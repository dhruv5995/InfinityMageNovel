Infinity Theory (2)

The Borschea region of the Across Kingdom.

Sirone, who had been walking along the treacherous mountain path, suddenly stopped in his tracks.

"Huff! Huff!"

Nade, who had been climbing the slope with his tongue hanging out like a dog, planted his hands on the ground and turned around.

"What's wrong? Getting tired?"

"It disappeared."

"Huh?"

Iruki, who had been leading the way, turned around and plopped down on his butt.

"Let's take a break. What happened?"

"One of the simultaneous events disappeared. Or maybe I just can't sense it anymore."

"Which one?"

"Ymir's mind. To be precise, the presence vanished the moment it was engulfed by Guffin's Hand of God."

"Guffin?"

It wasn't actually Guffin, but explaining everything would take far too long.

"Anyway, the signal's been cut off. It means the quantum signal isn't entangled with me here."

Nade tilted his head in confusion.

"Is that even possible? Quantum signals transcend time and space. How could something block that?"

"It shouldn't be possible. At least not in this universe. The only possibility would be..."

Sirone cupped his chin thoughtfully.

"The me here and the me in Ymir's mind have become completely different people."

Nade's face went pale.

"You don't mean... dead..."

"No, that can't be it. The me here is alive and well."

His friends could indirectly sense that Sirone's life was connected.

Iruki spoke up.

"If you're not dead, then maybe it's an elevation in realm? But you're already an Infinite Wizard."

"Even if that were the case, the quantum signals should overlap. Then what's left is..."

Sirone stopped mid-sentence.

'The outside world.'

If it had combined with information from outside the universe, even the Ultima System could be blocked.

'What could have happened?'

He wanted to check immediately, but the Sirone in Ymir's mind didn't seem to think the same way.

"Nothing will change. We'll proceed as planned. It'll become clear once that mission is complete."

As Iruki dusted himself off and stood up, the three resumed climbing the steep mountain path.

"This is killing me. I don't even know where we are anymore. Aren't we just wasting time?"

Iruki tapped his own head.

"According to the map in my head, no demon armies passed through this route. Naturally, the path would be treacherous."

When they reached the summit as the sun was setting, Sirone's group frowned and retched.

"Ugh!"

A terrible stench was wafting through the air.

"The smell must have been trapped in this mountain-enclosed area. Even the air quality is different. What on earth..."

Iruki surveyed the area below the mountain, but even the moon was obscured by clouds, making it impossible to see anything.

"Let's go check it out."

The descent was somewhat faster, and following the mental map, they arrived at the middle slope.

"What is this..."

The fence of a small village with about 100 households came into view.

A sign at the village entrance was broken, and dried blood made it impossible to read.

"Let's go in."

Amid only the sound of windows rattling in the wind, they could see a corpse collapsed on the roadway.

"Phew!"

The body, covered in maggots, was so decomposed that even wild animals wouldn't be interested.

Iruki picked up a tree branch to examine the corpse.

"The head was smashed by a blunt weapon."

"Demons?"

"The distance is too far based on their movement patterns. Besides, the buildings are too intact for this to be demon work."

"Then maybe aftermath from the emotional plague..."

This time Sirone shook his head.

"It's not impossible, but the emotional plague would spread southwest from Tormia. This is northeast - the complete opposite direction of transmission."

Iruki threw down the branch.

"Let's look around first. There might be survivors."

As they moved toward the village center, more corpses appeared, all struck in the head with blunt weapons.

"Sirone, over here."

On the wall Nade pointed to, the words "I am king" were written in blood.

Below the wall sat a man's corpse with both wrists severed, in a dejected pose.

"Sirone, do you know who this is?"

"No. It's been 22 years already, so I can't tell just from the face. At least if I knew the name..."

Nade searched through the man's clothes.

"There's something here."

What he pulled out was a letter from someone.

"Can you read it?"

"Yeah. Sirone, some light."

As Nade approached, Sirone and Iruki flanked him on both sides to read the letter together.

Honey, something's gone wrong. I'm so anxious I can't stand it. That woman, yes, that woman who absolutely refuses to reveal her name - she claims she originally had no name - but ever since she arrived, everything seems to be going mad.

"That woman?"

While hearing Nade's voice, Sirone continued reading down the text.

Remember, honey. In all the time we were born and raised in this village, have we ever met even one person who came from outside the village? That evil woman deceived the village chief with her cunning words and turned everything into chaos. And finally... she even used our child as a sacrifice.

At this moment, Sirone felt uneasy as the image of the man's severed hands flashed through his mind.

I have something to confess. Actually... when I was young, I did meet someone from outside the village. They saved me when I hurt my leg gathering herbs and got lost. Through the amazing power of the god Yore. That person taught me about love.

Iruki thought to himself.

'Someone from the Yore sect. Did they meet during missionary work?'

The reason I've kept it secret until now is... you know how much the villagers fear the outside. But I know. This world is filled with God's love.

'They fear the outside.'

Sirone's eyes deepened as he read the letter.

That woman! That vicious, venomous bitch! She must be a demon! I'm terrified that the villagers believe what she says. Yes! It's like they're dreaming, like all the villagers are dreaming with their eyes open.

'Some kind of hypnosis?'

That would be the easiest explanation, but Sirone felt like he was missing something.

'No, this isn't that kind of thing.'

I'm going to follow the village chief to God's holy land. Maybe I can make people wake up from their dream. Only I can accomplish this.

The woman continued on the next line.

I'm sick and tired of fighting with you too. The villagers are the crazy ones, not me. Look at our newborn son. Take Reas and run away. If you don't believe me, we're going to lose our son.

Nade read the name written at the end.

"Your wife, Ravika."

From Sirone's five-dimensional cube knowledge library, Omega's records were retrieved.

'There really are many.'

Countless Ravikas existed in the universe, including humans from other civilizations.

But Terraforce was the only species in the universe capable of exceeding the light-speed barrier.

'Though individuals are a different story.'

Sirone set the region and year within physically possible parameters.

'Exactly one person. This is her.'

Since only information up to age seven appeared, her current age would be twenty-nine.

"This is Kasiram Village. A place established 230 years ago when war refugees drifted in. They've been self-sufficient, isolated from the outside world for a long time."

Iruki said.

"There are too few corpses compared to the number of buildings. They must have gone to that place called God's holy land mentioned in the letter."

Nade flew up into the sky and pointed ahead.

"Sirone, Iruki. Let's check over there."

Following where Nade was flying, they ran and found a completely collapsed building.

It was the largest building, and it seemed to have burned - all the materials had turned to charcoal.

"The village hall. Why did they burn it down?"

Sirone cast Hand of God and grasped the building with a giant hand of light.

When he lifted up a handful, the gruesome scene inside the village hall was fully revealed.

The charred corpses all lay collapsed with their jaws wide open and bodies twisted.

"There was a fight here."

Sirone lowered the building debris and examined a stone wall that had fallen in the auditorium area.

"It must have collapsed when the building burned. There might be something that didn't burn."

When Hand of God used its thumb and index finger to raise the wall, a bulletin board made of planks was revealed.

On the left was text written by the village chief:

Worship. I, God's messenger, declare that by burning the place of return, you shall enter God's holy land.

On the right was an announcement:

The village hall will be burned at 5 PM, so everyone must attend. Those with circumstances or who are absent will receive God's punishment. Bringing food is prohibited, and there will be a ceremony to pay for everyone's sins with the blood of a pure child.

Nade said.

"Something... seems normal but abnormal."

"That's what you call insane. Anyway, let's find this place called God's holy land."

Sirone's group surveyed the village. The scenery decorated with corpses from murder and suicide was itself a test of courage.

Arriving at an area where warehouse buildings were clustered, Sirone pointed across the waterwheel.

"There are traces of an explosion."

A massive pile of stones could be seen below the cliff.

"They must have sealed the entrance."

It was puzzling what kind of power these people, who had lived in isolation for 200 years, could have used to blow up the entrance.

Iruki said.

"Based on the state of decomposition of the bodies, it's been at least three weeks. Whatever happened should be over by now."

"We'll know when we see it."

When Hand of God moved one large boulder, a gap big enough for a person to enter appeared.

Going through there, they could see a winding path with sharp stalactites.

"Hello! Is anyone there?"

Besides the echo of Nade's voice, they couldn't detect any other sounds.

After some time had passed, as they crawled through the narrow entrance, Iruki asked.

"But why did they seal the entrance? It's not a size that people could escape through with human strength."

"Who knows. To prevent escape?"

"But the village chief went in too. And I'm bothered by them saying not to bring food."

Various thoughts crossed their minds, but they couldn't know without checking directly.

A sound came from beyond the narrow passage.

"Crunch. Crunch."

"Shh."

As Nade signaled, Sirone simultaneously dimmed the brightness of his Shining magic.

'Infrared vision.'

When he activated Miracle Stream, Sirone's group's vision peeled away the darkness with a pale green tint.

'Damn it...'

Three people crouched like rats were burying their faces in a dead body's belly and swallowing something.

"Give me the fingers."

The tone was so matter-of-fact that it sounded to the three like "Pass me the salt shaker over there."

"Chomp chomp. Chomp chomp."

Even trying to look away, their hearing reconstructed the scene, and Nade finally couldn't stand it.

"You guys, what are you doing here?"

The three people surrounding the corpse looked up, and their eyes gleamed in the infrared vision.

"Who is it! Who!"

On the other hand, they couldn't see Sirone's group.

"Speak up quickly! What are you doing after trapping the villagers in the cave!"

"Aaaah! Evil spirits, evil spirits!"

Despite being unable to see, they were surprisingly fast when it came to running away.

"They must have memorized the terrain. Should we chase them?"

Nade asked while summoning lightning magic, but Sirone shook his head.

"No. Let's examine this first."

The corpse was severely damaged, with most of the flesh stripped away.

"I think I'm going to throw up."

Unlike Nade, Iruki was calm.

"At least they weren't without food. With this method, they could survive for more than three weeks. The question is why."

The eyes of the three people simultaneously gazing into the depths of the cave held cold anger.
