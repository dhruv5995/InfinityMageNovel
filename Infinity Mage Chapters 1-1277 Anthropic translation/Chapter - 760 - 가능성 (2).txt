[760] Possibility (2)

"Ugh!"

Only after flying 20 meters did the pain hit, and Jaicy desperately clung to her fading consciousness.

'Stop! Stop!'

She cast reverse propulsion magic from the Blow series, but her body only bounced off the ground like a ball, multiplying her agony.

"Kyaaaah!"

She realized for the first time that a person could roll for so long and so far.

She rolled endlessly, and any sign of stopping seemed to be waiting at some distant point in time.

'I'm going to die!'

She would die from rolling.

The moment she felt something break with a cracking sound, suddenly a tremendous force stopped her.

"Huff! Huff!"

Held in someone's embrace while looking up at the spinning sky, Jaicy focused on her body.

'Three ribs, fractured wrist, torn ankle ligament.'

Having assessed that much, what came to mind was what kind of magic had hit her.

'It was just light.'

Information about divine particles was now fairly well known, but North Eamond was an exception.

'There's no such mage here.'

For a 3rd-grade grand mage to be taken down by a single spell, the attacker would have to be at least a 1st-grade mage.

"Thoroughly trampled. It must have been good experience for you too."

Minerva clicked her tongue and breathed the witch's breath into Jaicy's lips.

"Ahh..."

After briefly falling into ecstasy and coming to her senses, the pain in her body had vanished without a trace.

"It's roughly patched up. Don't fight."

Jaicy's eyes widened.

"I can't do that! There are still thousands, tens of thousands of people to kill...! Ugh!"

As her side throbbed, Jaicy curled up her body.

'Anger is beautiful.'

Minerva, who had been lovingly watching that sight, straightened her expression and stood up.

Sirone was standing before her.

"What are you doing right now?"

"You know. If you still don't understand, you're subpar. North Eamond conducted experiments that threaten humanity."

"So what are you planning to do?"

"As you can see..."

Minerva gestured to the scene where countless demons had turned to ash and disappeared.

"End them one by one. Soon North Eamond will disappear from the world map."

Not showing any room for compromise meant she too had grasped Igor's true nature.

"Like Garas, control of the altar has already been lost. See those demons? An enormous number are still escaping. Without mass slaughter, it'll be hard to finish this."

"That's cruel. Even people who have nothing to do with this will get caught up in it."

"Of course they will. But minimizing damage is my mission. And honestly, speaking frankly..."

Minerva's eyes changed.

"There isn't a single human in this world who would die unjustly."

"..."

"If you're strong, you can make choices. Good or evil. But the weak only have evil as a weapon to become strong. When they commit some evil act, people become afraid. Afraid they might suffer the same fate."

Minerva's pipe pointed at Baseto.

"You think that guy's any different? If he were as strong as you, he might have become worse than Igor. Nobody knows that."

Sirone had learned what kind of person Minerva was in the ivory tower's elevator, and why she became that way through the story of 'Law Kill.'

Since compromise would be difficult, Sirone also spoke his piece.

"Stop the massacre. From now on, I'll handle matters concerning North Eamond."

The person who least wanted this was undoubtedly Jaicy, who clutched her side and approached Minerva.

"Did you know each other?"

Certainly, that level would be worthy of respect.

"Should I say we know each other? We're work colleagues."

"What? Work colleagues?"

Having confirmed where her workplace was, Jaicy narrowed her eyes and looked back at Sirone.

"Is that person also a star?"

"Yeah. This is troublesome. If it were another star, I'd chase them away, but he's the same rank as me."

The same rank as Minerva.

"Then, one of the Five Great Stars?"

"Right. I'm from Human Safety Enforcement, and that guy's from Integrated Space Management. But the problem is..."

Integrated Space Management had slightly more influence with Taeseong.

Jaicy, unaware of the power struggles within the ivory tower, simply found Sirone interesting.

"He looks like he's barely twenty..."

Then again, wasn't Minerva's actual age over seven hundred?

"Right. He's twenty."

Jaicy looked at Minerva with a dumbfounded expression, but she wasn't joking.

"And he's humanity's strongest mage. No, was it second place?"

Minerva casually mentioned Nane's existence and said with a playful smile.

"Fine, let's call it a tie for first place."

"Don't childishly instigate fights. I'll handle Nane myself. The problem right now is you, Minerva. Nothing will be resolved this way."

"Then what are you going to do?"

"Cancel the disaster magic right now."

The poison gas she had scattered was killing demons, half-demons, and civilians alike.

"You have 'Law Kill,' don't you?"

Sirone frowned.

"Let's make a deal. Hand over 'Law Kill,' and I'll also pass this matter to Integrated Space Management."

"I can't do that."

"You're going to hand it to Kashan? You're not in a leisurely enough position to worry about politics."

"No. I think if you have this, you'll suffer more than you do now."

The poison gas disappeared.

"Just because you sacrificed yourself for everyone doesn't mean you can protect everyone. Neither you nor Nane are gods. And you're not Guffin either. Even if you've reached the realm of infinity, it's still only human infinity."

Minerva pointed to the battlefield.

"See? Even now, countless people are dying to demons. You can defeat them, but you can't save everyone! You need to stop playing at being some petty god and focus your choices!"

That's what was irritating.

"Nane, Kashan, the altar, humans, extremes...! You can't do it all! You can't even protect the residents here right now!"

From beyond the supply route, Berdi and his family screamed.

"Dad! Dad!"

"Berdi!"

Baseto launched himself forward, and demons with terrifying weapons chased after the family.

The situation was analyzed simultaneously.

Half-demons were slaughtering the garrison troops, and in the distance, Godan, commander of the 48th Military Facility, was cutting down workers with military swords.

Minerva said.

"This is reality! Killing them all is the only way to minimize damage! So leave it to me and get out!"

"What's reality?"

The moment you give up is reality.

"How do you know without even trying?"

As Sirone concentrated, his Spirit Zone expanded to an unimaginable scale and covered the military facility.

"This, this can't be..."

Before Yahweh's transcendent mind that surpassed human limits, Jaicy didn't even dare to interfere.

'Quantum Superposition!'

100,000 overlaps.

Far more entities than when exploring Andre's labyrinth, Sirones cast instantaneous movement in all directions.

The explosion of spreading light was nearly blinding, and countless people simultaneously experienced miracles.

"Graaaah!"

Synesthesia combining the five senses with time, space, and mind was transmitted through the Spirit Zone.

That transcendent information analyzed every situation without the slightest error and saved people who were about to fall victim to demons.

"Damn Yahweh! Abominable Yahweh!"

In a situation where only demons were being annihilated, the half-demons stopped their actions as if terrified.

"Ah, ahhh..."

Berdi looked up at thousands of flashes of light tracing parabolas across the sky and shed tears.

Though he couldn't analyze it with an adult's mind, the emotion welling up in his chest was no different.

"Huk! Huuuk!"

Saving everyone.

"My brother told me."

In the 48th Military Facility lived countless people treated as less than human.

"You are the most valuable person in the world."

As something no one in human history had ever attempted became reality, people began kneeling one by one.

Light embroidering the sky.

"What is that light?"

As everyone harbored the same question, the demons turning to ash let out final roars.

"Despicably hateful Yahweh! I'll tear apart the people you love! I'll watch you shed tears of blood from hell!"

"Die, Yahweh! Be cursed, Yahweh!"

People murmured.

"Yahweh."

Love that humans cannot achieve.

"O Yahweh..."

100,000 flashes drew 10 million afterimages covering the sky, and finally the entire world was filled with light.

Sirone knelt and exhaled ragged breaths.

"Huff! Huff!"

Watching the scene where demons had disappeared without a single one remaining, Minerva fell into deep thought.

"It's not over yet!"

What remained were a few half-demons.

Most had sustained injuries that left them unable to move, but only Commander Godan had endured and charged toward Sirone.

"Demon."

It was natural for those who contained every human emotion except love to hate Sirone.

"I'll kill you, you abominable...!"

When Minerva extended her hand, Zet flew at tremendous acceleration and pierced through Godan's body.

"Gack!"

In that state, it toured the facility, penetrating every building in sight before Godan finally went limp.

"...Are you alright?"

Having finished things up, Minerva approached Sirone, who was practicing Musang Mind breathing techniques.

Sirone silently raised his head.

"That look in your eyes says I'm the one who should answer."

"I can do it. You may have your own Kar, but please leave this matter to me."

"You saved the 48th Military Facility."

Minerva looked around at the peaceful scenery.

"Next you'll save the capital? Further on, North Eamond, then the continent, the East, the South..."

Until when?

"Just because you succeeded today doesn't mean your Kar has been fulfilled."

"I know. But..."

Sirone looked at Berdi, who was embracing his family and shedding tears of joy.

"That's not what's important."

If one individual could save everyone by sacrificing everything...

'It's impossible, which is why even Nane didn't do it. But if, really if there's even a 1% possibility...'

Where could there be a better gamble than this?

"Hmph, acting like you have Kar when you don't."

Sirone smiled and stood up.

"Then you're leaving it to me now?"

"What do I care? Anyway, Human Safety Enforcement does what you tell us to do. What we gained in return is recklessness."

It was the department that killed the most people.

"I'll keep 'Law Kill' too."

When Sirone firmly drove the point home, Minerva chuckled and turned around.

"Can't beat you. Do you know how to use it?"

"What? Doesn't it just activate automatically when filled with earnest feelings?"

"In a way, yes. That's enough if you're just killing street thugs, but the target 'Law Kill' will probably kill this time is on a different level."

Sirone hadn't heard news of the holy war.

"The extreme that Kashan's Empress is watching is Gustav Havitz the 17th. The person who became Gustav's emperor this time."

"The Three Emperor System..."

"Since you know Uorin, you'll understand quickly. Their methods are no joke either. Countless strategies will be employed to avoid the law of 'Law Kill.'"

"I see."

Sirone also couldn't imagine an emperor dying.

'Certainly. From North Eamond to Gustav's imperial palace, and then breaking through countless guards to kill the emperor...'

Just how would the law have to change to make that possible?
