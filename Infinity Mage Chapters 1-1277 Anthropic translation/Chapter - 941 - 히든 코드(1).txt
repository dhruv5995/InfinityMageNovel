Hidden Code (1)

Shiok.

As the fanatic who worshipped Satan appeared, Harvits stepped back as if he had nothing left to do.

'Shiok is human?'

While taking in the face of the woman who had removed her hood, Sein wondered.

'Why are they human?'

Of course, since Harvits, who is human, also embodies the concept of Satan, it wasn't particularly strange.

Miro embodied extreme goodness, Nane embodied void, and Sirone embodied philanthropy.

It was natural logic that any concept needed hardware to manifest as phenomena.

Therefore, Sein's doubt wasn't a logical error, but purely an emotional matter.

In other words, why did even Shiok have to be human?

'Because they can choose.'

There was a difference between being created to follow Satan and choosing to follow Satan of one's own will.

Fanaticism.

The act of throwing one's heart in the most dangerous way.

'Even if Shiok's will is separate from Harvits', it's ultimately the same as being Harvits' will.'

For example, wanting to kill someone.

If directly acting would cause problems, and even making requests would leave traces.

'But what if someone acts on their own?'

Could there be a more efficient being as Satan's hands and feet?

"No need to hide anymore."

The remaining 11 Shiok who had been covering their faces simultaneously pulled back their hoods.

Women, elderly, children.

They had ordinary appearances you could see anywhere in society.

The woman with the cut forehead glared at Quan.

"An attack coming from outside cognition. Interesting. I didn't expect to meet someone else who handles Hidden Code besides us."

Quan asked back.

"Hidden Code?"

"You couldn't know. It's the異知 of the hidden world. For you people to feel the world logically, illogical codes must be tested. It's a kind of code used in test mode. We call it cheat."

Sein couldn't understand.

"You people think this world is logical. But it's not. You've simply adapted to reality's code."

She raised her index finger.

"In dreams, even the most absurd events make sense, right? Of course. It's called Drimo, where countless codes from the hidden world enter and get filtered. Only codes with secured stability get applied to reality. Ultimately, what you believe to be logic is just rules set by the convenience of those who made this world."

Sein's group listened blankly.

"Codes that Drimo considers useless for the real world, codes that haven't secured stability, fall into a buffer called 'Under Coder'. There they combine with discarded information from the real world."

Sein asked.

"What happens after they combine?"

"They get endlessly stored in a system called The Abyss."

He had heard of it from Miro.

'The destination of all information.'

He had heard it was a place where the final future the world would reach based on its current state was implemented.

'Did she say it was like hell?'

"It's a very interesting place."

Shiok's thoughts were different.

"All processes until the world's destruction are accumulated there. If you carefully examine the ruins and records rolling around there, you can even know what will happen at specific points in the future. Go there once. It's really interesting."

Sein shook his head.

"If the present changes, the future changes too. If we win, The Abyss won't be hell."

"It's all predetermined."

The woman sneered.

"Hidden world, reality, Drimo, Under Coder, The Abyss. It's a world where five systems operate simultaneously in the same timeframe. Can you imagine? What could you possibly change?"

Sein remained silent.

"Listen carefully. Humans are merely tenants using the space called reality. You cannot change the future."

"But all systems are operated for the space called reality. If humans are users as you say, then we also have the right to reject the current world."

"Hahahaha!"

The woman who had burst into mad laughter suddenly stopped and made a cold expression.

"There might have been a time like that once."

There was an era when humans defined everything.

"But not you people. You're not connected. How can humans who haven't realized the Missing Link change the law? Of course, some humans do handle administrator codes. But do you think that would make this world budge?"

As Sein closed his mouth, the woman turned to look at Quan.

"In that sense, I want to praise you. It's a pretty decent cheat. But we're on a different level."

The blood flowing from her forehead disappeared, and even the sword wound began to fade.

'Healing power? No, the wound itself is disappearing.'

Mayray muttered.

"Pride's 1 o'clock."

"Huh?"

The moment he turned to look at her, the woman's wave was transmitted as an auditory hallucination through Nemesis.

"...This is impossible."

It was an incomprehensible phenomenon.

"Hehe, yes. I am Pride's 1 o'clock. I handle Hidden Code that can change past choices."

"Nonsense."

Quan spat out.

"In my memory, the moment I cut you is still clearly there. My memory isn't false."

"That's what you think. What do I care?"

Pride's 1 o'clock shrugged.

"Still don't get it? The logic you know isn't absolute. This is a cheat you don't know about. Look, the wound is gone. I regretted it. I thought if I had leaned back just a little more, I wouldn't have been cut. So I changed that choice."

The wave of her heart was telling the truth.

'It's real?'

Pride's 1 o'clock could change past choices she regretted and output results through the butterfly effect.

'Endlessly changing.'

This meant all regrettable events in someone's life would be erased, supporting the phenomenon where whatever decision Harvits made would always turn out right.

'This is dangerous.'

Quan, who had served as a hitman in the holy war, instinctively knew how difficult it would be to kill Pride's 1 o'clock.

'I need to create a death without regret.'

There were roughly two methods that came to mind immediately.

'Either make her seek death herself, or drive her into a situation where death is absolutely unavoidable.'

In both cases, the emotion of 'regret' wouldn't be triggered, so she couldn't change past choices, but...

'Is this even a feasible level of difficulty?'

He didn't feel like it could be done.

This is Mayray. From now on, I'll wiretap all 12 Shiok's waves. Remember clearly.

Shiok charged.

"For Satan's pleasure!"

Since Sein, Armin, and Mayray were blocking Harvits' law with their respective magic, they couldn't move.

"Absolute Barrier!"

As Eden deployed a defensive barrier, Shiok scattered, and Lilia amplified Quan's law.

Quan's figure disappeared from Shiok's cognition.

'I can't enter rashly.'

Meanwhile, through Nemesis, Shiok's names and Hidden Codes echoed in his mind.

Sein stored Pride's 1 o'clock in his head.

'Woman with a venomous expression and sharp teeth. Can change past regrettable events, and since the process is ignored, it can be called a cheat.'

The next wave came flooding in.

'Bald man. Defiance's 2 o'clock. Hidden Code is... wins in all types of probability?'

Harvits came to mind first.

Since Shiok's abilities were also derived from Satan's chaos, it was natural.

"Quan! Kill 1 o'clock!"

Since Shiok couldn't find Quan anyway, he shouted loudly.

'Pride's 1 o'clock, who reverses past choices, is the top priority target for elimination. If we kill just one, Shiok will have a hole.'

At least for now.

"Foolish!"

A woman in her mid-thirties with owl-like large eyes and protruding cheekbones shouted.

"Why should Pride's 1 o'clock be killed? Aren't you perhaps someone who hates being first? How can you command battle with such paranoid thinking? Therefore, you are trash!"

Sein couldn't think of a retort.

'Why?'

The moment he realized there was no way to refute her, he heard the sound of waves Mayray had wiretapped.

'Obstinacy's 3 o'clock. Hidden Code is... wins in all types of refutation? What is this.'

Specific information followed.

'...Because no matter what argument is made, her logic cannot be broken. Damn, where does such bullshit exist?'

Sein, being a logician, tried to face her code with a bit more intensity.

"Among the three we've analyzed so far, 1 o'clock is the one who can have the biggest impact on battle. Got it? I'm not making strategy based on paranoia or anything."

"Ah, I don't know! Annoying! Your face looks weird too, so why is your voice like that? The conclusion is, you're wrong!"

The cheat was applied.

The logical connections forming Sein's thoughts were destroyed, making him dizzy with anger.

"Grrrr!"

Fire boiled inside him, but since reality's logic had disappeared, he couldn't refute.

'Is this Hidden Code?'

That the past cannot be changed, or syllogism, or that probability is mathematical.

'These propositions are also just human thoughts. Just rules set according to the administrator's convenience.'

Viewed from outside the universe, the world actually had no problems functioning however it worked.

"Suddenly closed your mouth? Well, you're full of contradictions. On the other hand, I made arguments based solely on facts. Therefore, you are a fool!"

"...Shut up."

"Shut up? Shut what? Slap your cheek!"

Since it really seemed like he should, Sein gritted his teeth in defeat and lowered his head.

'Damn! Why can't I win?'

While everyone refrained from speaking carelessly, Obstinacy's 3 o'clock laughed triumphantly.

"Hahahaha! As expected, life fails when you don't worship Satan! Long live Satan! Oh, Satan!"

Just as Sein completely ignored her and turned his head, heart waves came flooding again.

'Sloth's 4 o'clock.'

It was an old man with maliciously drooping jowls, and shortly after, his Hidden Code was revealed.

Things you don't want to happen to you don't happen.

'Damn it.'

Cold sweat ran down Sein's back.

'This is how Harvits and Shiok avoided the law. Then should I kill 4 o'clock first, then 1 o'clock? No, depending on the situation, maybe 2 o'clock too... wait.'

'But Quan did wound 1 o'clock.'

If Asymmetry's Extreme was also a cheat, then ultimately Shiok hadn't responded perfectly.

"Lilia..."

Sein, who was about to give voice instructions, realized Obstinacy's 3 o'clock and used Nemesis.

Lilia, when you see an opening, suddenly amplify Quan's law. The bigger the range, the better.

Lilia nodded and watched the battlefield while planting her birch staff in the ground.

Then, a plump woman with a dissatisfied expression shouted.

"That woman is a traitor!"

"What?"

Everyone turned to look at Lilia.

"What nonsense..."

Lilia, who had been frowning and shouting, was flustered by her comrades' gazes.

"Why, what's wrong?"

Mayray wiretapped the waves of the woman who had just shouted.

'Prejudice's 5 o'clock. Hidden Code is... everyone trusts.'

'How absurd.' To Sein's perception, it was code powerful enough to make people want to believe even if you accused a good person of being a murderer.

"Wait! Why would I betray anyone?"

He knew it in his head.

'Right, there's no reason to betray. She's from Zion, a nun who hates evil.'

But cheat wasn't reality's logic.

As Hidden Code was input into everyone's minds, endless suspicion spawned in their thoughts.

'Was her life guaranteed? Or did she collude with evil to gain higher fame...'

Anything could be suspected.

'Come to think of it, Lilia left her room alone a month ago. Right, her way of speaking was strange too.'

Even couples who had spent their whole lives together could split over one small suspicion - such was our life.

"No! It's not me!"

Perhaps this was the tragedy of the human species.
