[522] A New Contract (1)

Thirty-four kilometers away from Galiant Island, there exists an island that doesn't appear on any map.

This island, known as "Baekdo" and known only to old fishermen who have sailed the seas for over forty years, was an island that some organization had privatized long ago by paying a hefty sum to the Galiant Autonomous District.

And currently on that Baekdo, Kaira, one of the Ivory Tower administrators, was in confinement awaiting orders from her superiors.

The scenery of the shallow sea was full of mystery.

Countless flora and fauna that had evolved independently, and even tube birds that made beautiful sounds like flutes.

Kaira was preparing an early morning in a cabin built where a small waterfall flowed down.

Though it was a modest meal, for her who had always lived buried in work, this was truly a long-awaited rest.

"Smells delicious. Is it rabbit stew?"

Kaira's hand stirring the ladle stopped abruptly.

She hadn't even sensed his presence, but the voice alone was enough.

Armin said with a smile.

"What? Don't tell me you're going to turn me away at the door?"

But Kaira acted as if she hadn't heard anything and concentrated on stirring the ladle again.

"...I'll come back when you've cooled down."

The moment Armin turned around, Kaira irritably threw down the ladle.

With a clang, the ladle rolled on the floor, and Kaira, tears streaming down her face, ran with all her might and threw herself into Armin's arms.

"You bastard! I thought you were dead! I really... I really thought you were dead!"

Armin stroked Kaira's back.

"I'm back. As promised."

Kaira, her face covered in tears, asked with a bright expression.

"Are you completely back? Sit down first. Are you hungry?"

Her mouth was as busy as her hands preparing the meal.

"I was disciplined for tearing up the covenant agreement. They told me to stay here until you returned. But it was worth the wait. Oh, let's go straight to the Ivory Tower after breakfast. I need to report."

"No, Kaira. I'm not going back to the Ivory Tower."

Kaira turned around with a blank expression.

"What do you mean?"

"I have things to do. I'll probably be working with a new team for a while. You'll understand."

"Understand? Unless you were dead, you can't avoid the Ivory Tower's surveillance now that you've returned alive."

"Of course. But it'll probably be fine. The Ivory Tower will have no choice but to accept my proposal this time."

"What on earth happened? And what's this new team?"

"First, let's eat breakfast. I'll explain."

Armin sat at the dining table with complete leisure.

It seemed like today would be a long day.

Bashka, the capital of the Kingdom of Tormia.

Quan, who had returned to the Kaizen Sword School, packed his few belongings into a single bag and changed clothes.

His eyes were more careful than usual in choosing clothes, but nothing seemed satisfactory.

'Should I cut the sleeves? Or is it better to leave them as they are?'

Just then, the door burst open and a shrill voice was heard.

"You crazy bastard!"

It was Kiyora Ellis, the surgeon of the sword school.

"You're here?"

Quan greeted her briefly and looked back at the mirror.

"What? You're here? Yes, I'm here, you bastard! Do you know how much trouble I went through to retract that resignation letter you submitted today?"

Quan, who had been absent from school classes without permission, was naturally processed for dismissal, but Ellis had used her influence to put it on hold.

Being such a person, the emotions she felt when Quan returned were indescribable.

He had returned.

Not only limping, but with one arm missing.

Especially since she was a surgeon specializing in nerve grafting, her heart broke seeing her cherished friend in such a state every time.

Whether he knew this fact or not, Quan reacted as if he had just thrown out old garbage and felt refreshed.

"Why did you retract it? I stayed up all night writing it. Give it back and return it."

"Ah, damn it!"

Ellis slammed the resignation letter to the ground.

It wasn't like training a mutt, and if he was going to leave the school anyway, what was the point of such things?

"Why are you acting like this? You could just stay at the school during vacation and think about it! It's paid leave!"

"I got a new job. And I can't become a teacher anyway. My sword can't be passed on to students. So find another teacher now."

Ellis, also being a teacher at the sword school, vaguely sensed what Quan had gained in exchange for losing his arm.

The Quan before leaving school and the current Quan were so different in temperament that they could be considered completely different people.

"You're not going to tell me to the end, are you? You don't want to be friends with me, is that it?"

"We're past the age of threatening with such things. By the way, what do you think about this? Should I cut the sleeves or leave them as they are?"

"How would I know, man! A person who cut off his own arm, what would he care about sleeves! You're getting on my nerves!"

"I guess I should just leave them."

It would be cumbersome in combat situations, but it looked much better appearance-wise.

Only then did Ellis realize that Quan had changed from deep within.

His attention to clothing, and his attitude toward people had become much calmer than before.

He had made up his mind to overcome his long nightmare and face the world.

"You really won't regret this?"

Quan looked back at Ellis and said.

"It's okay."

Ellis couldn't say anything.

How could she hold back her beloved friend who was showing her a smile for the first time in ten years?

"Thank you. I'll keep in touch."

After patting Ellis's shoulder and leaving the room, Quan walked through the familiar corridor and took in the training ground where he had disciplined countless students.

Even the scenes he had found tiresome seemed precious today.

'Come to think of it, I wonder how that guy is doing?'

Rian, who had dropped out of school saying he would pursue knighthood.

Thinking about it now that things had turned out this way, he was one step behind Rian.

'We'll meet someday.'

Because that was the fate of swordsmen.

Quan, who had boarded a pre-reserved carriage, told the coachman to take him to Kentra City.

It was a famous livestock region of Tormia, where the restaurant was located where he had lunch with Siena before going to heaven.

And today, he would meet her again.

"I hope I'm not late."

Quan, who was twenty minutes late, roughly opened the carriage door and entered the restaurant.

"Damn."

The atmosphere was still comfortable as before, and most of the customers were dressed modestly.

But to them, Quan was an unusual customer.

He was carrying a sword and even had a fierce expression, so the restaurant became quiet and all eyes focused on him.

Then Siena stood up from a table in the corner.

"Over here, teacher."

Quan stared at Siena in a daze for a moment.

Without her glasses and with her hair down, she was a completely different person.

When the beautiful woman welcomed Quan, the customers looked back and forth between the two with puzzled expressions.

A gait that was inevitably bothersome even if he didn't want to be conscious of it.

In the restaurant, only Siena was looking at Quan with sincere eyes.

"I'm sorry for being late."

"It's okay. Bashka is far away. Have you been well?"

"Yes. Well..."

It was Siena who had contacted him first. She must have been bothered by the promise they made in heaven.

Quan ordered lamb steak.

Since it hadn't been long since he lost his arm, all daily activities were unfamiliar, but he thought there was no need to suddenly order something different.

But that thought soon turned to regret.

The meat was tougher than expected and wouldn't cut well, and he couldn't exactly perform swordsmanship with a dinner knife.

"Pfft!"

At the sound of laughter from the next table, Quan's cutting stopped.

When he turned his head, a woman belatedly covered her mouth and lowered her head, while the man across from her avoided eye contact restlessly.

"Don't mind them."

Siena said.

"I know how strong Teacher Quan is. The stronger a person is, the more composed they are."

Siena, who had realized her own weakness in heaven, also came to understand what burdens the strong carried on their shoulders.

"Let me cut it for you."

Before Quan could say anything, Siena took the plate and cut the steak.

Whether it was effective or not, the customers' gazes were much warmer than before.

Of course, it was probably a reaction from the ridiculous misconception that Siena was helping a weak person with physical difficulties.

Quan just stared as if possessed by a ghost.

Come to think of it, her attitude toward him had changed considerably from before.

"Teacher Siena."

Siena asked back while concentrating on cutting.

"Yes?"

"You don't need to go this far. I'm grateful for your kindness, but if you think you owe me a debt..."

Quan stopped speaking as a piece of steak was suddenly thrust in front of his face.

In terms of swordsmanship, it was an excellent thrust.

When Quan looked up, Siena, whose face had turned red as a beet, couldn't find where to look and said.

"W-would you like to eat it?"

When swept away by emotional currents, one's rational focus sometimes goes awry, leading to senseless actions, which was exactly what Siena was doing now.

It was true that she had developed feelings for Quan, but she had no intention of being so forward.

The customers, sensing the atmosphere, were waiting with interest for the man's choice.

Quan, who had been staring for a long time, smiled gently and put the meat she offered into his mouth.

"Ah..."

Then he politely received the fork and bowed.

"Thank you."

If Ellis had seen this scene, she would have come to tease him even at his grave, but Quan thought this was enough.

No one would blame him for taking one pleasant memory before a long journey.

After the meal ended, Siena hesitated for a moment in front of the carriage going back.

"I don't think we'll be able to meet often once school starts."

"Yes. Probably not. Don't worry about it."

Siena tilted her head, but since she was also hopeless when it came to romantic relationships, she was busy trying to bring up what she wanted to say.

"If it's okay with you... would you like to correspond?"

"Correspond?"

Quan, who had been blinking at the unexpected suggestion, thought for a long time before nodding.

"Let's do that. I'll be waiting."

Whether she had been nervous, Siena's face visibly brightened.

"Yes. Then I'll send them to the sword school."

"The sword school... Ah, yes. That should work."

"Then, Teacher Quan, please get home safely too."

Siena politely bowed and got on the carriage.

Her face behind the closed door was quite flushed.

Corresponding with and getting to know a man she hadn't even known existed until recently.

It was a flutter she hadn't felt since owing a debt to Armin in her childhood.

Quan watched the departing carriage for a long time before turning toward the city entrance.

As he entered the forest, companions who had already arrived and were waiting revealed themselves.

Armin of Gwangan asked.

"Was the meal enjoyable?"

"I was just taking care of a prior engagement, not going to enjoy myself."

Quan spoke honestly.

Siena was a good person, but having learned the world's secrets, Quan chose to protect her rather than pursue immediate happiness.

'This isn't enough. I need to become stronger.'

"Hey, why so serious? Like someone who just had their last supper."

Miro and Arius walked out from the bushes on the opposite side.

Sirone, still wearing Armand's robe, was fast asleep on Arius's back.

Miro tapped Sirone's head and said.

"Anyway, now that we're all here, shall we get going? We need to wake this kid up first before we can do anything else."

After returning from heaven, Miro had asked Armin and Quan to help her with her work.

Armin and Quan were rivals in a sense, but to her, both were precious talents she couldn't give up.

Especially Quan's unique swordsmanship that he had realized in heaven was powerful enough to change the system of swordsmanship that had spread throughout the world.

"I agreed to cooperate, so I'll go anywhere. Wherever my sword is needed."

Armin asked.

"So how do you plan to wake Sirone?"

"Nothing's decided yet. Once I consult with her, we'll find an answer somehow."

"Her?"

Miro smiled and said.

"Theraje, the Empress of Kashan."
