[521] The Nameless Swordsman (5)

The battle had temporarily fallen into a lull.

Dozens of deaths had already occurred, and the bandits were in a state of excitement bordering on madness, but even such fighting spirit cooled in an instant at the shocking sight of Rian slicing through the fireball.

The fury of a yaksha transcends law and manifests through action.

Commonly called Acting.

Among these, Denial was Rian's unique technique of breaking an opponent's will with his own will.

Expressed as an incantation, it could be summarized as the thesis: "If it must be done, then it must be done" - endlessly layering laws through feedback to negate all principles of the world.

"How did you cut through magic...?"

Breeze still couldn't face reality.

Of course, a fireball combining omniscience and omnipotence acts like real fire within the Spirit Zone, so it can be cut with a sword.

But the problem wasn't that he had cut fire - it was that the magic itself had been annihilated.

The magic that suddenly vanished as if someone had blown out a candle was clearly not a normal phenomenon, even to the untrained eyes of the bandits.

"So that's how it is..."

Peikon of the Red Spear rose from his seat.

He still couldn't understand the result before his eyes, but if he expanded it to the category of strange phenomena, it wasn't entirely incomprehensible.

Battlefields were always rife with countless rumors where truth and falsehood couldn't be distinguished, and among them, stories of swordsmen with transcendent abilities that could never be implemented through Schema were not uncommon.

"I wondered what you were relying on to attack our stronghold at such a young age."

Peikon gripped the red spear that had been leaning against the stone chair.

"Kill him with everything you've got. This human has a different nature from the swordsmen we know."

Following their leader's words, the executives lined up on both sides drew their respective weapons and glared at Rian with menacing eyes.

"Let's go! Full assault!"

As Peikon swung his spear and leaped down from the platform, the bandits who had been stunned also regained their senses and charged at Rian.

Rian looked at his enemies with calm eyes.

'Don't be obsessed.'

Rian put all his will into each moment's judgment, and with every swing of his great sword, enemies were cut down.

It was a mechanical severance, as if drawing a ruler on paper and cutting with a knife.

And this was precisely the unique sword signature that made Rian known as the Knight of Maha.

When the bandit group's numbers fell below fifty, momentum began to build for Rian for the first time.

How unreasonable was it for one life to reap seventy lives?

The bandit group trembled in fear, feeling their hearts stop just from meeting Rian's gaze.

"Come here, boy!"

Peikon charged at Rian, swinging his red spear.

The moment sword and spear clashed, Rian's mind, which had been in a state of selflessness, suddenly returned to reality.

The sensation of colliding not with a person but with an iron wall traveled up through his fingertips.

'So this is Peikon.'

Even without the red spear, Peikon's skills were outstanding.

The order of the technique tree was: muscle strength, nerves, mitochondria.

Especially the foundational muscle enhancement had its efficiency multiplied through a technique called folding.

"Kuhaha! Is this all? Rampage like you did before!"

Under Peikon's relentless spear thrusts that gave no respite, Rian was pushed back repeatedly.

In a one-on-one fight, he might have a chance, but fighting a master while surrounded by the bandit group was too much.

Above all, the skills of the executives assisting Peikon were incomparable to ordinary people's martial prowess.

'Grandfather, how did you ever think to do something like this?'

As Rian fought with all his might, Augent Klump naturally came to mind.

When he was living as the youngest son of the family under the devoted care of his parents and siblings, he had thought bandit subjugation couldn't be that difficult, but experiencing it firsthand made him realize to his bones how indulgently he had been living.

'He's still young after all.'

Peikon's eyes gleamed as he closed the distance.

The wavering was significant whenever crisis struck.

Of course, he wanted to give credit for ultimately overcoming those crises, but the lack of experience was obvious at a glance.

'Just stubborn with terrible instincts. How did he reach this level? He should have died long ago.'

That was the diagnosis of Peikon, who had lived in the world of swords for many years.

"Kugh!"

As the blood-stained spear thrust brilliantly toward his lifeline, Rian swung his great sword widely.

It would have been an effective counterattack normally, but Peikon had perfectly anticipated Rian's breathing pattern from their brief exchange.

'Dodge and...'

The great sword passed by Peikon's nose tip as it rose.

'Thrust.'

Pung!

The spear tip thrust while twisting his arm pierced through Rian's side, creating a fist-sized hole.

'Huh?'

Since he had aimed for the heart, Peikon's eyebrows rose slightly.

"Krrgh!"

Rian gritted his teeth and endured the pain, his pupils rolling back white as the phantom of the incarnation manifested once again.

Peikon was flustered in a way unbecoming of a veteran's reputation.

It probably wasn't actually visible.

If some energy emanating from Rian was passing through the brain to form a special image, there would be no spatial limitations.

Enormity.

He didn't know what the most enormous thing in the world was, but if there was one, it would be exactly like this - a form so enormous it was baring its teeth.

Simultaneously, a sound like noodles being lifted from water was heard as black lines emerged from Rian's side, intertwining and rapidly repairing the empty space.

'The wound is regenerating?'

It was a strange phenomenon that couldn't be explained even by Schema.

"Uaaaah!"

Rian charged with his eyes rolled back white.

Unlike refined anger, boiling emotions exploded, making his body uncontrollable.

The identity of the emotion was belligerence.

The desire to fight, to clash with stronger opponents, guided Rian's sword.

Smile. Smile.

"This is our chance! Kill him!"

If he had raised his firepower while ignoring bodily preservation, his defense would inevitably be vulnerable.

'No, this isn't just vulnerable.'

He was attacking like someone with no regard for life.

"Stab him! Stab him no matter what!"

Now they could kill him.

But among the bandit group, only Peikon could thrust his blade before such explosive momentum like a war god.

"You idiots!"

Twenty-two members remained.

If they lost more here, it would truly be irreversible.

Peikon, who had discerned Rian's intention to target the mage Breeze, used his subordinates as sacrifices to close the distance.

As he continued to pierce holes in Rian's body with brilliant spear techniques, the hallucination was heard again.

Smile. Smile.

At the voice that sounded like wind echoing from the bottom of a deep valley, Rian regained consciousness.

'I'm scared. So scared, Sirone.'

Why was this happening to him?

Even when he ate Ymir's arm and his right arm regenerated, even when he obtained <Idea> and fought countless battles, he hadn't heard hallucinations.

From some day, he heard them.

It was probably when he first suffered near-fatal injuries close to death.

But the problem was that Klump had also heard the same hallucination only once in his lifetime.

So why wouldn't this hallucination leave him alone?

The only fact he could know was his certainty that this wouldn't continue forever.

Rian gripped his great sword tightly.

'It doesn't matter. If I can fight now!'

Kwaang!

Peikon, who blocked Rian's attack, grimaced at the shock that felt like all the bones in his body were being crushed.

"Hehe!"

Laughter leaked out senselessly from fear.

"Hehehehe!"

Kakakak!

As he pressed his body close to the spear shaft and held firm, Rian's charge stopped.

Through the weapons crossed in an X-shape, Peikon revealed his face of madness.

"Want to carve your name in history? Huh? Think it'll be that easy?"

Who had started this first?

The madman who tried to make his name known by defeating a bandit group.

"It's over. Your future is at best becoming a corpse and bird food."

Peikon turned his head and shouted.

"What are you all doing! Finish him!"

No one answered.

'Don't tell me...'

With an uneasy feeling, Peikon hastily looked around.

No one was standing.

He had cut down all 120 members of the bandit group in three hours.

'Perhaps this guy too...'

Might have his name recorded in history.

As he turned his head with such thoughts, Rian spoke.

"Die."

Ah, I'm going to die.

The voice contained such overwhelming power that the thought naturally welled up that it should be so.

"This..."

As Peikon tried to leave his last words, Rian's arm rose very slowly.

Seeing the completely empty torso, Peikon thought he could live again.

'If I stab the heart...'

But at that moment he realized.

Not only his body, but even his tongue speaking words wasn't moving.

The temporal disparity due to transcendent relative speed.

In reality, Rian's arm would be moving faster than Peikon's tongue.

The two arms under Denial swung downward several times faster than they had risen.

Kwaaaaang!

The great sword struck the ground, and with a tremor as if the world itself was splitting, Peikon's body was cleaved in two.

"Krrgh!"

Rian grimaced and endured the shock to his body pushed to over-pace.

As muscles throughout his body twisted, he felt as if he was metamorphosing into a different organism.

"Whew."

Only after about five minutes could Rian lift his waist.

'I'll be bedridden for two days.'

Anyway, he had survived. And with this, he had completely fulfilled his responsibility to Sylvia's family.

'I won't waver anymore.'

It had been a battle where death was closer than life, but for Rian learning through actual combat, it was a great achievement.

"This is lucky. I really didn't expect you to be here."

At the voice from the stronghold entrance, Rian turned his head.

"Who are you?"

A tall man in black iron armor was scanning the corpses with greasy eyes.

Seeing the attendant standing behind him with pen and paper, he was clearly a noble on knight's training.

But he seemed too old to be doing training now.

"Are you the Knight of Maha? I've heard the rumors."

"Knight of Maha?"

Rian tilted his head at the unfamiliar title, but the man paid no attention and drew a sword as long as a spear.

The sword was also black iron with refined patterns embroidered on it.

"You're as enigmatic as I heard. But the scene before my eyes is definite proof."

As killing intent emerged from the man's eyes with eyelashes spread like petals, Rian's body automatically reacted.

This was a master he had never encountered before.

"Bandit subjugation, eh? Well, I used to do it whenever I was bored in my youth. Now that I see it, I miss those days."

When Rian showed no particular reaction, Lamdas swung his sword around and took his stance again.

"What are you doing? Come at me quickly. You're not just waiting to die without knowing what's happening, are you?"

Duels during knight's training were common occurrences.

But currently, Rian had just annihilated a bandit group of 120, and the aftereffects of Denial hadn't completely subsided.

"Of course I know."

Rian smiled and turned toward Lamdas.

Thus the two swordsmen faced each other at a distance of twenty meters.

It was much farther than sword range, but considering Schema's movement speed, it couldn't be called a distant gap.

'Come. I'll expose your true nature.'

The moment Lamdas thought this, Rian's figure disappeared.

In the realm of thought, all he could see was a horizontal flash extending infinitely.

As if Lamdas's three-dimensional body had been drawn in two dimensions, his waist, wrists, and the sword made of black iron were all cut at the same longitude and fell to the ground.

"..."

The attendant stood with his mouth agape, unable to write a single character on the paper.

Turning slowly around, he could see Rian holding his great sword with his arm extended, descending the mountain.

Pop pop pop pong!

Rian's muscles from shoulder to wrist burst, exposing bone, but his fingers still gripped the great sword.

Smile. Smile.

Feeling the muscles of his right arm reconnecting, Rian moved away from the attendant's sight.

He would become stronger.

He would reach the end of the world.

'That's where your place will be, right beside you. Isn't that right, Sirone?'

Only after Rian had completely disappeared did the attendant swallow the saliva that had filled his mouth.

His master of ten years had died, but rather than grief, he felt moved first.

"The rumors... were true."

Following his trembling hand, the shaking pen tip slowly swept across the paper.

The Knight of Maha
