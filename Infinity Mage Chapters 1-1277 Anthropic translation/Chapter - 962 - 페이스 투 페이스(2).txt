Face to Face (2)

'I can see.'

The world that had been filled with Agape's signal began to regain the colors of its landscape.

Miro, who had descended to the ground, looked around.

The city of Bashka, which had been teeming with demons, was now desolately empty as if nothing had ever happened.

"Auuu. Au."

Even those with dense magical concentrations, the powerful demons, were crawling on the ground in a half-melted state.

'Half of them are gone.'

Judging by the population density, at least 60 million demons had been annihilated.

Of course, downtown Bashka was almost completely wiped out.

The surviving army consisted of demons that had been outside Agape's range, beyond Bashka's walls.

'But the important thing is...'

The people in the city, excluding the demons, had suffered no harm whatsoever.

"We're alive."

Citizens who had regained consciousness jumped to their feet.

"We're alive! We survived!"

Only when their cheers reached the sky did the group truly feel the reality with their skin.

'Shirone...'

Always a welcome face, but now his heart was beating as if a dead person had returned.

"Phew."

Shirone, who had finally descended to the ground, let out a long breath, then looked around at everyone and smiled.

"Hello?"

Even his usual simple greeting was enough to bring tears to their eyes.

"Shi..."

Just as Amy opened her mouth and was about to approach him.

"Shirone!"

Nade, who had cast Spark magic, instantly closed the distance and embraced Shirone.

"You bastard! What the hell happened? You should have at least told us something!"

"Sorry. I had my circumstances."

Knowing each other so well, Nade didn't even want to hear explanations.

"Hah, really..."

He had believed without a doubt that Shirone would come.

Iruki thinks, Nade prepares, and Shirone always solves the problems.

"I really thought we were going to die."

When the elemental bomb timer dropped below 10 seconds, his heart had honestly been pounding.

Nade, who suddenly remembered, said:

"I need to tell Iruki. That guy is in a dangerous situation where every second counts. If we're not careful..."

"It's okay. Iruki knows too."

"Huh?"

Knowing about the elemental bomb's existence, there was no way Shirone would have visited the cathedral first.

'That's not his personality.'

The heart tends to lean toward urgency.

But that too was merely human common sense - the inability to solve two problems simultaneously.

"Shirone."

At Ryan's voice, Shirone turned around.

"Ryan."

He didn't make a fuss.

In this terrible battlefield, Ryan was probably the only person who could forget about Shirone for a moment and fight.

Perhaps as a manifestation of such pride, Ryan smiled and pushed Amy's back.

"Ah."

Though Nade had beaten her to it, her heart was churning so much that it was rather fortunate.

'Am I ready to meet Shirone?'

Having done everything she could, warm hope had disappeared, leaving only cold reality.

At this point where she had to face everything directly.

'Shirone...'

He seemed inhuman.

"You've gotten stronger, Amy."

Because it seemed like consolation, the first emotion Amy felt was anxiety.

"I worked hard. I joined the Valkyries, received special training from Teacher Garcia, and also..."

She tried to list as many things as possible.

"I traveled around battlefields risking my life to fight alongside you. Then I got fire-branded..."

She didn't feel like she was getting closer to Shirone.

"I almost died, but still..."

Looking at Amy desperately holding back her sorrowful feelings, Shirone spoke.

"I'm sorry."

It was sincere.

"I hurt you. I shouldn't have said those things. I'm the worst boyfriend."

"What's..."

Amy put strength into her trembling lips.

"What's the worst about it? You did your best. It's because I'm weak, because I can't fight alongside you..."

"No."

Shirone shook his head.

"I was the weak one."

The people around them waited for the first truth from Shirone, who had reached a new level.

"Because I was weak, I said those cruel things. You must have been just as hurt as I was, but I made you responsible for my pain too."

The reason the Ultima System is possible is because everyone is a being with a heart.

"So..."

Imagining the pain Amy had to endure until now, Shirone said:

"Let's fight together. Whatever the outcome, I will never leave your side."

Seeing Amy's shoulders trembling with overwhelming emotion, their friends smiled.

"...Huu."

Amy clenched both fists and nodded.

'I won't cry.'

Until they finished this war together with everyone, she wouldn't shed a single tear.

Meanwhile, Heaven's army, watching from outside Bashka's walls, was also momentarily stunned.

Especially Satiel had been feeling something close to fear since Agape's light had burst forth.

'What is this?'

It was certainly some kind of Hexa, but it was definitely a feeling she had never experienced before.

'Is it included in Guffin's deletion?'

The reason she thought it was somewhat different was because there was no characteristic unpleasantness.

'So it means it's something I don't know. But also... something I do know.'

Having attempted memory recovery countless times, there was one case she could deduce.

'If it's Guffin itself.'

She hadn't experienced Agape, but if it was connected to Guffin, the contradiction would be resolved.

'If the feeling of that light is ultimately Guffin...'

Satiel's gaze turned toward Ikael, but she still had a cold expression.

'Why?'

If Ikael had regained her memories, she should have shown a shocking reaction to the light just now.

'Don't tell me she hasn't regained her memories?'

Satiel, who had been observing Ikael intently while lost in thought, shook her head fiercely.

'No, it's rather abnormal. Even I, who haven't had my memories restored, had mental disturbances.'

The fact that her Halo showed no wavering meant she was intentionally controlling her mind.

'She's alive.'

Ikael looked down at the scene where demons had disappeared and hundreds of millions of humans had been saved.

"Are you relieved?"

At Nane's question, Ikael turned her head.

"I don't have any special feelings about humans..."

"Someone once said this: sounds without heart are nothing but empty shells."

When Ikael fell silent, Shura stepped forward.

"What are Buddha's feelings? Countless demons have died and humans have lived."

Nane...

"I opened the Psychic Realm."

He quietly looked down at the citizens who were rejoicing at regaining their chance at life.

"I summoned demons, and as a price, countless humans are suffering. Do you think it's cruel?"

"Are you happy that they're alive? Of course I'm happy. But demons are the spirit that the era contains. They're not fruits from outer space."

Nane wrinkled his nose with a sad expression.

"Since when have humans... come to suffer and feel fear from mere demons?"

Again, Shura couldn't answer.

"Did I open hell? No, I opened an era. Even before the Psychic Realm opened, someone had to bear those terrible pains, and they simply became reality and covered everyone. Among those celebrating down there, how many don't need to take responsibility for this era's hell?"

"But humans are originally..."

"There was a time."

Nane, who had swallowed Ankera's dream, knew of humanity that existed long ago.

"A truly strong humanity that didn't need to fear things like the spirit of the times."

The archangels nodded.

'That's right.'

In Heaven's actual history, demons had never possessed powerful strength.

'The Gaians were a race that fought against gods. Before their convictions, demons had no place to stand.'

They had no fear of what was contained within themselves.

"Therefore, I still cannot make a decision about the necessity of my existence."

Nane said:

"I'll go and hear it directly."

Heaven's army, which had crossed Bashka's walls, landed on the street where Shirone was.

With one block between them, the era's Yahweh and the era's Buddha faced each other.

One by one, sounds disappeared, and finally, a silence without even breathing arrived.

Nade swallowed dry saliva.

'My heart feels like it's going to burst.'

Just looking at those lined up behind Nane, it was an aura that could overwhelm the world.

'So those are archangels. Is that Ikael that Shirone mentioned? That guy is probably already...'

"Nothing to be nervous about."

Miro gripped Nade's shoulder.

"You won't know until you try. We're not to be underestimated either. Including you, of course."

Her extreme smile calmed his heart.

"Ah..."

Only then did the lineup of those guarding Shirone come into view, and he felt a thrill.

'And me.'

Nade, the strongest (self-proclaimed) lightning mage.

'I'll end this fight.'

Just as he was looking ahead with shining eyes, Shirone began walking alone.

"Hey, you...!"

Shirone turned around and smiled with his eyes.

"I'll be back."

Only then did Nade see that Nane was approaching alone from Heaven's army.

Each step that Yahweh and Buddha took to meet each other felt as long as an eternity.

Dante, who had been watching seriously, chuckled.

'Brings back memories.'

During magic school, in the 2000th interpersonal combat, Shirone and Dante had walked like that too.

'Neither of us had any failures.'

Two people who had experienced only victories in their short lives clashed, and the result was Dante's defeat.

'That defeat...'

The reason he thought it was fortunate was that he could escape from the obsession with victory and savor life.

'But you're still carrying it.'

As sword afterimages rose around Nane, Shirone also floated hexagonal Hexa.

'Go.'

Dante pushed Shirone's back with his gaze.

'That's the world's final destination.'

Shirone, who shattered his Hexa into golden smoke, and Nane, who created sword fire, bumped foreheads.

In that state, as the two stared at each other, those watching had the same thought.

'They look alike.'

The impressions of pure-looking Shirone and Nane, covered in tattoos, were never the same, but...

'Why is this happening? Are my eyes strange?'

It was as if one person was standing in front of a mirror - like the same person with left and right reversed.

"The other side of the mirror."

Miro said.

"Then who... is really the real one?"

Nane's sword fire rose like thorns, and simultaneously, Miracle Stream split and surged upward.

Kukukukukukuku!

With thousands of visible afterimages, the sword fire was dizzying as it was enveloped in streams of light.

"The fight began from the moment they took their first step."

They had simply blocked each other's paths, but neither had ever stopped walking.

'I'll break through.'

When Shirone gritted his teeth and frowned, Nane inevitably made the exact same expression.

'What is necessary?'

Hundreds of millions of concepts asking that question attacked Shirone in the form of swords, all those harmonies.

'There is no "must."'

As Miracle Stream enveloped Nane's sword, all those concepts scattered like delusions.

'It's not that cold. That's what the heart is.'

While Hexa and sword fire collided with tremendous noise, no one from either side dared to intervene.

'The same things are colliding.'

Even though they were just facing each other, it felt as if the world's laws were rupturing.

"The world is one anyway."

Miro said.

"For two people who have perfectly defined that world, all that remains is a difference in perspective. Like a mirror. But the problem is, we don't know who's inside the mirror. Also, because both are perfect, they will never break."

Sein asked:

"Then?"

"Therefore, what breaks is the perspective. The moment the mirror shatters, they will know for themselves."

Who will pour out as fragments.
