Age of Chaos (3)

Rodenin, the capital of the Zive Kingdom.

True to its nature as a free city, the gates were wide open, and even as the sun was setting, countless people were entering the capital.

"Wait! Stop right there!"

But Rian was an exception.

"Are you talking to me?"

"Well, is there anyone else here as filthy as you? I don't care if you come in and become a beggar, but I can't let a beggar enter."

The rain had washed away the smell of blood, but the problem was that he wasn't carrying an umbrella.

"I'm not a beggar, I'm a wandering swordsman."

The guard burst into laughter.

"A wandering swordsman? Can you tell the difference between a beggar with a sword and a beggar who picked up a sword?"

It was strangely persuasive.

"I'm a noble. I came from Tormia, and I'm a swordsman of the Ozent family."

When Rian finally pulled out his identification papers, the guard's expression changed immediately.

"Ah, I apologize. Your appearance, no, your attire is quite far from what one would expect of a noble."

Rian smiled bitterly.

"I understand."

"Once you enter Rodenin, please wash yourself. Even with identification, you'll face many inconveniences."

Rian thought it was advice anyone would give.

"Thank you. Well then, good work."

True to a kingdom with many cloudy days, Zive had various nighttime entertainments and quite a few people wandering about.

'It's not all cheerful though.'

Rian's keen eye penetrated the darkness of small alleys branching off from the main street.

Though hidden in shadows, people were gathered there, and they weren't all beggars.

"Oh my! It's a monster!"

Two women walking with umbrellas stumbled out of the way as soon as they saw Rian.

"...I really do need to wash up."

With his massive build, hair hanging down to his shoulders, and carrying a greatsword, he looked exactly like a villain.

As he walked through the night streets with drizzling rain looking for a bathhouse, the sound of hoofbeats approached from behind.

"There! That's the man!"

One of the women who had run away in fright earlier was riding in the carriage.

"Hyah! Hyah!"

The carriage that had been rushing as if to collide came to an abrupt stop right in front of Rian.

As he waited, feeling the horse's rough breath on his face, a group of soldiers disembarked from the carriage.

"We'll need to conduct a brief inspection."

Since he had already proven his identity to enter, this was troublesome.

"What's the matter?"

"We received a report. Someone said an unidentified suspicious person was wandering the night streets looking for women."

Rian had simply been walking.

"I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm a wandering swordsman. Here's my identification."

Having learned from the gate, when he presented his identification, the security force's expression softened considerably.

"Tormia. You've come quite a long way."

The soldier who broke the ice continued.

"Recently, there have been disturbing murder cases in the capital. Serial killings with perverted methods. So..."

"Are you saying I'm the culprit? I just arrived in Rodenin. The gate guards can confirm this."

"That's not what I meant. But as you know, being a swordsman, the security headquarters has issued a first-class manhunt order. When reports come in, we're required to bring people in unconditionally and record their whereabouts."

Now he understood what the gate guard meant about getting a shave first upon entering the capital.

'It's troublesome either way though.'

The security force couldn't even catch the tail of the serial killer and needed performance records to show they were working hard.

"I understand."

Rian didn't argue.

He knew that such performance-oriented labor forces made up the city's security.

'This might actually work out well.'

Rather than looking for a bathhouse in the middle of the night, going to security headquarters would allow him to wash and shave.

"I'll cooperate with the investigation."

"Thank you."

The guard had the woman who reported Rian get out of the carriage.

"We'll take it from here. Don't worry and go home safely."

The woman glared at Rian.

"He tried to kill me! This murderer! He was going to kidnap me and do something terrible!"

While shaving his beard would reveal a neat appearance, the aura from his blood battle with the demons couldn't be easily erased.

'It can't be helped.'

If it was an aura that made even swordsmen's knees tremble, it was natural for the woman to instinctively feel fear.

"Do you provide meals and lodging?"

The guard who understood Rian's intention smiled.

"Of course. It won't be as good as a nice inn, but we'll need to shave you anyway to make a composite sketch."

The carriage carrying Rian quickly traveled the winding roads.

2nd Security Headquarters of Rodenin.

Upon entering the three-story building located in the western part of the capital, the warm air made him drowsy.

"I'd like to wash up first."

"Understood. I'll guide you to the bathroom."

Upon entering the public bath, sturdy guards who had finished their night patrol were washing themselves.

True to those who lived bearing heavy armor, they were muscular with chests so firm that even a needle couldn't penetrate them.

"Phew, how long has it been since my last bath?"

As Rian undressed while recalling memories he couldn't even remember, the eyes of those in the bath widened.

"Wow."

Though they were second to none when it came to physiques, Rian's body had different lines altogether.

'How can a person become like that?'

Rian's body, which had cut down over ten thousand demons with his great sword, was beyond biological and into the realm of engineering.

'That's not a body made through exercise. It's a physique carved by the sword.'

When the perfect inverted triangle physique twisted, they could almost see the kinetic energy it produced.

The feeling of men stealing glances at his body was quite strange, but Rian deliberately ignored it and washed himself.

With scratching sounds, his long beard fell at his feet, and he scrubbed off the accumulated grime with sandpaper-like stone soap.

"Ahh, refreshing."

As he came out shaking his hair, numerous guards who had already heard the rumors had gathered.

"Are you finished? Ah..."

The guard who had brought Rian in was handing over the great sword when he saw Rian's body and his eyes widened.

'A Knight of Maha. To see his entire form.'

It was the glory of a lifetime.

"I apologize for not recognizing you. It was raining so I couldn't see the name clearly."

While it was partly an oversight, since the other party was a Knight of Maha, confessing made things much easier.

"It's fine."

As Rian, dressed in security supplies, waited for the next step, the guard admitted his mistake.

'That woman reported such a big shot as a murderer. Well, even I get goosebumps...'

After bathing, Rian's appearance wasn't gentle, but he looked sufficiently honest.

"Let's go. I'll try to finish the investigation as quickly as possible."

With the changed treatment, Rian thought he should wash himself before going anywhere from now on.

"But about these murder cases. What exactly are they?"

He had heard they involved perverted methods.

"Starting two months ago, women have been kidnapped once every seven days. They're found dead the next day, and surprisingly, they're found completely drained of blood."

"Completely drained of blood?"

"Exactly as it sounds. I've seen all kinds of corpses, but this was severe. They were crumpled up with not a single drop of blood left, just skin remaining."

It was horrifying just to imagine.

"Anyway, there's no chance you'll be a suspect, so don't worry. Now then, this way..."

Opening the door, he saw night troublemakers sitting in interrogation chairs being questioned by guards.

"Well, well, who do we have here? Isn't this the Knight of Maha who once made the world buzz?"

A corner ring setup. A middle-aged man over two meters tall approached the corner.

It was Benov, the 2nd Security Captain.

"Captain, this person isn't a suspect..."

"Get lost, you fool."

Though said playfully, an order was an order, so the guard hastily stepped aside.

"Yeah, I know. The lone warrior of hell who belongs nowhere and hunts demons alone."

The Knight of Maha was a more global issue than Rian imagined.

"Cutting, cutting, cutting your way down to arrive at Rodenin, the capital of Zive. Hmm. Good, good."

"What do you want to know?"

Benov asked, baring his teeth.

"Why our kingdom of all places?"

"To go home."

He had come straight down, so he would go straight home.

"The security force situation isn't good these days. The higher-ups are nagging, the culprit isn't caught. I'm dying from stress too."

Benov lightly stepped and tapped the corner with his gloved fists.

"Let's end this simply. Come up for a match and you're immediately released. Otherwise, you'll be investigated all night long."

In the end, he wanted to spar with the Knight of Maha.

"Captain, but this method is..."

Benov interrupted again.

"Just stay quiet. How about it, Knight of Maha? Swords are one thing at security headquarters, but how about settling this man-to-man with fists?"

The guard whispered.

"He's just on edge. Just refuse. He may not look it, but that man is the Rodenin Colosseum champion."

"I can hear everything, you fool."

With the interrogating guards and even the night troublemakers watching with great interest, Rian spoke.

"I don't fight to defeat someone."

If one could become strong by defeating others, what would be the emptiness dwelling in Rian's heart?

"Really? Then what do you fight for?"

"I don't know. I'm just thinking that strength isn't something like that."

"Hahahaha! As expected, there's no practical knight among those with famous names. Just smooth talk."

"Such provocation won't work on me."

The laughter disappeared instantly, and Rian turned his shoulders and walked toward the ring.

"However, if it's a way to quickly deal with something bothersome, I suppose I could step up."

Benov's smile stretched to his ears.

"That's exactly it. Come up."

Thus an unexpected martial arts match was prepared, and guards gathered around the ring.

"Ah, really! Let us watch too!"

The sound of low-ranking guards dragging the troublemakers in a line to temporary holding could be heard.

As Rian stepped into the ring and removed his shirt, a guard who appointed himself as second helped him put on gloves.

They were open-finger gloves.

As he tightly fastened the wrist straps, the guard said.

"I'm sorry it came to this. The captain is a martial arts fanatic. He was going to participate in the Central Continent Colosseum as Rodenin champion, but it was canceled due to work. If he weren't in the security force, he would have gone global."

It was a roundabout way of telling him to be careful.

"It doesn't matter. Fighting is my profession. But if I win, let me sleep right away."

"Haha! Martial arts is different from swords."

He had heard rumors about the Knight of Maha until his ears were sore, but the captain's skill was force confirmed with his own eyes.

As he walked to the center of the ring, tapping his gloves together, Benov approached as if he had been waiting.

"Let me explain the rules. If you die fighting, no tattling to mommy. Attacking vital spots is a foul. You'd rather die anyway. Right?"

Rian briefly nodded and retreated to the side of the ring.

"We'll begin the 2nd Security Headquarters martial arts match. Time limit is 10 minutes. Fight to your heart's content, reasonably."

The guard who entered as referee crossed his arms in an X shape, then immediately leaped over the ring.

Benov charged with a thump, kicking the ground, but Rian only raised his guard and swayed his upper body.

'Let's see the champion's skills.'

The sound of a jab breaking through the air exploded against Rian's weaving guard.

Bang! Pop-pop-bang!

Following that, a combination attack of jabs drummed against his arms with a light rhythm.

'This is interesting.'

The corner of Rian's mouth slightly curved upward.
