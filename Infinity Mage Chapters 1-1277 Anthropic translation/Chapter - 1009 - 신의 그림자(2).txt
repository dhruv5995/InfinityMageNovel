Shadow of God (2)

The mountain viewed from the sky was a massive piece of charcoal with hundreds of thousands of lights twinkling like stars.

In temperatures hot enough to burn living creatures to death from the heat alone, Amy calmly exhaled.

'Yahweh's assassination organization, he said.'

Gultan's ability, Image Crafting, would certainly have been far more lethal to Sirone than to herself.

"Maya."

Pushing aside her countless thoughts, Amy looked toward the forest-covered mountain across the way.

'Am I already too late?'

If whoever attacked Maya was on a similar level to Gultan, she would have died a hundred times over by now.

"Hm?"

Her pupils blazed red.

'What's that?'

Deep within the forest, she detected artificial tremors completely different from natural phenomena.

It meant they were still fighting.

Amy immediately cast spatial movement toward that location.

Miyo, with her severed arm, didn't even think about stopping the bleeding as she struggled to understand what had just happened.

'What the hell occurred?'

She could accept having her arm cut off, but not being able to perceive it at all was incomprehensible.

'I'm a corps commander. And that bastard was a weakling who couldn't even stand up just one second ago.'

Faced with a massive gap that even enlightenment couldn't explain, Miyo turned to look at Caden.

"What are you?"

Caden couldn't answer.

'Why can't I move my arm?'

His right arm was still frozen in space, sword extended horizontally.

'Lower it! Lower your arm!'

When he forced his consciousness into it, he could clearly feel the grip's texture and the blade's weight.

'It's not a problem with sensation.'

Yet still his arm wouldn't move, as if he'd forgotten how to give it commands.

'The problem is my brain. What exactly happened...'

It must be related to that tearing sound he'd heard moments ago.

'Don't think about it.'

Caden turned around, leaving his right arm stiff as if in a cast.

'Protecting Maya comes first.'

The moment Miyo entered his field of vision, his sword began slashing through the air like mad.

Caden remained calm.

His senses were definitely alive, but his brain wasn't processing those sensations.

"What are you doing?"

Only when Miyo spoke did Caden realize what was happening and became startled at his arm moving on its own.

"What is this..."

The moment he forced his consciousness in, his thoughts vanished and his body shot forward.

"Kiyaaaaa!"

Miyo's remaining arm was severed, and a scream that seemed to tear apart echoed across the mountain.

"You bastard!"

With both arms now pathetically shortened stumps, she thrust them forward and opened her mouth wide, baring her teeth.

"I'll chew up your heart!"

Caden tried to regain consciousness.

And the moment he reclaimed control of his body, he felt all strength drain from him.

'Damn it!'

Miyo charged forward, leading with her head.

Even a simple headbutt from a corps commander's physical abilities would be enough to shatter bones.

At the same time, Caden's right arm plunged the sword into the ground, raising a thick iron wall.

Thud!

Miyo's pupils shook violently.

"Urgh!"

As she collapsed to her knees, clutching her head and trembling, cracks spread across the iron wall.

Caden finally had an intuition.

'Two brains.'

Though he wasn't certain, it seemed the network between his left and right brain had been severed.

'The brain that moves my right arm no longer sends signals to me. That's why I can't control it.'

If he built on that hypothesis, it also explained why his thoughts had evaporated during that all-out attack earlier.

'Then if the brain that doesn't send me signals momentarily dominates my body...'

Caden would receive no signals at all.

"Heh heh. Heh heh heh."

What did it matter anyway?

If even just his right arm could be free from the fate of the Red Cross, that damned fate.

"Maya."

If he could hold her hand.

"Now I can finally..."

Before he could finish speaking, the crouched Miyo threw her body toward Maya.

"Kiiiii!"

Having already taken a fatal blow by smashing her head against the iron wall.

In that case, completing at least part of Catacomb's strategy would be the best option.

'Kill Maya. If I can gnaw away even a little at Yahweh's heart...'

Caden shouted.

"Maya!"

But the brain he could control was trapped by the Red Cross's fate, unable to budge.

"Dieeeee!"

Miyo's chest split vertically and vicious ribs grew out, spreading like jaws.

At the same time, a flash of light crashed down.

Amy, who had arrived via spatial movement, grasped the situation in an instant and threw her body forward.

'This is bad!'

According to her self-image memory analysis, she was 0.43 seconds short of saving Maya.

"Kyaa!"

Maya, with her sensitive civilian-level nervous system, screamed belatedly.

"Kekekeke! Too late!"

Miyo, having exposed all her disgusting organs, gathered her countless ribs and lunged at her.

Splat!

Amy's steps stopped.

Miyo's body had split in two, passing by either side of Maya before crashing into the ground.

"Hng! Hk!"

Maya, who had been holding up both hands like a puppy, sensed something strange and slowly opened her eyes.

Caden was holding his longsword in reverse grip, having swung it upward, glaring at Miyo.

Amy gaped in bewilderment.

'Demon Sword Technique, Flash Rend.'

Though it was a finishing move in itself, the sword speed was on a completely different dimension compared to their school days.

"Caden, what happened to you?"

There were mountains of things she wanted to say, but there was something she had to say first.

'Even dreaming of it was a luxury, but now I can do it.'

With eyes of determination, Caden approached, and Maya smiled as she came to meet him.

"Thank you, Caden. Without you, I would have..."

"Maya."

The moment Caden interrupted, Maya's shoulders flinched and her face went pale.

"I'm going to confess properly. From the moment we first met, you were the only one in my heart."

"H-hey, Caden."

Amy tried to intervene, but Caden ignored her.

"It's okay if you don't like me. Just know that I love you. Then I'll be able to do anything. I won't fear hell or death."

The reason Maya couldn't say anything was because Caden's words and gaze were far too serious.

'Why is he acting like this? Is he teasing me?'

If she hadn't seen how much Caden had sacrificed to save her, she would have slapped him first.

"Can I ask you one favor in return?"

Caden said with a gentle smile.

"Just once, could you sing a song for me? That's my only wish. Of course, if you don't want to..."

"Hey! Caden!"

Only then did Caden turn his head.

"Why do you keep interrupting? Can't you see what I'm doing?"

"I can see it too well, that's why I'm doing this! What are you doing to Maya right now? Your hand! Your hand!"

"Huh?"

Blinking for a moment, Caden traced along his shoulder to where his right hand was located.

It was on Maya's chest.

After staring at what his hand was doing for about a second, Caden's eyes filled with horror.

"Aaaaah! What is this, damn it! What the hell is this!"

"How would I know, you crazy bastard! Just take your hand off her!"

Caden stomped his feet frantically, but couldn't figure out how to move his right hand.

"Urgh!"

Finally, he grabbed his wrist and pulled back, bringing the terrible accident to an end.

'Why? Why on earth?'

He'd never made such mistakes in his entire lifeâ€”how could his hand do something so stupid?

Only his brain would know.

'Maya!'

Turning his head, Caden saw Maya avoiding his gaze and made a tearful expression.

'I'm ruined. It's all over.'

Did the Red Cross's fate not even allow his first and last confession of his life?

Imagining what she must think of him now felt like falling into an abyss.

"I'm sorry, Maya. This absolutely wasn't my intention. I don't even know what this hand did."

Though it was the typical excuse of a pervert, Maya, who had some idea of what was happening, nodded.

"Y-yeah. I understand."

Of course, that didn't mean she had gained enough courage to close the distance with Caden again.

Consumed by despair, Caden's eyes filled with killing intent as he drew his sword with his left hand.

"Damn it! Then I'll punish it!"

Amy and Maya shouted simultaneously.

"Wait! Caden!"

But before Caden could do anything, his right hand moved on its own and slapped his face.

"Ugh!"

Hit by his own fist, Caden lost his reason.

"Aaaaah!"

He threw down his sword and began fighting his right hand with his left, the battle fairly evenly matched.

But eventually his right hand overpowered his left and twisted it outward forcefully.

With both women watching in bewilderment, Caden finally admitted defeat.

"Aaah! Fine! I lost! I'm beaten!"

Though he was as stubborn as anyone, what was the point of beating his own right hand?

Maya muttered.

"I always knew he was a strange person, but..."

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Collapsing weakly to the ground, Caden stared intently at the sword that had fallen right beside him.

"Should I really just cut it off?"

Amy said.

"Stop it. I don't know the details, but anyway, you protected Maya, didn't you? Thanks to that right arm of yours."

"Tch! If it keeps acting like this, how can I stay by Maya's side? Who knows what this hand will do?"

Maya realized the real reason for Caden's disappointment.

"I'll tell you."

She approached Caden and sat beside him.

"It's not sincere, right? I mean, honestly, I don't know what kind of mechanism it is, but the Caden I know isn't that kind of person. So... whenever something like this happens, I'll tell you."

"M-Maya."

"Thank you, Caden. Thanks to you, I can continue singing. I'll grant that favor you asked for too."

Caden bit his lower lip tightly, but couldn't stop the flowing tears.

'He's surprisingly tender-hearted.'

Of course she knew.

How much Caden had dreamed of this moment, how he had screamed madly at his cursed fate.

'Congratulations.'

Even if it was just his right arm, it was the first thing he had obtained by tearing apart destiny with his own power.

How much time had passed?

After the storm of emotions subsided, the three sat side by side on the hill, watching the city.

"By the way..."

Even Caden, who had fought fiercely, couldn't help but feel deflated by the sight.

"It's incredible."

The gray space created by the Taeguk was spreading toward the horizon's end.

'Whatever's happening inside there... I can't even imagine it.'

Amy said.

"Time, space, law, mind. All of it is collapsed and endlessly cycling. The moment you enter there, your thoughts will be destroyed and you'll lose even your sense of self."

It wasn't a level they could interfere with.

The Taeguk's space was like a landscape of torrential energy rapidly flowing in reverse, like a waterfall.

Sirone and Giyorgi faced each other.

Just 2 meters apart, in that small nucleus, the power to devour the world was being created.

Giyorgi spoke.

"How long do you intend to hold out, Yahweh? You must know. The Taeguk expands endlessly."

Unless one of them backed down, it would eventually devour the entire world.

"The odds are fifty-fifty. If you want to gamble with me using all of humanity as stakes, I won't stop you, but..."

Yahweh wouldn't be able to do that.

"Giyorgi."

Sirone spoke for the first time.

"You seem to overestimate yourself too much. Whatever kind of being you are, you're merely a shadow. You cannot surpass me."

"...Perhaps that's true."

As Giyorgi bent his upper body, his eyes flashed and a demon's face was revealed.

"But what about this?"

As the power of evil grew, the Taeguk's space, which had remained in a lull, began expanding again.

"Kekeke! Will you take it, or will you back down? Will you, Yahweh, gamble with humanity at stake?"

"That's exactly why you can't win."

As Giyorgi's expression crumpled, Sirone drastically twisted the distribution of power.

"You call this pathetic thing a Taeguk?"

As the light's energy weakened, darkness began penetrating at a terrifying speed.

'Now if I twist it back here...'

By taking the force that darkness was pushing with and spinning it around, the speed of light became much faster.

Giyorgi realized.

'Son of a bitch!'

Light and darkness endlessly cycling within the Taeguk's constraints.

'He's using the power of darkness to amplify the light. As a result, Yahweh is faster than me.'

"If you want to do this with me, bring at least my level."

In the tremendously fast-spinning game of yin-yang tag, finally the teeth of light bit the tail of darkness.
