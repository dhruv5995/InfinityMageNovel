[687] Incident Occurs (2)

"Aaahhh! Save the goblin!"

Sirone swooped down like a swallow and caught Kido, who was flailing as he fell.

"I told you I'd catch you. Why are you making such a fuss?"

"Damn it! I hate the sky!"

For Kido, who had grasped the principles of earth, the sky with nothing to grab onto was an uncomfortable place.

"That human really went all out though. I didn't think he'd actually break that thing."

The seismic waves from Seedling's collapse had destroyed more than half of Radum.

"It's better this way. I don't really like ancient weapons and such."

Map weapons that make judgments based on charts don't bother to look at what's actually there.

They only calculate damage scale and gains according to strategy and tactics.

This was why Sirone tried to restrain himself from using wide-area destructive magic, despite its tremendous power.

"That's just your opinion. That thing was incredibly expensive, you know?"

After setting Kido down on the ground, Sirone looked around.

The impact of Seedling's collapse had made the ground bounce like a rubber mat, causing all the dust on the surface to rise up, making it impossible to see even an inch ahead.

The silver lining was that since it was raining, the time their vision would be obstructed wouldn't last too long.

'Spectrum is annihilated and Seedling is broken. What is La Enemie thinking?'

Sirone turned to look at Meirei.

"How is it? Can you still hear the voice..."

Sirone felt his heart stop as he met her eyes.

"You... who are you?"

Though her appearance hadn't changed, the person standing before him now was not Meirei.

If faces are mirrors that reveal emotions, then her face - with lips pursed and watching Sirone intently - contained an unknown emotion he had never seen in any human before.

"......"

When he couldn't get any response from Meirei, Sirone opened his insight.

Behind matter lies the concept that defines that matter.

A sword is a collection of atoms, but to recognize it as a sword, the concept of "sword" must come first.

Therefore, if a sword is preceded by an indestructible concept, it will be indestructible in reality too - this was the true nature of Lian's great sword <Idea>.

Soul, Idea, concept.

It didn't matter what you called it, but for humans who exist through the five senses, there were two ways to enter this realm.

One was to escape from the physical body made of matter (brain in a vat).

The other was to feel the hidden world from the realm of reality (insight).

Using the latter ability to examine Meirei, Sirone got goosebumps.

'What... is this?'

Meirei's conceptual form was different from that of humans.

Her body was dry as thorns, over 3 meters tall, with the top of her head spread out and rising like a fan.

Her arms were thin and long, her waist hunched, and her pupils were covered with glossy black retinas without any irises.

"You, just who are you..."

Just as Sirone was about to speak, Kido grabbed his wrist.

"Never mind. Just leave her alone for now."

"Kido, what's going on?"

Kido couldn't sense insight, but he had predicted this to some extent through the taste of memories.

"I knew when I ate Meirei's blood. Her memories aren't human."

Meirei's memories were something that couldn't be analyzed by a goblin's imagination.

"Anyway, it's clear she intends to fight La Enemie. That means she's an ally."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Well, that's..."

Meirei spoke to Sirone.

"It's been a long time, Hexa."

Though it wasn't human language, the Ultima System interpreted it.

"You know me?"

No, to be precise, it was Hexa.

Though Sirone had recalled Hexa's memories through Igor's ability, he still didn't feel they were his own.

Meirei looked around and said.

"There's too much noise. It must mean the time has come. Wait a little. You'll understand everything."

"Wait? For what?"

Meirei raised her head and pointed her index finger toward the sky.

"The Event."

"Grrrr! Damn it!"

Seedling's collapse claimed countless casualties regardless of racial superiority, but only Raika, the purebred vampire, managed to barely save his life.

"You think I'd be destroyed by just this much?"

Raika crawled out from the wreckage of the fallen Seedling and shakily got to his feet.

Since it had been such a massive tower, even in its collapsed state it looked like a cliff standing there.

'I want to suck blood right now, but... recovery comes first.'

Vampires are a race with the unique concept of being half-body, half-soul.

Dwelling on the boundary between matter and concept, they can destroy or pass through walls depending on their will, but neither function works perfectly.

For example, since wood is easier to destroy than stone, wood becomes the material that's easier for vampires to pass through.

Rufist's iron wall was strong enough to be difficult to destroy unless you were a pureblood, so Raika's condition after being hit by the Vajra Tsunami was completely battered in both body and soul.

"I'll give you credit for still being alive."

Rufist walked over, stepping on ground that had become a muddy mess of rainwater and dust.

'Damn it.'

Rufist's persistence in tracking down Raika even at this disaster site comparable to a natural calamity was also remarkable.

"I'm glad you're alive. I had no intention of giving you a peaceful death."

Raika bared his fangs and retorted.

"Kekeke. How unfortunate. Do you think your dead woman will come back just because you broke Seedling? You didn't even manage to steal the seed. Your mission is a complete failure."

He couldn't not know that the main reason the royal castle sent the Magic Association President was Seedling.

"That's not for someone about to die to worry about."

A gurgling sound came from Raika's throat.

"A lowly human... dares to say he'll kill a vampire?"

Rufist let out a long sigh.

"Human, human. Is that all you scum know how to say?"

"Because it's true. It's just absurd that such a weak race dominates the world."

"Yes, we are weak."

Rufist readily agreed.

"Generally speaking, that is."

Raika's eyes became sharp.

"Let me tell you an interesting story. Two men fell into hell with their families."

Rufist showed the back of his hand with his index and middle fingers extended.

"And they decided to escape from hell. But you see, one man succeeded, while the other couldn't escape."

He bent his index finger, leaving only the middle finger.

Even knowing this was a curse gesture used among humans, Raika had to suppress his anger.

"The man who failed couldn't abandon his family. When his wife collapsed, he helped her up, and when his child fell, he carried them and ran. Eventually, the gates of hell closed."

Rufist sneered.

"On the other hand, the man who succeeded didn't look after anyone. Whether his wife fell into a pit of fire, his parents cried out in agony, or his children shed tears of blood, he just ran and ran until he finally escaped before the gates closed."

Rufist spread both arms and asked.

"Isn't that strange?"

"...What are you trying to say?"

"As you know, this is a metaphor. A metaphor about the system of human society. The more you have to take responsibility for, the less competitive you become. Yet they choose responsibility over competition. Those 'ordinary' humans you mentioned."

Murderous intent flashed in Rufist's eyes.

"Most people's reactions to this story are similar. They sympathize with the failed man and condemn the successful one. So hardly anyone asks this question: Why did the successful man have to run, leaving the people he loved most in the world behind in hell?"

Rufist raised his index finger.

"Because it's efficient. The moment you take responsibility for someone, everyone dies. Then what about the mental state of that man who abandoned his family and ran? Can you really call that sane?"

Rufist shook his head.

"Absolutely not. Obsession with success, madness. I call this psychological murder. Whether you're born without guilt or suppress it with rational force, victory or defeat depends on how many precious people you can psychologically kill. And currently, the upper echelons of the human system are crawling with such insane bastards. So, do you still think humans are a weak race?"

Rufist's smiling face gradually hardened.

"The opponent standing before you now is a human who has transcended the ordinary category. Everyone who entered Radum to carry out missions are all terribly cruel psychological murderers. Only those who had to kill their most beloved people to become mages, to spread the will of good, to reach the pinnacle of swordsmanship remain. Killing, killing, killing, continuously killing to climb up."

Friends, family, even oneself - the only thing you can obtain by murdering them all is...

The true self.

"Don't think I'll be the same as those good humans whose blood you've been sucking. No one here is normal. Crazy bastards who would do anything to achieve their goals are swarming at the top of the world. It's not a system that lowly races like vampires can dare to set foot in."

"Kieeeeeee!"

Raika screamed and charged forward.

His soul hadn't even half recovered yet, but he couldn't contain his fury at having his racial pride trampled.

'Jane...'

Though he had poured out all the words left inside him without restraint, Rufist didn't feel relieved.

The reason a genius mage of the mental category met his death in such a den of demi-humans was probably also because he had to take responsibility for someone.

'You should have killed. You should have lived.'

Perhaps Jane wanted to escape the guilt of psychological murder and find a better life.

Steel Magic:

Vajra Hand.

Steel was refined over Rufist's shoulder and transformed into the massive arms of a beast, crushing Raika.

"Grrrr!"

Raika, hanging like a mouse caught in a lion's paw, struggled with all his limbs.

The fact that he couldn't escape even with his half-soul abilities meant that Vajra Hand's durability was strong enough to transcend vampire abilities.

"Shall we start playing around?"

Raika's face contorted grotesquely.

"Lowly..."

The claws of Vajra Hand penetrated Raika's body.

"Aaaaaahhh!"

The vampire's screams continued for a full 10 minutes.

"Grrrr..."

No beast would have mangled its prey this thoroughly.

When Raika died, his body withered first.

Finally, it turned to dust and his black soul scattered into the air.

'Is this the end?'

Raika was destroyed, and with Seedling destroyed, Flalino shouldn't be able to use his power either.

Among the Three Administrators, Draker remained, but since he hadn't shown himself so far, it seemed the Sirone mercenary group had dealt with him.

"Finally found you."

At the sound of splashing water, he turned to see Segal walking with a hunched posture, his hair soaked like a mop.

The first thing Rufist checked was the bag Segal was dragging.

'He recovered the dagger.'

His only weakness had disappeared.

"I will kill you."

Segal's pace quickened, but Rufist didn't even flinch.

And when he approached close range, Rufist slowly turned his body, and Segal kicked off the ground and passed by him.

"La Enemie!"

The rapid sword stabbed through the air at terrifying speed.

"Wherever you are!"

Segal sniffed and launched his body toward the opposite side of where Seedling had fallen.

"I'll find you and kill you!"

Rufist took out Nemesis from Cubrick.

'If his sense of smell caught it, that means everyone will gather soon.'

La Enemie had begun to move.
