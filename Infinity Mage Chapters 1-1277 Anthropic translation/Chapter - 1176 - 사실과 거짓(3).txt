Truth and Lies (3)

'He really wants to kill me.' As expected, only friends would do this.

Moved by their determination, Havitz finally turned his gaze to Zetaro.

"Explain."

Though he understood the rules through divine frequency, this wasn't a game he could win with brains alone.

Zetaro spoke.

"You and Wizard will play the game. The rules are simple. You each make one true statement and one false statement." Havitz smiled.

"But neither side can know which is true and which is false, right?"

"That's right. You must state one truth. If you can't prove it, you lose."

"And the penalty for losing is death?"

"Well, I'd like that, but I want to avoid situations where the ultimate goal interferes with the rules. If you prove 'I will die' as truth, you'd actually win the game. That would break the rules."

"What does it matter? You're trying to kill me anyway."

"Then it wouldn't be a game."

When Zetaro smiled slightly, Havitz felt a chill for the first time in a while.

"Hehe, that's right."

Satan is unpredictable.

If the rules of the game itself were broken, he would survive in any situation.

'Zetaro really is interesting.'

Feeling slightly excited, Havitz asked.

"What's the penalty for losing?"

Wizard said.

"Granting whatever wish the opponent wants. Since it can't be decided arbitrarily."

"Keke. Any wish at all, I suppose?"

Even seeing the madness flickering in Havitz's eyes, Wizard answered calmly.

"Yes, any wish."

Though what each wanted might differ, Wizard's desire was no less than Havitz's.

"Good, then let me summarize. For example: In one hour, I will eat an apple. In one hour, I will eat a strawberry. One of these is true, one is false."

Zetaro nodded.

"Right. You must eat either the apple or strawberry to prove the truth. If you eat both, or neither, you lose."

There must be exactly one truth and one lie.

"Hmm."

After confirming even the detailed rules, Havitz was unexpectedly cautious.

Smoodo narrowed his eyes.

'He felt it too.'

This one was truly dangerous.

As his thinking took longer than expected, the group grew anxious, but Zetaro was certain.

'Havitz will accept.'

A conversation from an hour ago came to mind.

"Havitz will accept."

When Zetaro said this, Balkan fell into thought with a pale, bloodless face.

"Can you be 100% certain? Playing a game means following rules. His greatest strength—chaos—would weaken. For someone already playing an assassination game to play a second game seems like suicide."

Zetaro agreed.

"It would be. Unless it's quite interesting—no, probably no game could shake him. But this time it's possible. Because Wizard is here."

Zetaro looked back at Wizard.

"The rules are actually simple. What matters is psychology. And when it comes to psychology, we can pierce Havitz. Because it's a rule requiring exactly one truth."

"Divine frequency."

"Right. Havitz can't read Wizard's mind. When I heard the assassination game rules, I had a feeling. Havitz can grow tired of everything. If Wizard is the only one whose mind he can't read, we just need to build rules around her."

Balkan chuckled.

"Certainly. This is more about the person than the game. If he played this game with someone uninteresting, it would just become meaningless wordplay. But he wants to know about Wizard. He'll participate actively."

"As long as Havitz finds it interesting." Zetaro looked sad.

"So... he'll definitely play this game."

"Good." Havitz said.

"I accept."

Even Wizard, maintaining extreme composure, had her face slightly flushed.

Havitz checked the time.

"I need to play my game soon, so shall we start with this? I will kill Zetaro in this assassination game."

Truth or lie?

"And one more. I will kill Smoodo in this assassination game."

One of the two must be true.

"Try to avoid it if you can. If you both survive, I lose."

"Hmm."

Smoodo stroked his chin.

'Has he already decided? Or is he simply listing two options to choose from? Either way, one of Zetaro or me will die.'

Zetaro also fell into thought.

'Too easy? If Smoodo and I commit suicide, it's over, right? Havitz's thinking is...'

He looked up.

"Ah."

Havitz was absorbed in this game.

'Even if Smoodo and I commit suicide, if Wizard loses, it becomes a draw. It's a declaration that he'll make Wizard fail somehow. No, it's a much grander desire than that.'

How would the opponent respond?

"Alright. I accept. Then I..."

Wizard said.

"Before this assassination game ends, I will kiss Shirone."

Truth or lie.

"And I... before this assassination game ends, I will kiss you."

Zetaro nodded inwardly.

'As expected, Wizard understands the essence of this game. With this, there's no need to worry.'

She's not a child.

Through every imaginable simulation, her mind must be as mature as an adult's.

'If she doesn't lose in psychological warfare, she can beat Havitz. What's true and what's false isn't important. The real intent of this game is...'

The same as what Zetaro was feeling now.

"Interesting."

Havitz said.

"Good, I accept. Now then... about 8 minutes left until my game starts."

Putting away his watch, he said.

"Go. Eight minutes."

Smoodo and Zetaro exchanged glances and hurriedly fled.

"Tick, tick."

Making clock sounds with his mouth, Havitz asked Wizard, who remained.

"Are you thinking of killing me now? The moment you have killing intent, Vanishing will activate."

Havitz's lips curved up.

"Or what? Planning to kiss me?"

"I don't need to kill you." When Wizard activated Avatar, the ominous afterimage of the Formless God bloomed in the air.

"Stopping you is enough."

"You're making the game boring."

Of course, whatever attitude he took toward the game didn't matter considering the winner's reward.

'She's gotten stronger.'

From the writhing form of the Formless God, Havitz intuited what level she had reached.

"Keke."

Killing intent flashed in Havitz's eyes.

"How unfortunate."

Twelve shadows appeared beneath Wizard's feet as Sheol suddenly rose up.

'I'm complete too.'

The moment Havitz launched himself, Wizard gritted her teeth and activated the Formless God.

Reverse White Spin.

"For Satan...!"

Before Sheol could finish speaking, 0.666 seconds shattered and time reversed.

"Damn!"

Though she ran frantically down the corridor, Havitz was nowhere to be seen at any intersection.

'Where did he go? Smoodo? Zetaro?'

50-50 odds.

'He's not caught in Spirit Zone. He activated Sheol. Should I rely on half chances? Or...'

Should she meet Shirone to complete her mission?

Five minutes remained.

Zetaro ran until his mouth tasted bitter.

"Hah! Hah!"

Rather than fearing death, he was doing his best to entertain Havitz.

'Havitz will kill me.'

Three minutes earlier, Zetaro had told Smoodo:

"Havitz will kill me. If killing someone he likes better is more fun, it would be me."

It was his pride.

"I'll lure Havitz, so you escape that way. Now we can only leave it to fate."

"Will you be okay?"

"We're just tools in this game anyway. Wizard will handle it properly."

"Got it. Then... be careful. Keke." When Smoodo burst into laughter at his own words, Zetaro's lungs also shook.

"Kekeke! I should slap you once too."

Since only Wizard could perceive Havitz's Vanishing, they might not even know they're dying.

"Farewell."

So the two parted at the crossroads.

Zetaro entered an empty office, locked the door, and hid under a desk.

"Can't run anymore."

Vaguely waiting for death while trying to recall pleasant memories from the past.

"Huh?"

Vanishing activated.

'Why am I here? I definitely came in to avoid something...'

One minute remained.

Smoodo stood dazed in the corridor.

"What did I forget?"

Havitz was approaching Smoodo with his sword drawn long.

"With this, my words are true."

Time remaining: 3 seconds, 2 seconds, 1 second.

Checking the time, he twisted his waist to cut Smoodo's neck.

"Gasp!"

As Hexa's light spread through Delta headquarters, Havitz registered in Smoodo's mind.

Through Elicia's quantum signal, the situation here spread throughout the building.

Shirone's figure flickered.

"Yahweh..."

Timed with the assassination game, once every hour.

"Kiiiii!"

Havitz, grotesquely contorting his face, thrust his sword toward Smoodo's heart.

"Urgh!"

Though he hastily twisted his body, the sword pierced Smoodo's lung and emerged from his back.

Wizard, having located them, arrived.

"Havitz!"

"...Smoodo?"

Still sitting under the desk, Zetaro muttered blankly.

"Why? Why not me..."

Though Wizard had to admit it, being surpassed by Smoodo too was shocking.

"No!"

Zetaro clutched his head.

"That can't be! Havitz said I was the most interesting! Why am I...!"

As the sword slid out with a swoosh, Smoodo, coughing up blood, smiled.

'Zetaro. Thank goodness.'

Slumping to the floor, he leaned against the wall, gasping.

'This round probably wasn't fun for Havitz.'

Havitz turned around.

"I won."

Spreading both arms, he said.

"You didn't meet Shirone. And I killed Smoodo. My victory."

"It's not over yet."

Wizard pointed at Smoodo.

"He's still breathing."

Smoodo, clutching his belly and surviving on the air left in his lungs, nodded.

"Hmm, shall we finish it?"

As Wizard activated the Formless God, Havitz raised his sword.

超空

Infinite Creation.

In that moment, one frame disappeared.

When Havitz came to his senses, Wizard was already kissing him.

Even as Wizard landed silently, Havitz stood there with sword in hand.

"This makes it a draw."

Smoodo spent the precious air in his lungs to burst into laughter.

"Kekekeke."

And showing his blood-stained teeth, he said.

"I'm going first. Have fun."

As Smoodo finally died, Havitz looked at Wizard and touched his lips.

'She kissed me.'

That was an undeniable fact.

But did that mean Wizard liked him?

'I don't know. I can't read her mind. Was it just part of the game? Or perhaps...'

He wanted to know.

He was dying to know.

Zetaro thought.

'Yes, I don't know either, Havitz. Why you chose Smoodo. But that's the true meaning of this game.'

Whether truth or lie, with any words, any actions, any proof whatsoever.

'We...'

Cannot know another's truth.
