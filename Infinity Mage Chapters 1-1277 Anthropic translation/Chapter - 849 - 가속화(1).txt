THUD! THUD!

A massive creature made of black rock was walking through the mountains, making the ground tremble.

A Slayer equipped with <Beop-sal> as its engine.

The Slayer's appearance, which could be transformed using materials, was a quadrupedal body with a smooth surface like a glass marble.

Its face was round, and Shirone and Rian were riding on its waist that curved down from the neck.

"Eek!" 

The security forces from a nearby city hastily stopped their horses and moved aside as the 5-meter-tall Slayer passed by them.

"Wh-what is that thing?"

As security forces, they should have stopped it, but they couldn't bring themselves to approach the sight of moving metal.

"Halt! Halt!"

When the Slayer stopped, the security captain approached.

Despite being on horseback, Shirone suddenly poked his head out from a position higher than the captain's line of sight.

"Hello."

"A human?"

Relieved that it wasn't a demon, the security captain asked.

"Who are you?"

Shirone handed over a travel pass stamped with Kashan's seal.

"I'm a mage from the Ivory Tower. I'd like to use the spatial teleportation magic circle in Tasian City."

It was the fastest route.

After checking the document written in Uorin's own handwriting, the security captain immediately saluted.

"Ah, I apologize. We were in a state of emergency."

"It's fine. What's the extent of the damage?"

The security captain's face darkened.

"All the cities have already been destroyed. I'm afraid you won't be able to use the spatial teleportation magic circle."

Shirone had thought that might be the case.

"I see. Thank you for letting me know."

"I'm sorry we couldn't be of help."

Looking at the tired faces of the security forces, Shirone shook his head.

"You've saved us plenty of time. Well then..."

When <Beop-sal> was activated, the Slayer began racing through the mountain path at a terrifying speed unlike before.

"So that's the star of the Ivory Tower."

The security officers who had heard reports that the Ivory Tower had prevented the capital's fall let out exclamations of admiration.

"Yeah. They're different from us."

Though it was a brief encounter, it wasn't difficult to read the determination in those eyes that seemed to emit light.

"Why do they fight?"

With their hometowns already destroyed, the officers were sensing the world's doom.

"If it were me, I would have taken my family and fled. Since they have enough power to do so."

"Who knows."

The security captain felt the same way.

"How could we understand?"

Rian, who had been lying on the Slayer's back lost in thought, raised his head and asked Shirone.

"You're going to the Ivory Tower, right?"

"Yeah. I need to check the world situation. If another disaster like Argantis appears somewhere..."

"Hell's army is heading to the central continent."

The meaning in his words was clear.

"Amy is there too."

"We defeated Amon, but an army of 40 million is still threatening enough. How about we go if possible?"

"I want to go."

It was his honest feeling.

"I want to see Amy right now."

"Then go and see her. No matter what happens, I'll protect her. Amy and your families too."

"If I were just one weak soldier, I couldn't even think such thoughts. The reason they fight is simply to survive. Furthermore, to protect their families."

"You can do that too."

"Then we can't win the war."

That was the problem.

"If a commander leads an army based on personal emotions, it's annihilation. Moreover, this is a fight where humanity's lives are at stake. The moment we act on emotions, everyone dies."

He certainly understood it logically, but...

"I don't want you to have regrets."

Shirone smiled.

"Are you worried about what Uorin said?"

Rian clicked his tongue.

"That you can't beat Nane? Forget that nonsense. If he shows up this time, I'll split him in half myself."

"It won't be easy."

At the unexpected answer, Rian asked with a serious face.

"What do you think?"

"I think..."

Shirone recalled his conversation with Uorin.

"I can't beat Nane?"

"That's right. You should know, Shirone," Uorin had said.

"Nane is almost right, and evil is almost everything. In quality and quantity, good and love were never a match to begin with."

They were fighting an impossible battle.

"What good and love have accomplished is barely preventing the world from ending. But if Nane returns, it will be the true birth of Buddha."

"Then it will be perfect truth, the only righteousness."

"Even so, that's no reason for me to love you."

Uorin had pointed to her own eyes.

"Among the bloodline of Theraze, I have a unique foresight. The reason I knelt before Havitz was because I felt death from him."

It wasn't like magic.

"In a box mixed with blue and red marbles, you roughly guess what will come out. When I looked at Havitz, he was a life where only blue marbles endlessly came out."

The extreme of probability.

"But for a moment, something felt different. The emotion I felt was definitely a red marble. Probably because of you. If I had died to Havitz, Havitz would have died to you too."

The war could have ended.

"Still, I chose to live. In the same context, my foresight tells me. You have no choice but to come to me."

"What the hell..."

"Shall I tell you the only way to avoid it?"

Shirone closed his mouth.

"Meet Amy. Abandon humanity and the world, and find happiness with the person you love. Until Nane closes the world."

"You're telling me to give up?"

Surprisingly, Uorin nodded.

"Because you can't win. When Nane returns, nothing will be reversible then."

Coming out of his recollection, Shirone said.

"I can't win. No one can win."

Rian's face contorted.

"Why are you being so unlike yourself? You blocked him when you fought Nane before. You can do it this time too."

"No. The reason I rejected Uorin's words isn't because I can stop Nane."

"Then?"

"Because I believe he cannot return."

"Hmm."

"If Nane becomes Buddha, we definitely lose. But he can't become one. He sympathizes with the world of emptiness but will never plant his heart there."

"What if he does plant it?"

Shirone thought for a moment.

"Then I wouldn't be able to destroy it."

"...Mysterious, this thing called law."

"Right. If you think Nane will return, you can't do anything. What we need to do is eliminate evil."

They had to prevent the situation where Hell's Ten Great Corps Commanders would open the demon realm again.

'Hell's army advancing to the central continent has lost its corps commander. We definitely need to go to a more intense battlefield.'

Since Shirone would have the hardest time of anyone, Rian didn't push further.

"Huh?"

Suddenly Shirone turned his head, and Rian, sensing something strange, jumped up.

In an instant, he drew his great sword and climbed onto the Slayer's head, seeing space distorting before his eyes.

"What is it?"

From within the space that was crumpling like a whirlpool around a single point, one woman appeared.

"Shirone."

"Huh?"

Shirone's eyes widened.

"Seong-eum?"

Jin Seong-eum, the princess of the Zhenchen Empire who had competed with him as an Ivory Tower candidate, stood there with a stern expression.

Though her face was more haggard than before due to the war with demons, her strong spirit remained unchanged.

After bowing her head to Rian in greeting, she approached Shirone and said.

"Sorry for suddenly visiting. I was on my way back from the Ivory Tower. They said you'd be here."

"Why the Ivory Tower?"

Tears welled up in her eyes as she bit her lip.

But soon she showed a strong expression and bowed flat before Shirone.

"Please help us! Save Zhenchen!"

Shirone and Rian looked at each other.

"All troops standby!"

Following the commander's orders, the flag bearers' responses echoed.

Hell's army, which had reached the three-nation border faster than expected, was approaching from 2 kilometers away.

RUMBLE! RUMBLE! RUMBLE!

The ground shook, and black dots rose from beyond the horizon like they were in zero gravity, covering the sky.

"Huff! Huff! Huff!"

The sound of the front-line infantry taking deep breaths could be heard even by Amy, who was hundreds of meters away.

'They're coming.'

Even with 40 million, they couldn't control the entire border, so she thought they could deal with them strategically.

But the scene unfolding before her eyes was so overwhelming that such thoughts vanished.

"Kahahaha! Humans! It's humans!"

Demons of various heights, forms, and characteristics dominated the earth, letting out terrible roars.

"All troops!"

The commander's order came down.

"Advance!"

As tens of thousands of people surged forward like a tidal wave, Amy's battalion also moved.

"Support the infantry!"

When 200 members of three battalions cast military-style teleportation, sharp flashes of light shot out.

'We need to suppress their momentum with firepower.'

The key to magical attacks by regular magic units, not special forces, isn't power.

A unit's capability is determined by how long they can pour consistent firepower into an accurate range.

"Sector 32! Firepower level 10!"

Following the brigade commander's instructions, fire magic blazed in the mages' hands.

Just as Amy raised her right hand to give the battalion the magic casting command.

"Aaahhhhh!"

The infantry unit in front was instantly crushed as massive demons pushed through.

'They broke through already?'

Estimating the number of deaths upon impact, she gritted her teeth and swung her hand.

"Fire!"

When hundreds of fire magic spells fell to the ground, massive flames instantly shot up.

"Kraaahhh!"

The demons melted in disgusting forms, but enemies kept pushing in endlessly.

"Retreat! Retreat!"

At the dire news that came in just a few minutes after the war began, Amy felt dizzy.

"Damn! It's over! We're going to die!"

Screams erupted from all directions.

"Stay calm! The forces just concentrated on our side! We were just unlucky!"

Therefore, some units would be better off than here.

"Support units will come soon! The balance of power is supposed to be maintained! Just hold on a little longer!"

The advantage of magic units was that they had higher mental endurance than regular infantry.

Amy's battalion calmly fired magic while retreating without being swayed by the battle situation.

After being pushed back 300 meters, friendly flags finally fluttered from all directions.

"Here! Hold the position here! Sector 4! That water formation..."

"Battalion Commander!"

When she turned her head at the voice, a demon with bull horns was running toward them with a huge axe.

"Kuhahaha! War is fun after all!"

Seeing it emit terrifying purple demonic energy, she instinctively knew it was corps commander level.

'Damn! So that's why!'

She understood why they were so helplessly breached.

"Battalion Commander! Please dodge!"

If they had drawn the worst card in the lottery anyway, even retreating immediately would mean annihilation.

'That's war.'

Amy dismounted and lowered her stance, concentrating her mind.

'Fire Seal!'

The flames that rose from her body shot up to the sky and transformed into the fire giant Ifrit.

"Wh-what is that?"

It was magic that even her subordinates were encountering for the first time.

The Ifrit, crouched low at the waist, placed its thick arms on either side of Amy and glared forward.

"Come at me."

Red light flickered in its large eyes.
