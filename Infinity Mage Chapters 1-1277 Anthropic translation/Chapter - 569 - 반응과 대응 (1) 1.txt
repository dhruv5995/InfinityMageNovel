[569] Reaction and Response (1)

Alpheas Magic School. Third Logistics Warehouse.

The six members of Shirone's team, who had risen before dawn, gathered at the entrance to the site where Estas could be seen.

Though senior year evaluations were underway, with pride at stake plus personal rewards and penalties on the line, none had chosen to be absent.

"Everyone must be anxious, but let's focus on the match for now."

Their resolve was already set.

"The match period is seven days. If we clash for today, we should be able to roughly gauge our capabilities. Let's think about what comes after once we get there."

When Nade's opening remarks ended, Amy asked.

"Strategy?"

Iruki spoke up.

"Controlling six allies while responding to six opponents' reactions is impossible. For now, it's reconnaissance. However, we absolutely cannot let them steal our Master Cards."

Shirone added.

"Since we agreed that going out of bounds also counts as forfeiting, make sure to keep a solid check on the battlefield boundaries."

Sabina asked.

"Still, shouldn't we decide on the first scramble? Black, white, or random, I mean."

Shirone said.

"The allied team will all choose random. Even if we grab good (○) in the first stage, if the opponent also grabs good, it's a draw. Conversely, if we pick evil (●), we'll be in a disadvantageous position for two hours."

Dorothy added.

"From the second round onward, we need to think about team combinations too. Even opening two random cards (RR), the probability of getting evil (●●) is one in four. So since we're six people, at least one of us should be able to draw evil."

Shirone summarized.

"The most important thing early on will be not missing scrambles. Depending on coordinates, we could be at a disadvantage."

"I can know the opponents' positions."

When Dorothy deployed her Spirit Zone, Iruki asked.

"You're a Zoner, right? How far can you extend it?"

"If I completely drop the density, the maximum range is one kilometer in diameter. But I can only barely distinguish between humans and non-living objects."

Even as a Zoner, she was a Manipulation type, and precision of the zone was prioritized over size in that field.

"For reference, when I manipulate Hickory, my Spirit Zone is roughly fifty meters in diameter. I thought I should let you know in advance."

This meant that without precision enough to compress from one kilometer diameter to fifty meters, she couldn't manipulate Hickory.

Dorothy, switching to sniper mode, began rotating her linear Spirit Zone to locate enemies.

Unlike Amy, who rotated dozens of times per second, it took a full twenty minutes just to survey 360 degrees.

However, changing a one-kilometer diameter Spirit Zone into a linear form was impossible unless you were a Zoner.

'The allied team has Sona's Hersy. Their reconnaissance has to be faster than ours.'

While Iruki was lost in thought, Dorothy spoke.

"Six people are gathered at a point seven kilometers to the east."

"Then let's go in the opposite direction. We absolutely must collect the first scramble. The more test subjects, the better."

"How do we track each other's positions?"

"Scrambles are summoned every two hours, and if we check the status of collected cards, we should be able to know approximate positions."

Sabina smacked her lips.

'It would have been nice if Dante had participated too.'

Having a communication mage would be ideal, but wanting everything when you're not Cage-level was a luxury.

"Alright. Then let's depart."

As all six cast spatial movement simultaneously, the flashes gathered in the sky scattered in all directions.

Scramble Royale standby time: 10 minutes.

'About three minutes left, I suppose.'

Shirone, having arrived at the starting coordinates, calmed his anxious heart while performing sequence formulas.

Since he might need to use Shining Instantaneous Thousand Hands from the beginning, it was better to advance the sequence formula to some degree.

'The primary goal is collecting the nearest scramble. But depending on circumstances, I might have to run long distances.'

Then Lulu's voice pierced his mind as an electrical signal.

"Scramble Royale has commenced."

Shirone's eyes flashed brightly.

Gripping the Master Card that had appeared and swiping the screen with his thumb, coordinates appeared recorded on the display.

Exactly twelve coordinates were recorded in XYZ format.

After visualizing a virtual map and quickly inputting the twelve coordinates, Shirone extracted an image and confirmed the nearest location's coordinates.

'X-271, Y-373, Z-8. That's toward the ninth training ground.'

Once the destination was set, his body moved automatically while the information input in his head began to be gradually analyzed.

'The shape of a circle slightly distorted on the right. But the distribution is close to average values.'

He couldn't guarantee whether scrambles would be summoned in fair positions in subsequent rounds either.

However, if there were specific rules, Iruki should be able to find the equation after about three days.

After checking his Master Card, Shirone's eyes widened when he saw that nearly two coordinates had disappeared simultaneously.

'Already collected?'

Arriving at the safest landing point for spatial movement, Shirone checked his Master Card again while running toward the coordinates.

'Five.'

Out of twelve, five coordinates had already vanished.

'It hasn't even been five minutes yet. Is this what they call the human touch of probability?'

Swiping the screen showed Iruki, Amy, Hersy, and Anchal's status displaying R (Random Card) markers.

'As expected, everyone chose random.'

Confirming another coordinate had disappeared meanwhile, his anxiety peaked.

"Damn it!"

Kicking off the ground and leaping, Shirone cast teleportation, sending intense flashes curving through the dense forest.

"This concludes the morning interpersonal combat evaluation. Everyone enjoy lunch and see you in the afternoon."

Binder raised his hand.

"What happens to today's interpersonal combat absentees?"

Though a prodigy with a perfect 100 in theory scores, he had currently dropped to 26th place due to this year's formidable senior class competitors.

Especially since today's interpersonal combat opponent was the powerful Anchal, he was in a state of near surrender.

Department head teacher Collie entered the interpersonal combat training ground and said.

"If absent until afternoon, it's a forfeit."

Several students' eyes lit up with hope.

'Please don't come.'

A whopping eleven students were absent from the morning evaluation. At this rate, most students would gain three points through default victories.

"Fermi, do you know anything?"

When Collie asked, Fermi merely shrugged.

"Why are you asking me that?"

Though Collie knew that two members of the Golden Wheel were absent, he was helpless when met with feigned ignorance.

'Anyway, participation in senior evaluations is the students' freedom. In cases like this, it would be recorded as absent in the report, but...'

"Maybe they ate something wrong yesterday? Perhaps they all got stomach trouble, hehehe."

Alchemy's Richard laughed while shrugging his shoulders.

"Go eat lunch."

Saying that, Collie turned and headed toward the principal's office.

'Scramble Royale, huh.'

"Found it."

Shirone discovered a fist-sized, glowing scramble hanging on a tree at the training ground's outskirts.

'The remaining coordinates are...'

After the initial rapid disappearance of coordinates, collection had been sluggish, with four coordinates still remaining.

'If I collect this, three left. Initially, I choose random. But before that, what I need to confirm is...'

Grasping the sphere of light, it transformed into a pure card.

After collecting a scramble, transfer to other participants becomes impossible.

Shirone shouted in his mind.

'Random!'

There was no particular reaction, and following existing rules, after one second passed, it converted to a random card.

"As expected, it doesn't work."

It seemed impossible to arbitrarily choose random while in pure card state.

Actually, it automatically converts just by holding it, but this was an important issue for Shirone.

If he could arbitrarily select random cards, he could use Shining Instantaneous Thousand Hands to revert them back to pure state.

'That's confirmed. Next is returning open cards to random state.'

Just as he was rapidly building up sequence formulas to demonstrate Shining Instantaneous Thousand Hands, a voice echoed in his mind.

"All scrambles have been collected and destroyed. 1 hour, 38 minutes, 12 seconds remain until the next summoning."

Shirone postponed his experiment and checked his Master Card.

"Phew, thank goodness."

All team members had obtained one card each, and as promised beforehand, everyone had chosen random.

Next, Shirone checked the allied team's collection status.

'As expected, they also chose ran... Huh?'

Though five names all showed R markers beside them, only Eden's name was recorded with ○ (White Card).

'He chose white. Strongest in stage one. But won't it reverse after an hour and thirty minutes?'

One thought suddenly struck him.

'Could it be...?'

Before his thought could finish, rustling bushes revealed someone's presence.

"Finally found you."

Murderous intent lit up in Shirone's eyes as well.

"Caiden."

Caiden of the Cross Star was dragging his family's weapon, the Cross Sword.

Having clearly obtained a scramble quickly and searched only for Shirone, he approached while scraping the ground with his sword tip.

"Looks like you chose random. My card is random too."

Even with the same random, the precarious one was Shirone, who hadn't opened yet.

'Caiden would have opened immediately upon collection. There's no reason to maintain a random card.'

However, Shirone had procedures remaining to test Shining Instantaneous Thousand Hands, creating a slight delay.

'Should I open now? But then I'd have to wait over an hour for the next experiment. If I take a hit in this state, what happens to open cards?'

Would they automatically open, or would it be a crushing defeat?

Perhaps that too could become another experiment, he thought, when unexpected words came from Caiden.

"Do you think I'm going to call a win?"

"..."

"It's just the first card anyway. No real meaning. That's why I sought you out. I can beat you up regardless of the hand."

Caiden raised his sword and pointed it at Shirone.

"Let's have you take some hits first."

The reason Shirone gladly rose to Caiden's provocation was because he too was equally angry.

"I told you, didn't I?"

Caiden carefully observed the Photon Cannons floating around Shirone, his nose bridge gradually contorting.

Even at a glance, the photons' compression force was incomparable to before.

"If you interfere with me, I won't forgive you."

The Photon Cannons transformed into flashes and shot forward, while Caiden dodged right, trailing afterimages.

'Incredibly fast. Is that a schema?'

It was difficult to track with his eyes Caiden's movement as he circled the training ground as if rails were laid on the ground.

"Uwaaaaah!"

The Cross Sword swept in recklessly, but each trajectory was certainly lethal.

'Flash!'

Struck by the barrier of light, Caiden gritted his teeth and raised his head.

Sixteen red dots were already marked on his face.

"Homing Photon Cannon."

"Grk!"

Though Caiden ran with swallow-like swift movements from the curving flashes, he couldn't escape the seeker's pursuit.

"Shirone...!"

As he stopped sliding across the ground and gritted his teeth, red energy rose and condensed into a cross shape.

What could be obtained in exchange for sacrificing fate was the supreme talent to reach one's purpose.

"Shironeee!"

As Caiden shouted and swung his sword, the Homing Photon Cannons bounced away in all directions with clanging sounds.

Each deflection pushed his legs back a meter, and after deflecting all sixteen, his position was twenty meters further than initially.

"Graaaah!"

Caiden, his face completely contorted as he endured the shock, glared fiercely at Shirone.

'Monstrous power. So this is Photon Cannon.'

Though the Cross Sword's blade reflected light, the impact of the striking mass felt like his finger joints were being crushed.

'How dare someone like you with Maya...! My muse!'

Recalling Maya's face, Caiden showed the whites of his eyes and gripped his sword fiercely again.

"I'll kill you!"
