The Infinite (3)

"What should we do?"

Iruki's words carried the premise that their suspicions might be correct.

"First, we need to understand the full situation." Not making hasty value judgments about a single incident was a mage's disposition.

"It could be completely different depending on perspective. If they were trapped here against their will and couldn't endure the hunger..." Nade asked.

"Then it's not a sin?"

"Well, there would need to be social consensus on that... I'm just saying that a starving creature eating something is natural."

Iruki said.

"A cold world."

"Yeah. There's only one thing I want to know from them. Whether the standard for this act is law or conscience."

At the chilling tone in Shirone's voice, his friends fell silent.

"Let's go. If they're still here, it means there's no exit."

"What if they're doing this even though there is an exit?"

Shirone took a long breath.

"...Let's hear them out."

Rejecting the delusions that endlessly filled his mind, Shirone stepped into the deep darkness.

The path gradually narrowed until they reached the end, where a large space opened up.

As his eyes hurt from someone's torch, Shirone deactivated his infrared vision.

"Are you the village chief?"

Though he'd resolved not to judge, his tone was rough.

It was because of the old man's unnaturally clear eyes and the smell of blood emanating from him.

"I am the chief of Kashiram. Where did you come from?"

Nade said.

"Where from? We came from outside. If you don't explain the tragedy that occurred in the village..."

Before he could finish, the chief prostrated himself flat.

"Please save us!"

As Shirone's group looked on in bewilderment, he jerked his head up and sobbed.

"We... we never thought we could live. The entrance suddenly collapsed. That woman did it. We were all deceived. Ah, we should have listened to Rabika."

According to the letter, Rabika seemed to be the only sane person in the village.

"Where is she now? Is she alive?"

The chief shook his head.

"I was foolish. I only came to my senses after we lost our way out. We tried our best to escape, but it was futile. We lost lives one by one."

Iruki asked.

"How many survivors?"

"Including myself and these friends, seven in total. When we first came in, there were over a hundred."

Shirone's expression turned grim.

"Seven out of a hundred? How long have you been here for so many to perish?"

"I don't know. What day is today? It's nothing but darkness here. We formed search parties to find an exit, but they never returned."

The chief bowed his head again.

"Please! We beg you... tell us where the exit is!"

"Let's go to the survivors first."

As Shirone stepped forward, the chief could finally identify the owner of the voice.

"Huh?"

They were much younger than expected, and none of them even carried weapons.

"How did you get here without even fire... no, is there really an exit?"

Nade snapped.

"Of course there is, or we wouldn't be here. Just guide us quickly."

The startled chief looked back at the men behind him, then moved toward a side path.

The men turned around, and Shirone didn't miss the bloodstained club one of them carried.

Following the side path, they came to a small room with people's clothes layered on the floor.

When the chief entered with the strangers, three people who had been waiting in the room stood up abruptly.

A woman in her mid-forties and what appeared to be her young son and daughter.

'A woman and children.'

If the survivors had been only strong men, the scales of suspicion would have tipped further.

"Chief, who are these people?"

"Greet them. These are people who came from outside to save us. Now we can live."

The woman's eyes wavered momentarily, then she covered her face as if overwhelmed with emotion.

"Really... can we really get out? Dear God, you were watching over us."

"We'll have to hear the story first."

Iruki said.

"We found a letter in the village. Did you kill Rabika's child?"

"Absolutely not!"

The chief held out both hands.

"At first, we intended to. We were deceived by that evil woman's temptation. Actually, the village was on the brink of destruction. From one day, animals and plants started dying, and the water we drew from the mountain caused diarrhea and vomiting when we drank it. Then that woman came to the village. She said we had to offer a sacrifice to God. A child. The only child in the village was Rabika's."

Having explained the situation as briefly as possible, he changed his expression and continued.

"But we came to our senses. The cave entrance collapsed, and we realized we'd been deceived. Probably all the villagers who didn't come are dead. That woman is a witch. She definitely took the child too."

"I see."

Memorizing what he'd heard, Shirone asked.

"Then tell us what happened here. The reason you could survive here for over three weeks - wasn't it because there were sacrifices somehow?"

"Well, that's...!"

Shirone cut off the chief's words.

"I'm not trying to blame you. It's just that they were fellow villagers too - how did they become sacrifices?"

The chief looked at the woman, then spoke in a sad voice.

"At first, we tried to endure. We resolved again and again that people shouldn't act this way. We gradually grew exhausted, and one person died. It was the oldest person in our village."

He didn't particularly want to ask for names.

"That's when an agreement was reached. At least I think so. No one spoke up first, but we were so starving and hungry..."

Nade remained unmoved.

"What happened next?"

"The first time is the hardest. Why were there so many victims? At that time, there were still over ninety mouths to feed. One corpse wasn't enough. It even led to fighting over the scraps. It was pandemonium, and we eventually decided to draw lots. And that's how... that's how we survived to this point."

In the silence that followed, Shirone asked again.

"Drawing lots?"

"Yes, that's how we survived. In case you misunderstand, I drew lots too. These children will testify to that."

The girl said.

"It's true. Brother, please save us. It's too hard, we can't endure anymore."

Entrusting one's life to probability was the same as entrusting it to law.

'In a cold world, there is no sin.'

Because God is indifferent.

'If no manipulation was involved, and if what they're saying is true...'

Shirone asked again.

"Where are the victims' bodies? There should at least be remains, right?"

"Ah, that's..."

When the chief became noticeably flustered, Nade, who had been waiting for an opportunity, barked.

"Speak up! Where did you hide them?"

At that moment, the man with the club glared menacingly and stepped forward.

Having eaten well and being naturally strong, the threats from youngsters barely past twenty seemed trivial.

"Stop that. Aren't these young men who came to save us?"

The reason the chief stopped the man was due to a question that wouldn't leave his mind.

'Just how did they get in?'

Having no concept of infrared vision, he couldn't possibly know Shirone's group's true identity.

"I apologize. We put the remains in a distant place. It was too frightening to keep them nearby..."

The boy burst into tears.

"Please let us go. We want to get out quickly. Please?"

"It was almost perfect."

As Shirone stepped forward, the crying stopped abruptly and the chief and men backed away.

'What?'

Looking at Shirone's eyes gave them the feeling of an invisible sword piercing their hearts.

'Just like...'

Just like when they first saw that woman.

"Wh-what do you mean? Perfect. Are you saying we lied? If so, we can show you the remains right now."

"No, I've already seen them."

Shirone's Spirit Zone was synesthetically sweeping the entire mountain beyond the cave.

"I prayed there would be some reason. That there would be some reason for hiding the survivors down there too..."

The chief's gaze moved sideways.

'How did he know?'

The villagers who had been backing away whenever Shirone moved were now pressed against the wall.

"There's only one thing that puzzles me. That you, who committed such atrocious acts, left this woman and children alive."

"Th-that was out of pity..."

Shirone's gaze sharply glared at the children.

"Who are you people?"

Before he finished speaking, the man with the club charged at Shirone.

"Dieeeee!"

At the same moment, Nade slipped into the man's embrace and drove an electric shock into his ribs.

"Aaaaah!"

The man whose whole body convulsed rolled his eyes back and collapsed, while the chief fled shouting.

"Stop them!"

"Kiiiii!"

Their true nature revealed, their eyes were insane, but they were no match anyway.

Two were knocked down by Photon Cannon, and the woman, putting the children in front, shouted.

"Kill them! They're bad people!"

The children each grabbed knives and charged, but Shirone's gaze didn't waver.

His judgment was already complete.

"...Photon Cannon."

As the children hit directly by the flash were thrown to the woman's left and right, she collapsed to her knees.

"What are you people?"

Nade approached with electricity wrapping around his arm.

"You're the one who should reveal your identity. Better to speak obediently. I'm a really scary person."

The woman who had been avoiding his gaze suddenly stuck out her tongue and bit down hard with her teeth.

Shirone's group just watched.

Realizing her mistake, the woman drew a dagger and shouted with blood streaming from her mouth.

"Just leave me alone!"

She pierced her own heart in one strike, then fell to the ground with a suffocated expression.

"She's dead."

Iruki, who had examined the woman, turned his head.

"Let's chase the chief. We need to save the survivors first."

Shirone, casting Shining magic, ran quickly through the cave bright as daylight.

Descending an almost vertical pit, they saw iron bars where survivors were trapped.

About twenty people were imprisoned, and among them, a young woman gripped the bars and asked.

"Who are you?"

Seeing her normal eyes, Shirone was certain.

"Rabika."

After a momentarily shocked expression, she quickly regained her composure and shouted.

"Catch the chief! You must kill him before that woman comes! He's a demon!"

With Nade and Iruki guarding the rear, Shirone walked down a side passage.

"Hehe. Hehehehe."

An ominous laughter heard even before turning the corner, and a disgusting smell.

A curse escaped Nade's mouth.

"Bastard."

The chief, buried among over twenty corpses, raised both arms with an ecstatic expression.

Long things were hanging all over them.

"Welcome to God's holy ground."
