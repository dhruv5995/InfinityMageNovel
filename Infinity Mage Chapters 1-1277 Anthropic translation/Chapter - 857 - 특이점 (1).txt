Singularity (1)

How much time had passed?

The woman who had been nursing pushed Habitz's shoulder away gently and said.

"It hurts. Stop drinking now."

Habitz's face as he slowly pulled away was drenched in cold sweat.

"Haah."

The taste of breast milk was sweet yet fishy, but Habitz's mind was completely empty.

What filled the 10-minute void that didn't even remain in his memory was the thrill that peace brought.

'This is the beginning.'

The woman's breast milk seemed to contain every type of pleasure that humanity had ever created.

"Do you want to become a baby?"

At the woman's question, Habitz raised his head.

'What is it that I want to become?'

The world gave him various names, but in reality, there was no defined sense of self in his own mind.

Only tangled thoughts, and the pleasure that occasionally shot through the variations of those thoughts—that was all.

"Waaah. Waaah."

Habitz made the crying sounds of a baby.

The sight of him acting out innocence with a dry face was chilling in its extreme artificiality.

'This is chaos.'

Like an aborted baby.

A vague form that, despite never actually being born, lives on as a child in the parents' memories.

'A point where all contradictions are compressed without resolution.'

Natasha understood Habitz.

'The anguish of discovering two children drowning at the same time—if that emotion were amplified infinitely, would it become Habitz?'

And now she had awakened.

"Waaah. Waaah."

Having realized that he could become nothing, Habitz defined himself as that very thing.

'I am Satan.'

* * *

A village 17 kilometers from Habitz.

In the village that demons had first swept through and bandits had pillaged, the breathing of those waiting for death could be heard.

"Ugh."

A woman with her left leg severed, bleeding profusely, was crawling across the ground with difficulty.

"My baby."

Where she reached her hand, a young child pierced by an arrow lay collapsed.

"Mommy, it hurts."

Tears welled up in the woman's eyes, and Nane and Shura were there watching this tragic scene.

"It's okay, my baby."

Stroking her child's head, she said.

"When you die..."

She tried to grit her teeth and hold back her sorrow, but she couldn't suppress the devastation.

"When you die, everything will be okay."

As Nane pressed his lips tightly together, the heart-wrenching scream of the woman echoed through the air.

"Aaahhh! Aaahhh!"

The woman who had been screaming beside her dying child eventually died from excessive blood loss.

Nane slowly closed his eyes and pressed his palms together.

"May you find peace in paradise."

Shura said.

"Let's go back. We're not going to fight the demons anyway."

When Nane, who had been hiding in the mountains cultivating himself, suddenly suggested going out into the world, it had been puzzling.

"No. There's nothing more I can do sitting still. Let's look around the world a bit more."

"What are you guys?"

A massive shadow approached from the pitch-black darkness.

They were demons who had broken away from their group during the war, each bearing injuries.

Shura took a fighting stance.

"Back off, unless you want to die."

"Kekeke, ridiculous. Do you think we'd be scared just because the spirit realm is closed?"

Nane asked.

"The spirit realm is... closed?"

Since it had only been a day, Nane hadn't heard the rumors about Sung Eum.

"Lowlifes like you don't need to know. Just quietly become targets for our frustration."

Nane had no interest in the demons.

"So the spirit realm is closed."

Even when he had opened the altar, he had thought humans would easily be swept away by the Great Purification.

'Humans are strong.'

Getting beaten by Gaold was one thing, but he had indeed taken the world too lightly.

"Go back. From now on, live in repentance instead of committing evil acts."

The demons looked at each other.

"Puhahaha! What are you saying right now? Are you crazy?"

"Telling demons not to commit evil? A mere human like you preaching to us..."

The demons' faces froze simultaneously.

"Ah, aahhh..."

Shura, who turned around with a pale face, saw the shimmering heat waves of light burning from Nane's body.

"Bu... Buddha..."

It wasn't that he hadn't realized it.

Nane could become Buddha again and destroy the world whenever he wanted.

"I told you to go back."

The moment Nane's eyes opened wide, the demons scattered in all directions without even having time to scream.

As the enemies disappeared, the energy that seemed ready to tear the world apart vanished like a lie.

"Master, why do you hold back?"

"It's not time yet."

Because the world doesn't change just because one achieves enlightenment.

"Universal love that loves and sympathizes even with demons—Shirone. I want to understand his thinking a little more."

If there was no wavering in Buddha's perspective even when viewing the world from the realm of universal love.

'Then it becomes truly right.'

Nane turned to Shura and said.

"One extreme cannot support the whole. Shirone must be thinking the same thing as me."

All those who had been asserting themselves from their respective extremes were passing through a singularity.

'After going around in that circle... whatever happens, it will end.'

The morning sun rose.

The Jincheon army that had entered Gustav through Gwangcheonseong's spatial distortion was stunned by the scene that unfolded before their eyes.

"What on earth is this..."

Demon corpses were piled up everywhere they could see.

"Did some disaster strike?"

All the buildings were collapsed as if a natural disaster had swept through.

"This is Yahweh's power. Perhaps we didn't even need to step forward."

The Five Dragon General realized a new fact.

'The Princess.'

Though Jincheon's morale had risen through Sung Eum's sacrifice, what she had truly wanted to rely on was Shirone.

'So she wanted to spend one day with him...'

His eyes reddened.

"No, we can't just stay like this. This is the opportunity that the most noble person in Jincheon created for us. We must win."

Jincheon's army advanced toward the capital again.

From far beyond the horizon, screams of demons were coming over like a downpour.

Shirone was no longer running.

'If Nane had closed the world... Sung Eum wouldn't have had to fall into hell and suffer eternally.'

'Because I thought I could endure it...'

He had thought others could endure it too.

'I'm the one who doesn't know suffering.'

If he saved the world with the spirit of universal love, everyone would be happy, but Sung Eum couldn't return.

'I'll destroy it.'

With Shirone at the center as he moved forward, blinding waves of light spread endlessly.

God's particles that had reached near-light speed swept away everything around them.

"Aaahhh! Run away!"

The demons occupying Pamelion, a city near the capital, scattered in all directions.

Though they were beings who regarded Yahweh with contempt, they were screaming in terror before the current Shirone.

"Run! Ru..."

Time seemed to slow down almost to a stop.

"...n... a...way..."

Behind the demons filling the landscape, light particles pierced infinitely.

Before explosions could even occur, the massive bodies scattered like dust, followed by sweeping shockwaves.

Kukukukukukuku!

Like a flood bursting forth, light filled every street of the city, sweeping everything away.

"My, how frightening."

In a situation where no one could look back, there was only one being watching Shirone.

She had jet-black hair flowing down to her waist, and her face was pure as an angel's.

Commander of Hell's Army 2nd Corps, Melania.

"Yahweh is very angry."

Even the light particles striking at speeds too fast to react couldn't come near her vicinity.

"What should we do, Commander? At this rate, we'll all die, won't we?"

A low-ranking demon with no particular rank was clinging close to her side.

"Leave it be. When gentle ones get angry, you have to coax and soothe them until their anger subsides."

That's why she saw meaning even in the death of tens of millions of demons.

"But what if the anger doesn't subside?"

Even in Melania's opinion, Shirone's rage was terrifying enough to end the world.

"Then, well..."

Her lips curved up slightly.

"I suppose I'll have to go and apologize myself."

"Hurry and run!"

Ryan, who had surrounded the imperial castle Marsak, cut down demons while evacuating people.

'Shirone won't care about humans.'

Without that level of resolve, he couldn't give up Yahweh.

'It's not that I treat life as trivial.'

Compared to Sung Eum trapped in eternal hell, death would rather be a relief.

"Go! Quickly!"

As Ryan cut down the demons, civilians living in the capital screamed and fled.

'There are too many people.'

He had been fighting for over 12 hours through the night, but there were still many who hadn't left.

Kwaaaaang!

In the battlefield filled with all kinds of screams, a particularly grating explosive sound reached his ears.

At the clearly attention-seeking noise, Ryan turned his head to see a giant black-haired figure standing there.

The madness of the man wearing a bizarre smile made Ryan's breath catch.

"Brother?"

Though his previous upright appearance had disappeared, Augent's distinctive features still remained.

"Long time no see, Ryan."

Eldest son Augent Gai.

Facing his older brother who had left home long ago without even sending word, Ryan lowered his great sword.

"Brother... how are you here?"

Shirone hadn't mentioned Gai.

"As you can see, I've gotten ahead in life."

Just as Ryan couldn't properly understand the situation, demons charged from behind Gai.

"There he is! Kill...!"

Without even turning around, Gai's single sword stroke split dozens of demons in half.

'Tremendous swift sword.'

Augent's sword style was honest, so even when the genius swordsman Rai was struck, it left no bitter aftertaste.

But Gai's strike had a violent quality added to it, as if cut with a saw rather than a sword.

"How did you end up like this? Have you been living as a spy here all this time?"

"A spy?"

Gai shrugged his shoulders.

"As you can see, I'm Gustav's supreme commander. Though Hell's army is outside my authority."

Gai walked steadily toward Ryan, who wore a confused expression.

"How is the family?"

He couldn't answer.

"Is grandfather healthy? Rai was always exceptional, and as for Reina, I wonder if that tough girl will ever be able to get married."

"Brother, I..."

Before he could finish speaking, Gai approached and raised his sword high before plunging it into the ground.

"My cute little brother."

Then he spread his arms wide, roughly pulled Ryan into an embrace, and rubbed his furry cheek against him.

"I missed you."

They were family.

"Brother."

Ryan dropped his great sword and embraced Gai in return.

"I missed you too. What happened to make things like this? Come back with me. The family is waiting too."

Gai, who had grasped Ryan's shoulders, pulled away.

"You've grown up well. You used to not even reach my waist, but now you're almost as tall as me."

Ryan spoke again with a desperate expression.

"Brother, let's go back."

Gai smiled and shook his head.

"I can't do that."

"Why? Why not? Whatever you've done, the family can bear it together."

"It's not because of guilt. If I had any of that left, I wouldn't have made it this far."

"Then what is it?"

"The ultimate sword. I threw away everything to reach that point. And Ryan..."

Killing intent rose from Gai's body.

"You're the same."

Gai grabbed the sword stuck in the ground and swung it at Ryan's neck.

'He's serious.'

Ryan ducked and immediately picked up his fallen great sword, swinging it upward.

"Whoa there."

Gai, who had created distance, smiled with his eyes and said.

"Good reaction. That's right. Even if I'm your brother, if you read killing intent, you should respond like that."

"I'm also a knight. If it's going to be like this, I have no choice but to fight."

"I know. Knight of Maha. They say you're incredibly strong."

As Ryan watched silently, the scenery surrounding Gai began to distort.

"What is this...?"

"That's right, my foolish little brother."

Gai's eyes blazed with madness as he spoke.

"You're not the only one who carries the bloodline of Augent Smile."
