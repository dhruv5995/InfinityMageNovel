[617] The Day of the Final Battle (1)

The faces of the 30 graduating students who had left the capital and arrived at Creas via magic circle were triumphant.

"Did you see the Royal Academy kids' faces? They looked like they'd eaten shit. That's what they get for picking a fight when they can't even break even."

"I didn't realize it just from the numbers, but now I can clearly see the difference in skill level."

"It's because we worked so hard."

Competing with students of the highest caliber had a way of unconsciously drawing out one's potential beyond its limits.

"Still, I'm glad we won something before the graduation exam. It's giving me confidence somehow."

The competition was fierce, but the skills they'd built up through hard work weren't going anywhere.

While each student spoke with confidence, the expression of Colli, who was leading them, gradually darkened.

It was already past midnight when they arrived at Alpheas Magic School, meaning the graduation exam was tomorrow.

"Sleep well. See you in the morning."

As the students dispersed after roll call, Colli spoke up.

"Could you spare me a moment?"

The students turned back with puzzled expressions.

In all the years they'd taken graduation exams under Colli, this was a first.

When the students gathered around regardless of their formations, Colli gestured for them to sit comfortably.

"I'm sorry to bother you at such a sensitive time, but there's something I absolutely must say today."

"Don't say that! You've worked so hard for us all year, teacher."

A kind smile formed on Colli's lips, who had always been stern.

"You are all those who have steadily built up your skills from the lower classes to reach this position."

The students' eyes lit up as they focused.

"That means there's no one here who dislikes competition or is just casually attending school thinking they might try being a mage."

The graduating class wasn't one you could reach with a complacent attitude.

"So at this point, I want to ask you something."

Colli struggled until the very end before speaking.

"Couldn't you give up on becoming mages now?"

In the silence, the students had countless thoughts.

They too were human beings who knew fear and felt pain when things were difficult.

"Watching your brilliant performance today, I wondered what I was doing. The most important thing in the world is happiness. Are these children really happy? Fighting every day, competing, being envious and jealous. Do they really want to become mages so badly that they'd go that far?"

For the first time in his teaching career, he revealed his true feelings.

"Competition is a pyramid built with human blood and flesh. The only thing needed to build that pyramid is the bodies of the losers. Only by stepping on them, stepping on them, stepping on them can one person reach the top."

Only 10 out of 30 people could pass.

"Even if you pass, it's not the end. The wretchedness of the losers needed to climb higher will increase exponentially. That's why I'm saying this. The position at the top is so brilliant and splendid, but the probability of you being in that position is far too slim. Don't just try to win - couldn't you seek happiness instead?"

No one spoke, but the students' eyes burned more intensely than ever.

'Right, the word 'give up' doesn't exist in your dictionary.'

If they were the type who needed pity, they never could have made it this far in the first place.

'I should retire too.'

The very fact that he'd spoken such weak words as the head teacher managing the iron rules of the graduating class was proof that he was getting old.

"If you still won't give up..."

These were words he could say because he'd watched the entire year's process with his own eyes.

"Fight and win! Without blood, tears, or pity! Don't show mercy - trample your friends and climb up!"

If becoming a mage was their only happiness.

"You must become mages!"

"Yes!"

The students' voices echoed through the night sky.

The next morning.

For the first time in a year, a day of doing nothing had arrived.

Some students woke up a bit later to recover their condition, while others found themselves waking earlier than usual.

"Ahhhh."

Among the 30 students who had gotten up, Nade was probably the only one who could stretch lazily.

'I'm hungry. Are they giving us breakfast today too?'

Now that it was only a day away, the one thing he was certain of was that the most refreshing thing would be to just throw away the mage certification.

"Hm?"

While washing his face and drying it with a towel, he noticed a letter that had slipped under his door.

"What's this?"

Nade's face crumpled as he checked the sender with the towel draped over his shoulder.

The West Family.

Though Nade had thrown it away as if he'd touched something horrible, he eventually picked up the letter again and tore open the envelope.

What had he been expecting?

No, even though the situation he'd definitely been expecting had come to pass, anger surged up from his heart beyond control.

"Wicked woman!"

Nade tore the letter to shreds.

"What face does she have to come here now!"

It was his mother, who had never shown any interest in whether her son had talent or not, only constantly going on about money.

'But she's coming to observe the graduation exam?'

She was trying to devour everything Nade had built up until now at the cost of pain and despair.

'Actually, this works out well. I'll crush her hopes. I'll drop out as soon as the exam starts. No, I'll die! Right in front of her!'

"Nade, are you in there?"

At Shirone's voice, Nade quickly fixed his expression, pushed the letter fragments under his bed, and opened the door.

"Yeah. Come in."

Iruki was with him too.

"How are you feeling? The exam is tomorrow."

"Of course I'm thrilled beyond words. But what's up? I was about to head out. Aren't they serving breakfast today?"

"They are. Before that, I wanted you to try this too."

Shirone pulled out a paper from his chest.

"Iruki and I made a bet. Guessing 1st through 10th place in the graduation exam. The winner buys dinner."

The paper had Shirone and Iruki's predicted rankings written on it, and of course, each had their own name in first place.

"Ah, so the winner treats everyone."

"You should participate too. It'll help you renew your resolve."

"Hmm, 1st through 10th place."

After considering it briefly, Nade realized that if his name wasn't written down, Shirone and Iruki would notice.

"I don't want to do it. I feel like it would just add more pressure."

This was why Shirone had suggested it.

"Nade, don't tell me..."

"Haha! Don't worry. I can't stay at school alone while you guys graduate. I need to stop by the bathroom first. Go ahead to the cafeteria. My stomach hurts."

Shirone sighed and turned around.

"Alright. Let's talk later."

Nade watched his friends leave intently, then called out to Iruki just before the door closed.

"Iruki."

"Yeah?"

"Make sure Shirone doesn't get hurt..."

"No. You do it. I don't know what you're thinking, but if you disappoint Shirone, I won't associate with you either."

"Iruki..."

"I don't care if you drop out. One less competitor isn't bad for me. But do you realize? If you beat Shirone, you'll be first in the kingdom. You'll gain wealth and fame. What's your reason for acting like this?"

He could gain wealth and fame.

So would his father, who had squandered the family fortune and wandered gambling halls, and his mother, who never acknowledged his talent.

"Think rationally. Consider what would help your life. If you're consumed by hatred, you can't do anything."

Nade smiled bitterly and put on an act.

"Haha! What kind of joke is that? Honestly, how could I beat Shirone? Shirone is so strong."

"Are you serious?"

When Iruki became serious, Nade's smile stiffened.

"Do you really think that? That even if you gave it your all, you could never win?"

"Iruki, I just want to have fun with Shirone..."

"Answer clearly right now. If you backstab us later, I won't let it slide."

Nade hung his head low.

"See, you think you're stronger. Then fight. Both Shirone and I have worked our hardest. If you act like this, you're disrespecting our efforts."

"Iruki, what are you doing? Let's go quickly."

Shirone's voice came from the corridor.

"I'll give you a definite answer."

Nade raised his head as if he'd made up his mind.

"Shirone is stronger than me. I will never fight against Shirone."

"...See you at the cafeteria."

Iruki closed the door.

After eating breakfast, Shirone parted from his friends and strolled through the garden.

A year ago on this day, he had passed through the steel gate to meet Amy and Ceriel.

But now that he was the protagonist, he finally understood how nervous they must have been at the time.

'It feels like there's a lump of metal in my chest.'

Amy, facing her second exam this year, must be fighting even more desperately against the tension.

'Second-year students have the lowest pass rate.'

Since it was an exam that required everything, even the cafeteria situation could be analyzed.

Two people out of 30 had skipped breakfast: Richard from Alchemy and Amy.

'Richard can consume other things instead of food, but...'

The fact that Amy didn't come to the cafeteria likely meant her tension had hit its peak.

'Should I go see her?'

Shirone shook his head.

When he needed to raise his concentration to the maximum, worrying about a friend was impossible.

"But..."

Amy wasn't just a friend.

Amy tried not to attach special meaning to skipping breakfast.

Having worked her hardest and achieved far greater growth than last year, there was nothing to be nervous about.

'Focus. Let me focus.'

After washing up and sitting on her bed in a refreshed mood, she calmly closed her eyes and drew up her concentration.

'I need to feel the self-image memory more precisely.'

The competition rate for the graduating class was the highest in the school's history, and one small mistake would make another year go to waste.

"Hup!"

Amy covered her mouth and ran to the bathroom, burying her face in the toilet as gastric acid completely reversed.

"Ugh! Ugghhh!"

Though nothing came out, her stomach churned, and all the anxiety she'd been suppressing exploded at once.

Failure. Failure.

Only bad thoughts came to mind.

'Get it together, you idiot! It's over if you get nervous!'

"Amy, are you in there?"

At Shirone's voice, Amy turned her head but couldn't bring herself to open the door, asking instead.

"Yeah. What's wrong?"

"You didn't eat breakfast either, so I was worried."

"Hah..."

She should have gone to the cafeteria after all.

When the door opened and Shirone saw Amy's pale face, he spoke with a surprised expression.

"You really aren't well."

"Haha! It's not like that. I just threw up."

"..."

Realizing her mistake, Amy averted her gaze.

"My stomach was upset. It's nothing serious, so don't worry about it."

When Shirone's foot crossed the threshold, Amy sat down on the bed as if giving up.

"Honestly, I'm a complete mess. I don't know why I'm like this."

"I understand completely. I would have been nervous too."

Only after hearing those words did Amy remember that Shirone was also facing an exam.

"Sorry. For making you worry too."

"What are you talking about? We're not just friends..."

Though he didn't say it out loud, it was a fact they both already knew.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have come all the way here before the most important exam of his life.

'Come to think of it, he really has waited for me a long time.'

She remembered last winter at the Snow Crystal inn, when she had turned away from Shirone's feelings.

"May I sit down?"

The future was uncertain, but this question was definitely presenting another possibility.

With that thought, her heart pounded as if it would burst.

"Yes."

A shy voice leaked from between Amy's lips.
