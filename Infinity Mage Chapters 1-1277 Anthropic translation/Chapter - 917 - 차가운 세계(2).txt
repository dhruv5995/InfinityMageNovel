Cold World (2)

Before the final operation conducted with humanity's survival at stake, even a king's reputation held no importance.

'The personnel needed to open the flower garden - myself, Flu, and Dante are sufficient.'

That's how he obtained the right to choose 100 people.

"I can give you one hour. Please select 100 people within that time."

Many thoughts crossed his mind.

Kings, politicians, doctors, teachers, families, the impoverished who lived ostracized from society.

In the end, they all carried the same weight.

"Guild Master, please start first." When no one took action, Iruki put down his pen and pushed it forward.

"General Commander of the Valkyries."

Lupist leaned back and crossed his legs.

"Though it wouldn't be wrong to say you're at the very top of the sky, you sure look down on people."

Iruki remained calm.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean there's no need for me to step in either. Let's leave the decision to this friend."

When Lupist pointed to Dante, Flu and Iruki's gazes turned sideways.

Dante, who had been lost in thought, looked up and spoke.

"Iruki, honestly, I feel sick."

No answer came.

"Fine. Since the Guild Master has given the order, I have no choice but to make this difficult decision."

Contrary to his words, Dante didn't even glance at the pen and spread both arms wide.

"There's no one. No one worth saving."

Finally, a smile appeared on Iruki's face.

"We're dropping bombs on the capital. It'll be a massacre of 6.5 million people. If I save 100 people, that information will spread to a thousand, and those thousand will spread it to ten thousand...

The operation will fail.

"It'll spiral into an uncontrollable situation. You were testing whether we're prepared to destroy the capital or not, weren't you?"

Everyone must die.

Precious people, necessary people - no one in Bashka can survive.

"That's right. I'm sorry."

Dante snorted.

"A stubborn guy like you pulling such childish tricks. You must be pretty cornered yourself."

"To tell the truth, yes. I'm going to be the ringleader of this insane massacre. If I'm destined to go down in history as a demon, I at least don't want to fail."

Knowing what burden Iruki carried, Dante didn't press further.

"But seriously, there are no security issues? A project of this scale - we can't be the only ones who know about it."

"It's at a precarious level."

Iruki admitted readily.

"As you probably guess, not everyone dies. The lives of tycoons who invested heavily in this project and officials from related organizations are guaranteed. We'll at least save the subjects' children."

"Children, huh. That's vague. From a husband's perspective, you could save wife and children but not the parents."

"They're not foolish enough to be greedy. They know better than anyone what happens in such cases."

They would disappear without a trace.

"Should I call it fortunate? We organized assassination squads for contingencies, but haven't moved them yet."

Iruki raised his index finger.

"Rather, the ones we had to especially monitor were the unmarried. Some people hastily married to save their lovers, but the Holy War tolerated even that."

Lupist asked.

"How many people got involved that way?"

"286."

Dante rested his chin on his hand and muttered.

"286 people."

From his judgment as an expert in security and intelligence, this was an absolutely uncontrollable number.

Iruki said.

"I know what you're thinking. That's why we're monitoring through countless channels ourselves. One of them is a censorship system we pride ourselves on being the world's best."

'Mairei.'

Through Armin, Dante knew that the Great Purifier's ears were in the Holy War.

"We're monitoring 24 hours a day. And the number of cases caught by the Holy War's filter so far is..."

Iruki smiled bitterly.

"Not a single one."

"Not one?"

"Right. We couldn't even find Code Zero - that is, compulsive suspicion level factors. Therefore, from the Holy War's standpoint, we can assert that none of the 286 survival targets leaked any information."

"Heh. Heheheh."

Lupist hunched his shoulders and lowered his head.

"Perfect."

Usually they'd be dying to spill even the smallest secret.

'Facing the horrific event of 6.5 million people being massacred...

No one opens their mouth.

In front of parents, in front of friends, they're acting out their daily lives pretending nothing's wrong.

'Ah, humanity.'

Lupist's expression, splitting at the corners of his mouth, was indistinguishable between laughing and crying.

"Very well."

As if by magic, his expression disappeared.

"We're in no different position from them. The conclusion is 6.5 million people die. The question is efficiency versus sacrifice - can you definitely annihilate the demon race?"

"By my calculations, if the strategy works, hell's army will suffer 91.3 percent troop losses."

It was sufficient results.

"Good. Then we'll abandon Bashka, and we can just choose a new king..." 

To Lupist, even kings were merely top-grade parts for running the system called a nation.

"How will you compensate for Tormia's losses after the war? With the capital gone, self-recovery will be impossible."

They'd be devoured by other nations in an instant.

"The Holy War will bear the full cost of reconstruction. Once a government is established, implement immigration policies. If you provide houses and land, many will flock there."

Lupist squinted one eye.

"Sounds like a pipe dream. Even the Holy War would have to collect funds from other nations - do you think the leaders of each country will comply obediently?"

"On top of that, I'll hand over all technology and materials related to elemental bombs to Tormia."

Lupist's eyes flashed momentarily.

"Even with related industries, only I know the core technology. You can use it to check other nations or as a negotiation card. Most importantly, I'm from the Kingdom of Tormia. I won't let my country perish."

The last words moved Lupist.

'Well, Iruki's family is included in those 6.5 million too.'

Unless he was insane, he'd sell his soul until death to take responsibility.

"Very well. We'll follow the Holy War's will. Once detailed strategies are issued, I'll transfer all usage rights to the flower garden."

Iruki turned to Dante.

"Time is too short to explain verbally. I'll issue orders through the 'rope'. Since Dante is the general commander, it's the safest method."

As Lupist nodded and stood up, Flu and Dante followed toward the door.

At the door, Dante turned around.

"What would have happened if we had written down and submitted 100 names?"

"...You wouldn't have made it out alive."

"In other words, you were looking down on us quite a bit. Did you think it was possible?"

Iruki evaded the answer like a snake.

"Anyway, you didn't write any."

Dante let out a bitter laugh.

He felt like a psychopath for being able to laugh after hearing about Bashka's terrible future.

It was that unrealistic, but...

'For you, Iruki, it's reality.'

The face of Iruki that Dante saw was no longer that of a living person.

'You were an annoying bastard.'

The guy who had gotten on his nerves since Royal Magic School days was now half a corpse.

"Take care of yourself. You'll really die at this rate."

Unable to answer yes to words he couldn't agree with, Iruki just smiled weakly with his eyes.

"Dante."

At the calling voice, Dante turned around again.

"Yeah?"

"When the war ends..."

Even speaking a single word seemed cautious, and Iruki's eyes looked so lonely.

"Let's have a drink together."

Though Dante felt tears welling up and his throat tightening...

"...Yeah."

He had no choice but to answer.

To avoid being caught with reddened eyes, Dante immediately opened the door and left the room.

'Stupid bastard! What kind of hero does he think he is?'

As Dante quickly moved away, Flu naturally lengthened his stride to catch up.

'Now the battlefield has moved to Tormia. The Association will take the front lines. I need to assess Zion's factors.'

But his thoughts were brief - reading the emotion in Dante's eyes, he kept his mouth shut.

'He's a rational person, but...'

It was tremendous rage.

'Damn it! Those dog-like demons! I'll kill them all!'

Seeing blood flowing from Dante's fist, Flu ultimately asked nothing.

The Hwa族's hideout.

Lupist had made some kind of deal with Plarino in exchange for receiving the seeds of life flowers.

He rescued 300 suffering kinsmen from around the world and provided them with a safe haven.

Plarino, who had once been Spectrum's Defense Minister, now lived as an ordinary Hwa족 woman.

"Hello, Ms. Plarino."

A man of Grass bloodline looked at Plarino with a plain smile and bowed his head.

"Yes, good morning."

The bloodline of Violet Tiara, said to be the most beautiful and fragrant among the Hwa족, shone even brighter under the sun.

"The sunlight is really sweet today. On days like this, it's best to go to the 'garden' and just sit quietly."

Plarino covered her mouth and laughed.

"That's right. There's nothing better than receiving sunlight without thinking about anything. Would you like to go together?"

"Haha, of course."

Plarino spread both arms while looking at sunlight filtering through tree branches.

"I love this place so much. There's no one trying to harm us, and most of all, it's quiet."

"It's all thanks to you, Ms. Plarino. Everyone gathered here is grateful."

"Oh no, that's not true. I also..."

Plarino's pupils shook as she saw figures approaching from afar while waving her hands dismissively.

"What's wrong?"

Where Plarino's gaze was directed, Lupist and Dante could be seen walking side by side.

"Lupist..."

Plarino's body trembled.

"So you were here. Perfect timing."

Lupist approached Plarino with large strides and cut straight to the point.

"Where's your chieftain? Guide me."

The deal was already finished, and Lupist had promised not to interfere with the Hwa족's lives.

"Wh-what's this about?"

"No time to explain. It's urgent. We need to use the Small World Creation ability."

Plarino shouted.

"You promised! We already handed over all the life flower seeds! We just want to live peacefully!"

"Peace?"

Lupist grabbed Plarino's collar, pulled her close forcefully, and brought his face near hers.

"Look at me. Look straight into my eyes."

The Hwa족 man fell on his bottom with a thud, and Plarino's jaw trembled.

"Do I look sane to you right now? What do you think I came here for? Want everyone to die?"

"Huu... huuuu..."

The Hwa족's characteristic 'extreme passivity' manifested, and her mind went blank.

'How can someone have such eyes?'

They were the eyes of one at the apex of animals, who could do anything to achieve what they wanted.

"Last chance. Guide me to the chieftain."

Plarino's head dropped powerlessly.

"...Yes."

If asked what the scariest thing in the world was, her answer would undoubtedly be humans.
