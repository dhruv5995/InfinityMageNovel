[724] Face Off (1)

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 283.

Shirone suddenly realized. 'Immortal Function.' The answer to the problem he had been pondering for days was seeping through the circuit of insight. Expanding his mind infinitely to open this world was the only way to break Andre's seal. 'But... why must it be so?' How was this different from taking his own life? "We are! Working hard! Today too!" Worker ants emitting cheerful pheromones were lined up to the edge of his vision, carrying food. At Queen Garnet's suggestion, Shirone was also moving along, carrying the flesh of dead insects. "Shirone, isn't working enjoyable?" A worker ant overtaking the line looked back at the contemplative Shirone while releasing pheromones. "Yeah, of course." Shirone smiled while wiping his sweat. "It's not good to be absorbed only in thought. When you fall into thoughts within thoughts, you lose what's truly important." "What's truly important? What is that?" "Well, perhaps the reason for thinking?" "......" When Shirone stopped walking and blinked, the worker ant also brushed off dirt and continued. "When you actually face any situation, you realize it's completely different from what you thought. Sometimes not thinking is the right answer." 'Thoughts within thoughts......' The nature imprinted in the genes of these small creatures contained their own definition of emptiness.

Garnet Colony is not complicated.

The Queen's words echoed in his mind.

"Thank you for your hard work today!" After finishing his daily tasks and arriving at Garnet Colony, Shirone washed himself at the water storage. Though uncommon for ants who communicated through pheromones, Shirone was human. 'I worked hard, so using a little should be fine.' After cleaning off the dirt and descending underground into the colony, noble ants were occupying the passageway. They were all male ants, filled with hostility toward Shirone who rested in the princess ants' quarters. "Will you move aside?" As Shirone advanced, he could feel through his skin the web of killing intent they had spread. Daren, who had made a bad first impression, blocked his path. "Think you're getting special treatment? Not a chance. You're just the princesses' plaything. The moment they get bored, you become food." Whenever he encountered wild killing intent devoid of humanity, Shirone realized where he had come to. 'They're just acting according to their nature.' Therefore, he couldn't blame them. "Move aside. I understand your feelings, but I'm a different species. I have no reason to fight with you." "Do you know this? Currently, Garnet Colony's food procurement is becoming difficult. Because the army ants have expanded their territory." "So?" Daren's jaw pointed at Shirone. "I'd like to check just how nutritious human nutrients are. That's the role of a noble, after all." Local battles were already frequent, and the nobles who had to continue their lineage were in an extremely sensitive state. 'Nothing is insignificant, but......' Shirone's life wasn't insignificant either. "Move aside. I'm the Queen's special guest. Those orders should have been given, right?" "That's during peacetime. In wartime......" Just as Daren opened his jaws like scissors, the pheromones of Thirteenth Night burst from behind the noble ants. "Stop this." Just that was enough to make the displeased male ants turn around to see Thirteenth Night emanating an ominous aura. Daren pushed through the nobles and approached. "Are you giving orders to a noble now? Think we look easy because you've been around some battlefields?" Thirteenth Night's body, victorious in today's local battle, was carved with countless wounds. "This is advice given out of concern for Lord Daren. That human is the Queen's guest, and above all, he is strong." Meaning he wasn't an opponent that nobles who had never experienced combat could handle. "Hmph! Is it because he uses the same thing as you? That means we should submit to you too." "Don't misinterpret. This is a message from Princess Merot. She said to ensure he has no discomfort during his stay." If it was conveyed by Merot, ranked first among the princesses, the nobles had no choice but to leave Shirone alone. "How nice. Why don't you hurry along and go act cute?" Following the path Daren opened and descending underground, Shirone sighed as he left the noble quarters. "Thanks. I avoided a fight because of you." Though soldiers were beings who followed nobles' orders, Thirteenth Night was an ant who had realized incarnation techniques. "The army ants' formation is ominous. The atmosphere is unsettled. Exercise restraint for the time being." After Thirteenth Night withdrew and Shirone arrived at his quarters, he received a completely different welcome from the noble quarters. "Welcome back, Shirone. Was it tough?" The princesses who instantly swarmed around Shirone lavished chatty pheromones. "How was the outside world? Were there many dead insects?" "What color was the sun? The 2837th color?" When Merot appeared, the princesses unanimously made way to the side. "You returned safely. That's a relief, Shirone." The local battle that occurred near the colony was a hot topic even among the princesses. "Army ants are different from us. Instead of minimizing the labor population, they mass-produce numerous soldier ants." Merot explained the situation on the way to his quarters. "They expand their territory by conquering colonies like that. If full-scale war breaks out, the damage will be great." Yet moving the colony wasn't an option either. "If war happens, I'll fight then too. But Shirone, you don't have to stay in the colony." The situation seemed more serious than expected. "There's no need for you to get caught up in war too. If you want to leave, leave tonight. I'll allow it." "Merot......" Ants were small creatures. At least to Shirone, who had lived in the human world, they weren't precious enough to sacrifice his life for. 'Is there such a thing as greater value in life?' Returning to his quarters, Shirone lay down with his arm as a pillow on the dirt floor, lost in thought. 'I don't want to disappear like this.' What if someone showed him an ant and told him to give up his life for it? If it were a joke, he'd be treated like a madman; if serious, he'd surely get slapped. 'No, it's not because they're ants. Nothing is more precious than one's own life. There must be another way.' The same would be true for Shirone exploring other worlds, but he would never open the Immortal Function.

How long had he been sleeping? Shirone slowly lifted his eyelids at the sound of thunder from outside. 'Is it raining?' This was the lowest level of the colony. "It's not rain!" Shirone bolted upright and pulled out his artificial brain, and massive information began transmitting. "Block them! Defend the Queen's chamber!" "Kieek! Get lost, you hideous things!" As Shirone shot up and used the momentum to rush out of his quarters, a grotesquely bizarre scene unfolded that nearly stopped his heart. 'Army ants.' They were twice as large as Garnet Colony's soldiers, and their heads were even three times bigger. Every time those powerful jaws attached to their massive heads moved in a cross pattern, ants' heads fell off. "I can't die yet! Protect me!" Under the attack of army ants who had invaded in the dead of night, all the male ants from the upper floors began fleeing. Though they usually flaunted their massive builds, the nobles were no match for the army ants' huge frames. "Where are the soldiers! Quickly protect me!" Though Daren released pheromones filled with terror, only army ants came swarming. "Die, you lowly species!" "Kuaaaaa!" Just as Daren's body, buried under army ants, was being flipped over, Thirteenth Night flew in.

Law of Earth

Ant Hell.

As Denai caught the landscape, the bodies of the army ants biting Daren were torn to shreds. "You......" Daren refused assistance with the last remaining pride of a noble, but he was already unable to move. "Shirone." Thirteenth Night looked back at Shirone. "I will protect the Queen." Since the Queen couldn't move with the colony, she was the most vulnerable existence when under attack. "Because I am Thirteenth Night." It was a happy life to have a name. "Wait! You should protect me! The Queen is already...!" Leaving Daren's pheromones behind as Thirteenth Night departed, Shirone suddenly came to his senses. "Merot!" Army ants were already roaming around the princesses' quarters, and screams could be heard from all directions. "Merot! Mero...!" When he arrived at her quarters, three army ants were pinning down Merot while strangling her. The sight of them pressing their sharp jaws against her throat as if playing made his hair stand on end. "Shirone......" Merot, spotting Shirone, opened her jaws. "Run away! Quickly run away!" At that moment, what came to Shirone's mind was. 'When you actually face any situation......'

You realize it's completely different from what you thought.

It was the pheromones of a nameless worker ant. "Run away! You can't stay here!" As Merot desperately held onto the army ants, the ant biting her throat tensed its body. "Stay still! I'll cut your neck!" Just before Merot's neck was severed, a photon cannon's flash flew over and struck the army ant's head. The companions who confirmed the fallen army ant with their antennae raised their upper bodies and shouted. "What! We never heard there was such a species...!" Before the pheromones could even be released, the army ants hit by photon cannons were slammed against the wall. 'When you look closely, all life is the same.' For beings born through endless cycles of samsara, high and low have no meaning. 'Those ants are the same.' Having realized how to stop the war, Shirone approached Merot and extended his hand. "Are you okay? Can you move?" "Shirone... what was that just now?" Though she had heard about magic, she didn't know it possessed such powerful force. "Let's go out. There's something I want to show you." There was no longer any reason to hesitate.

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 847.

"Kill them! Pay them back as much as we suffered!" Shirone's code was 427,621. Realizing there was no longer anyone with power over code names, countless citizens stormed the temple. "Damn it! Let go! You dare touch me with your 800,000 code!" Gale, who had been getting beaten with clubs, couldn't stand it and struggled, but fists flew at him relentlessly. "Shut up! What's different between you and me? You bullied me just because your rank was a bit higher!" Gale, who had harassed countless women using his high code of 9, suffered the most miserable treatment. But the resentment held by low-code residents wasn't limited to those who had directly suffered. "Kill them all! Just die, all of you!" Drain, who had once been the emperor of code names, was already lying unconscious, but the kicking didn't stop. "You're the worst one! You! You!" In a situation where even the standard of what constituted high rank had disappeared, people were simply destroying everything in sight. "Shirone, I'm scared......" Panica hid behind Shirone's back, trembling. "It's okay. I'm here." In a world where rank discrimination had disappeared, Shirone was the only being who could use power. Therefore, the residents didn't dare approach Shirone, but it had long since lost meaning. 'Humans have no such thing as rank.' There was no standard that said from here was noble and from there was lowly. "Shirone? Where are you going?" At Panica's question, Shirone smiled sadly. "Because there's no life that doesn't deserve to be saved." As if embracing the entire world, Shirone spread both arms wide and slowly closed his eyes. A single tear rolled down. 'May everyone be happy.' There was no longer any reason to hesitate.
