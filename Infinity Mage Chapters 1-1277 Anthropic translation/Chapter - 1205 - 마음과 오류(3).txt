Heart and Error (3)

Fermi had gotten a sense of who Guitaruman was, but he didn't hastily form an image.

"I heard you lost your daughter."

"It was a stupid thing to do. He really loved his daughter. There was no malice. He just... doesn't know. Because he's never properly lived in the world, he doesn't know what to do or how to do it."

Panier let out a sigh.

"After that, his wife ran off with some guy who'd been Lanstin's friend for 10 years. So how could he be in his right mind? Most guys like Lanstin are like that. They always live at a loss. Because of that pathetic artistic soul of theirs. I can't really blame his cunning friend, but honestly, is that what a human being does? Then again, maybe he did it because he was human? He was a friend who had some kind of inferiority complex toward Lanstin. I never really liked the guy."

Unlike when he was with Maya, Panier didn't hide his emotions.

"On the other hand, you liked Lanstin."

Panier, who had been silent for a moment, took out a cigarette and glanced at Fermi.

"If you don't mind..."

"Yes. Give me one too."

After lighting his cigarette, Panier looked more comfortable than before.

"I too had a time when I went around calling myself an artist. That doesn't mean it was glamorous or that I was successful. Popularity, fame - those are just illusions of show business."

Recalling those days, he smiled slightly.

"I was holed up in a tiny room, drinking cheap liquor, drawing sheet music on staff paper all day. Thinking I'd create one timeless masterpiece, heh. But I was free. People say what can you do without money, but it's actually the opposite. When you have nothing, your soul is free. You do whatever you want. Back then, I really churned out a lot of bizarre songs. Of course, nobody listened to them. But still... how should I put it."

Cigarette smoke drifted toward the ceiling.

"It was the most authentic life I ever lived."

"Do you dislike it now?"

"Of course, my life now is fine too. Didn't you see how those arrogant artists can't even move against me?"

Panier had a bitter expression.

"But just because the results are good doesn't mean you understand the cause. I started this work trying to live for art once in my life. I wanted to surprise the world. But it's not easy. I'm divorced now, but I worked for over 10 years just to support my two kids. While Lanstin was doing art, I was working."

He spread his arms wide.

"Who's better off? Of course it's me. I worked hard and protected my family. But it's also an undeniable fact that I had less courage, that I compromised with life."

Panier doesn't call himself an artist.

"...It would have been nice if things had worked out. If he had compromised just a little, if he had mixed just a bit of lies with the truth, people would have applauded. But he didn't do that. He was someone who would beg for money before he'd beg for applause."

"I see."

Fermi fell into thought.

'Kayden's escape, Maya's best effort, and Guitaruman is...

No compromise.

The picture of the future was becoming complete.

Panier asked.

"By the way, what's that guy doing these days? He doesn't seem to have released any albums."

He couldn't tell him that Guitaruman, one of the world's 100 most dangerous people, was Lanstin.

"I don't know either. That's why I came to find you. Do you have any guesses where he might be?"

"Well, there are a few places. There are places that give inspiration, after all. Anyway, if he's still holding a guitar..."

Panier took another drag of his cigarette.

"Wherever he is, he'll be living artistically."

He doesn't know the name of the city.

After leaving his hometown, everywhere was just an unfamiliar world to Guitaruman.

In a nameless inn room, he listened to the breathing sounds of a man and woman coming through the wall.

One of them was the voice of Taira Lin, Guitaruman's exclusive singer.

It wasn't that they, as two of the world's 100 most dangerous people, were prostituting themselves because they couldn't afford the inn.

It was just that there was no reason not to.

'As the mood strikes.'

As if trying to prove with their whole bodies that they didn't belong to this world.

Meanwhile, Lin was getting a bit annoyed.

"Hurry up and finish."

Despite her youthful face and small body, she was actually close to thirty.

The man who had finished asked.

"You're pretty good at this. Do you work here?"

"No."

Lin said while buttoning up her top.

"Nothing like that. I'm leaving this city after tomorrow's performance. So don't ask me anything."

"Performance? What performance?"

She handed him a ticket with the time and place written on it.

"Come if you want to."

With a dazed expression lost in thought, he tucked the ticket into his clothes and asked again.

"Were you a singer? But why are you doing this kind of work... No, more than that, is it okay for me to come?"

Lin chuckled.

"Coming and going is your freedom. I'm just going to sing there."

After collecting her fee, she left without even saying goodbye and entered the adjacent room.

"I'm back."

Guitaruman, Robe Lanstin, didn't ask anything.

"I wrote a new song."

Lin, who had placed the money on the table, plopped down on the bed and flipped through the sheet music.

"It's good."

Guitaruman played his instrument again.

They hadn't spoken for four years due to musical differences, but even after reconciling, they were still people of few words.

If the emotion disease hadn't broken out, Guitaruman would still probably keep his mouth shut.

'Single-minded. Idiot.'

Robe Lanstin was more artistically stubborn than anyone Lin knew.

"I like it."

That's actually why she follows him around.

"I'll play it for you."

Lanstin performed the sheet music he had just finished working on with his artifact <Guitaru>.

'Guitaru,' probably meaning guitar, produced the sounds of all instruments simultaneously.

Lin hummed along and sang.

Lyrics that would make listeners frown were carried by a mournful melody.

The next afternoon.

Arriving at the plaza, Lanstin and Lin paid the rental fee and borrowed a small theater for about an hour.

Since they didn't particularly need a session, preparations were quick, and quite a few people gathered.

Most were men who had made connections with Lin over the past two weeks.

"Huh?"

The only person who recognized her true identity was Kimsler, a composer who had once attended art college with her.

"Taira Lin?"

Perhaps his first love.

But even back then, students who liked Lin weren't limited by gender.

Her transcendent youth was unique, but her singing made every artist's heart race.

'She really sang well.'

He had heard rumors about why she quit school, but they were hard to believe even after hearing them.

'It was a savage society.'

It was a place that gathered all the world's unique people, so there were that many incidents and accidents.

"Hello. I'm going to sing."

After Lin's simple greeting and grabbing the microphone, Lanstin began a brilliant performance.

"Whoo!"

Watching the men whistle and cheer enthusiastically, Kimsler clicked his tongue.

As decadent and sensual lyrics began, the cheering grew even louder.

No one knew.

That everyone in the plaza could die from just her voice, just one gesture from Lanstin.

"Is that the girl?"

"That's what I'm telling you. Yesterday I..."

Hearing the audience's whispered conversations during the interlude, Kimsler's face burned.

'What is this about?'

As the lewd talk continued at length, he finally couldn't contain his anger and shouted.

"Hey, enough with the slander! What good does it do you to disparage a singer like that?"

"Who are you?"

"Do you know who that woman is? If you keep this up, you could get sued."

"Hahaha! Who is that woman? I was with that girl..."

Lin sang.

"I'm going to kiss that woman walking down 73rd Street. Will this shitty feeling disappear then? It doesn't matter now. It's not my fault I ruined it."

After hearing the whole story, Kimsler was mentally stunned.

'That can't be.'

What reason would she have to ruin her life when she has such wonderful performance skills and singing ability?

When the performance ended, the audience gathered around.

Of course, most probably remained with bad intentions, but Lin was polite to everyone.

'Don't ruin my memories.'

To think that she, who he couldn't even make eye contact with during school, was being harassed like this.

"Thank you! Thank you!"

After several jokes and instances of physical contact, Lin energetically packed up the equipment.

"Still, quite a few people came today. Right?"

Lanstin was silent.

"What? What's got you so gloomy again? Was today bad? You didn't make any mistakes."

"No, it was good."

It was just that old pain had resurfaced.

"You have good talent. If you go out into the world, everyone will probably recognize you."

Lin snorted.

"What are you saying, idiot... I left because I hate that world terribly, because it's so disgusting it makes me sick."

"Lin."

Kimsler approached.

"You're Taira Lin, right? It's me."

"Who are you?"

Lin naturally didn't remember him.

"Ah, well, we're classmates. I went to Merius Art School, composition department. I even greeted you during the performance..."

Merius Art School was a painful name for her, but she was already outside the world.

"Ah, it's been a while since I heard that name. Nice to see you. How have you been?"

Kimsler was moved by Lin's relaxed attitude, which also stemmed from his own inferiority complex.

"Yeah. I'm currently the director of the National Art Academy. I came out briefly while working on new sheet music."

Though he unconsciously spoke twisted words, Lin sincerely congratulated her classmate's success.

"Wow, that's cool. That's amazing."

"How about you? Instead of performing in places like this, want to come with me? I can introduce you around."

"Huh?"

When Lin looked at him as if asking what he meant, Kimsler opened his mouth triumphantly.

"I'm saying I'll help you. It's much better than living like this anyway. Don't you think?"

"Ah, you heard."

Lin just wants to be free.

Even though she has nothing but freedom, why do people try to take away even that freedom?

"Sorry. Today was the last performance in this city. If you come to another city, let me know. I'll entertain you then."

"Wh-what are you saying? I didn't mean it that way, I was genuinely worried about you..."

"Hoho!"

She knows the mockery and contempt hidden behind the word 'worry,' and the relief people get from it.

Lin stuck out her tongue.

"You guys are much worse than the public that treats us like clowns."

Without the courage to stake your life.

"Goodbye!"

Leaving the red-faced Kimsler behind, Lin linked arms with Lanstin and walked away.

That's how they live.

Even if everyone points fingers at them calling them pathetic, even if they despise them while wearing the mask of sympathy.

Because this is our world.

'Because we're free.'

From the place farthest from the world, they are clowns who live mocking the world like that.
