[717] Key to Liberation (1)

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 283.

The Garnet Colony that they entered following the 13th Night was a kingdom more prosperous than any human city.

The paths leading underground were tangled like a maze, and with no sunlight penetrating, nothing could be seen.

"Would it be okay if I create some light?"

When Sirone cast his Shining magic, the 13th Night tilted his head curiously but soon lost interest.

It wasn't as if there were no creatures that could produce light at all.

'The control is well-maintained.'

The chambers were enormous, and most of the ants were faithfully performing their assigned roles without slacking off.

"This way."

After passing through the spore farms where worker ants were gathered and entering below the hatching chambers, the 13th Night became noticeably tense.

"From here on is the nobles' territory. If you're not careful with your conduct, you could die."

In ant society, the nobles were the male ants—a class that never worked their entire lives and only waited for their nuptial flight.

'There really are so many of them.'

Countless noble ants were spending their time with various diversions in their respective chambers.

Some ants were tormenting captured slaves, while others had gathered masses of aphids and were throwing extravagant parties.

The 13th Night respectfully released pheromones to all of them as he advanced through the cave.

Most of the nobles paid no attention, but suddenly a noble burst through a hole in the ceiling, his magnificent wings draped like a cloak.

"What business does a soldier have here?"

"Lord Darean."

Only nobles could be granted names in the Garnet Colony, and the male ants' names ended with 'ean'.

"I've captured a new species. I'm taking it to Queen Garnet."

The 13th Night could not lie.

"You captured a new species?"

Indeed, even from Darean's perspective, Sirone's appearance was of an unconfirmed type.

"Hmm, quite an inconvenient structure."

Darean's criteria for evaluating Sirone's appearance were purely functional.

"I'll conduct an experiment. Leave this species behind and go."

The 13th Night vehemently objected.

"This one is not that kind of species. I'm sorry, but... it can use the same thing I do."

As killing intent emanated from Darean's body, Sirone felt as if all the blood in his body was freezing.

"Having luckily survived, do you think you're some special specimen?"

Most nobles viewed the 13th Night unfavorably.

First, unlike other soldiers who were distinguished by serial numbers, he had a unique name given by the queen.

He was also the only soldier ant who had been born when the Garnet Colony first opened and had survived until now.

"I apologize. But since Her Majesty has many questions about what I use..."

While no ant in the Garnet Colony could subdue the 13th Night, a coup would never occur.

This was because the nobles would mate with the princesses in place of the 13th Night, who could not reproduce, and bear numerous offspring for them.

However, since the queen's commands were absolute before the nuptial flight, Darean also swallowed his anger and pointed his antennae at Sirone.

"You'd better please Her Majesty. Otherwise, I'll tear your body apart soon enough."

Sirone's reproductive-capable body was transmitting displeasure equivalent to death to the male ants.

As Darean roughly turned his body and disappeared back into the ceiling hole, the 13th Night looked back at Sirone and said:

"I told you, didn't I? That you could die? If you want to go back, now is your last chance."

In the worst-case scenario, he might have to fight tens of thousands of ants in the deepest part of the ant nest.

"It's fine. I came in already prepared for this."

Returning alive would be quite difficult, but the place Sirone needed to return to wasn't the surface anyway.

'To return to my original world, I need to meet the queen.'

When he first fell into this place, he couldn't grasp anything, but as time passed, his thoughts became clearer.

'I think I know how to break this world's seal.'

It felt as if another version of himself from a different world was giving him hints.

"This is the royal palace."

In the deepest part of the colony, there was a massive cavity with paths extending in thirty-two directions.

Confirming that princess ants, significantly larger than other ants, were moving around every corner, the 13th Night said:

"Soldiers cannot enter Queen Garnet's chamber. To have an audience, you need permission from Princess Merot, who ranks first."

The 13th Night, who had been looking around, approached a familiar princess ant and bowed his head.

"Princess Panot, this soldier greets you respectfully."

"It's the 13th Night. It's been a while since you came here. Did something happen on the surface?"

"I've brought a new species that Her Majesty will like. Do you know where Princess Merot currently is?"

Princess Panot extended her antennae toward Sirone.

"This is the new species?"

While the nobles viewed Sirone's existence as competition, the princess's genes were filled with interest in the new species.

Regardless of reproductive capability, obtaining better genes was the supreme task of insects.

"How interesting. What are you good at? How long do you live? What do you eat? How do you reproduce? Are you strong?"

As various questions poured out, the 13th Night provided a clear answer.

"He can use the same thing I do."

"What? Really?"

Princess Panot's antennae felt around Sirone even more rapidly.

"Then you must be incredibly strong? The 13th Night is strong too. Even the Paratla army ants are no match for him."

"You flatter me."

As the 13th Night released respectful pheromones, Princess Panot turned her body.

"Good, I'll take you to my sister's room. She probably went to drink aphids with Sister Romit."

Though Panot was also interested in Sirone, there was a clear hierarchy, so it was proper to wait until Merot came.

Since the princesses weren't violent, the 13th Night also felt relieved and gestured for Sirone to follow.

"Princess Merot will take you to Her Majesty. My job ends here."

In ant society where everyone simply performs their assigned roles, the 13th Night left as if he desired nothing.

"If you wait a little, my sister will come."

Sirone looked around Princess Merot's chamber, which was surrounded by solid outer walls, then sat down in a spot where soil had accumulated.

After waiting about thirty minutes, the outside became noisy, and a massive ant appeared inside the cave.

'That's Princess Merot.'

Though he didn't know much about ants, she had a different scent from the other princesses and was surprisingly fragrant.

"A new species, I hear. It seems you've come to meet Mother."

The sound of numerous princesses gathering and whispering outside the cave was transmitted through the artificial brain interface.

'Quite a commotion.'

"Wait outside. I'll talk with him."

Merot, who had driven away her younger sisters with powerful pheromones, brought her face close to Sirone.

"So you're the new species. Nice to meet you. I'm Merot."

"Hello? I'm Sirone."

"I heard you came from the outside world. What kind of place is it? Are there many more interesting things than in the colony?"

Unlike Panot, who was interested in Sirone's biological capabilities, Merot was more interested in the world he lived in.

'She has a curious personality.'

Since conversing with an ant was also interesting, Sirone told her about the human world.

"Hmm, so you use tools."

Merot, who had been caressing Sirone's fingers, nodded.

"That's right. Your appendages are quite specific in function."

Merot, who had checked from his fingers to his wrist, arms, and torso with her antennae, looked up at the Shining magic.

"So this is what's called magic."

Merot, who inserted her antennae into the sphere of light, released ecstatic pheromones.

"...It feels good. This is the first time I've touched light."

Her wariness was rapidly disappearing, which was conveyed through the Ultima System.

"What a truly unique species. I'd like to visit your world too."

From a human perspective, ants are beings included in the world, but from the opposite standpoint, the scale was far too vast.

'Perhaps humans are the same way.'

Sirone felt his heart warming at the sight of Merot forming intimacy with a new species.

'Nothing is insignificant.'

We simply don't try to look closely.

"Oh?"

Sirone hastily caught aphid droplets falling from under Merot's chin.

"Is something stuck there? Let me wipe it off for you."

"Huh?"

When he brushed down the tangled fur under her chin, Merot trembled as if electrocuted.

"It was aphids. There, all done now."

"......"

Merot, who hadn't moved for a while, slowly turned her body and went outside the entrance.

"Where are you going? What about Her Majesty?"

At her disappearing without listening, Sirone tilted his head and muttered.

"Why is she acting like that?"

When Merot came out of the chamber, numerous princess ants swarmed around her.

"Sister, did something happen?"

The younger sisters were startled when they realized an enormous amount of pheromones were being released from Merot's antennae.

"Did the new species say something bad to you?"

"The human, no... Sirone..."

Merot whispered with a small amount of pheromones as if too embarrassed to reveal it.

"He touched under my chin."

"Whaaaaat!"

The horrified princesses stamped their feet.

"Pervert! Worse than a dead maggot corpse! How could he do such a barbaric thing!"

When the artificial brain interface reacted violently to the signals from outside, Sirone came out of the chamber and asked:

"What's wrong? What did I do wrong?"

Simultaneously, numerous princess ants who had flinched at his shoulders quickly scattered in all directions, stamping their feet.

Pheromones were released continuously among them.

"Did you hear? He touched Sister Merot's... that place."

"Her chin, under her chin? Good heavens! How can such a shameless species exist? More barbaric than army ants."

Feeling their reproachful atmosphere, Sirone approached a nearby princess ant and asked:

"Did I make some mistake? You have to tell me so I know."

No ant answered him; they simply whispered among themselves and gossiped about Sirone.

"The worst pervert. Like a moth shell. How could he touch a princess's chin... underneath. I really can't stand it."

Sirone felt wronged by the pouring criticism.

"So what exactly is so important about under the chin?"

"Kyaaaah!"

The princesses released pheromones of shock and scattered in confused movements.

"Did you just hear that? That human said it so blatantly!"

In an instant, the area in front of Merot's chamber became completely empty, leaving Sirone with a dumbfounded expression.

"...What just happened?"

Merot, who remained in place, approached with her head drooping as if sighing.

"The place you touched is a very important part for us. It's directly connected to our lives, but it also serves as a sign of permission during nuptial flight. Princesses never let anyone touch that... place unless they permit it. Not even among fellow princesses."

"Uh, so that means..."

Sirone's face turned pale as he rolled his eyes.

"I'm sorry! I really didn't know! I just saw aphids stuck in the fur and tried to wipe your chin..."

"Enough!"

Merot hastily cut off Sirone's words, patted his shoulder, and changed direction.

"It's fine since you didn't know. I was just flustered because it was my first time too. Follow me. I'll let you meet Mother."

"Okay. I'm sorry."

Sirone, considerate of Merot, followed her and arrived at the colony's core facility.

"Mother, there's a species I'd like to introduce to you. It's a human. His name is Sirone."

Sirone looked up admiringly at the massive queen ant that reached the ceiling of the ant nest.

'That ant is...'

The pinnacle of the colony system that controlled hundreds of thousands of ants—Garnet.
