[715] What Do You Gain? (4)

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 1.

Having no idea what was about to unfold, Shirone spoke to Mitochondrial Eve.

"Even if you're not the you that I know, I'll never regret it. So let's do our best to live."

With a Karr value of over 90 percent, there was no lingering attachment to decisions already made.

"Uga. Ugagaga."

Mitochondrial Eve's blocked voice was interpreted through the Ultima System.

"I don't know. I might not be."

Without desperately raising her brain function, she still couldn't properly speak language.

Therefore, even she couldn't guarantee who would be the protagonist of the underlying events that would unfold.

"It's okay. You'll definitely become the empress someday."

Mitochondrial Eve quietly withdrew her body and turned her head as if embarrassed.

"Am I ugly?"

However, there was nothing specific he could say in response to this type of question.

"Uh, well..."

"I know. You came from a different era. I can tell. And I also know what I need to do from now on."

Mitochondrial Eve took Shirone's hand.

"I'll help you. How to get back."

He didn't know what the other world was like, but it was true that obtaining information in the primitive age was limited and felt overwhelming.

'Still, I'm fortunate. There's someone I can communicate with.'

Just as he smiled and grasped Mitochondrial Eve's hand in return, screams of humans could be heard from outside the cave.

"Kyaaaah!"

It was the voices of those who had fled earlier.

"What's that?"

"Kraaaang!"

At the dragon's roar, Mitochondrial Eve leaped into Shirone's embrace.

"They... found me."

The moment her words ended, the dragon's face filled the entire cave entrance.

It had a long snout covered in blue scales, and electricity flowed through its vertically slit amber pupils.

'It's different from other dragons.'

While its ferocity was beyond measure, the overwhelming presence different from the wild carried a bit more dignity.

"There you are."

The moment the electric gaze targeted Mitochondrial Eve, Shirone suddenly realized.

'Perhaps...'

This Mitochondrial Eve might not have been destined to die here from the beginning.

"And you?"

The dragon's face, upon discovering Shirone, lost all emotion and gave off a distinctly inanimate feeling.

"Kraaaaaaah!"

The cave shook from the thunderous roar.

"Kraang! Kraang!"

The dragon's roar wasn't singular, and like an echo without sonic loss, it struck his mind consecutively.

"Krgh!"

Against the violence inflicted by sound, Shirone gritted his teeth and pulled Mitochondrial Eve deeper into his embrace.

"Come out, human from another world."

Honestly, he didn't want to go out.

"If you refuse, I'll shoot lightning breath into the cave. You won't be able to avoid it. That's not what you want, is it?"

"Let's go."

Holding each other's hands tightly, they walked out of the cave, and the dragon's face quietly moved aside.

'One mountain after another.'

Though he had even considered combat as a last resort, hundreds of dragons were already dominating the sky.

'Even so, this is too much.'

Even in reality, the dragon population was known to exceed a thousand, but it was rare for two or more to travel together.

"Submit. Our Core is coming."

As the lightning-wielding dragon said this and flew up, a massive shadow rolled in from the distant horizon.

"That's not a shadow."

It was covered in black scales, with a body so massive that the other dragons' forms looked small in comparison.

Kuuuuuuung!

The ground rumbled from the impact of landing, and a dragon with a neck roughly 20 meters long raised high looked down at the distant ground below.

"Human from another world..."

As the power contained in the voice was transmitted through the Ultima System, Shirone's body trembled.

The power of language from this dragon was on a different dimension from all the dragons he had met so far, containing an aura that could overwhelm all things.

"I am Karatorsa, the Gradeless Dragon. Why do you disturb the world's information?"

"No way..."

Gradeless Dragon Karatorsa.

In the world where Shirone lived, this was the king of dragons, existing only as a legend in mythology.

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 847.

"Divine authority?"

Codename 97 Panica told Shirone about the things he was curious about on the way to the temple.

"Yeah. Rankings are divided based on how suitable you are for divine authority, and codes are engraved on foreheads."

"Then are there duplicates? For example, if I were number 50, there might already be someone who's number 50, right?"

"You, number 50? Hahaha!"

Panica burst into laughter and covered her mouth.

"Sorry. It was such an absurd example. Anyway, if that happened, everyone behind you would be pushed back by one rank."

"So it's not like a tattoo. The code, I mean."

Panica pointed to her clear forehead.

"Of course not. This is a mark engraved directly by god. That's why rankers show their foreheads. It's a symbol of dominance."

The hairstyle with bangs cut along the forehead line looked ridiculous, but it was a natural trend under this city's system.

"So you can use authority according to your ranking?"

"Yeah. The higher you are, the better authority you get. Below 400,000 have no authority at all, but just getting into the 300,000 range gives you power amplification so you can easily lift heavy rocks."

If physical strength differed according to ranking, it made sense why no regime overthrow had occurred so far.

"In the 200,000 range, you can handle elements. Create fire or freeze water. In the 100,000 range, you can use two elements simultaneously."

Imagining the endlessly rising pyramid of abilities, Shirone understood why people were frightened when they saw number 97.

"Then rankers are..."

"Ranks 1 to 100. People who use what's called the ultimate authority, 'Divine Knowledge.' Like me."

Panica demonstrated directly.

"Basically, rankers handle all abilities up to rank 101, but one special thing is added. My authority is 'Conceptual Objects.'"

An apple appeared in Panica's hand.

"The ability to create objects from thoughts."

When Panica offered it as if to taste, Shirone took a bite of the apple with suspicious eyes.

'It really is an apple?'

"I can make anything I want. Gems, weapons, even explosive materials. But as time passes, they get a bit stale. So lately I've been obsessed with shopping."

It was natural for people to be surprised when a ranker appeared in a middle-class neighborhood.

'Strange. Really strange.'

The ability called authority was different from the magic Shirone knew, even from irregular formulas.

There might certainly be plant mages who could create apples, but achieving everything just by thinking was only possible for gods.

'Is there really a god? Or perhaps...'

Thinking of one possibility, when they arrived at the temple, the city's upper classes were strolling around.

"Everyone above rank 500 spends time here. Anyone can come, but naturally..."

It was a place where those with low rankings might face unknown consequences if they loitered around.

Numbers 467, 311, and 109 were visible, and a man with the astonishingly high ranking of 37 was leisurely reading a newspaper.

"Hey, Panica. Who's that, your boyfriend?"

In front of the temple entrance, a sharp-featured man with only short-cut bangs and long side hair approached.

'Number 9...'

He was 9th place among over 400,000 people.

"That's Codename 9, Gale. You should be careful of that guy."

Gale approached Panica and glanced at Shirone.

"What's with this guy's hair? Isn't he a ranker? Where did you pick him up? I didn't know you had such taste."

Gale never dreamed that a numberless person had come to the temple.

"What business is it of yours who I date? I'm busy, so move aside. Is Mr. Draine in the temple?"

Panica was noticeably tense.

"What's the rush? You need to punch your attendance card."

Gale grabbed Panica's chin and kissed her, causing sparks to fly in Shirone's eyes.

"Stop it! What are you doing right now...!"

Panica held out her palm to stop Shirone, and Gale spoke without removing his lips.

"Haha! Why, feeling bad? Then get revenge. Come to think of it, what number are you? Are you at least in the 100s?"

Sensing danger, Panica desperately pushed against Gale's chest.

"That's enough now! Stop it!"

"Getting pretty feisty because it's in front of your boyfriend? Want to fight? Maybe you could take the 9th spot."

The reason friendships were possible between ranks despite hierarchy being everything was due to the 'Exchange and Acquisition' system that allowed obtaining higher codes.

As you climbed to the top of the pyramid, the skill gaps weren't that large, so rankers naturally wanted to avoid conflicts among themselves.

'But not Gale.'

Still, the reason Panica had no choice but to offer her lips to Gale was because he wasn't an ordinary ranker, but a Legendary Ranker in the top 10.

Rankers up to 100th place could use the ultimate authority called 'Divine Knowledge,' but going further into the top 10 granted an additional authority called 'Divine Grace.'

'Fighting would mean certain defeat.'

No matter what, the most powerful force was ultimately the code, and Panica could only resent her fate of being targeted by Gale.

"Isn't it too much just because you have one number engraved?"

At Shirone's words, Gale turned with an incredulous expression.

"You... what did you just say?"

"I mean that number carved on your ugly forehead. Anyway, you're not number 1 either, right? Don't you think you're going too far?"

"Puahahaha!"

Gale burst into laughter.

"Right. Low guys like you wouldn't understand. Someone like Panica is receiving tremendous privileges. She's probably played around with every handsome man she's met on the street. You too."

"That's not true!"

Panica shouted with a reddened face.

"Well, that's a matter of taste, but anyway, having only 96 people above you means an incredibly comfortable life. Even people in the 10,000s live doing whatever they want. Someone like you has no right to pity Codename 97."

Is Panica unhappy?

If she was unhappy, how should the lives of the 427,000 people below 97th place be defined?

"Still, I can't accept it. Whether strong or weak, humans tormenting humans is wrong."

"Hah. Listening to this is really annoying."

Gale, who had been stroking his forehead, approached at tremendous speed and lifted Shirone's bangs.

"What number are you to act so superior... Huh?"

Confirming there was no number, Gale turned to Panica with furious eyes.

"You... dare bring a numberless person to the temple?"

"What's the commotion?"

At the voice from the temple direction, all the rankers stopped what they were doing and turned their heads.

A gentle-looking man with neatly grown bangs came down the stairs, bringing color to Panica's face.

"Mr. Draine!"

Codename 1, Draine.

The absolute ruler who was the only one in this city who didn't have to take orders from anyone.

"It's been a while, Panica. Tell me what happened."

After hearing Panica's explanation, Draine looked at Shirone and nodded.

"I see. A numberless person, that must have been troubling. Sometimes people cross over to the codename system. Follow me. God will determine your position."

Gale looked at Shirone and sneered.

"Be prepared. Once you get a code, even Mr. Draine can't interfere. Then I'll crush you miserably."

Linking arms with Shirone as they climbed the stairs, Panica came close and whispered.

"Don't worry too much. Even if you get a low number, I'll be your friend. It won't be too hard to get by."

"Yeah, thanks."

Though the number didn't particularly matter now, her words warmed his heart in this cold world of hierarchy.
