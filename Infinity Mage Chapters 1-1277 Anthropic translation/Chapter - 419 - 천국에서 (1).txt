[419] In Heaven (1)

Heaven's 6th Heaven, Jebul. The Great World War.

There is an angel with a face as transparent and beautiful as light.

With a slender body of 2 meters and 30 centimeters, and intelligence that knew all the principles of the world from birth - the pinnacle of intellect.

Among the countless angels, there are only 8 Archangels, and among them, Kariel, the Angel of Birth, who boasts the most outstanding beauty.

However, his face now was as gaunt as a sick human.

His eyes were sunken and his expression was irritable.

The benevolent and clear facial lines that had overflowed with intellectual beauty had been frequently distorting lately.

In reality, he was in a state equivalent to being ill.

If an angel's power comes from clear concepts, his current clarity was only 10% of normal.

All of this was the result of labor endured to bring one human here.

"Kariel, are you really alright?"

Uriel, the Angel of Destruction, looked worriedly at Kariel, whose very presence had grown faint.

The tallest among the Archangels at 3 meters in height with a solid body, at the center of his thick breastplate that reached down to his chin, a golden halo rotated as if in anger.

"I can still endure it. I have to endure it. This is just the beginning."

The fatigue Kariel felt, when converted to human standards, was roughly equivalent to not sleeping for 40 years.

Any living being struck by this level of fatigue would have already had all their cells wither away.

But his eyes still burned with emotion.

Uriel turned his head toward where Kariel was looking.

Below the Galaxy Mirror that governed the operation of the world, a woman beautiful by human standards sat cross-legged.

Adrias Miro.

Could there be a more abhorrent concept to the beings of Heaven?

The last bastion of humanity that interfered with the conquest of the universe, protected by a barrier that even Ankera, the incarnation of the Akashic Records, could not penetrate.

But even she had been helplessly caught by Kariel's persistence.

"You finally did it."

Just before the rebels were annihilated, Ankera suddenly canceled the war and prohibited any investigation into humans.

All angels obeyed the decree, but only Kariel did not give up and steadily continued the human extermination plan.

What he obtained through this was Miro's 'physical body' right before his eyes.

"How did you do it? Didn't you say Miro's space-time couldn't be destroyed?"

A smile appeared on Kariel's tired face.

"When I attacked Miro's space-time with Cheonpok, Optrus crossed over through the crack. Information about Miro's space-time was embedded in his electromagnetic pattern. I analyzed that."

"But Miro's space-time immediately healed. You couldn't have brought her here by breaking through the dimensional barrier, could you?"

"Dimensional barriers, in fact, have no substance. The reason Heaven's army cannot go to the earthly realm is because the protocols are different from here. It's an independent world without even quantum entanglement."

Uriel didn't try to understand.

One born for destruction had no obligation to understand the target of destruction.

"So?"

"I decoded the protocol with information obtained from Optrus. Then I transmitted Miro to the Great World War through quantum superposition."

"Hmm, and then?"

Kariel realized Uriel hadn't understood.

"To put it simply, I put my hand in a container and kept drawing until I got what I wanted. The size of the container was no exaggeration to say it was the entire universe."

Uriel understood why Kariel had weakened.

"So you searched the universe and kidnapped her."

"Well... that's exactly it."

Kariel decided to just let it pass.

"Hmm."

Uriel looked at Miro's face, lost in deep meditation.

It was the same youthful face that had single-handedly spread dimensional walls against Heaven's army just before the final war erupted.

"The human mind is, in some sense, formidable."

Currently, her mind that constituted Miro's space-time was being endlessly sucked into the dimension of emptiness.

For angels who were perfect from birth, this was an incomprehensible mental state and concept.

"Hmph, that's precisely proof of being an imperfect existence. Don't have sentimental feelings toward mere humans."

Uriel didn't respond.

For him, anything incomprehensible could simply be destroyed.

But would Kariel really be the same?

Birth was a concept established on the premise of understanding everything.

For Kariel, who handled the arts of life, being unable to understand humans might be the greatest contradiction in this universe.

"Humans are truly strange beings. Even now, one human is blocking all of Heaven's power, isn't he?"

Kariel's expression crumpled.

Humans. Humans.

Starting with Ankera, he couldn't understand why everyone applied different standards only to humans.

"That won't happen. I'll destroy them."

Uriel changed the subject. He didn't want to further provoke the mood of an angel who was like a twin born on the same day with a different concept.

"Right, so what will you do now? Even if you kill Miro, Miro's space-time won't disappear. What's the reason you brought her here while overworking your mind to the point of near extinction?"

"Hmph, naturally it's to destroy Miro's space-time. I'll pull Miro out from the dimension of emptiness. If I kill her after she regains consciousness, Miro's space-time will disappear."

It was a decent method, no, the only method.

"But we cannot understand human imperfection. Even among our subjects, there would be no human who could understand Miro's mind. The Nephilim disappeared after the Guffin erasure."

"There aren't any in Heaven, but there are some in the earthly realm."

Uriel tilted his head.

Of course, there were those in the earthly realm who spontaneously awakened as Nephilim.

But as long as Miro's space-time was blocking the way, it was impossible to bring someone from there.

"Are you planning to search the entire universe again? You might completely disappear doing that."

"There's no need for that. I don't have the strength left for it either."

Kariel flew up to the pillar-shaped central system and accessed the Akashic Records.

Uriel, who followed him up, looked at the screen from behind Kariel.

"I found something interesting while searching the Akashic Records."

When Kariel moved aside, a human's name appeared on the screen.

Reading through the explanation that followed below, Uriel nodded slowly.

"Certainly, interesting."

Coincidentally, it was a human who understood the human mind best.

No, it would be more accurate to say he had changed to his current state because he understood the human mind best.

"I'll summon this one to the Great World War."

When Kariel spread his hand, a holy light flashed and a codex was born in his palm.

The codex containing the principles of the universe had a high-strength metal hard cover, and pages made of light began turning.

The central computation system operated at full capacity, and bluish electricity flowed like waves across the floor before gathering in an arch-shaped mechanical device.

Uriel watched this for a moment before turning his head back to the central computation device's screen.

'A grave robber...'

Someone's name, existing only as a concept, was blinking.

Morrigan Arius

Rebel 1st Command.

Shirone's group received enthusiastic cheers from the rebels.

The tale of Shirone's valor in subjugating hundreds of giants with an Archangel's ability spread quickly through drones and had already become a new myth among the rebels.

In the midst of the massive white noise, Shirone's face was solemn.

Though he found it curious that the command had the number "1st" attached to it, any doubt disappeared at the scale of the rebel base, which was much larger than expected.

Dozens of buildings presumed to be military warehouses surrounded the grounds, and in the forest stood a massive building over 30 meters tall.

'Tremendous military power. If they move...'

Gaold's thoughts were different.

'It wouldn't make a damn difference.'

Of course, the command's military power was formidable.

But there was no doubt in the battalion commander's words that they had nearly been annihilated.

It wasn't a matter of asymmetric power.

From the beginning, the beings of Heaven were something different from humans.

Just as thousands of ants biting a human might kill them, but humans wouldn't let themselves be killed that way in the first place, angels were the same.

"Huh? There's Shirone over there. Hey, Shirone! It's me, me!"

A familiar face suddenly popped out from the middle of the procession.

It was Clove and Gardrak, who had guided Shirone and his friends to Nor's Shelter in Heaven a year ago.

Though the memory of Clove ignoring Amy still remained, discovering a familiar face at such a moment was welcome.

However, Shirone couldn't approach them. Countless people who heard Clove's words were all trying to rush out.

"Waaaah! It was real! Shirone really came!"

Clove and Gardrak were buried in the crowd and couldn't even be seen.

This phenomenon occurred because, aside from people from District 73, extremely few people knew Shirone's face.

Shirone backed away with a startled expression.

If he got any closer, people might get hurt.

Watching Shirone move away, Clove tore at his hair and let out a lament.

"Ugh, who knew that kid would become such an important figure? If I'd known this would happen, I should have befriended him earlier."

Gardrak smacked his disciple's head.

"Is that the problem now? We're at the point of being annihilated by angels or not."

Clove said with an aggrieved expression.

"But Master, you said so too, that if Shirone came, we could also receive good treatment here."

Gardrak was silent.

Shirone had returned. And at a very exquisite timing.

Heaven's suspension of attacks was certainly good news for the rebels, but that alone couldn't fill the deepening rift between the Mechas and Nor tribe that had grown through repeated defeats.

The command, unable to reach consensus, had finally split into 1st and 2nd Commands, and though there was no fighting, the situation was already looking grim.

At the point when everyone was just waiting for self-destruction, the light of District 73 began to shine on them again.

'Why now? Did he return knowing this?'

A series of events connected by invisible threads made it impossible to dismiss Shirone's return as mere miracle.

"Hehe, walking with oppa like this makes me so happy."

Meanwhile, Rena, who was holding onto Shirone's arm, didn't leave his side for a moment while heading to the command headquarters.

Watching Shirone's stiffly upright back, Flu clicked his tongue and said.

"What is she doing? Did she come to Heaven to date?"

Gaold didn't care either way.

"Keke, leave her be. Even that will help with the parade."

For the rebels who had been driven to near extinction, the miracle named Shirone had arrived, so a bit of staging would be fine.

But Kanya was just embarrassed by her sister's disgraceful behavior.

Unable to bear it any longer, she approached Rena and whispered in her ear.

"What are you doing right now? Let go quickly. Don't you know what Shirone means to the rebels? What if people misunderstand?"

"What misunderstanding? Shirone oppa and we aren't just ordinary acquaintances. We met after a year, can't I even link arms?"

Rena turned to look at Shirone and said.

"Oppa, let unnie link arms on the other side too."

Shirone couldn't find words to respond.

His heart was already racing - how could he walk with two women on both arms?

Kanya's face turned red as a beet.

"You, what are you saying? Why would I link arms with Shirone?"

"Oh, really. Unnie is too weak in this area. We need to look close to Shirone oppa so we can work at the command too. Unnie's Guroi was damaged too. You need to get a new Guroi supplied here to become a pilot again."

Kanya became speechless.

Though younger, her sister was more calculating in her thinking.

No, in this case, should it be called cunning?

Shirone reassured her.

"Kanya, don't worry too much. I destroyed the Guroi. I'll definitely tell the commander when I meet him."

Kanya smiled at Shirone, then narrowed her eyes and looked back at Rena.

'Ugh, that fox...'

Whether she knew her sister's feelings or not, Rena, with her arm around Shirone's, was just smiling contentedly.
