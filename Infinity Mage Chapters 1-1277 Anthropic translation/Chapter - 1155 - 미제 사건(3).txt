Unsolved Case (3)

"Nade!"

Before his friends could stop him, Nade received the bandit's longsword and deflected it to the side.

"Grk! Not bad!"

Even without special abilities, his combat instincts and experience were absolutely first-rate.

He thrust a dagger into the bandit's side and twisted it, making the bandit cry out in surprise.

"Haaaagh!"

'What a disgusting feel. This is really realistic.'

After quickly landing another blow to the abdomen, he swung the dagger upward and pierced the bandit's throat.

"Grrrr..."

Nade held on until he could feel the enemy's full weight on the handle, then stepped back.

The bandit collapsed like a broken dead tree.

"Points?"

Your current Crime Points are 58 points.

'18 points for one kill. I guess defense is also part of crime. Really inefficient.'

If he had performed the mission on civilians, he was confident he could have finished it with just 5 points.

"Cocky brats!"

At the bandit's shout, he turned his head to see Iruki and Eden dodging around a longsword.

"You're pretty good at running away!"

Iruki dodged the longsword by tumbling, sweeping the ground while completely twisting his upper body.

He whipped his right arm like a whip, and dirt smacked hard into the bandit's face.

"Argh! My eyes!"

At the same time, Eden took a running start and struck with all her might between the man's legs.

"Son of a...!"

He couldn't even scream.

The bandit's eyes rolled back as he collapsed with a thud, and Nade slashed the back of his neck.

"Points?"

Your current Crime Points are 17 points.

"What?"

He didn't know who used how many points, but it was much more consumption than killing with a blade.

Nade looked back at Eden.

"You..."

"Sorry."

Just as she stuck out her tongue and shrugged her shoulders, Shirone's voice was heard.

"Nade!"

Shirone was rolling on the ground, choking the bandit from behind.

"Grr! Get off!"

The bandit grabbed the longsword that had fallen to the ground and pointed the blade toward Shirone's face.

"Shirone!"

The moment Nade threw the dagger in his hand, his fingers curled and grabbed the handle.

Insufficient Crime Points to perform criminal act. Current Crime Points are 14 points.

'Damn!'

It seemed throwing weapons required more points.

"Die!"

Just as the bandit raised his arm above his head to thrust the longsword down, Shirone let out a battle cry.

"Hiyaaa!"

Using all his strength to twist the bandit's neck, there was a sickening crack as the head turned.

The bandit's arm fell limply, and everyone was speechless at the gruesome sight.

"Hah. Hah."

Breathing heavily, Shirone pushed the bandit's corpse aside and stood up.

"Shirone, are you okay?"

Though his basic physical strength was far superior to ordinary people, his back muscles still ached.

"Yeah. I'll be fine after resting for a bit."

The civilian investigation team stared blankly at them, having subdued the bandit group with just a single blade.

'What are those guys? They all look young.'

Knowing that rookies were only given 100 points made it even more absurd.

"You guys..."

The moment he tried to speak, time stopped.

Mission complete. Reward event begins.

Nade waved his hand at the frozen figures, but caught nothing.

"Is this also a hidden code?"

Iruki said.

"It must be. It's a system to prevent us from knowing by any means how many points we received as a reward. It's fair. Points are everything."

Special! You have cleared an honorable evil act. Double the acquired Crime Points will be awarded.

As soon as the words ended, two Crime Dice dropped in front of the party's feet.

While no one picked them up, Nade said.

"A special. I guess it's because we cleared a hidden event. Double isn't bad, right?"

Iruki shook his head.

"Not necessarily. The effort to find hidden events, and as you've experienced, killing through combat is definitely a loss. Defense, evasion, striking vital points - every action costs points."

Eden said.

"Honestly, I think the efficiency is poor too. I understand what Curtis meant."

"Honorable evil..."

Shirone muttered.

"It said honorable evil act. But the people we defeated were vicious bandits."

It seemed to be saying that it was still evil, that he was no different from them.

Nade comforted him.

"Don't worry about it. This is a game made by evil people. You know - the moment you waver, it's over. This is exactly what Catacomb is aiming for."

"Right. Of course, but..."

Perhaps that too was the truth.

"Nade, I'm going to stick with this strategy to the end."

"Of course."

Having collected himself, Shirone picked up the Crime Dice from the ground.

A transparent surface appeared beneath his feet and began to ripple like waves.

'Random number structure.'

If it was code that created Havitz, it would be perfect.

Reward details. Basic reward: 100 Crime Points. Additional reward: Crime Points equal to the sum of 3 Crime Dice rolls. Special: Honorable evil act. All rewards doubled.

Iruki said.

"It seems Shirone still owns the Crime Dice. If we had played normally, we could get a maximum of 36 additional points on top of 100."

Nade clicked his tongue.

"That's incredibly stingy? So that's why the murderer was being so petty. It'd be hard to even break even."

Eden said.

"Still, Curtis had 3 Crime Dice. More faces than ours too. It's a structure where the more you strengthen the dice, the bigger the rewards you can get."

"Guys... you know."

Shirone looked at his friends with a blank expression.

"I think I can 'double' this."

"What are you talking about?"

"There are no restrictions on magic or incarnation techniques here. So... I can do it. Quantum collapse."

It was the method he had used to get legendary items in High Gear.

Iruki confirmed.

"That's right. In a time-stopped state, even the signals that restrict us can't reach us."

It was purely a world of probability.

"I'll try it."

Rolling the dice onto his palm, Shirone stared at the ground vibrating like a string.

"Wow..."

Penetration of mind.

As the quantum collapsed, the earth froze, and two dice flew across it.

'Completely observed. That is, 100% probability.'

The dice that had been bouncing along the bumps stopped rolling, scattered left and right.

The numbers 6 and 6 appeared.

"Got it!"

With a thrilling impact sound, the numbers combined into 12, and the dice fell in front of him again.

Double! You gain one more opportunity.

"Great."

The second roll also came up 6 and 6, but this time no system voice was heard.

"Hmm, I see. You can only get one additional chance per double. But we still have two more opportunities, so we can roll a total of four times. If doubles come up, of course."

"No problem."

Shirone caught the dice falling before his eyes and immediately threw them far away.

The additional reward obtained this way was 72 points.

Adding the basic reward made 172 points, and with the special 2x multiplier, they got a total of 344 points.

"Yes! Jackpot!"

As Shirone's party cheered, Nade jumped up and down.

"Awesome! This method is amaziiiing..."

Time returned, and Nade came to his senses with a satisfied smile.

"Huh? What?"

Hawk Eye and the civilian investigators were staring at them with blank expressions.

"Ahem."

"Did something happen?"

"No, nothing."

Unlike Nade who instinctively blocked information leakage, Shirone spoke honestly.

"We received a reward. And I'm sorry."

He could have mentioned falling into the mental world, but the investigator didn't ask.

"No, we're the ones who received help. Thank you."

"Are you going to wait again, until the bandit group attacks the village?"

The investigator's expression darkened.

"We can't delay any longer. We know Melkidu's rules too. The heinous criminals must have fled much farther. So we have no choice but to..."

Kill the residents.

"Actually, they're not even real people, and we've confirmed that dead residents resurrect. I don't know why I'm telling you this. Just... I don't know. We have to go."

Shirone pressed his lips tightly together.

'This is why it's difficult.'

Unlike absolute good and absolute evil, this was why fairness and love couldn't rashly judge good and evil.

'Are humans evil?'

That might be possible, but before that, we should ask ourselves:

'Isn't the system wrong?'

Perhaps humans, society, we ourselves are driving ourselves toward evil.

'Because we have to survive.'

Inevitably competing, inevitably pulling others down, being jealous, envious...

'I also hate evil people. The sense of injustice that Miro feels about evil - I feel exactly the same.'

However, a perfect system.

'In a rational intelligence where there's no need to worry about disease or energy, if humans still harm, deceive, and torment others...'

Then feel free to condemn them.

'But no. We just haven't reached that level of intelligence yet.'

Humans who are hurt by being called evil and warmed by being called good.

'Why don't they understand how amazing that is? To value good over evil means...'

In the very distant future.

'It means we'll eventually reach that place.'

As human history proves.

'We shouldn't define humans from the start. We shouldn't give up in advance.'

Someday evil will disappear.

'Because I too am human.'

This isn't all there is - that's what I want to believe.

"Yes. Good luck."

Shirone couldn't voice the countless words that came to mind.

'My ideals are just delusions to every individual.'

Because even at this moment, all humanity is playing hot potato with bombs of suffering.

'They are right.'

If we think of those living in the present, this world might as well be closed.

As the civilian investigators limped away, Eden approached and whispered quietly.

"Let's do what we have to do."

...

Until good, evil, fairness, and love are all integrated.

"Well then, shall we get going? They said one person can't roll the dice consecutively. Who's going next?"

Iruki pointed to Nade, who had brought up the topic.

"Anyway, unless it's Shirone, we can't create artificial doubles. It doesn't matter who rolls."

"Ah, right. Damn, I could have gotten a free ride."

Eden consoled him.

"Still, we have 344 points. If we had played normally, we would have gotten about 100 points at most. For a start, we can say it's good. Meeting Curtis was also lucky."

Nade received the dice.

"Alright. Let's boldly charge forward. The god of dice is watching over me."

"Got it. Just hurry up and throw."

"Here I go! Our brilliant destiny!"

As Nade threw the dice with all his might, red numbers appeared in the distance.

It was 1 and 2.

"Damn iiiiiit..."

Shirone's party, transformed into light, advanced 3 spaces.
