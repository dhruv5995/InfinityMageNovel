[541] The Forbidden Sanctuary (1)

As water poured from the showerhead, Miro closed her eyes and fell into thought while washing her body.

'This is getting more troublesome.'

Molta was dead, and his wife had been erased at the end of Fermi's experiment.

Though Lian had considered that murder as well, the reason she ultimately kept her mouth shut wasn't solely because of Shirone.

The open state.

Everything except the Abyss Walkers was false, and from the beginning, they were merely information entities without life.

'Shirone is the same.'

If she encountered him, based on the case of the Molta couple, he would regain some memories, but they would ultimately be distorted memories.

"Lady Miro."

At the voice from the bathroom, Miro opened her eyes to see Arius appearing like a mirage and bowing.

"So you finally entered?"

"I'm only transmitting information through code. But this won't last long either."

It meant time was running out.

"Alright, speak."

"Shirone is currently located in the northwestern colony of the city. However, due to firewalls, I couldn't obtain detailed information. It seems there's a coder ability user over there."

"The mutant Molta mentioned?"

"Perhaps."

"How is Shirone's condition?"

"The flow of information is smooth. However, based on the mission... it's not good."

It was exactly as Fermi had predicted.

"I see."

"Search around the colony. Then you'll be able to find Shirone."

"A colony. I'll need to communicate with them. Can you code their language?"

"It's possible. I just need to inject my information. But I won't be able to come here again."

"It doesn't matter. Code it for my companions too."

Arius bowed his head.

"...Please be careful. Recently, two new pieces of information were added to Apocalypse. They're not perfect avatars or minority conceptions."

"Abyss Walkers. But what do you mean be careful?"

"I couldn't grasp their exact nature, but when I first encountered their code, I..."

Arius raised his head and spoke.

"I thought there were two more Lady Miros."

Miro's hand washing her body stopped abruptly.

"They're that strong avatars. Currently they've split into two, but if you encounter them, even Lady Miro might find it troublesome..."

Miro wasn't displeased.

"The Ten Lords? But why are they here?"

There was only one answer.

'They're thinking the same thing as Uorin.'

Miro turned off the shower and turned around.

"Understood. From now on, I'll handle it myself, so do the coding."

"Please preserve your precious body."

Arius's phantom transformed into code mixed with symbols and numbers before disappearing.

The rain that had fallen all night stopped, and for the first time in a while, a clear sun rose in Apocalypse's sky.

Having left the colony early in the morning, Shirone and Yo decided to explore deeper into the city center than yesterday, taking advantage of the clear weather.

"The rain has stopped."

Looking at Yo's pleasant smile, Shirone said:

"But without water, survival would be impossible."

"It's okay. With the water we've stored, we can last a month. I really love the sun."

A blush appeared on Yo's face.

"And... I also love the Archon's light."

Shirone cast a Shining spell above her head.

Yesterday it had been cast as part of strategy due to the rain, but this time it was just for fun.

"Ahh! I love it so much!"

"Yo has quite an appetite."

Yo understood the ancient's joke.

"Haha! That's right. Actually, I..."

The moment Yo saw Shirone's cold gaze, she stopped speaking and heightened her awareness of the surroundings.

'An ambush.'

As Yo activated her silver mirror to block Shirone's front, bullets poured from all directions simultaneously.

Through the sparking metallic arms, underground dwellers could be seen.

"Food! Food!"

Even roughly counting, there were over 40 of them.

"It's a combat unit! Hide behind me!"

Though Yo had to protect the Archon in any situation, Shirone leaped out without hesitation.

'Scatter Movement!'

Shirone, transformed into a photon state, split explosively in eight directions like an explosion, unleashing Photon Cannons in all directions.

Chaining teleportation from there, flashes intertwined like a net, devastating the surroundings.

"Wow..."

Yo, who had been watching in a daze, turned her head at the engine sound from the alley.

"Kahahaha! It's a hunt, a hunt!"

As a jeep with a machine gun appeared escorted by seven motorcycles, the subordinates rejoiced.

"Boss!"

Shirone's eyes widened as she spotted an underground dweller twice the size of the driver.

"How is that even..."

She couldn't gauge the average build of underground dwellers.

"That's the Boss. The leader of the combat unit."

"Let's avoid them for now."

As Shirone spread her light wings and flew up while embracing Yo, the jeep's machine gun swiveled and black bullet traces quickly followed.

"Uuuugh!"

Just as they soared above the building's rooftop, Yo shouted:

"Archon! Below!"

The Boss was climbing the wall with unbelievable agility for his massive frame.

'What the hell?'

The moment the rifle fired, Shirone used Rainbow Drop to curve and fall below the railing.

"Yahoooo!"

Then the excited Boss changed direction and threw himself toward where Shirone was.

'Crazy...! It's the 20th floor!'

"Kahahahahaha!"

Not caring about the fall, the Boss aimed his rifle downward and fired frantically.

Abandoning teleportation, Shirone activated Light Speed, and a curtain of light subtly twisted the bullets' trajectories.

"Huuuugh!"

Being able to see bullets was a terrible fear.

'Get it together! If I miss the fall timing, it's over!'

She could only hope the bullets wouldn't curve toward her by mistake.

Just before crashing into the ground, Shirone cast teleportation again, turning at a right angle and sliding across the ground.

"Damn it!"

The Boss, who arrived at the same spot afterward, dropped his rifle and twisted his body, landing with a thud and rolling across the ground before crashing into a junk vehicle.

"Aaaaah!"

"Boss, are you okay?"

The jeep and motorcycle unit came to meet him.

The Boss, his face contorted like a gorilla, pushed his dislocated shoulder back into place and climbed onto the jeep.

"Go! Today we feast!"

"Kiyayayayaya!"

At the monkey-like howls rolling in from the distance, Shirone felt chills down her spine.

'These are really dangerous guys. Not just their physical abilities, but their weapons are on par with magic's power.'

No, perhaps her magic was on par with their weapons?

Setting aside the confusion of memories, Shirone said:

"We can't shake them off. Do we have no choice but to fight?"

"There's one place where they absolutely cannot enter."

"Absolutely cannot enter?"

"Yes, probably. Because I don't want to go there either. We call that place the Forbidden Sanctuary."

"Is it a dangerous place?"

"I don't know. It's a contaminated zone, but I heard no one has gone there since very long ago. I'm feeling strange right now too."

'Hmm, I feel fine though...'

If it was a meme that applied in this ruined world, Shirone had no need to worry.

"Let's go there. Guide me."

Though Yo felt uneasy, she couldn't disobey the Archon's command and pointed in a direction.

"That way."

The place they arrived at was the tallest building in the city.

It was a building completely covered in mucus, and because of that, there weren't even traces of destruction.

"Certainly... I do feel something unsettling."

It would be even more ominous for Apocalypse's humanity.

"But the mucus is blocking the way?"

Yo spoke while shattering her silver mirror:

"It's best not to touch it, but in urgent times, we open a path like this."

As the mirror fragments scratched the mucus on the floor, the viscous substance writhed like a living thing and began to retreat.

"There they are!"

As underground dwellers pursued from beyond the block, Shirone pulled Yo close and cast Light Speed.

"Let's go!"

The curtain of light pulsed, opening the path to the entrance wide.

"Don't let them escape! Shoot! Shoot!"

As Shirone and Yo entered the door without time to look back, the jeep stopped in front of the building.

"Of all places, they went into the Forbidden Sanctuary? Cowardly bastards."

"Boss, what should we do?"

Two adults would be enough for the combat unit to eat their fill and have leftovers.

But even the Boss, who had jumped from a building rooftop, absolutely didn't want to enter this place.

"Can't help it. We give up. Let's look for other prey."

The engine roared as it moved away, and mucus dripped onto a monument erected beside the entrance.

Fairy Biomimetics Research Institute

Kwaaaaang.

At the explosive sound from across the city, Miro's group stopped walking and looked back.

"What's that? Combat?"

Then the sound of gunfire rolled in.

"Let's go see. It seems quite intense."

Knowing that Shirone was in the colony, they couldn't just pass by.

Using Miro's spatial movement to skip distances at once, they ran following the direction of the moving gunshots.

"How troublesome."

As Fermi cast Air Skate magic, his feet lifted and he slid quickly across the ground.

"You carry around all sorts of magic."

When Marsha made a snide remark, Fermi turned his body and took a stance with his legs spread.

"It doesn't allow flight like Fly magic, but among movement magic, it has good cost-effectiveness. Movement is also free."

Fermi, who had moved ahead with run steps, looked back at his companions and said:

"Anyway, I've poured all my money into this operation."

It was a mission that would bring in 190 billion gold if successful.

Lian said:

"They keep getting farther away. It seems like a chase."

Marsha, feeling unnecessarily annoyed, asked Fermi:

"Hey, how much is that? It's transferable, right?"

"2 million gold. Want to buy it?"

"Shut up."

Marsha thought she'd better run diligently with her feet.

"Strange. Really strange."

Shirone looked around the building lobby.

It was a place that could be commonly seen before, and except for the mucus clinging to the walls, there was nothing particularly unusual.

"Of course it's strange. No one comes here."

"No, that's not it. I feel like I've definitely been here before."

Some memory flooded into Shirone's mind.

A pure white office with an oak table. A man wearing intellectual glasses held out a document and said:

Congratulations, Mr. Shirone. You've been selected for artificial hibernation. Just sign here.

No. I can't survive alone, leaving precious people here.

You don't understand the situation. This isn't about individual survival. You're entering as humanity's representative.

But how...

Don't be presumptuous. I, who am handing you this contract, must also remain here. In other words, this is the end of life.

"...Have I really become alone?"

Though Yo couldn't understand Shirone's feelings, the fact that he was sad was enough.

"Don't worry. We're here with you."

Shirone, walking while staying far from the walls, looked at the stairs leading to the upper floors.

'Certainly at the top of this building...'

That office seemed to have been there.

But currently, it was completely blocked by mucus, forming a mottled wall.

"Have they gone back by now? They won't wait long because of hunting."

Ignoring Yo's anxious voice, Shirone searched his memories again.

Let's go underground. There's no time.

I'm sorry for only thinking of myself.

...I hope you create a good world.

'Underground. There's something underground.'

Shirone ran to the elevator and said to Yo:

"Can you open this door?"

"Huh? Oh, yes."

Yo made both arms metallic, inserted them into the elevator door gap, and pulled with all her might.

"Huuuup!"

The door opened, revealing a vertically dropping elevator shaft.

"Good. We can go underground."

"You're going underground?"

"If you're anxious, you don't have to follow."

Yo's expression changed immediately.

"No. I have a duty to protect the Archon."

"It'll be fine."

As Shirone threw Shining magic into the shaft and grabbed the elevator cable to descend, Yo followed.

"..."

One minute later, a human face bulged out from the mucus that had invaded the lobby ceiling.
