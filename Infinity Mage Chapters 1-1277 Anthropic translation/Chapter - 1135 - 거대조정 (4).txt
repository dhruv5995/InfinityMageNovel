**Giant Operation (4)**

Shirone's expression grew serious.

"Heukgangsi."

Aside from being a sorcerer from the Moon Kingdom, much about him remained shrouded in mystery.

'Those talismans are troublesome.'

The method of enforcing laws through power contained in specific objects was difficult to block with Hexa.

"Are you really going to stop me?"

Unlike the residents, if he was a star of the Ivory Tower, Shirone had no need to show mercy.

"We won't know until we try."

The moment Heukgangsi finished speaking, flashes of teleportation struck around Shirone.

'Tanjura, Daeho.'

A 1-star and satellite from the Law Department.

'Borbor.'

Then Borbor, a 2-star from the Balance Department, landed while suppressing Shirone's rear.

'Six stars total.'

Though they had the advantage in numbers, he didn't think it was balanced.

"You might die."

The corners of Heukgangsi's mouth, hidden behind his talisman, curled up slightly.

"How very human of you to say. Who do you think we are?"

In the Ivory Tower where even residents risked their lives, life was more trivial than conviction.

As the conscious residents retreated to the tower's outer walls, battle began.

Miracle Stream surged to the ceiling as stars and satellites simultaneously changed positions.

Chief Justice Tanjura shouted:

"For inciting discord in the Ivory Tower before humanity's crisis, 300 years imprisonment! For making wrong judgments due to obsession, 273 years imprisonment!"

As his ability 'Judgment' activated, binding force began to settle on Shirone's body.

Borbor shook her head.

"It's useless."

Though all stars of the Law Department handled laws, even Singh couldn't stop Yahweh.

'Of course I know that.'

Nevertheless, Tanjura continued his judgments.

"For ignoring the Chief Justice's verdict and fleeing, 600 years imprisonment! For appealing without repenting your crimes, 987 years imprisonment!"

The more Shirone rejected the verdicts, the heavier the weight of sin became in Tanjura's judgments.

'He'll be caught eventually.'

The hundreds of talismans Heukgangsi launched were gradually closing in on Shirone's tail as evidence.

"800 years added for not repenting! Another 800 years added! Yet another 800 years added!"

As the sentence exceeded 20,000 years, Shirone's movements were finally constrained.

"Death penalty."

The moment Tanjura delivered his final judgment, his satellite Daeho drew twin swords.

The 'Guillotine' ability activated in the 'Imprisoned' state had power comparable to Lian's Divine Transcendence.

'It's over.'

As talismans stuck to Shirone's body and the guillotine's cutting force bit into his neck:

'Hand of Trickery!'

Shirone vanished.

"Damn it!"

If everyone was 100% certain, Shirone could deceive their hearts.

'A double-edged sword. But it never fails.'

Issues of the heart weren't something that could be corrected immediately just by knowing about them.

"Dangerous!"

Borbor shouted as a giant fist of light flew toward Heukgangsi.

'Can't block it.'

Crouched in the air, Heukgangsi burned all the talismans clinging to his body.

Light burst forth, and through Hand of God, Shirone felt a tremendous shockwave.

'He blocked it?'

A long, thin breathing sound was heard.

"Huuuuu."

With all talismans gone, Heukgangsi's body glowed as bright as the sun.

"It's been 20 years since I've revealed this form."

"Baekgangsi."

Though the talismans had disappeared, Moon Kingdom sorcery was carved into his flesh.

Tanjura stroked his beard.

'Heukgangsi has no satellite. When the seal is released, he becomes a different human being entirely.'

According to Taesung, Baekgangsi was 4-star level.

'Like Eumji and Yangji, Seong Noe, Ruber - beings a bit different to be called human.'

As if fuel was evaporating, heat shimmer rippled around Baekgangsi's long, solid body.

"Yahweh, I am a being born as a law weapon of the Moon Kingdom. 88 sorceries dwell within my body."

Each one was arguably the strongest sorcery.

'What a turbulent life he's had too.'

The life it took for someone treated not as human but as a weapon to become a star of the Ivory Tower.

'Everyone has their own burden.'

Because they chose to bear it themselves, the stars of the Ivory Tower couldn't be persuaded.

Tanjura fluttered his fan and spoke:

"We are not ordinary residents. You might be able to kill us, but you won't be able to save us."

Even so, Shirone receiving a not guilty verdict was unpleasant.

'Hand of Trickery, truly chilling.'

From the victim's perspective it felt like being deceived, but in reality, that was the truth.

'In the current state, judgment is useless. To stop Yahweh, we must first destroy his heart.'

Borbor, who reached the same conclusion, spoke to Mika dwelling in her body:

'Scan the Five Great Stars.'

If the electromagnetic life form Mika scanned Yahweh's information, she would replicate it.

*This is a dangerous tactic. Yahweh's emotions are predicted to be of a type not in our database.*

'It's the only way.'

Once she replicated the psyche, Borbor could manipulate the target's emotions as desired.

'Lead him to self-loathing and destroy his heart.'

As satellite Mika generated electricity, Miracle Stream turned like a snake.

'He reacted?'

*He seems faster than me.*

Though they thought they knew Shirone, facing him as an enemy was a different level of difficulty.

"Five Great Stars."

Baekgangsi's body blazed like steam.

"I am honored."

His body, concentrated with various sorceries, became a single talisman and rushed toward Shirone.

'Authority of Power.'

When his fist carved with spiral patterns struck the ground, an explosion shook the entire floor.

Shirone's skin tingled.

'Still not easy.'

As Tanjura's judgment constrained his body, he felt Borbor's gaze.

'I don't want to kill them.'

Weren't they people fighting for humanity?

"...Stop this now."

"Truly impressive. To show leisure before stars of the Ivory Tower."

Baekgangsi didn't stop.

"But we cannot do the same."

The hieroglyphs carved on his abdomen began to contort along with his muscles.

'Three Thousand Worlds.'

His abdomen split open, revealing rainbow-colored fragments rotating like looking into a kaleidoscope.

'Buddha?'

Shirone, who recalled sermons from each color, defended with Hand of God.

"Release."

The massive energy wave's discharge scraped the surface of Hexa and pierced through the Ivory Tower's walls.

"Kruuuu!"

Probably something that couldn't be used twice - the essence of the human talisman called Baekgangsi.

'To use such a thing... on a human rather than the world.'

"You idiots!"

As Tanjura's judgment surpassed 20,000 years again, Borbor embraced Shirone.

'Mika.'

In the split second sparks flew:

*Scan complete.*

Following the emotionless voice, Borbor's mind fully accepted Yahweh's emotions.

'This ends it.'

In the mental space where friend and foe disappeared, Shirone and Borbor faced each other.

Tears streamed down her left eye.

"...Huh?"

Emotions too vast to feel at first enveloped her entire body.

*Aaaaah!*

In the mental world, tears became a flood filling the space where she dwelled.

*Shock! Shock detected! Severing consciousness...*

Even Mika's voice was buried in the emotional storm as Borbor realized:

'I can't even imitate it.'

She couldn't handle even a fraction of the despair Shirone felt.

'How can he endure this?'

No, why must he go this far?

'It's too unfair. For one human... to have to do this much in this world.'

That sense of injustice broke through limits and invaded her psyche until her consciousness finally snapped.

"Borbor!"

As other stars watched, Shirone embraced Borbor and shouted:

"Wake up!"

Electricity flowed through her body, and her closed eyelids slowly lifted.

'Mika...'

*Defibrillation complete. But you'll die soon. Your heart is already destroyed.*

Like a rubber band that lost its elasticity, her mind could no longer dwell in reality.

"...Five Great Stars."

Borbor opened her mouth.

"I'm sorry."

She couldn't persuade Singh.

Whatever Borbor said would become phantom information from Singh's perspective.

'I'm no different. Despite knowing humans best, I couldn't trust them.'

But Shirone was different.

'Whether real or fake doesn't matter.'

Even if it were an illusion, a world where such hearts could dwell would be beautiful.

"Please let the Five Great Stars go."

Of course, stars of the Ivory Tower wouldn't change their minds over a few words.

"Please."

For the first time, Borbor showed her expression.

That's how she felt.

"Hmph."

As Borbor died, talismans flew from all directions to seal Baekgangsi's body.

"Five Great Stars, I haven't changed my mind. This is grief for losing a great star."

All stars of the Ivory Tower liked her.

"Borbor was..."

Though Shirone only knew her life through Omega until age four, that was enough.

"Someone with great courage."

*Her heart has stopped. Blood flow is blocked and brain death is progressing.*

During this time, Mika spoke to Borbor:

'Yes. Biologically, I'm already dead. You should leave my body now too. Thank you for everything.'

Mika seemed lost in thought.

*I will remain here.*

'I can no longer think. If you stay here, it's the same as you dying too.'

*Yes. That would be so.*

Since Mika had no heart, Borbor felt puzzled by her satellite's words.

*It's a calculation that parasitizing your silence is far more constructive than parasitizing others' minds.*

'Haha, I see.'

With Mika together, death seemed like falling into a slightly long sleep.

'When I open my eyes again...'

Her life flashed before her eyes.

Born in Morai Market, Borbor was abused by her stepfather from age three.

Until she left home at seventeen, her father changed three times, all terrible men.

While her mother worked, all she did was sit on the market floor.

"Hey, there's that cripple. Hey, cripple!"

Around age twelve, having grown tall without gaining weight, she became a target for peer mockery.

"Hey you! We'll pay you to play with us. Want to come?"

Security was terrible too, with human traffickers approaching in broad daylight.

"We'll treat you well. Come with us."

Each time, Borbor just crouched her thin body and observed the streets.

'I'm not scared.'

Because home was the scariest place.

She became the market's attraction in a bad way, reduced to a spectacle.

"Ah."

Then one day she suddenly realized:

'They're not looking at me.'

There was no difference between people watching her and her watching people.

"...Borbor."

Watching Borbor grow cold with sad eyes, Shirone held her hand.

'May you rest in peace.'

At that moment, he felt a tingling current at his fingertips and a voice spread through his mind:

*There's something important I must tell you.*

'Mika?'
