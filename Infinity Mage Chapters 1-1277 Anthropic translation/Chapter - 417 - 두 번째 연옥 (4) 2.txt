[417] The Second Purgatory (4)

"Shirone?"

Kanya's voice trembled.

It was definitely Shirone. But how could he be here?

No, that wasn't important anymore.

If the person on the screen was Shirone, it meant he could bring new hope once again to the rebels who had fallen into despair.

"Unit 5 is down! Provide cover!"

Hearing the radio transmission, Kanya finally came to her senses and turned her head toward the multivision.

Most of the units were immobilized, but there were still devices capable of firing.

And all of them were aimed at Shirone.

"Wait, no!"

Kanya frantically pressed the radio button.

"Don't shoot! He's not an enemy!"

When she received no response, she checked on Shirone, still uneasy despite sending the transmission.

With what audacity, he was boldly revealing himself.

"Damn it...!"

When she pressed the emergency escape button, the cockpit's reinforced glass shot forward with a bang.

Kanya, who had stripped the Piper from Kuroi's synchro machine, crawled out of the bushes and raised her hands.

"Cease fire! Cease fire!"

The squad leader's voice came through the speaker of Unit 5 that had emerged.

"Commence firing."

Tick! Tick! Tick!

Kanya squeezed her eyes shut, but all that could be heard from the remaining three Kuroi units was the sound of steel bouncing off.

"What, what's happening?"

Looking around with a dazed expression, Kanya realized that the landscape was distorting.

At the center of the distortion, a pair of giant gears were turning while meshed together.

Sein's Equilibrium had stabilized the changes occurring in the chemical reactions of the gas.

"Misfire! Misfires, squad leader!"

"Same here. Check the ignition plugs."

"No problems! This is... Gah!"

Boom!

Quan and Ethella brought down one Kuroi unit.

It took longer than their skills would suggest, but it was significant that two people specialized in anti-biological warfare had smashed machinery with physical abilities alone.

The Kuroi's reinforced glass shot out with a bang.

The pilot was unconscious, hanging from the synchro machine, with Armin standing beside him.

It was the eerie characteristic of space-time mages who could infiltrate even sealed spaces as long as they had the coordinates.

The other team members also easily destroyed their Kuroi units, and the only intact machine left was the one the squad leader was riding.

Gaold approached the Kuroi with interest, stroking his chin as if encountering the unknown.

And instead of offering a handshake, he looked up at the purple-glowing machine's facial section and said:

"Get down. If you don't want to die."

Whoosh!

The reinforced glass shot up to the ceiling as the squad leader, equipped with a Piper, leaped at Gaold.

"Die!"

"No, squad leader!"

Kanya shouted, but the Signa the squad leader was holding was already falling toward Gaold's head.

"Kanya?"

Gaold looked back at Shirone. And as if it were a separate matter, his fist swung quickly, striking the squad leader's jaw hard.

"Ugh!"

He fell ungracefully and rolled on the ground with unfocused eyes.

If Gaold hadn't released his Press magic, this single blow would have erased his face from the world.

"Do you know him, Shirone?"

Shirone looked more carefully, doubting his eyes.

"Kanya? You're Kanya, right?"

Kanya finally seemed to relax as she walked weakly forward.

Clang! Clang! Having even stripped off her Piper midway, she ran with her bare body and threw herself into Shirone's arms.

"Shirone, Shirone! Waaaah!"

Everyone was bewildered as a suddenly sweet scene unfolded from what had been a deadly hostile confrontation.

"Really... Shirone?"

There wasn't a single person among the rebels who didn't know Shirone.

The first Nephilim to stop Ikael's drinking.

The rebellion had been organized starting from the riot that began in Shamain District 73, and they honored Shirone as the 'Light of District 73.'

Kanya belatedly wiped away her tears and smiled bashfully.

"Sorry. I didn't recognize you because you were wearing something strange."

Since anyone would have reacted the same way when meeting as enemies while concealing their identity, Shirone didn't mind.

"It's okay. How's Lena?"

"Yeah. She's with the main force. She'll faint from joy when she sees you."

"Haha! Right, how are your parents?"

"Dad is still healthy."

"...I see."

Shirone didn't ask about her mother.

Even at that time, she hadn't had much time left, so he could guess what had happened afterward from Kanya's silence.

There's no such thing as a good death in this world.

But Shirone hoped she had departed happily, seen off by her family.

"How much time has passed since I returned?"

"Exactly 432 days."

Kanya didn't need to think long. The day Shirone stopped Ikael's drinking was a monumental day for the rebels, so there was no need to calculate.

'432 days.'

It wasn't much different from the time zone where Shirone had been living.

Guffin's door worked by distorting space, so there was no time discrepancy caused by distance.

The reason time here was slightly faster was probably due to the influence of the gravitational field around the planet.

Shirone asked the question he was most curious about.

"I heard you're at war with Heaven, but on my way here I didn't see a single angel, let alone Mara. Why is that?"

Kanya shook her head.

"We don't really know either. We fought really fiercely, well, we mostly ran away, but anyway, from one day on, the angels stopped appearing. Even on the full moon nights when they always patrolled."

Sein, who had been listening while connecting mental magic, interjected with bright eyes.

"When exactly did this change begin?"

"Um, about 130 days ago?"

130 days.

Comparing it to the original world's timeline, it was around three months ago.

The first thing that came to mind was that contact with Gaold's guard unit that had infiltrated Heaven had been lost around that time too.

'Something definitely happened in Heaven. But what? Is it related to Miro? Or...'

The squad leader looked at the Kuroi with a bitter expression.

If it was Shirone, called the Light of District 73, there was no need to fight for any reason, but what they had lost because of this was too great.

"This is serious. The machine damage is severe."

Shirone approached with an apologetic expression. It was damaged beyond repair without major maintenance.

"I'm sorry."

"You have nothing to be sorry about. We were the ones who struck first."

The female squad leader, who bore some responsibility for this, protested with an aggrieved expression, showing her palms.

"But that man first deployed some bizarre illusion. If you experienced it yourself, you'd know anyone would have recognized him as an enemy."

Flu interjected.

"Before that, you aimed your Arc first, didn't you?"

"Before that, that man picked a fight first."

"Before picking a fight, you misunderstood first."

The woman couldn't hold back and shouted.

"Then how could we not misunderstand with him looking like that! He approached like he was going to hit someone!"

A moment of silence followed.

When opinions emerged that ultimately Gaold's face was to blame, the squad leader didn't want to argue anymore.

"Enough. Let's stop that and quickly recover the machines to rejoin the main force. The main force isn't in a leisurely situation either."

Sein asked.

"Where is the main force?"

"The Plain of the Dead. They're currently conducting a giant extermination operation."

The squad leader walked toward his Kuroi.

"This is the only equipment that can be deployed immediately. I'll lead for now, so follow me... Huh?"

Gaold was standing behind the squad leader.

When the squad leader, who had one foot on the machine, looked at him in confusion, Gaold pointed to the side with his chin.

"Move. I'm going to ride it."

"Wh-what are you saying? You're going to ride this?"

Kang Nan approached with a sigh.

"Why on earth do you want to ride that thing? It's synced with the Piper anyway, so it won't move even if you just get in."

Gaold's solution was simple.

"Then give me the Piper too."

Kang Nan looked at Sein.

It was an official question to the team's order about whether it was okay to leave this human alone like this.

Sein nodded.

Shirone would destroy Heaven, but Gaold had to handle the angels. He was the only person who could buy time against multiple angels, so it was better to entrust combat matters to him.

"Let him do what he wants for now."

Five minutes later.

Clank! Clank!

Gaold, equipped with the Piper, boarded the Kuroi.

The squad leader, who had been stripped of everything, could only stare at distant mountains.

Shirone, watching with concern, asked Flu.

"Is this really okay? The atmosphere had just lightened up, but stealing equipment is a bit..."

"He must have some idea. He's not someone who would ruin things just because he got interested, right?"

Shirone closed his mouth.

Flu, perhaps also feeling guilty, eventually changed his words.

"Actually, I don't really know either. But everyone here followed him this far because he's that kind of guild master. I just trust the guild master too."

Gaold connected the Piper to the synchro machine.

When he folded both arms inward, the Kuroi took the same motion.

"The feeling is pretty good?"

Since there was no reinforced glass, Gaold moved the tank while checking the scenery with his eyes.

"Hmm, how about this?"

When he turned the waist joint to its limit, the Kuroi's waist began spinning round and round like a top.

"Hehe. Kang Nan, look at this."

When Gaold playfully attacked with the Kuroi's arm, Kang Nan, who had lightly leaned back to dodge, couldn't hold back and shouted.

"Ah, seriously! Should I just smash it to pieces!"

Since these were words from people who had already destroyed four Kuroi units, Kanya pleaded with sincere eyes.

"Please hold back on that. Kuroi are really precious equipment."

"Phew, fine. I'm going to die of stress because of that human."

Gaold finally looked around at various things.

While it couldn't compare to the synesthesia of Spirit Zone, the multivision provided excellent vision, and the firepower was also powerful enough to rival Air Gun.

"How many units do the rebels have in total?"

"That's classified. I can't tell you."

With a clank, the Kuroi's gun barrel turned toward the squad leader.

It was impossible to tell where the joke ended and where he was serious.

"It's classified, but I don't know. At most, I know the battalion equipment status. A mere squad leader wouldn't know the rebels' total production."

Gaold clicked his tongue and stopped the machine.

Jumping down from the Kuroi, he threw off the Piper and quietly joined Shirone's group.

Kang Nan crossed her arms and glared.

"Why? You acted like you were going to ride it all day."

"Motion sickness. Worse than horses."

Kang Nan snorted.

Meanwhile, Gaold's mind was becoming complicated.

'That won't be nearly enough. At least 2,000 units? No, more than that.'

This was the force of Kuroi units that Gaold calculated would be needed to take down one ordinary angel.

When evening fell, Shirone's group emerged from the forest.

Arriving at a hill overlooking the Plain of the Dead, they could see the giant procession they had seen in the morning and the 1st Command 23rd Battalion of the rebel army engaged in localized combat stretching to the horizon.

The battalion possessed a total of thirty Kuroi units.

However, since they had sent one squad including Kanya as support forces, twenty-five Kuroi units were currently in operation.

The Kuroi units, divided into five squads, cooperated with infantry to lure small numbers of giants at least one kilometer away from the procession before concentrating fire.

Every time giants fell like rags, Shirone made a terrible expression.

Giants were also human.

If the Mecha tribe members had once been divine citizens, they would know this fact better than anyone, so Kanya's face was also shadowed.

"The rule is to eliminate giants immediately upon discovery. If they reach Jotunheim and achieve mental unity, they'll be able to use giant strength."

The squad leader spoke as if making an excuse, but it wasn't wrong.

With eight egos overlapped, the schema's formula would become as powerful as an excellent swordsman. When that time came, the forces of a mere battalion wouldn't be able to handle it.

The group that entered the plain quickly returned to the main force.

Seeing the group that had brought back only one Kuroi unit, the company commander first looked at them in disbelief, then finally exploded in anger.

"What happened! You said it was Kergoin! I sent five units to handle it quickly, not to do it like this!"

"I'm sorry."

The squad leader just repeated the same words.

After all, he was responsible for the squad, so he had nothing to say even with ten mouths.

But Kanya was different.

Shirone had returned. And with much more powerful allies than before.

This was good news incomparable to the loss of tanks.

"Company commander! I have something to report!"

"What are you! Don't you see I'm chewing out the squad leader! Are you ignoring the chain of command!"

Kuroi pilots held positions equivalent to infantry squad leaders, but reporting directly while bypassing the squad leader was a great breach of protocol.

But Kanya couldn't wait.

With the giants' invasion line closing in, as could be heard through the sounds, this was a matter the highest authority absolutely needed to know.

"It's the Light of District 73!"

"What? What nonsense are you babbling about now?"

Kanya burst out in frustration and shouted.

"Shirone has come!"
