Truth and Lies (4)

Melkidu, the sanctuary for murderers.

Square 1 of the outer track is the only town that first-time visitors to Melkidu cannot enter.

Town 1, Vital.

The special reason is that attacks between users are prohibited, and there aren't even any missions.

Conversely, it had many convenience facilities, making it a place where many users stayed.

"We finally collected it."

Sitting in a restaurant, Sirone's group spread out their handmade map and began their meeting.

"100 million crime points."

At Nade's words, memories of their hardships flashed through his friends' minds like a montage.

Eden let out a sigh.

"It was tough. We cleared everything through honorable evil acts just to take the special route."

The honorable evil acts bonus couldn't be obtained if they committed even one ordinary murder.

Iruki said,

"100 million points after going around the outer track seven times is perfect strategy level. Some missions cost 10 million points for a single bomb. But the real problem starts now."

Their handmade map had the outer track of Melkidu drawn in detail.

"468 total tracks. Of those, we directly experienced and gathered information to map 207 squares. Accelerating point accumulation in this state is impossible."

For example, some missions involved rolling dice to chip away at a villain's health.

However, the opponent's attacks resulted in enormous point deductions, so quick elimination was key.

"The Treacherous Lord. The only mission where we lost points. We'll need items and will have to strengthen our dice too. Let's gradually enter the inner track."

Sirone said,

"The price for items to enter Melkidu from the inner track is 100 billion points. We'd reach it eventually if we continued like this, but we don't have that time."

The best route was to strengthen their dice on the inner track and sweep up points.

Nade said,

"Since we've collected 100 million, let's double this first. I saw a casino on the way here."

While gambling was possible in other towns, Vital's gambling hall was operated by the system.

"It's comfortable not having to get entangled with other users. But betting opportunities are limited to once each time we pass the starting point. Betting amounts also have limits by unit. 1 to 99 points, 100 to 999 points."

This was why they came to square 1 after collecting 100 million.

"It would be impossible to do this after collecting up to 1 billion. Even winning 100 million points in one go would be incredible."

Eden asked worriedly,

"What if we lose? We'd lose almost everything."

"Haha! We have Sirone. He never loses at gambling. Unless it's Satan."

Suddenly, silence fell.

"Melkidu is Satan's..."

"Hahahaha!"

Nade burst into awkward laughter and stood up.

"Come on! Let's put aside useless thoughts and go quickly. We can earn 100 million points!"

His friends sighed.

"I'm a bit anxious."

After leaving the restaurant, Sirone's group headed to the gambling hall in the town center.

About ten booths were set up with people waiting in lines.

'We couldn't meet this many people in other towns. This really is Vital.'

A man came out of booth 1.

"Jackpot!"

He seemed to have won, and other users looked at him with envious eyes.

"I wonder how much he won?"

Iruki answered Nade's question.

"Probably not big money. Even with 50% probability, lives are on the line. There probably aren't people betting amounts like ours. Unless they're point tycoons."

Booth 6 had the shortest line while booth 7 had the longest.

"As expected, superstition rules in places like this. Where should we wait?"

There was no need to ask.

"Let's go to booth 6."

Shortly after, booth 6's door opened and a woman came out with a tearful expression.

"Sob, sniff."

Walking with trembling shoulders, she eventually lost strength in her legs and sat down on the spot.

"Waaaaah! What do I do!"

She seemed to have bet a considerable amount, but no one sent her sympathetic looks.

When Sirone's group entered the door, a dimensional space unfolded like when completing missions.

Welcome to the Devil's Gambling Hall. Please set your betting points.

Sirone, after making eye contact with his friends, said,

"100 million points."

Points will be deducted. Current remaining points: 6,878,300 points.

Sirone caught his crime dice - two six-sided dice - as they fell.

The side with the higher number wins.

Since the system used the same dice, strengthening their dice wouldn't provide any advantage.

"Here we go."

Forgetting even to breathe, his friends watched the dice fall to the ground.

Two sixes appeared.

Doubles. One more opportunity is granted.

Without hesitation, Sirone threw the dice again, and the result was the same.

"Phew, that's it. Honestly, I was on edge."

Iruki was cautious.

"We can't relax yet. The system could get the same result. Then it would be a tie."

"Come on, surely not three times in a row..."

While speaking, the system rolled its dice, and two sixes appeared.

Nade's eyes widened.

"What?"

If the next roll also showed two sixes, it would total 24 points, tying with Sirone.

"What happens if it's a tie?"

A system message was heard.

Another match will be held, and doubles will be reset. However, if it's a group crime, the participant will change.

A chill ran down their spines.

If it were truly 50% probability, they wouldn't have bet 100 million points in the first place.

'Please, please. I'm the one throwing next.'

As Nade's heart raced, two dice emitted light.

One was 6, one was 4.

24 to 20. Congratulations. You have won the game. You will receive double your bet amount.

Nade was on the verge of collapse.

"Hah, how many times did 6 come up? My stomach acid is coming up and burning everything."

"For ordinary people, this would be incredibly unlucky. But considering everything, we got this easily."

100 million points will be paid as victory reward. Current points: 206,878,300 points.

"Good, we just need to collect 9.7 billion more."

Leaving the silly joke behind, they exited booth 6 and felt people's gazes.

'There's nothing good about showing off.'

While battles between users were prohibited, they could meet anywhere.

"You guys."

When the group turned around, the woman who had gambled at booth 6 was following them.

"Did you win by any chance?"

The woman shrugged her shoulders.

"Don't be so wary. I'm a point beggar now. I can at least tell you about wins and losses, right?"

Sirone said,

"We won. Why do you ask?"

"Hmm, well..."

Suddenly the woman started fidgeting.

"I really have no points, so if you could just buy me one thing I want from the shop..."

"Let's go."

As Nade coldly pushed his friends' backs, the woman glared with fierce eyes.

"Those bastards really! Do they know who I am!"

"Who? Blood-sucking ghost Pena."

At the voice heard from behind, Pena's eyes widened, and Sirone turned his head.

"Huh?"

Curtis, who had helped them when they first came to Melkidu, waved at the group.

"Long time no see."

This place was also a kind of under-coder, so time flowed differently from the real world.

"Mr. Curtis? How are you here?"

"The dice god guided me here... that's a lie. I was waiting for you guys. I figured you'd stop by the gambling hall after this much time."

It was correct.

Pena snorted.

"Tch, what? You knew each other? Seeing you hang out with Curtis, you guys aren't much either?"

Curtis smiled.

"You'd better drop that thought. These guys are professional mages in reality."

"Oho?"

While Pena re-examined the group, Sirone asked Curtis,

"Do you two know each other?"

"Rather than knowing each other... she's a familiar face. She's neither particularly strong nor weak, the type that moderately circles the outer track."

"How ridiculous! Do you think I'm like you? I'm already angry enough from losing at gambling."

"Haha. And let me tell you, don't believe what this woman says. She didn't get the nickname 'blood-sucking ghost' for nothing. Even if she lost at gambling, she probably still has her principal."

Pena frowned.

'What?'

More than having her identity revealed, she found it strange that Curtis was freely sharing information.

'What makes him so confident to freely share information? Does he think these kids will absolutely never lose?'

Curtis asked,

"How many points do you guys currently have?"

As expected, there was no answer.

"Hoho, you seem quite experienced. Then could you tell me how many times you've circled the outer track?"

"We can't reveal that. You could deduce our points."

"That's why I'm asking. We don't have perfect alliance, but we have enough trust for information exchange, right?"

"Does the information Mr. Curtis has make it worth the risk of revealing our points?"

"Probably. The information I know is a hidden method to enter Melkidu."

Sirone made eye contact with his friends.

"How about it? You guys buy the drinks."

As Curtis pointed to the restaurant, Pena interjected,

"I, I want to come too! Right? I can come, right? I won't listen to anything. I'm starving to death."

'This is why she's called a blood-sucking ghost.'

Curtis said,

"Let's take her. She has 27 fraud convictions in reality, but she's a somewhat trustworthy friend."

Though the statement seemed contradictory, there must have been a reason for wanting to bring her along.

"Alright. Let's hear it first."

The moment they settled in the restaurant, Pena opened the menu and ordered various foods.

"Lastly, beer too please. Oh, and the lunch bread is complimentary, right?"

From the buyer's perspective, it was annoying, but at least she didn't choose expensive food.

"This much is okay, right? I want to take the leftovers."

"Yes."

Since they had won 100 million points and were in a good mood, they could afford to buy her food.

Curtis asked again,

"How many times did you circle the track?"

"Seven times."

"Incredibly fast. If you continuously took the honorable evil acts route, that would be about 50 million points?"

Curtis couldn't imagine Sirone's group's efficiency.

"Well..."

"Good. Not denying it means it's at least around 50 million. Then there's possibility."

Pena raised her hand.

"Wait. I'm eating. Can I listen to this?"

"It doesn't matter. Knowing won't help you do anything about it. Besides, numbers matter for this."

Curtis lit a cigarette.

"Collect 100 billion, or get lucky. These are the two standard routes to enter Melkidu. But there's a hidden method. I go bankrupt."

Eden frowned.

"But if your points reach 0, you'll be chased by guards. You'll be imprisoned."

"That's the key. After serving your full sentence in prison, you restart at the starting point. But there's one way to not go to the starting point."

Sirone realized.

"Bribery."

That was also a crime.

"Right. Help me escape prison. Become a criminal again in this place where all crimes are innocent."

"What happens when you become a criminal?"

Curtis looked out the window and said while exhaling cigarette smoke,

"The back door opens."
