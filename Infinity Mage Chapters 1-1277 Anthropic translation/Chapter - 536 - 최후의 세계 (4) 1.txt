[536] The Final World (4)

The atmosphere in the temple grew heavy.

"Answer me. What did you do to me? And what's this about being a slave?"

Though the Consul had no combat abilities, there were plenty of powerful warriors to protect his light abilities.

"Priest, summon Ra's guardians."

The priest quickly waved both hands, grasping codes from different locations and connecting them before his eyes.

Sparks erupted from the connection point of the codes, and his figure vanished instantly.

'So he can do that too.'

Before long, the priest returned, and with a clatter, the door opened as four figures rushed in swift as wind.

"Avatar of Ra, we follow your command."

The Consul pointed at Shirone and issued his order.

"Execute this heretic who blasphemes the name of god. The language of light never befits a slave."

Sensing something extraordinary about the guardians' prayers, Shirone remained alert and focused his mind.

'They're different too.'

The colony's executives were mutants born with a 0.001 percent probability from the Tree of Life.

Their abilities encompassed biological, mental, and phenomenal categories, and they were those who ruled over the Children of the Sun with powerful strength.

"An Ancient, I see. You refused Ra's baptism?"

Yo, the only female among the guardians, approached.

She was a woman with green hair tied in complex knots against her head and bangs cut straight above her eyebrows.

"It's not Ra's baptism but brainwashing. What wrong have I done to deserve this?"

"There is only one wrong."

Yo aimed her palm at Shirone and spoke.

"Your existence."

Silver Mirror.

Her arm transformed into silver-gleaming metal, then shattered with a ringing sound.

"What!"

As metal fragments swirled and rushed like rapids, Shirone circled the temple's perimeter with teleportation.

"I'll go."

Karoff, who had been standing beside Yo, cracked his neck left and right.

He was a man of medium height with a balanced build, his hair cleanly shaved on the sides with the top grown long and hanging down.

"Grrrr!"

Karoff's face contorted viciously as fur began growing all over his skin.

Finally becoming the face of a fierce dog, he leaped toward Shirone's flash.

"Graaah!"

As four claws came slashing in, Shirone, who had canceled his teleportation, rolled on the floor.

"Damn...!"

Just as he regained his balance, fragments of the silver mirror came flying.

'Rampage!'

A curtain of light pushed away the silver mirror fragments, and Karoff also received the impact of being beaten by dozens of clubs.

'Photon Cannon!'

When Shirone threw a sphere of light as if snatching it, the flash stretched out and struck Karoff's abdomen hard.

"Gugh!"

Karoff, pushed back with a thud, could only put his lifted legs back on the ground when he reached his original position.

His mimicry released, he knelt bare-bodied, puffed his cheeks, and widened his eyes.

"Graaaah!"

Even in his mimicry state that boasted powerful muscle strength, he couldn't withstand the impact and blood spurted out.

When Yo formed hand seals, the silver mirror fragments gathered on her shoulder and returned to arm form.

Using her palm like a mirror to examine her face, she removed the metallic properties from her arm and spoke.

"What? You could have easily avoided that."

Karoff shook his head.

"That's not the problem. The light..."

It possessed physical force.

Faced with this inexplicable fact, the two guardians who hadn't entered combat remained silent.

To the Children of the Sun, light meant life itself.

Even without the doctrine that those who worship Ra shall gain eternal life, they were a race that couldn't survive without light.

"Hmm."

In this situation, only the priest who managed doctrine could make a judgment.

'Among mutant abilities, those who could use the language of light have existed for generations.'

The reason was unknown, but he suspected it was because the Tree of Life's activity was based on light.

'And at this moment, a new language of light has appeared. To an Ancient, no less. Is this Ra's revelation? Or...'

The priest who had made his judgment bowed his head toward the Consul.

"Avatar of Ra, two suns cannot exist in the colony. Though it may be troublesome, please exercise the authority of the sun to convince these pitiful children."

Since matters had escalated this far, they had no choice but to ask the colony's people to choose between the two lights.

"Good! I shall gift the sun during Ra's slumber!"

The Consul also understood the nature of power well.

If he retreated here, only death would remain for him.

"It will be in three hours. I shall tell the priests to prepare."

The priest said this and then addressed Shirone.

"You who have caused discord in the colony, I give you one last chance. At the time when the colony becomes darkest, you and the Consul will compete in the power of light. If you win, you will become the colony's new leader, but if you lose, you must take your own life."

"I have no intention of becoming a leader. And I won't take my own life either."

"Don't be arrogant. Though you impersonate Ra with strange language, the guardians' power is not all that you've experienced. If you want to live, you must prove yourself with all your might."

Though judgment was left to the colony's people, the priest had no doubt that the Consul would win.

After everyone had left, only the guardians remained to exchange opinions.

"What do you think about this match?"

To Yo's question, Karoff spoke as if there was nothing to consider.

"Of course the Consul will win."

"But the light that slave uses is strange."

"Hmph! What does that matter? The reason we've served the Consul for generations is because light is life itself. Light that destroys life is of no use to the colony."

As Karoff turned away, the other guardians also returned to their rooms, leaving only Yo to mutter while looking toward where Shirone had gone.

"Light that destroys life..."

Meanwhile, Shirone was being guided by a gatekeeper to a place where he could rest.

The colony's way of life that he roughly grasped was simple.

The Children of the Sun did nothing, while most of the menial work was handled by the Ancients.

Leaving the floor where slaves were active and going down below, he found Woodga and Hamei sitting in a small room, basking in light.

"What are you doing here?"

Woodga, who had been trembling with an expression of ecstasy, opened his eyes.

"Oh? You're safe? That's a relief."

"I'm not safe yet. What are you doing here, I asked?"

"What else? Basking in light in the sacred room. Huh? But you, if you're a slave, you should speak respectfully. Seeing that you understand words, it seems you've received Ra's grace too."

"That's... just temporarily postponed."

"Hmm, is that so?"

Woodga brushed it off casually.

It probably had to do with the Consul's sun festival that would take place in three hours.

"Only those who have done blessed deeds can enter the sacred room. You can bask in light from the closest distance. Originally today is a blessing given to Hamei, but he allowed me to bask together."

"Basking in light is a blessing?"

Hamei spoke with a rapturous expression.

"The greatest blessing. When you're exposed to such strong light from this close, you feel tremendous power. It's the best feeling in the world."

"Long exposure can strain the body, but anyway, only the Consul can create such light. Slaves are truly pitiful. They can't even feel how good this feels."

'Strong light...'

Arriving at the room, Shirone fell into solitary thought.

He could escape now, but perhaps that was exactly what the Consul wanted.

'There is a way. No, actually I'm not certain. It would be good to test it...'

Then a band of code connected in front of him and the priest appeared.

"...It's time. You will ascend to the top floor."

When the priest approached Shirone and connected the code, the scenery changed instantly and they arrived on the colony's rooftop.

The Consul was flexing his upper body muscles and warming up, with four guardians standing in a row beside him.

Looking down, hundreds of the Children of the Sun had all come outside and were looking up at this place.

"Avatar of Ra! Eternal life! Eternal future!"

"Listen all, people of Ra!"

The ground became quiet instantly.

"The one who blasphemes Ra's name with false language, I shall personally step forward to punish. Now I shall bestow the power of blessing!"

When the priest handed over two devices connected with optical fiber, the Consul grasped them with both hands and turned to look at Shirone.

"Watch closely the power of my authority. If you cannot produce light stronger than mine, I will take your head."

Without answering, Shirone examined the device.

The optical fiber was connected to the colony's ceiling, and the trapezoidal handle was glowing faintly.

'A device that transmits light?'

The Consul raised the device to the sky and opened his ability.

"Even in darkness, the sun does not go out! I shall prove it through my body!"

As both fists shone brightly and light flowed along the optical fiber, people burst into cheers again.

"Waaaah!"

The glass spheres installed throughout the colony began emitting light, and finally the entire structure became luminous.

Without exception, the moved Children of the Sun turned their heads toward the light and offered prayers.

"Ra! Ra! Great Ra!"

"Truly magnificent."

Karoff nodded satisfactorily at the festival of light that drove away the darkness of night.

As long as the Consul existed, the Children of the Sun would not perish.

This was why those with the language of light became Consul for generations, even without combat skills.

Thinking he had sufficiently demonstrated his ability, the Consul put down the device and the light went out.

Nevertheless, the afterglow of emotion rippled through the night air, and people trembled for a while in the pleasure of light.

"Now, it's your turn."

The Consul stepped aside with a derisive sneer.

'Light bright enough to illuminate the entire colony...'

When Shirone revealed himself, people murmured.

Though the words were garbled, the sound waves contained pure hostility.

'I have no choice.'

Shirone's eyes flashed as he concentrated his mind.

"Heretic, quickly take the device..."

The priest's face turned pale as he approached with the device.

A small light above Shirone's head began moving in trajectories, creating a massive circle.

'Super Magic Amplification Circle Ataraxia.'

It was someone's ability from memories that had newly emerged when opening Immortal Function.

As Ataraxia rotated in completed form, the Consul, instinctively sensing crisis, shouted.

"It's heretical language! Quickly drag that slave away!"

To others, this was merely a contest to determine the sun, but for the parties involved, it was a matter of life and death.

"The Consul is right. We eliminate the heretic."

Just as the four guardians were about to leap simultaneously, a handful of photons began gathering in Shirone's hands.

"Light?"

It was definitely light.

But it was only enough to illuminate the surroundings at most, and even that was growing dimmer with time.

'I need to unify the polarization direction.'

The impatient Consul mocked Shirone.

"With just that much, you dared impersonate Ra! There's nothing more to see! Quickly dispose of the heretic!"

Just as the guardians were about to leap again, Yo stopped them.

"Wait a moment. That's something..."

The light that had seemed like a dot buried in the night began rising above Shirone's hands.

And the moment it passed through Ataraxia.

"Woooooh!"

A tremendous explosion of photons occurred in the sky.

The intensity of light emitted by the sphere of light, far more massive than the colony, was enough to swallow people's forms.

In a blank world where nothing could be seen an inch ahead, the sound of people's cheers, struck by intense light pleasure, filled the air.

"Aaaaah! Aaaaah!"

Woodga screamed and shed tears in pleasure so intense it made his mind fly away.

It felt as if blood was circulating fast enough to evaporate, and energy overflowed as if he could explode his body at any moment.

"Brother... brother..."

Hamei, trembling with emotion, clasped her hands together, shed tears, and raised her head.

As the photons escaped, people could finally confirm the true nature of the light that had risen to the sky.

"Ah, ahhh..."

"Ra... Ra has descended..."

Above Shirone's head, the sun was floating.
