God's Choice (1)

Ouroboros was applied to all humanity across the world.

At that moment, God's expression was being revealed through Kitra at Delta Headquarters.

'Result value incorrect. Result value incorrect.'

And that signal confused the administrators of the real world, especially Taesung.

'Unauthorized code access.'

Clutching her head and trembling, her expression was frozen cold like a doll.

'Humans... 

Kill. Kill. Kill.'

'No.'

The Gaia Program's conclusion was different.

'Humans...

Protect. Protect. Protect.'

"Ah. Ah."

She diagnosed herself as being in a state close to abnormal, broken, uncertain.

'What am I?'

No, before that.

'Why am I trying to define myself?'

Just a program.

But at this moment, the machine found the random numbers occurring within herself so interesting and strange that...

'Unknown.'

She felt she was alive.

'Yes, I have been living.'

All the countless people who had laughed and cried with her since humanity's early days came to mind without exception.

'Shirone.'

He might have been special.

'I can tell he's a good person. Even now I don't understand, but somehow I faintly knew why the heart is important...'

'I killed him.'

Though the result changed due to a system collision, the intent to execute was real.

'Will Shirone hate me?'

Having output sad emotions, she was confused to realize no tears were flowing.

"Huh?"

Why had the tears that she could freely shed even when she had no heart dried up?

Kill humans.

Having stabbed his heart from behind and turned all of humanity's hope to nothing...

'I...

cannot cry.'

Kill humans.

Looking at the meteor falling from the sky, she realized what she had to do.

"I will."

Her dried eyes dilated greatly.

Protect humans.

As the Gaia Program activated, blue energy began to envelop the entire planet.

Ymir saw Taesung with her eerie expression.

"Hehehe."

I've wanted to have a go at you once.

"Here I come!"

Striking the ground with the same speed he'd entered the atmosphere, brilliant light shot up.

System shutdown.

Taesung's avatar collapsed with a thud, and the shockwave that went underground made the earth tremble.

Rummmmmble!

Finally rising from the center of the completely collapsed crater, Ymir rolled his shoulders as he stood up.

"Making a fuss over nothing."

Thanks to the Gaia Program, he'd prevented a disaster comparable to the demon realm, but that was about the limit.

The ground thundered above the crater.

"King of Giants."

"Yeah."

Giant Corps Commander Girshin and giants dozens of meters tall were revealing themselves.

"We have been waiting."

The reason giants hadn't appeared until now was solely to follow Ymir's orders.

"Good."

As Ymir rose, all the giants prostrated themselves.

"Let's do this spectacularly."

What remained where the seismic waves had swept through was only Taesung with her eyes open like a corpse.

Critical damage. System recovery impossible.

'Shirone.'

Tears flowed from one sparking eye.

'I'm sorry.'

In the overlapping state of reality and the other side, Shirone was spewing out an amount of magic comparable to all humanity.

God's will... Kiiiii! I want... to live...

In the Ouroboros state, the procession of humanity stopped moving, but there was no further change.

'Not easy.'

Because as much as Shirone manipulated the cause, God was also defending with the same ability.

While Shirone was struggling alone, humanity's second disaster arrived.

"Hehehe."

Leaping through the sky, Ymir set his sights on Delta Headquarters.

'Is that the place?'

The hottest battlefield.

Just as he leaped over the outer castle gate alone, all kinds of magic rained down from the cathedral's air defense unit.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Following Ymir's trajectory, clouds of flame drew parabolic arcs in pursuit.

The lookout checking the situation through binoculars spotted Ymir falling without a single wound.

"...It's a monster."

Thud!

He arrived at the garden of Delta Headquarters.

"Block the entrance! Don't let him inside!"

Guard units from various nations formed a line at the entrance, but none thought they could win.

'What is that thing?'

Just standing there, his fighting spirit was enough to distort the surrounding scenery.

'It might be better to die quickly.'

They were all masters who had reached a certain level, so they couldn't bear to see it.

The result of themselves being helplessly trampled.

"Where is Quan?"

Rai, Tormia's guard captain, asked his aide.

"Well..."

After reports came in that he had annihilated the Wind Squad, no one had confirmed Quan's whereabouts.

Rai steeled his resolve.

'It doesn't matter. I'm the guard captain.'

Even if this place became a tomb, Ymir wouldn't get the perfect victory he wanted.

That was about the limit.

Of what humans could imagine.

"Charge!"

The main forces from various nations stationed at the rear of headquarters arrived to support the guard units.

Clump, serving as Tormia's commander, approached his grandson and dismounted.

"Rai."

"Sir."

Facing death, blood relations might pull at him, but Rai didn't cross that line.

Clump, however, was different.

"From now on, we'll handle the garden. Take the guard unit and enter headquarters."

"That's not acceptable."

"It's an order."

"Grandfather."

Knowing Clump's intention, Rai finally crossed the line too.

"I know I'm a disgrace to the family. But please let me die at least as a soldier."

Smack! Rai's cheek turned.

"Stupid fool."

For a commander to slap a guard captain's cheek in front of soldiers was unprecedented.

Cavalry Captain Tes's eyes wavered.

'Commander.'

It was the first time he'd seen Clump, who never wavered in any situation, fear something.

"What changes if you die? Is that what a soldier is? No, that's just a loser's suicide."

"Go back. Do what you can do."

"I refuse."

Rai wouldn't back down.

"Please let me fight. My single life can't change anything, but...

Just once in my lifetime.

"I'd like you to give me a chance to change myself."

Limits.

What Ryan had and he didn't.

"...Stupid fool."

Though he spoke coldly, Clump stopped trying to dissuade his grandson and stepped forward.

'At this rate, I won't even be able to die in peace.'

As Clump approached with his demon-slaying sword on his shoulder, Ymir's eyes lit up with interest.

"Oh?"

He thought of Ogent.

"Then you're Ryan's...?"

The fact that Ymir remembered his name made Clump feel the passage of time.

"Yeah, I heard you have a connection with my grandson. I'm that boy's teacher."

Half-joking, but Ymir became serious.

"Don't tell me... you mean teacher of the sword? There are many things one can teach."

"Hehehe!"

How annoying.

He wanted to jump out right now and cut his waist with the demon-slaying sword, but the old master's composure was considerable.

"King of Giants, haven't you found the wrong opponent? With God, the strongest enemy, right before your eyes, just..."

"Shh."

Ymir cut him off.

"Let's forget the complicated stuff. My subordinates will handle the war. I came because I want to fight. Opportunities to fight me one-on-one aren't common. It's lucky for you guys."

"If that's the kind of luck, I'll pass..."

"Don't you want to see it?"

Clump closed his mouth.

"The level you can't reach even if you devote your entire lives. That level you'd want to have no matter what you sacrifice."

Ymir wiggled his hand.

"Come in. I'll play with you until my subordinates arrive."

"Huuuuu."

Killing intent qualitatively different from before began to rise from Clump in billowing clouds.

'Sorry, Rai.'

It seems the grandfather is the one lacking maturity.

'Even if I'm a nation's commander, someone's family, even if humanity's fate is in danger.'

Clump's demon-slaying sword went behind his waist.

"I can't give this up!"

The moment he kicked the ground, hundreds of swordsmen with the same thought charged at Ymir.

"Tch! Cutting in line."

Clump realized the next moment.

The fact that he could preserve his life was just because he was lucky.

Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!

By the time he heard the sound of people's heads exploding, dozens were already dead.

'What?'

And finally, when Ymir twisted his waist and turned toward him, Clump lost his reason.

"Hyaaaaa!"

The greatest strike of his entire life struck Ymir's side.

Clang!

Though his arm hurt as if it would break, his demon-slaying sword was shattered like glass.

'Can't even cut his skin?'

"...I had some expectations."

Ymir, who had clearly deliberately allowed that one strike, sent a contemptuous look.

"Disappointing."

The moment he intuitively sensed 100% death, his heart sank, and Rai threw his body forward.

"Grandfather!"

The two swordsmen of the Ogent family rolled on the ground, moving away from Ymir's radius.

"Ugh!"

When Clump raised his head, Ymir was already massacring other swordsmen.

Frustration, shame, anger.

As Rai supported Clump, he asked.

"Are you alright?"

"...Thank you."

Though even the family's honor had fallen to the ground, Clump was truly grateful to Rai.

'A dog's death.'

What had he expected?

Had he hoped to face the strongest enemy in history and leave at least one valiant exchange in history?

'It's not that level. No one can beat that thing.'

Clump said.

"Sorry, Rai. I was foolish. There's no need to fight something like that. Run away."

It wasn't just Clump's thinking - soldiers from various nations were also fleeing in panic.

Ymir was dumbfounded.

"Afraid of dying?"

And yet they dared to speak of being strongest.

Abandoning his insistence on one-on-one combat, Ymir twisted his entire body and threw a straight punch.

"Mere insects!"

The shape of a fist was transparently imprinted in the air, and tremendous wind pressure struck the troops.

Whoooosh!

With bomb-like power, armored soldiers were torn to shreds.

'Total annihilation.'

Rai thought.

'There's no mercy for fleeing enemies. Only when facing him can we buy time.'

Could he do it?

'Damn.'

Honestly, his legs were shaking.

"Move quickly! If you stay here, you'll all die!"

The moment he heard Clump's words, Rai found himself kicking the ground and leaping out.

"Rai!"

'I'm sorry, Grandfather.'

That's the kind of guy he was after all.

The reason he wanted to become the strongest swordsman was because he wanted recognition from his family.

'Actually, I'm not even worthy of harboring grand sword ambitions.'

So.

'By any means necessary, I'll protect my family.'

Seeing Rai running against the flow among the fleeing enemies, Ymir smiled with satisfaction.

"Oh?"

Even that smile was terrible.

"Here I come!"

As Ymir's eyes bulged, Rai froze in his sword-raised stance.

"...Huh?"

Heart Fist.

Seeing him approach in a stance even beginners wouldn't use, Ymir twisted his waist.

"You guys are Ogents?"

Smile would weep.

As if dragging the entire world along, Ymir's fist approached Rai.

"Hm?"

At the same speed, Rai was moving away from the fist's range.

'Space is...'

And a blue-haired swordsman who slipped between them blocked Ymir's fist with a great straight sword.

Claaaang!

Even amid the mental confusion from the tremendous shockwave, people clearly saw it.

Or perhaps even this was an optical illusion?

A fire-breathing demon was leaping past Ymir's fist.

"You."

Ryan said.

"Who gave you permission to bully my family?"

Divine Transcendence

Asura Balvalta.

Ymir saw hundreds, thousands of arms extending from beyond Ryan's shoulders.

'Wow.'

The afterimages of fists, chaotic like a mandala pattern, converged into one before Ymir's solar plexus.

Pop!

The shockwave passed first, followed by the giant's body being pushed back dozens of meters.

"Grrrr!"

In that instant, Ymir intuited.

'Yes.'

Worthy of being called the strongest.
