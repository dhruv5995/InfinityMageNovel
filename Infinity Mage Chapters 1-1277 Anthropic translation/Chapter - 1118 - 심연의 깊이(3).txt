Depths of the Abyss (3)

"This is serious."

The Cheonganmun, the brain trust of the Moon Kingdom, watched as the Gapja plate floating on water began to rotate.

The laws of nature are embedded everywhere in the natural world, and water could be considered the most representative element of nature.

"This is the first time something like this has happened."

Even what appears to be still water contains countless particles moving within the fluid.

That is true chaos.

The Gapja plate was a divination device that responded to the movements of that chaos to map out the future.

"But for it to rotate?"

The impossibility of prediction meant that anything could happen.

"What's going on?"

When Mulyong appeared, all members of Cheonganmun rose from their seats and stepped aside.

"Your Majesty, you've arrived."

"I'm asking what's happening. People's positions suddenly changing in the banquet hall."

"Indeed."

The leader of Cheonganmun nodded.

"Your Majesty, the principles of the world are changing. This is something that could never occur naturally. Someone must be artificially manipulating the laws."

"Manipulating the laws? Who could do such a thing?"

"Most likely..."

The leader had an intuition.

"It must be Kitral of the Paras Kingdom. Originally, the Zodiac Twelve was comparable to our Cheonganmun, but they didn't have the ability to do something this extraordinary. They must have obtained something."

"Hmm."

The Moon Kingdom was the birthplace of divination, and Mulyong was not ignorant of the world's principles either.

"Then what should we do? If Paras's astrology is more powerful, it will be the Moon Kingdom that suffers the loss."

It was rendering the I Ching helpless.

"There are two methods, Your Majesty. The first is to adapt to the laws they're changing. With Cheonganmun's abilities, we should be able to respond nimbly."

Though it was sound reasoning, the feeling of bowing to a rival nation was unpleasant.

"What's the second method?"

The leader's eyes sharpened.

"A curse. We send a death curse to Kitral to make his mind unsound."

"...Would that be possible?"

"If he's the leader of a nation, his aura surpasses that of a tiger. Much preparation would be needed. However... if everything is properly arranged, it wouldn't be impossibly difficult."

"Hmm."

Mulyong fell into thought.

'Use Paras, or kill Paras. Either would be effective, but...'

His eyes flashed.

The Zodiac Twelve of Paras.

The hologram spread above Omang Star was densely packed with stars observable from the planet.

"Hmm."

Kitral, seated on the platform, watched the constellations.

'Quite tricky.'

Even Anke Ra, the administrator of the universe, only had the authority to reset the system.

The work of changing the system itself—fine-tuning—required absolute power from the outside world.

'If even slightly misaligned, the essence of the universe changes. One wrong move and it could all become nothingness.'

Changing the laws of the banquet hall was a kind of experiment for massive change.

"Your Majesty."

The door opened and an astrologer from the Zodiac Twelve brought a diagram of the banquet hall's condition.

"Fate has changed."

"Bring it here."

When the astrologer handed over the diagram, the viper around Kitral's neck bit it and brought it to him.

'Let's see.'

The special language used by astrologers could contain much information in short text.

"What's this?"

The astrologer couldn't see what Kitral was pointing at, but could guess.

"It's Cayden, born under the fate of the Red Cross Star. But in his right hand, there's a prison break phenomenon..."

"No, that's not important. It's going to happen anyway, and it's beyond control."

When the astrologer looked up, Kitral turned the diagram and pointed to one sentence.

"Sirone. According to the laws I designed, he should have moved exactly 32 meters. But... only 3 centimeters?"

"He is one who has mastered the mind. He's predicted to reach nearly identical conclusions from all causes. That's why Your Majesty permitted the exploration of the Pyramid of Truth, isn't it?"

To discover the location of God.

'Of course, but... he's far more powerful than expected. Soon he'll receive God in the Pyramid of Truth. If he persists to this degree, I might be the one in danger.'

"Nothing changes, Your Majesty."

"True."

The stronger Sirone's power to resist fate, the more precise God's coordinates become.

"I will change the laws of the world."

"We await your command."

As the astrologers of the Zodiac Twelve bowed their heads, Kitral spread both arms.

"I will become God."

Miro blinked her eyes.

"A strange dream?"

"Yeah. There's an ocean spread out, and a giant monster appears. If you're Miro, you couldn't not know."

"No. I don't have dreams like that."

"...You don't know?"

That was possible.

'It's just my imagination anyway. Reality is here.'

But why did his heart feel like it was tearing at the sight of Miro not remembering him?

"Think carefully. I saw you in a dream. You were trying to tell me something. Right?"

Gaold.

What was that woman trying to say in the dream?

"Dad, this man is weird. Let's go quickly."

Miro tugged at her father's hand.

Any parent would leave immediately, but unexpected words came from Sein's mouth.

"Wait... let me talk with him."

Sein's house had a cozy atmosphere. Gaold and Gangnan sat side by side on the sofa.

"What do you want to talk about?"

Watching his daughter playing with Arius on the floor, Sein said:

"I have those nightmares too."

Gaold and Gangnan's expressions went blank.

"That ocean you mentioned, that monster—they're still vividly in my memory."

Gangnan said:

"It could be coincidence. That's how dreams are. You can make connections however you want."

"Names come up."

Gangnan was angry at her husband's obsession.

"Stop saying stupid things! Even while suffering that unbearable pain, do you wish the nightmare was reality?"

How could that be good?

Just breathing felt like his throat was tearing, and every time he fought, he prayed he'd rather die.

Gaold clenched his fists.

'It doesn't hurt.'

Compared to the nightmare, this was heaven, but the problem was that he couldn't shake Miro's phantom voice.

"I understand."

Sein said.

"I don't want to go back to the nightmare either. I love my daughter too much. But..."

A thought suddenly occurred to him.

'Why a daughter?'

That trivial question was why he couldn't turn away from Gaold and had brought him here.

Gaold asked:

"Miro—I mean, your daughter—why doesn't she have dreams? Is she perhaps lying..."

"Miro doesn't lie. She may be stubborn, but she's a good child."

A good child.

As he was savoring those words, a sound came from the ceiling.

"Everyone's gathered."

Everyone who looked up widened their eyes.

"What..."

The wooden ceiling bulged like liquid, and a pale-faced boy descended.

"Sorry I'm late. I had trouble finding the drift point. I'm glad you're all safe."

"Who are you?"

The boy shook his head.

"As expected, it's become quite faded. Can't be helped. I'm called Mong-ah. I'm a dream designer. I was waiting at the deep layer entrance, but I had no choice but to come down."

"Dream designer? Deep layer entrance?"

It felt familiar yet unfamiliar, but no memories surfaced in their minds.

"I need your help. Please persuade Yahweh. He's been staring at the ocean all day."

Sein asked:

"Ocean? Where is there an ocean here?"

"You should know. Don't you all have dreams? So, like a kind of nightmare..."

The atmosphere became eerie.

"Of course I know. About being submerged under the sea too. My daughter doesn't seem to have nightmares though."

"Hm?"

Mong-ah's eyes calmly settled as he quietly observed Miro's condition.

'...I see.'

It was a very Miro-like decision.

"Let's go first. Time is running short. Miro did well, but waking Yahweh is urgent. Once we reach the beach, you'll understand everything."

If they could uncover the secret of the nightmare that tormented them daily, they'd do anything.

"Alright, let's go."

Leaving Sein's house, Mong-ah moved following the sound of waves.

'How could they not know?'

The group was shocked.

"I've never been on this road before. Living in this city for so long, and yet..."

"That's the kind of memory it is."

Mong-ah said.

"If you set the memory of living for 10 years as the cause, it really becomes the result of having lived for 10 years."

"Are you saying this is our first day?"

"Not exactly. I mean time is meaningless. That's the kind of world this is."

Sein looked around.

"What happened here?"

"Everything was swept away by Ymir's mind. It's proof that Master Luver was so desperate he couldn't restore the city."

Between buildings with only steel frames remaining, a white beach was visible, and beyond it, the blue ocean.

Hearing the sound of waves directly felt refreshing.

"Hm?"

In front of the waves rolling in with foam, a boy sat in a dejected posture.

"Sirone."

Approaching to look, it was the face from the dream, but his eyes had lost their vitality.

"Five Great Stars, I brought your friends. Pull yourself together. We have to go fight again."

Mong-ah shook his head.

"He won't say anything. He's lost the will to act. Though I can't say I don't understand."

"Why?"

"It seems he activated a dream barrier to withstand the water pressure affecting the mind of the abyss. This beach we're seeing is proof of that. It means we've come out of the ocean. Anyway, we won't receive mental attacks here. Because such things don't happen."

"What kind of things?"

"Aren't you all satisfied with this reality? An integrated dream combines everyone's individual dreams. In other words, everyone's wishes connect to create one world."

"Are you saying we wanted this situation?"

"It's the closest result. Miro realized it when the dream barrier was activated. So she erased all her memories. That image was manifested as a child."

"Why did she have to do that?"

"To avoid hurting Gaold."

Mong-ah raised his index finger.

"Dreams are the fulfillment of desires. If Miro were an adult, Gaold would have loved her even while enduring pain. Of course, no one knows where that might have led. With everyone's desires mixing, she might have ended up as Sein's wife instead."

Sein let out a hollow laugh.

If Mong-ah's words were true, he had been rejected by Miro even in the dream.

'An iron wall.'

"That's why she erased her memories. The only world where Gaold could be happy. Something absolutely impossible in reality. That's what Miro wished for."

"Honestly, there's no way out. The moment we leave here, we'll all be annihilated. I had hopes because the Five Great Stars seemed to realize something, but in this state, it's impossible. Just living here wouldn't be a bad choice either."

Gaold turned his head.

"Yay! It's the ocean, the ocean!"

"Woof! Woof!"

Miro's face was beaming with joy as she ran across the white sand with Arius.
