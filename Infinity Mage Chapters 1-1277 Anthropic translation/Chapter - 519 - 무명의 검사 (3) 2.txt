[519] The Nameless Prosecutor (3)

When Liz returned home, Rian and Silvia were in the middle of a conversation.

According to what Rian had heard, most of the executives of the Red Spear Bandit Group were composed of remnant soldiers from the Kingdom of Baiden.

In particular, the leader was a man in his mid-forties named Peikon, who had served at the border garrison and held the position of infantry battalion commander before the border was pushed back.

'An infantry battalion commander.'

Having traveled countless battlefields, Rian could gauge Peikon's martial prowess just from hearing his name.

Perhaps not in the kingdom's capital, but in fierce war zones where battles raged, rank became a direct measure of skill.

Especially for a battalion commander in the border region where both nations' pride was at stake—nothing other than ability was considered.

"Hmm, why would such a person become a bandit?"

"I don't know. He might be tired, or there could be personal circumstances..."

Silvia hesitated for a moment before speaking her true thoughts.

"But in the end, isn't that just what humans are like?"

Rian found himself convinced by her final words.

There might be circumstances.

But perhaps it was simply because he was human—choosing evil while seeking a slightly better path.

"Red Spear Peikon is known even in enemy countries. That's why the Baiden security forces can't easily lay a hand on him. They've established their base on Arch Mountain, three kilometers from here, and are expanding their influence by plundering nearby villages."

Fox, whom Rian had cut down, was also part of this expansion that Silvia mentioned.

"Arch Mountain..."

"Brother."

As Liz approached, Rian, belatedly realizing, apologized.

"I'm sorry. I showed you something terrible."

"It's okay. I wasn't really surprised."

While seeing corpses couldn't be pleasant, after seeing them daily, they only evoked about as much disgust as cockroaches.

"Tell me honestly. Brother, you're really famous, aren't you? You lied because you were afraid people would flock to you if you revealed your real name, right?"

"No. My name is Rian. And I'm not famous either. The bandits were just weak. I definitely didn't win because I was strong."

Liz hung her head dejectedly.

"But we... we're being beaten by even those weak bandits."

Rian had nothing to say to that.

Being weak wasn't a sin, but on the battlefield, such words were merely hollow ideals.

"I'd like to rest a bit. My wounds haven't fully healed yet."

Rian escaped the uncomfortable situation and entered his room.

As Silvia watched the firmly closed door with a worried expression, Liz nestled in her arms and asked.

"Mom, what will we do if brother leaves?"

"Liz, it's wrong to expect too much from others. Brother saved us, didn't he?"

"But I hate this now. I don't want to live like this anymore."

Who would want to remain in suffering?

But Silvia couldn't tell her young daughter the harsh reality.

One thing she had learned from living in this world was that you couldn't know about things you hadn't experienced.

In her youth, she too had spouted many words about what life was like and how one should live, but when she directly faced those situations, she had felt emotions completely different from the words she had uttered—and not just once or twice.

"Liz, you'll understand when you live longer. No one can understand you perfectly. But you have mom. Mom will protect you."

"I don't like mom protecting me. I wish someone would protect mom."

Silvia smiled sadly.

That too would be a fear a young child could have.

"Mom will try talking to him once. But even if no one helps us, mom will always be on your side."

Silvia hugged Liz tightly.

Rian didn't come out of his room until deep into the night.

He had skipped meals since breakfast, but the overwhelming burden on his shoulders made him forget even his hunger.

'Red Spear Peikon. A battalion commander?'

When he had dueled with his brother at the Ozent family, Ozent Rai had been an 8th-grade sergeant.

Of course, the Rai that Rian knew was a genius, so he didn't think for a moment that by Peikon's age, he would be merely a battalion commander.

But comparing just their current abilities, there was a strong possibility that Peikon surpassed Rai.

'Could I... defeat him?'

According to Silvia, the Red Spear Bandit Group had seven executives.

Among them, including Fox, there were three vice-leaders, so the number of subordinates would certainly exceed three digits.

He would have to fight all of them.

He would have to face alone a bandit group that even the kingdom's security forces had given up on.

'I'll die.'

If he was going to die anyway, was there really a reason to fight?

Justice that cannot be enforced is not justice.

'I don't know, Shirone. What should I do...'

Knock knock.

As Rian spent the night in anguish, he heard knocking.

"It's Silvia."

"Please come in."

Silvia opened the door and entered.

Seeing Rian sitting on the bed with no signs of having lain down, she sat in a chair with a somewhat relieved expression.

"What brings you here at this hour..."

"I wanted to thank you for your help. You're a benefactor to me and my daughter."

Rian reflected on his journey of knightly conduct.

More than half of those who had called him a benefactor eventually came to call Rian their enemy.

That's what responsibility was like.

"I only fought for myself. The bandits would have killed me anyway."

Silvia nodded as if she understood.

As the silence lengthened, Rian, unable to bear it, spoke honestly first.

"I'm sorry. I can't handle the bandit group alone. The border security forces have given up, and the villagers won't step forward either."

"I'm ashamed. This wasn't always such a desolate place."

The problem was that those who could fight had already died or joined the bandit group.

"I'll leave in the morning. I'm sorry."

"I'm not asking you to annihilate the bandit group, Sir Knight."

"Then what?"

When Rian looked up, Silvia averted her gaze and said.

"Could you become Liz's father?"

Rian waited for what would follow without showing emotion.

It was such an absurd thing to say.

"I'm sorry. At thirty-three, I couldn't bring myself to say the word marriage, so I sold my daughter instead. But I'm sincere. Of course, I'm not asking you to stay by our side forever. Just five years, no, even just three years—until Liz can leave this place and live in the world—couldn't you stay by our side?"

Rian felt his chest tighten.

If he refused the proposal, would he once again become the enemy who ruined Liz's life?

"I'll be a good wife."

As the silence lengthened, Silvia seemed to steel her resolve, bowed her head, and began to untie her clothes.

Relying on Fox, her husband's friend, had been something more hateful than death.

But if it wasn't quite that disgusting, she knew what a woman alone would give up to protect her daughter.

Rian firmly extended his hand.

"I'm sorry."

Silvia's shameful gesture stopped abruptly.

Since there were countless men who would spend just one night and leave, even she hadn't anticipated this situation.

"I have someone in my heart. And this method won't change my mind."

"I see."

Silvia adjusted her clothes and stood up.

Having nothing more to give, there was nothing more to demand.

"Still, thank you. Fox was... truly a despicable bastard. I'll pack some food, so please take it in the morning."

Since meeting would only be embarrassing for both of them, Silvia showed such consideration for Rian and left the room.

Silence returned once more, and moonlight entered through the window.

Rian spent the remaining time lost in anguish.

Things he could and couldn't do flowed by without criteria.

As dawn approached, Rian's confused gaze gradually regained stability.

He inserted his greatsword into the leather scabbard on his back and left the room to find a bundle of food that Silvia had prepared in advance.

Rian briefly looked back at the room where the mother and daughter were sleeping.

"..."

Without touching anything, he slowly opened the door and went outside.

He would never return to Rifne Village again.

One hour after Rian left, Silvia's house was deafeningly noisy with Liz's crying.

"Mom! Brother left! He abandoned us and left!"

"No, Liz. Brother went his own way."

"Waaaah!"

Perhaps understanding the world a little even with her young heart, Liz stopped talking and just cried.

Then someone knocked on the door from outside.

"Is anyone there? I'd like to ask something."

Silvia didn't let down her guard and cracked the door open to look outside.

Then she immediately wore a dazed expression and raised her head to the edge of the threshold.

A physique that deviated from average human proportions.

He was over two meters tall, and his shoulders were wide enough to get stuck in the doorway.

In her experience, this type always handled swords.

When the man bent his waist and suddenly thrust his face forward, Silvia startled and stepped backward.

He had a long face like a sweet potato, thick eyelashes, and a thin mustache growing beneath his hooked nose.

"Ah, sorry for startling you. May I come in for a moment...?"

Silvia hugged Liz and asked.

"What do you want?"

Without asking permission, the man barged into the house, followed by a subordinate who barely reached his chest level.

The subordinate wasn't short either, but compared to the man wearing black iron armor and carrying an intricately crafted iron sword, he looked like a dwarf.

The man sniffed around meaninglessly, then nodded as if he understood something.

"I heard that a few days ago, a knight with blue hair carrying a greatsword came to this village. Have you seen him by any chance?"

Blue hair and a greatsword—there was only one person that could describe.

"No. I don't know such a person. Please leave."

"Hmm, is that so?"

The man pulled out a table chair and sat down stubbornly.

Every single action conveyed intimidation to the mother and daughter.

"I'm late with introductions. I'm Ramdas, a knight errant. I held an official position in a distant country, but got wanderlust in my old age and have been wandering aimlessly."

Ramdas rattled off things no one had asked about.

"Then I heard a rumor on the wind. A story about a young prosecutor with blue hair carrying a greatsword."

"I told you I don't know such a person!"

"Yes. He's not that famous a figure. But I don't evaluate people by their reputation. Especially since that young prosecutor's activities have particularly piqued my interest."

Silvia gave up and closed her mouth.

"The corpses that young man cut down—of course, some might have been lucky hits, but certain corpses show consistency. Namely, magnificence!"

When Ramdas slammed the table with a bang, the mother and daughter's shoulders jumped.

"Everything was finished with a single sword stroke, they say. Horses, armor, shields, weapons—he ignored everything and cut through it all."

Fox's final moments came to Silvia's mind.

"Perhaps that's why he's being evaluated as a rising star among knight errants. Thanks to that magnificent swordsmanship, he seems to have recently earned the nickname 'Knight of Maha.'"

"Knight of Maha?"

"Yes. It means something vast like the sky, sea, or earth. But I heard—well, I heard from a villager—that yesterday morning a young man cut a person named Fox into pieces along with his sword and armor. And I also heard from a villager that this young man was staying here."

Silvia's lips trembled.

"Do you really... not know?"

Ramdas's pretty, feminine eyes pierced into Silvia's heart like an awl.
