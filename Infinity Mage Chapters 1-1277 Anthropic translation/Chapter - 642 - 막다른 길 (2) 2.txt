[642] Dead End (2)

Everyone fell silent, but their thoughts seemed to leap out and weigh heavily on the air.

Refusing a royal decree while already knowing the circumstances was a challenge to state authority, and Lyman's shoulders trembled with rage.

"How dare you! Do you know what the crime of insulting royalty is? You deserve to be executed!"

Now that Amy's acceptance had been confirmed, Shirone had nothing to fear.

"I'm not being arrogant, nor am I opposing the kingdom. I'm simply saying that I've done nothing wrong."

"You...!"

Just as Lyman was about to explode, Pony could no longer bear it and turned to leave.

"Lady Pony!"

With the party who should receive the apology gone, Lyman couldn't get his bearings either.

He could only resent Shirone for creating this situation.

"You'll pay dearly for your choice! Keep your neck ready and wait!"

Though he wanted to tear Shirone apart immediately, he had no choice due to the royal palace's expectations.

As Lyman disappeared, students rushed over.

"Senior Shirone! Will you really be okay?"

Shirone only looked back at Amy, grateful for her reassuring smile.

'Amy.'

Could one think of the mind apart from the body?

Whatever the outcome, the distance between them would only grow further now.

In the Alpheas Magic School conference room, as teachers exchanged glances, Saad stood up abruptly.

"I'll say this prepared to be cursed at. I think we should pass the proposal to delay Shirone's graduation by one year."

Though it was the most realistic alternative, Sheena's emotions couldn't accept it.

"Shirone achieved scores that will remain in the kingdom's history. If we cancel his graduation like this, Alpheas Magic School will also become a laughingstock of history."

"But it's a royal decree. If we're not careful, it could cause serious damage to Alpheas Magic School."

"That doesn't mean we can sacrifice a student to politics! Teachers have a duty to protect their students!"

As Sheena slammed the desk, Saad also raised his voice.

"Shirone could graduate next year anyway! When a storm comes, ships must take shelter. If you try to push through, everyone will sink to the bottom of the sea!"

Alpheas let out a long groan.

'How did it come to this?'

He had recorded the highest grades in the kingdom's history, but being too excellent had become poison instead.

Olivia spoke up.

"Commoners have weak foundations so they're easy to shake, but they also don't have as strong a sense of belonging to the state as nobles do. That's what made the royal palace uneasy. If he had been a noble, they would have followed normal negotiation procedures."

"So you're on the side of waiting and watching?"

"We have no choice. Even rationality is created within a system. With the royal decree issued, there's nothing we can do."

Though Alpheas could unilaterally allow Shirone to graduate, the aftermath would truly be tremendous.

"My head aches."

Sighing, Alpheas quietly left the conference room where all sorts of arguments were taking place.

"Where's Shirone?"

Ned arrived at the dormitory and opened the door, but only Amy and Iruki remained.

"He went out saying he wanted to get some fresh air."

"He's not thinking something strange, is he? Like leaving school, for example."

"He's not that stupid. Nothing's been decided yet. Let's wait and see what position the royal palace takes. They might offer a better negotiation deal."

As the day filled with talk of Shirone drew to a close, Pony sat lost in thought without even touching water.

'I just wanted to become a mage.'

From the moment she realized that qualification wasn't something that could be obtained at any time, she had lost everything in her life.

Sitting at her desk with a pen, Pony wrote out a suicide note, adding at the end a request to allow Shirone's graduation.

She climbed on a chair, hung a rope from the ceiling beam, tied a noose, and pushed her face through it like a necklace.

Finally, she wondered if this method was truly the best choice.

"I'm sorry, Mother."

Without a moment's hesitation, she jumped from the chair, and all her weight concentrated on her slender neck.

'What?'

Pony's tightly shut eyelids slowly opened.

Her heart pounded violently at the death signal from her brain, and only after a moment did she realize someone was holding her legs.

Pony's eyes widened as she looked down.

"Shirone?"

Shirone was looking up at her with a smile.

"This isn't good, Pony."

Was it really Shirone?

Thinking she might already be dead and seeing a vision, she twisted her body slightly, but realistic pain choked her neck.

"Ugh!"

Just before the weight could be applied, a Wind Cutter severed the rope, and Pony's body collapsed to the floor like a doll.

"Are you okay?"

She supported herself with both hands on the ground and turned away from Shirone.

"Why did you come?"

"I was worried you might do this."

"So why did you come?! I was trying to die. If I die, you'll be able to graduate too, so why are you saving me?"

Shirone didn't answer.

"Go back. I think I can still die once more. If you miss this opportunity, your life is over."

"It's not your fault, Pony."

Pony's face hardened.

"Not my fault? Do you think I'd believe such lies? Be honest. Say that you wish I would die, that you wish I would die so all of this could be undone!"

"I didn't say I wasn't angry."

Shirone crouched down beside Pony.

"I wish everything would work out well too. But it's not your fault. So you don't need to die."

Both the fact that she had shown him her final moments of life extinguishing and the current situation of receiving comfort from Shirone were miserable.

"What do you want?"

Pony whipped her head around.

"What do you want me to do for you? Money? Power? A title? Take it all. You can take everything, so please just end this!"

"I want nothing from you. What I want isn't something anyone can give me. And I've already obtained it. Right now, in this moment, being able to think and act like this."

As Shirone placed a hand on her shoulder, Pony's lips turned down.

"So don't feel guilty. Even if no one gives me some qualification, I'm already a mage now."

"I'm sor..."

The words she truly wanted to say burst out, and she threw herself into Shirone's arms.

"I'm sorry! I'm really sorry, Shirone! I... I...!"

Patting Pony's back, Shirone whispered.

"It's okay. It's not your fault."

"I must have gone crazy. I'm sorry!"

Being able to become a mage whenever one wanted wasn't how it worked.

'If I can't accept it myself, then I haven't truly obtained it.'

Just then, a Mage Association staff member who had heard Pony's voice opened the door.

"What! How did you get in here?"

Confirming the window was open, the staff member took a combat stance.

"Damn! What are the perimeter guards doing!"

"Stop."

Pony, stepping out of Shirone's embrace, approached them.

"But Lady Pony! Shirone is under absolute prohibition orders from the association..."

"Are you bringing up the association's authority in front of me right now?"

"Ugh!"

The association staff members shrank back at the changed atmosphere.

The aura emanating from the kingdom's most noble bloodline wasn't something that could be obtained through training or study.

Turning her head, Pony spoke with a gentle expression.

"Shirone, go back now."

"But you..."

"I'm fine. I won't waver anymore. I'll stay at school. And I will definitely become a mage."

Realizing Pony's determination, Shirone finally smiled with relief and headed toward the window.

"Good luck, Pony."

"You too."

As soon as the words ended, Shirone jumped out.

The association staff members reflexively rushed over, but no one could find any trace of him after he cast Shining Impact.

"Let Arian Shirone graduate! Students cannot tolerate the kingdom's unjust treatment!"

Members of the emergency committee formed around the student council gathered at the faculty building and held a demonstration.

Since even Pony, who was the party involved in this matter, had sided with the committee, the impact was considerable, and the teachers also seemed to subtly hope to follow the students' opinions.

"We understand everyone's intentions. We are currently preparing the necessary documents..."

Olivia, the faculty meeting inspector, came out with the teachers to convey the school's position when.

"What's all this commotion!"

Lyman rushed over leading soldiers.

"Please let Arian Shirone graduate!"

"It's a royal decree! Do you all want to be arrested for treason?"

As some students flinched, Pony raised her head and stepped forward.

"If you're going to arrest anyone, you'll have to start with me."

"Miss Pony! Why are you doing this?"

Lyman couldn't understand at all.

If she had just kept quiet, Shirone's graduation would have been canceled, and she might even have taken one of the positions in Tio.

What I want to obtain isn't something others can give me.

Recalling Shirone's words, Pony swept her arm horizontally.

"Stand back. By the unique authority of royalty, I will request a special inspection system from the royal palace. I will thoroughly reveal what figures are involved in this matter and how much illegal funding changed hands."

"Waaaaah!"

As if joining Pony's declaration, the students burst into cheers.

'Still young.'

As the blade of judgment tightened around his neck, Lyman actually became calmer.

"Make all the requests you want. However, Shirone's graduation will be suspended until the trial ends."

Now that it had come to this, the only option was to drag it into a mud fight and buy time.

Anyway, if Shirone couldn't graduate, the backlash would die down too.

"Miss Pony. In any case, the royal decree is still valid. If you don't disperse the students, we'll have no choice but to arrest them all."

Since it wouldn't be just a threat, Olivia stepped forward.

"Everyone go back for now..."

"Excuse me."

At the voice heard from behind the teachers, they turned their heads, but the owner of the voice was already walking toward the committee.

'An incredible master.'

Even Olivia, a certified 2nd class mage, couldn't sense the movement of this skilled individual.

The man had as kind an appearance as his pure white robe, but his eyes were sharp, and his long black hair was tied up on top of his head.

With his left hand behind his back, he gently waved a fan with a small bell attached as he spoke.

"Hmm... so what was the name again? Shi-something."

"Shirone. How many times have I told you?"

From inside the man's robe, a creature with the tiny body of a newborn appeared.

Its skin was crimson red, the area around its eyes was black like a panda's, and it had a long tail like a spear.

"Is there someone called Arian Shirone here?"

After wondering briefly at the strange speech pattern, they snapped to attention at the name Shirone.

"I'm Arian Shirone. Who might you be?"

The man, who had been staring intently at the approaching Shirone, hurriedly patted down his body.

"Uh, well, I am... Where did I put it?"

The red-skinned creature sighed and held out a badge with three overlapping pentagrams.

'Stars. And three-star grade at that.'

Everyone who knew the meaning of the three stars trembled in shock.

"We came from the Ivory Tower's Balance Department. We have something to tell Arian Shirone."

"The, the Ivory Tower?"

As students murmured, the man with the fan extended his hand to Shirone.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Arte."

Ivory Tower 3-star resident, Ghost Goblin Castle Arte.

"And I'm satellite Tokay."

Tokay, grinning like a mischievous child, held out a badge with orbital patterns drawn on it next to Arte's badge.
