Electric Civilization (3)

After the battle with the Jagra Pirates ended, the refugee fleet reorganized their formation.

Thanks to quickly capturing Jagra, the Arachne sailing ship barely managed to avoid capsizing.

"The treasure is safe."

Those were the first words Cairns spoke.

"We're in your debt once again. It seems the Arachne Knights weren't of much help."

The lack of political remarks was likely because he had already grasped Sirone's nature.

"Results are the sum of all causes. I don't think it's a good idea to assign merit and fault based on individual parts."

Sirone turned around.

"By the way..."

Jagra knelt there, bound with rope, his mouth hanging open in a daze.

Through the mental technique of Confinement, Jagra's ego had been locked away in the depths of his brain.

"You'd better think carefully. You might end up living forever trapped in the prison of your body."

Jagra's pupils shook with shock, but that was all the reaction he could show.

"It won't work. The only person Jagra fears is his older brother, Kalt."

The Great Pirate, known as the King of Dionas.

"What kind of person is he?"

The Kalt that Sirone remembered from Omega was only up to age twenty-four, a combat soldier in a mid-level pirate crew.

Even then he was someone with a serpent's heart, but compared to Jagra's madness, he was rather ordinary.

"I'd like to define him as a strange person. He calls himself a prophet. Someone who lives buried in his own doctrine. He's also the most diplomatically difficult type to deal with."

"Hmm, a prophet."

Ancient civilization, electric technology, prophet.

The mysterious fragments formed some kind of shape, but even that was nothing more than a giant question mark.

"He's someone who doesn't respond to profit-loss calculations, so Arachne has had trouble with him too. Perhaps it was fortunate that he wanted Rangi. Of course, if he comes out like this, that's a different story."

Poine spoke.

"I don't know why there are gaps in the Messiah's Omega. However, what I can tell you is that Maika is a virtual continent that humanity calls an ultra-ancient civilization. It's said to have been somewhere in the Ten Island Kingdoms of the archipelago, in the South Pacific, but the accepted theory is that it has now sunk beneath the sea."

"A virtual continent. Does that mean it couldn't be verified, even with a dragon's capabilities?"

"The Omega protected by Karatorsa, the Radiant Dragon, was transmitted only to the Messiah. Since we couldn't access it, transmission errors cannot be specified. However, when the Core was present, information exchange between the Twelve Apostles was possible. Based on that, several clues come to mind, but Kaios the Water Dragon knows more details than I do."

The reason he passed the matter to Kaios despite sharing the same information was due to subtle feelings that couldn't be conveyed without direct confirmation.

After resting and waiting, Kaios returned from blocking the tsunami and landed on the deck.

"Messiah, I have returned. Based on my analysis of the continental plate movements, the next earthquake will occur in 48 hours."

"Good work."

Sirone explained everything from the battle with the pirates to the story about Maika's artifacts.

"Such a thing happened. I apologize for not being by your side. If I had been there..."

"Never mind that. What I want to know about is the Maika ruins. If the continent sank, there's no way you wouldn't have confirmed it while touring the world's oceans, right?"

Kaios spoke heavily.

"To start with the conclusion, the Maika civilization is presumed to have actually existed."

"Presumed?"

"Yes. First, regarding the pirate crew's abilities that you're curious about, Messiah, they are likely the influence of OOPArts. Meaning artifacts that transcend time, and this designation is quite accurate. The chronology of the ultra-ancient civilization I investigated..."

Kaios's expression became serious.

"Is at least 2 billion years ago. In other words, it's from an era when even the dragon race didn't exist."

Sirone, who had cross-referenced with Omega's records, blinked.

"But why don't I remember it? No, before that, if OOPArts exist, doesn't that mean Maika actually existed?"

"That's the problem. While the accepted theory is that it sank in the South Pacific, over time the ruins have scattered to various parts of the ocean. I've confirmed over seventy locations myself. However, those ruins all share a common characteristic."

"What characteristic?"

"There are no traces of humans or living beings having lived there."

Silence flowed.

"What do you mean by that? OOPArts areâ€”"

"Yes, artificial products. Items containing technologies like spatial jumping or magnetic barrier shields couldn't occur naturally. The ruins also contain traces of civilization. But no one existed there."

"It's truly strange. Creating something requires a subject to exist. But Maika is the opposite. There's civilization, sites, and tools, but no subject."

"Outside of causality..."

Suddenly he thought of fish living in an aquarium.

'A fish simply swims in its own world. But if some human dropped a ring into the aquarium...'

Wouldn't that ring appear to the fish as an artificial product without a subject?

'Then even if the fish had an Omega of the aquarium, it couldn't know about the ring.'

Kaios continued.

"The reason I lost interest in ultra-ancient civilizations was ultimately because what you see is all there is. Since there was no subject that enjoyed the civilization, no imagination could be exercised."

"What about the OOPArts?"

"It's difficult to say anything about that. They're clearly tools with definite uses, but I couldn't find the method of using them. In short, I couldn't even guess what they were used for."

Poine interjected.

"If biological intelligence is also limited by the universe, perhaps concepts that don't exist in the universe need to be incorporated. All Twelve Apostles tried, but ultimately failed."

Sirone looked back at Jagra.

"But he used it, didn't he? No, before that, how were you so certain that spatial jumping was a function of the OOPArts?"

"Because of electricity."

Kaios said.

"Objects without subjects can only be interpreted as they are. The only conclusion I reached after acquiring OOPArts was that weak electricity was flowing through them."

Sirone listened more carefully.

"It was amazing. An object over 2 billion years old still hadn't discharged. So I tried to delve deeper into that aspect, but..."

"But?"

"It disappeared."

"What did? The OOPArts?"

"I don't know. What disappeared might have been the OOPArts, but it could also have been my memory."

Poine's eyes were shrouded in darkness.

"Messiah, we don't know about OOPArts. We only know they're some kind of tool using electricity. When we tried to go beyond that, we confirmed that the dragon race's mental network suffered serious damage."

Kaios took over.

"We suspect it was a powerful magnetic field. Of course, the OOPArts might have really disappeared, but the feeling at the time was very alien. As if they had never existed from the beginning, a phenomenon where the brain rejects sensation." 

Poine said.

"When such incidents repeated, Karatorsa prohibited investigation of OOPArts. There was a risk of damage to the Omega logs he protects, and artifacts from 2 billion years ago aren't that important to the Apostle of Time who guards human history."

Sirone asked.

"What did they look like? The OOPArts, I mean."

"There were various types, but the forms themselves weren't special. Some were like cubes, others like trays. Of course, their uses would be completely different from what we think."

"Hmm, couldn't we get one?"

"Why do you ask?"

"While dragon intelligence couldn't uncover it, I thought human insight might be different."

And Sirone knew someone whose insight into forms had reached humanity's peak.

'Arin.'

Her unprejudiced super-senses could penetrate the true meaning of all forms.

'She should be exploring archaeological sites with Canis. I need to determine their location first.'

Through Simultaneous Events, Sirone asked Rampa about Canis's whereabouts, then continued.

"Anyway, Jagra actually used OOPArts. Even without properly knowing their function."

Poine looked back at Jagra.

"Then how about asking directly? If you leave it to me, I'll make him talk within 2 hours."

Sirone wore a troubled expression.

"Seeing that he has no will to speak, he really seems not to know. Confinement is a fear that's hard for humans to endure. Since we'll arrive at Dionas tomorrow anyway, it seems faster to ask Kalt."

Poine smiled benevolently.

"Consider it a favor."

That night.

"Aaaaah! Aaaaah!"

Heart-rending screams powerfully decorated the deck of the Arachne sailing ship.

And as the promised 2 hours were nearly up, for the first time, human words rather than screams were heard.

"I don't know! I really don't know!"

Poine grabbed the head of Jagra, who was sweating enough to become dehydrated.

"Hoho, right. You don't know. Well then, shall we start over from there? This time..."

Jagra burst into tears.

"I really don't know! My brother knows! It's true! I don't even remember!"

"Don't deprecate yourself too much. You're an intelligent person. So you'll remember soon."

"It's true... He put something in. My brother, he put something in my head. After that, I can't remember. I just don't know! Damn it!"

Poine's gaze turned cold.

'It seems to be true.'

If, as Sirone thought, the OOPArts' magnetic field was the type that also affected humans...

"Endure just 2 more hours. If you can say the same thing then, I'll believe you."

"No, wait. Hey, you crazy... Aaaaah!"

The screams that had echoed all evening disappeared, and dawn came when everyone had fallen into deep sleep.

Sirone came out alone on deck to look at the stars.

'What could be there?'

No, perhaps the answer humanity should seek is fundamentally different.

'Why is it there?'

He sensed someone's presence.

Turning his head, he saw Rangi approaching in a robe, still damp from washing.

"Rangi, you're not sleeping?"

"No, I woke up. I ate breakfast, exercised, and just finished washing."

Looking at the stars, it was 5 AM.

"There's something important in Dionas, isn't there? That's why you're trying to negotiate with the king."

Sirone remained silent.

"I'll go to Kalt. I had to go anyway, but my feelings weren't good about it. But now it's okay. If I can at least be helpful to you, Sirone..."

Rangi frowned.

"What's with that smile? I'm being serious. I'm saying I'll go for your sake, Sirone."

"You don't need to worry. Nothing will happen to you, Rangi."

Sirone looked at the horizon where dawn was breaking.

'Whatever it is doesn't matter.'

Whatever lies beyond the sea, he just needed to do what he could do right now.

'Only that...'

Must be the reason we need to exist.

"Ah, over there."

At the place Rangi pointed to with an ecstatic expression, golden land glimmered faintly in the distance.

It was Dionas, the pirates' country.
