Apostasy (3)

Rian had a dream.

No, perhaps it was signals embedded at the genetic level manifesting as images through the dream.

Ymir gazed down indifferently at Smile, who had perfectly transformed into human form.

"Did he really leave?"

The only injury from his attack was a single molar.

Though he could regenerate it anytime with his true body, he had no desire to do so.

"This doesn't feel satisfying."

The feeling of incompleteness was even more unpleasant than the emptiness he'd felt after destroying countless weaklings until now.

He wanted to fight until his whole body was shattered.

A battle so difficult that even spitting blood, screaming in rage, and unleashing all his power wouldn't be enough.

Among Ymir's natural enemies, besides Ashur of Ichael's Triangle, he could count several on his fingers, but Ozent was the first to clash power against power and drive him to his limits.

'This world is too light.'

As Ymir reached toward the sun and clenched his fist tightly, the air shook from side to side.

"It doesn't even feel real."

A world made of paper that crumbles the moment you touch it, before you can even savor the sensation.

For him, a worthy opponent was the only tool that could make all his senses sharp and vivid.

"Did you kill him?"

Cariel, who had taken a hit from Ozent, approached with dirt-covered body.

As his sacred light body emitted radiance, his injured flesh quickly healed, but his expression remained grim.

"No, he's sleeping."

"What do you mean?"

Ymir pointed at Smile.

"He collapsed the boundaries of biology and devolved. He returned to his original form and merged with the woman."

"That's impossible."

At the end of cells converging through devolution was Argones, called the father of all life.

"It violates Argones' law. No creature can become mucus on its own."

They called the featureless life form itself mucus.

"It's impossible."

Ymir nodded readily.

"But he transcended that impossibility and reached it. Form is merely the shadow of specific signals. As long as the sun is up..."

As Ymir stomped on his own shadow, the ground sank a span deep with a thud.

"The shadow cannot be destroyed."

It can only be transformed.

"This is why he could reach apostasy with a mere human body. To destroy him, you'd need to break not the shadow, but..." 

Ymir looked up at the sky.

"The sun itself."

Cariel, who had been lost in thought, opened cold eyes and approached Smile.

"This works out better anyway."

The element of apostasy had disappeared on its own, and if he killed Smile, there would be no more dangerous factors.

"I'll kill this woman."

There was no need to use angelic judgment—he just needed to cut her throat.

"Wait."

Ymir stopped Cariel.

"You can't kill that woman."

He had made that promise with Ozent so that he could return someday to settle their match.

"Don't get cocky, Ymir."

Power filled Cariel's eyes.

"You've already violated the principles of apostasy yourself. Even if it's Anke Ra's orders, if you stop me, you'll face severe punishment."

"I don't care."

The spot where Ozent had hit him still throbbed.

"For a while, everything will feel empty anyway."

Cariel's face twisted with fury at how easily Ymir deflected the archangel's killing intent.

"Tch!"

But in the end, he had no choice but to turn away.

Unlike Ozent, against a giant who had reached apostasy through pure force alone, he had no chance of winning.

'Only Ra can stop Ymir now.'

As Cariel watched him move away, Smile made a small groaning sound and opened her eyes.

"Ugh..."

After tossing and turning briefly, she suddenly opened her eyes wide, confirmed Ymir's face three meters above her, and shot up.

"Brother!"

Ozent was nowhere to be seen.

Belatedly realizing she was naked, she stepped back and glared at Ymir.

"Who are you?"

"The King of Giants."

Unable to explain the current situation, Smile finally asked.

"Where's my brother?"

"You already died once."

Ymir told her about Ozent's actions while she had been trapped.

"...That's how you were able to come back to life. Cherish the life he gave you."

"Brother..."

Smile stroked her belly.

In a way, this too was a technique of transformation, but she felt no fear or disgust.

'Brother is inside me.'

Together forever.

"What will you do now? If you want to go to heaven, follow me. I'll protect you until then."

Smile shook her head.

"No. I'll stay here."

"Stay?"

From what he'd seen from the sky, humans seemed to exist here, but it would be a completely different society from heaven.

"Are you serious? You might never be able to return. You'd be abandoning your family and homeland."

"No. A new life is beginning."

Smile looked beyond the forest.

"My name is Smile."

Then after thinking for a moment, she smiled and looked back at Ymir.

"Ozent Smile."

Confirming the sincerity in her eyes, Ymir nodded and turned around.

"We'll meet again someday."

A single bat followed Ymir from high in the sky as he entered the forest.

'What a strange dream.'

Awakening from the dream, Rian felt his body heavy as a thousand pounds as he slowly opened his eyes.

A blade was falling toward his throat.

'What?!'

He reflexively raised his hand to block it, and the sharp sword cut into his forearm.

"Hup!"

His muscles twisted like a whirlpool and bit down on the blade.

He avoided being cut, but the scene that entered Rian's eyes as he came to his senses was shocking.

The hunters were fighting numerous soldiers, and Jenia was also wielding her Dark Blade in combat.

"Rian!"

The moment Jenia shouted, Zaib soldiers thrust their spears at Rian.

As seven spearheads entered Rian's body, the middle sections of the spear shafts swelled like balloons and split apart.

"H-how..."

How was it possible to block steel with a human body?

Rian glared at the terrified soldiers, wrinkled his nose bridge, and kicked off from the bed.

'Where's my sword?'

〈Idea〉 was nowhere to be seen.

"Attack everyone! Kill him no matter what!"

As the captain shouted, all the soldiers who had been fighting the hunters rushed at Rian.

"Hmph!"

As Rian threw a punch with a snort, the soldiers' armor caved in, breaking their bones.

"Gack!"

As soldiers scattered in all directions like an explosion had occurred in the center, Jenia approached.

"What happened? No matter how much I shouted, you wouldn't wake up! You slept for three days."

"Three days?"

No matter how difficult the battle had been, his mental strength wasn't weak enough to sleep for three straight days.

'Wasn't it a dream?'

It must have been a forced state of unconsciousness.

"My sword?"

Jenia spoke with a grim expression.

"They took it. You passed out and the security force moved you here. But for some reason, a great army attacked this morning trying to kill you."

"A great army?"

Rian's eyes narrowed as he looked toward the cabin door.

Though no sound could be heard, the killing intent piercing through from outside the door was truly overwhelming.

Moving slowly, Rian opened the door and stepped out to find thirty of Zaib's royal guard 'Sacred Guard' lined up.

Beyond them, nearly a thousand soldiers had completely surrounded the cabin.

"Rian..."

Security Captain Benov was holding 〈Idea〉.

"Why are you trying to kill me?"

There was only one reason.

Because he was too strong.

"Rian, we acknowledge your achievement in defeating the vampire, but too much damage occurred in the process."

It was just an excuse.

To King Meyer, the vampire had been a formidable enemy that could shake the nation's foundation, and he would have turned a blind eye to some casualties if it meant eliminating them.

But the scene Rian had created while raiding the vampire's hideout was beyond what a human could accomplish.

The reason it still took two days was because there had been opinions to bring Rian into their own country.

Benov had been one of those people, but ultimately Meyer made the decision to 'kill him while we can.'

Though Rian had fought in a half-trance state, he wasn't unaware of their scheme.

"Return my sword."

As Rian took one step forward, twenty Sacred Guards twisted their waists in identical postures and gripped their sword hilts.

'Strong.'

These were different from the Sacred Guard he'd faced in the colosseum—truly the kingdom's representative first-class royal guard.

"You're going to kill me?"

The aura emitted by the supreme swordsmen was suffocating just to be near, but Rian walked forward calmly.

'Collective killing intent pierced through the sun?'

First Royal Guard Captain Sale's eyebrows twitched.

"Is that Zaib's judgment? Even with war against the demons coming, you're going to kill me?"

"Because it's war."

Sale spoke.

"The Gustav Empire has absorbed and integrated the demons. The future ahead is nothing but war stained with blood. The world's balance will collapse and existing systems will crumble. The great powers of the past will fall, and perhaps... even a kingdom that was merely a small nation might rise rapidly."

Zaib was a great power, and Rian, who had nothing, would be a threat to their nation one way or another.

"Even if the world is destroyed, you'll protect only Zaib?"

"That is what it means to be a king. And we are soldiers who follow the king's commands."

As the killing intent called the sun grew dense, the hunters behind fell back hesitantly.

'It feels like my skin is burning.'

Sale spoke with force in his throat.

"This is your last chance. Abandon Tormia and join Zaib. We promise treatment so exceptional it will break historical precedent."

"Of course I'm a citizen of Tormia. But I won't fight for Tormia."

"...Do you think you can settle this that way?"

"Because it's the truth. I don't judge anything. My only destination is pure strength. And the only one who can wield that is..."

The air trembled with Mach's law.

"Only my lord, Arian Sirone."

He was going to meet Sirone.

"Give me the sword. Human or demon, it doesn't matter. I'll cut down anyone who blocks my path."

Realizing he was serious, Sale extended his hand to Benov.

"Give me the sword."

After briefly examining the 〈Idea〉 he received from Benov, he threw it to Rian.

"Captain! His Majesty said..."

"Be quiet."

Sale walked toward Rian.

"We're desperate enough to attack a sleeping swordsman. The king's command is absolute. We must take your head."

It would probably be impossible.

"So..."

"No way! Captain!"

As his men shouted, Sale took a drawing stance and revealed perfect killing intent.

'Let it end with me.'

As Zaib's strongest drawing technique unfolded, a vertical flash flew toward Rian.

And another light was born into the world, bisecting that flash vertically.

"Claaang!"

With Rian's single step, the ground cracked with a thud, and Sale's head fell cleanly away.

"Whew."

Having created another death, Rian's eyes simply sparkled calmly.

'There's no hesitation. I'll just take responsibility for all deaths.'

"You bastard!"

Just as the Sacred Guard members were about to rush forward, the vice-captain raised his hand to stop them.

"Stop! This is the end!"

His eyes were also bloodshot, but he couldn't abandon Sale's will.

"We're returning. You have half a day. If you're still in Zaib by then..."

The vice-captain ground his teeth and turned away.

"I'll sell my soul if I have to, but I'll kill you."

As the Sacred Guard collected Sale's corpse and left, the thousand troops withdrew in a rush.

"Rian, are you okay?"

Smiling, Rian patted Jenia's shoulder and entered the cabin.

'I'm coming, Sirone.'
