'Evil...'

Is chaos truly this lonely?

An existence that cannot connect with anyone outside the law, unable to even understand itself.

So solitary that it feels no emotion even when killing the entire world.

"Love, you say? Who? This goblin?"

It was a question only Habits could ask, from the perspective of whether humans could love beasts.

"Sirone."

Sadness filled Kido's eyes.

"Sirone?"

Smodo said.

"The mage from the Ivory Tower I mentioned before. Vulcan defines him as the philanthropy of this world."

"Ah, that guy. Hmm."

Habits looked up at the sky.

What could he be thinking?

At the word love, was he perhaps remembering Abella, whom he had killed with his own hands?

Uorin shook her head.

'No. He's thinking nothing at all.'

That's what chaos is.

Everyone assigns meaning to Habits' actions, but what truly moves him is random chance.

"Why did you do it?"

Habits lifted Uorin's chin with his toe.

"Because you're one of the Three Emperors? Because you're the Empress of Kashan? Did you think you could beat me? Did you really think you were stronger than me?"

She had thought there was a chance.

But now, having actually reached the future Habits had attained, she realized how futile that hope had been.

'Almost reached it? Nonsense.'

Even if Law Kill had pursued Habits to right under his chin, failure was simply failure.

'Probability means nothing to Habits.'

Even with a 0.001 percent chance, Habits is one who exists by breaking through it.

'A monster born of the universe.'

That's how Uorin defined Habits.

"I didn't know my place. I cannot defeat you. Please show me mercy."

Uorin spoke sincerely.

"I want to live."

There had never been such a humiliating moment in Terraforce's life, but she felt no bitterness.

'This is defeat. That's all it is.'

This world was structured so no one could win everything, and at the extreme, there could only be one victor.

Terraforce had approached the pinnacle but simply couldn't leap over the final barrier.

'The one who currently rules the world is Habits.'

Habits said.

"Fine, I'll let you live."

Uorin raised her head, but Habits had already turned away as if he'd lost interest.

"Let's go."

Smodo asked in bewilderment.

"Where to?"

"To another battlefield. I need to finish conquering the world before they call me back."

Who on earth would be calling Habits back?

"I'm going to the Central Continent. Tell Vulcan to handle this place himself. He likes this sort of thing, doesn't he?"

When Habits whistled, the demonic beast circling in the sky quickly landed on the ground.

Boarding its broad back, just before taking flight, he pointed at Uorin and said:

"Work hard. Enjoy yourself."

Having been spared by her life's greatest enemy, Uorin felt an indescribable eeriness.

"Why..."

Though she'd abandoned her pride, as a woman bearing the name Terraforce, she couldn't help but ask.

"Why are you sparing me?"

Shame washed over her.

"I was your greatest enemy. Your wife's death was because of me. Why?"

"You said you wanted to live, didn't you?"

The simpler the answer, the more complex her thoughts became.

"I am the Empress of Kashan. I might stab you in the back someday, and also—"

"I don't know what you're talking about."

Habits was indifferent.

"Empress or not, it doesn't matter. There's no one stronger than me anyway. If you stab me in the back, we'll just fight again."

The height of self-assertion.

Since good and evil are defined by humans, he doesn't even know whether what he does is good or evil.

That chaos itself is absolute evil.

"It was fun. Goodbye."

While Smodo stared blankly at the demonic beast disappearing into the distant sky, Uorin fell into thought.

'Goodbye? It was fun?'

What could this world possibly be to Habits?

At that moment, fragmentary information remaining in Terraforce's vast database came to mind.

'McClain Guffin.'

Already erased, not even remembered.

But upon hearing Habits' words, according to the fantasy-like memory that surfaced...

'It was fun. Goodbye.'

She thought these might have been the last words Guffin left before departing the Photon System.

'It must be my imagination.'

Even she, who possessed underlying information about Guffin, couldn't remember what he had said.

'But why am I thinking this?'

If it were true.

'If God exists.'

Does he really take interest in this world?

If this world we live in is merely one of infinitely many creations.

'Then Habits...'

Would be the human closest to God.

"Don't think it's over yet."

Smodo approached, drawing his sword.

"His Majesty spared you, but to end this war, your head is absolutely necessary—"

"Smodooo!"

Vulcan, who had rushed over with bloodshot eyes, stopped his demonic beast and immediately looked around.

"Habits! Where is Habits?"

Smodo frowned and said.

"He left. Without even killing the Empress, he departed for another battlefield. I have no idea what he's thinking."

Vulcan took Uorin into his sight.

Seeing her kneeling, he grasped the situation and let out a long sigh.

"Ah, forget it. It's over now."

Even if arrows rained before his eyes, no future where he could catch Habits would unfold.

'It was so close.'

That's why Sirone's law, which had made Habits leave from 8 kilometers away, was even more terrifying.

'The difference between 1 centimeter and 8 kilometers. That should be considered the current strength of Sirone's law.'

Vulcan gestured for Smodo to board.

"Let's go. We'll leave this place to Hell's army and follow Habits. It's best to escape this area."

Habits leaving Kashan entirely was like a prophecy that a great disaster would soon unfold here.

As Smodo boarded the demonic beast, Vulcan grabbed the reins and said to Amon:

"Stop Yahweh by any means necessary."

"Yahweh?"

Amon, already knowing that the 7th Corps demons were being slaughtered, immediately turned around.

With everyone gone, Uorin sat with the unconscious Kido resting on her lap, lost in thought.

'Sirone, you came.'

She had wanted to see him.

"Your Majesty."

Twenty Wind Masters created wind sounds as they spun rapidly around her.

"We've found a weak zone. We'll escort you."

Uorin shook her head.

"We return to the Imperial Palace. It hasn't fallen yet, so there should be physicians there. Treat Kido."

"But..."

"I must see the end of this war."

Kraaang!

Finally, Sirone's weapon 'Slaughter' entered the Imperial Palace.

Every time the engine of Law Kill, powered by Yahweh's wrath, moved Slaughter, demons exploded.

Screams of terror echoed from all directions, but not a single voice of repentance could be heard.

'Why!'

I want to ask, humans.

Can't you stop thinking what you're thinking right now and practice love instead?

'It's impossible.'

As long as even one evil exists, good becomes a foolish, pathetic, and inefficient means.

"Uaaaah!"

So people think the methodology of evil is cool, smart, and the privilege of the enlightened, but...

'So... are you satisfied now?'

Then in a world where absolute evil has descended, why do humans shed tears of blood and cry out to be saved?

'I can forgive you. I'll save you.'

But sometimes.

'It's not too late even now! Save the people beside you! Then we can win!'

Even that desperate voice seems like an empty echo, making me terribly angry.

"Uuuu..."

Sirone's cry.

Kraaang!

Changed into Slaughter's roar, instantly exploding the surrounding demons.

"Yahweeeee!"

With a thunderous shout, Amon in black iron armor collided head-on with Slaughter.

"Kruuuu!"

Grasping Slaughter's spikes with both hands and pressing it down to the ground, the pile of dirt began growing exponentially.

"What is that...?"

For the first time, the Law Kill engine encountered resistance, and Sirone narrowed his eyes.

'A Corps Commander.'

Even while being pushed back dozens of meters, Amon maintained his stance, finally burying Slaughter deep underground.

"Hehehe. Is this all, Yahweh?"

Arriving at Aganoth's spire via Wind Master, Uorin immediately surveyed the battlefield upon landing.

"Sirone..."

While she had no doubt about the abilities of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars, Amon's skills that she witnessed firsthand also surpassed the Stars.

"Die, Yahweh!"

Amon launched his body at tremendous speed and swung his sword, causing Sirone to retreat using teleportation.

"What the...?"

Amon instantly closed the distance and swung his sword to behead Sirone.

This took 1 second.

"Die, Yahweh!"

The exact same event repeated.

As Sirone began learning from identical events, his response methods increased exponentially.

'Block it!'

Death.

'Counter-attack!'

Death.

With each accumulated experience, Sirone's reactions became faster.

'I found a counter-attack route!'

And finally, when he broke through the 2,000th attempt, he could see the sword's trajectory with his eyes.

'Strange.'

To Amon, it was still just 1 second.

'This isn't coincidence. This is some kind of technique.'

Though he couldn't define it precisely, Amon felt something strange about Sirone's movements.

'It's not physics-based movement. He can't move like this. Yes, this is like...'

Taking one action and splitting it into countless pieces, then stitching together only the best feelings.

That's why, even though it was human movement, it didn't feel human.

When he saw movements accumulated from 12,000 experiences, the world felt like it was rippling like oil.

'I see.'

Amon realized.

'So that's why Satan...'

After approximately 40,000 learning attempts, Sirone captured an opportunity to land a strike.

'Definitely strong.'

In terms of swordsmanship alone, he wasn't far behind Freed.

A photon cannon containing maximum power was fired.

'I'll end it here!'

Clearly a direct flash.

But to Amon, it felt like a disgusting curve passing through all events.

Approximately 98,000 times.

That was the number of times Sirone had learned to achieve this result.

"Kruk!"

As the photon cannon struck Amon's abdomen, his armor exploded before his body was even pushed back.

"Kraaaah!"

Screaming as he was pushed back, countless demons collided with Amon's body and bounced off.

Kwaaaaang!

The moment he crashed into the wall, a thunderous sound erupted, and all the demons in the midst of battle stopped moving.

"Corps Commander..."

For the subordinates who had swept battlefields following Amon, this was something that could never happen.

Sirone breathed roughly while glaring at the pile of rubble where Amon was buried.

'I couldn't penetrate it.'

His physical durability was on a different dimension from other creatures.

"Yes! I can win!"

Uorin, watching the battle from Aganoth's spire, cheered and clenched her fist.

"If I can just defeat the Corps Commander..."

Then, vibrations began from the ground, and finally the entire Imperial Palace started shaking.

"Your Majesty! Please evacuate!"

A Wind Master shouted, but Uorin's gaze wouldn't leave the place where Amon had crashed.

'That's the place.'

Something terrible was being born.
