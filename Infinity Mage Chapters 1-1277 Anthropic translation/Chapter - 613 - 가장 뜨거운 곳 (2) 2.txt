[613] The Hottest Place (2)

Shirone climbed to the 18th floor of the Magic Association and walked down the corridor, recalling old memories.

Nothing had really changed, but perhaps because the Association had a new owner, the atmosphere felt somewhat more solemn.

He arrived at the Association President's office and knocked, but heard no response.

Unable to open the door first, he waited when a staff member approached and said:

"Go on in. The President is currently in a meeting. He'll be right over when it ends."

"Yes."

As he slowly opened the door and entered, Lufist's office came into view.

True to his nickname as the Steel Archmage, not only the furniture but even the decorative items were made of iron.

Considering how the element of omnipotence works in magic, this was only natural.

Sitting in a chair, Shirone rubbed his palms together nervously as he waited.

Two hours later, the door finally opened and Lufist entered with Secretary Jane.

It was natural that Gaold and Kang Nan came to mind, and his first impression was that he was much colder than them.

"Hello. I'm Ariane Shirone."

Lufist passed by Shirone indifferently and said:

"Get out."

Not knowing who he was referring to, Shirone stood still, but Jane closed the door and left.

"Sit down. We've met before, haven't we?"

Shirone had been aware of Lufist's gaze at the plaza.

"Yes. It's an honor that you called for me."

"No need for that. I know you're on Gaold's side."

Though they had carried out missions together in Heaven, he hadn't exchanged any ally-like emotional bonds with Gaold.

"No, I wouldn't say I'm on his side..."

"Right, Gaold doesn't have allies. He tries to do everything alone. But it's true that you're emotionally closer to Gaold than to me."

If he already understood everything, there was no need for Shirone to explain.

"Are you confident about this graduation exam?"

"I'll do my best. I will definitely become a mage."

Though it sounded like a memorized answer, his voice couldn't help but carry strength in front of Lufist.

"You think I'm your enemy."

"Aren't you?"

Having already clashed with Gaold before, he wasn't intimidated even in front of the Association President, and Lufist also smirked slightly.

"Perhaps I could be. You're on Gaold's side, and I'm an Association President who has to play power games with countries around the world. The moment the Association embraces you, Tormia will face checks from major powers."

Though he had already expected this, hearing it from the Association President's mouth made his insides burn.

"I won't be used. I'll decide my own future."

"Of course you should. But no choice is truly free. You choose between red and blue and delude yourself into thinking you're free, not even knowing who presented those red and blue options to you. That's the system."

The part cannot surpass the whole.

"Didn't you call me here because you had something you wanted to say?"

Shirone's voice rose in the face of the unpleasant truth.

"Let's make a deal. I'll guarantee you maximum freedom. And safety too."

It wasn't a bad proposal.

"What do I have to do to get that?"

"Fail the graduation exam early."

"What?"

"Of course, you're probably devising your own solutions too. But nothing will be as easy as my proposal. Fail. And badly at that. Publicly reveal that you're actually a nobody. Of course, some people will know it's a show, but humans believe what they see anyway. That alone will remove considerable risk factors."

"But if that happens..."

"I'll guarantee everything after that. Not only the mage certification but I'll also petition the King to get you official recognition. Then you can join the Association and work for the kingdom. I reinstated both Fludo and Isabel. You won't need to worry about your treatment."

If he failed the graduation exam, he would instead gain everything.

"Choose wisely. If you accept my proposal, that's the end of it. No exam or anything—just go home, get a good night's sleep, pack your bags, and come up here. I assure you, no matter how much you achieve in the graduation exam, you won't receive this level of treatment."

The fact that Lufist's words were true pained Shirone's heart.

"You're definitely a time bomb that could cause global tragedy. But if it's going to explode anyway, it's human nature to want to keep it close and manage it. And I have the ability to manage it. But only if you help me out a little."

By failing the graduation exam miserably.

"I decline."

Lufist wasn't surprised.

"The reason?"

"You said no choice is truly free. I don't think so. Isn't choosing nothing also another choice?"

"That's denying the whole."

"Then I'll fight the whole."

Lufist leaned back in his chair and half-closed his eyes.

"...Do you think you have a chance of winning?"

"Winning chances aren't important. Doing what I believe is right—isn't that what it means to be a mage?"

Shirone wanted to become a mage.

"If that's your will, it can't be helped. If you change your mind, don't hesitate to fail. The graduation exam hasn't even started yet."

"Yes. Thank you for your concern."

Without showing any sign of wavering until the end, Shirone left through the door.

"Phew."

Standing in the corridor and sighing, he finally felt a sense of reality.

'Was that the right thing to do?'

If he botched the graduation exam, he'd feel even more miserable, but whatever the outcome, he wouldn't have any regrets.

"Is your talk finished?"

Secretary Jane approached.

"Yes."

"Then go to the annex on the first floor. A dinner party will begin at 5:30."

She didn't ask about anything.

"Thank you. I'll head there."

After confirming Shirone had turned the corner, Jane entered the Association President's office.

Just from his expression, she could tell the negotiations had broken down.

"I told you it wouldn't work."

Lufist rested his chin on his hand and muttered:

"The singular surpassing the whole. Is such a thing possible?"

Jane looked toward the door.

"He is an Ultima, after all."

"But Gaia failed."

As Lufist stood up, Jane's head turned back.

"What will you do? He's too talented to let other countries take him."

"No need to rush. He's food that's hard to digest. For now, watching isn't a bad idea either."

Lufist approached the door and looked back at Jane.

"It should have started by now. The video recorder?"

"I've installed them with no blind spots. No major accidents will happen. If you have thoughts, that is."

"Where can I watch?"

"Go to the central control room and ask. But what are you planning to do by watching students have fun?"

Lufist raised one corner of his mouth.

"They came all this way with such effort—it'd be disappointing to just send them back."

Though called an annex, the Association building was so vast that even with all 150 students inside, the center still felt empty.

Under the light cast by hundreds of chandeliers, delicacies from countries around the world gleamed brilliantly.

Some ate and some enjoyed themselves, but most students representing prestigious academies from various kingdoms were focused on invisible psychological warfare with students from other schools.

Amid the complex tangle of emotional arrows, Alfeas Magic School naturally received the most attention.

"Is it true that Professor Baical is going to Creas this year?"

"That's what I heard too. He's been exclusively handling the Royal Magic School for over ten years."

Rumors spread quickly, and students who hadn't known began glancing at Alfeas Magic School's graduating class.

Among them, the one receiving the most attention was none other than Pony.

"Miss, we've prepared formal wear. Please accept my request. Having a party in the same clothes as commoners!"

'How annoying.'

The attendants dispatched from the royal palace surrounded Pony, making it hard to tell where she was even standing.

"Please go back. I'm not here as royalty but as a representative of a magic school. I have no special privileges."

"Miss, royal bloodline isn't something you can deny just by denying it."

Even so, it was just weak blood distant from power succession.

"Why do you soil your noble body with dirt? If you wish, I'll call the Association President right now and demand the highest-grade mage certification."

Pony looked at the attendant as if he were pathetic.

"All mage certifications are the same."

"Then I'll order them to make a separate one. A premium certification befitting royal dignity. You'll be pleased."

Knowing the attendant was serious made her even more annoyed.

Conversing with those who lived in a reality beyond reality made her feel like she was becoming a fool too.

'I won't rely on bloodline. I'll become the best through my own power.'

Alfred Pony (Final graduating class rank: 11th place).

Major: Rapids series of Hydraulic Magic.

Special notes: Royal bloodline.

"Ugh, so annoying."

Feeling a headache, Pony walked quickly as the attendants swarmed after her.

"In a way... she's a bit pitiful."

Maya, holding a wine glass and watching, muttered.

"Nothing is as unfortunate as predetermined fate."

At the voice beside her, she turned to see Cayden standing there.

This seemed to be the first time he had spoken to her throughout all their time at school.

"Good evening, Maya. Shall we toast?"

Maya stared intently at the liquid trembling in the wine glass Cayden extended.

"Why are you so nervous? Your hand seems to be shaking."

"Really? I don't notice."

Though he said that, once he became conscious of it, the trembling got worse.

"That's strange. It looks like you're shaking..."

"What are you talking about? Why would I be shaking?"

At Cayden's amplitude as he seemed to shake the wine glass, Maya pointed at it.

"The wine is overflowing and spilling."

"Strange. I don't notice."

"..."

Watching Cayden not even glance at his wine glass, Maya awkwardly raised the corner of her mouth.

"R-right. Well, have a good time."

And immediately turned around and left as if fleeing.

'What a strange personality. Is he making fun of me? I should avoid running into him from now on.'

Cayden, whose trembling had stopped, put down his wine glass and smiled sadly.

"As expected... the Crimson Cross isn't working?"

"Stop talking nonsense about crimson crosses!"

Amy pinched Cayden's side.

"Ow! What's that for, suddenly?"

"Now I see you're a complete softie. If you treat her like that, what girl wouldn't think you're crazy?"

Rubbing his sore side, Cayden grumbled:

"Why interfere in other people's business? You know it won't work anyway."

"Let's start with the premise that you're normal. What are you doing? Go quickly. Apologize to Maya and tell her it was a joke."

Cayden's gaze found Maya standing alone in the crowd.

"Will it really... work?"

"Are you proposing marriage or something? And don't take the wine. Acting cool when you can't even drink one glass..."

"Alright, I'll try."

Taking a deep breath, Cayden approached Maya again.

"Um..."

Only after seeing Maya's terrified eyes could he grasp reality.

"Sorry. That was just a joke earlier. I just wanted to try talking to you."

Maya's face immediately brightened.

"Ah, I thought so! I thought you had a weird personality. But it was fun."

When his imagined fears didn't materialize in reality, Cayden found his confidence.

"Are you done preparing for the exam?"

"Yeah. I have a good feeling about it. The advice I got from Iruki in the first half helped a lot."

Though lacking in magical talent, she was a genius in artistic sense that even Cayden of the Crimson Cross couldn't match.

"This time I'm going to try it my way. I'll hit a wall eventually, but right now graduating is the goal."

The future of the Supernatural tribe rested in Maya's hands.

Supernatural Maya (Final graduating class rank: 28th place).

Major: Song series of Sound Magic.

Special notes: Possesses natural omnipotence in singing.

"Right. You'll definitely pass."

"Huh?"

Maya questioned his definitive statement, but Cayden answered in his heart:

'Because I'll be by your side.'
