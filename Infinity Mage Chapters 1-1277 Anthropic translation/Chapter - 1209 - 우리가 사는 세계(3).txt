The World We Live In (3)

Since her life was on the line, Marsha carefully reviewed the additional clauses in the contract.

'Shirone.'

The person who gave her a second chance.

'I hope you'll be happy. You're the one who gave me back my family and my life.'

So.

'I'll keep quiet. If it's what you want, I won't tell you under any circumstances.'

Marsha signed the contract.

Even behind the pillar of the main system, the distance to the battlefield was less than 50 meters.

But she was so lost in conflict that even the sounds of battle seemed distant.

'What should I do?'

The file containing Omega 999's history.

According to the contract, she should send it to Fermi as is, but the 83 percent was the problem.

'How much of humanity's future remains?' What if the 83 percent of data only contained records of the past they'd already been through?

'I need to check now. To send information to Fermi, the messenger has to return to reality. If this turns out to be useless information, I'll have wasted a precious opportunity.'

Since time in Apocalypse and reality flow differently, once you go out, you have to wait a considerable amount of time.

'I have to look. This is the only chance I have to turn back. I just can't tell Shirone about it.'

She took out an analog watch and calculated the time in reality using the time difference.

'Alright. If there's information about the future beyond today, it passes. If not, I'll mine again here.'

Marsha opened the file.

Records written in human language were densely packed in chronological order.

'Skip. Skip.'

Her eyes barely registered the text.

Her face lit up as she flipped through pages with the sole intention of checking dates.

'It's here.'

Though not a large amount, the records contained today's date precisely.

'Good. I'll end it here...' At that moment, one line of record caught her attention.

"...What?"

Without time to think, her brain absorbed an entire paragraph of events.

Marsha slowly raised her head.

Even as she stared blankly, lost in thought, her hands were turning off the equipment.

'So this was it.'

Fermi's words about being certain the moment she saw it were true.

'Shirone.'

Her eyes grew hot.

'Is that how it was? You knew everything and still... erased your memory?'

At that moment, a thunderous roar erupted.

"Marsha!"

When she turned her head, countless jets were being destroyed in the collapse of the Operator.

"We need to get out now!"

As Freeman pointed toward the elevator and a path opened up, Marsha immediately threw herself forward.

"Hurry! Get on quickly!"

Just before the elevator closed, the Operator, having returned to the form of a young girl, boarded.

"Phew, I thought I was going to die."

"You did well, sis." The lollipop who said this looked up at Marsha and frowned.

"Make sure to return it when the job's done. Don't touch anything else. It's a personal secret."

"Huh? Oh, right."

'What's this?'

Unlike when her eyes had rolled back at being called an old lady, her face was full of sadness.

Smile Mark asked.

"Do you have a plan? There will be jets outside too. We don't have equipment to pull us up anymore."

"We'll hold them off, so you guys run. Find a safe place and leave Apocalypse." Once, Shirone's discarded information—Rosine—had dismantled Apocalypse.

Based on that information, Fermi created an escape code, which was precisely...

'Escape.'

Smile Mark looked worriedly at the pill in his palm.

'It takes up to 10 minutes to completely get out. Will there be a suitable place?'

When they reached the surface, as expected, countless jets were blocking the entrance.

'This is too much.'

Black Circle Mark seemed to notice something, looked up, and muttered quietly.

"Game over."

"Sis! Don't say such unlucky—" Simultaneously, a flash of light swept in from the left side of their vision, instantly clearing away the jets.

Shirone landed in the empty space.

"Bro!"

Lollipop ran over, and the Parrot Mercenary Group also exhaled deeply as their tension eased.

"Why are you so late? We've been waiting forever."

"Sorry."

Shirone first checked the number of people in the group.

"Is everyone okay?"

"Yeah. Let's get out of here first. We need to do a final check before escaping."

Shirone scooped up the group with Hand of God and immediately flew into the sky.

Jets gave chase, but it was impossible for them to catch up with Shirone who was determined to escape.

'It really is endless.'

There were only cities with the same patterns and scenery; nature was nowhere to be seen.

"This won't work. Let's go down for now."

Shirone landed at a point where no jets were visible and asked Marsha about the mining situation.

"How did it go? Did you succeed?"

Marsha, struggling to manage her expression, nodded.

"Yeah. It's not perfect, but we achieved our primary goal. Send it to Fermi and we're done."

"That's a relief."

Shirone exhaled a sigh of relief and looked around.

"There's nowhere to hide. Jets will swarm here soon, so let's get out of here first."

Naturally, no one objected, and each person held an Escape pill in their hand.

Marsha asked.

"What's the order?"

There was no need to decide.

"Everyone go out together. I'll move once more and then exit last."

"Alright."

Though having Shirone take responsibility was ultimately the best method, Marsha was overcome with sadness.

'Why?'

Shirone's back as he watched the distant parts of the city seemed particularly forlorn today.

'You bear everything and fight for the world... Why? Why can't you be happy?'

What Marsha had seen was.

'Shirone.'

The signal announcing humanity's history, the end of Omega.

'Amy dies.'

Something that would happen in 6 hours.

'It can't be prevented.'

It was such a powerful event, but if Shirone knew, the story would be different.

'But I...'

Marsha gritted her teeth and held back tears.

'I can't tell you!'

The moment one becomes obsessed with someone special, Yahweh's standards would crumble.

'How much must your heart have ached?'

Even after hearing about Amy's death from Fermi, you went so far as to erase your memory for the world's sake.

How many tears must you have shed?

'You must have asked again and again.'

Denying and denying again, searching for every possible way to change the situation.

"Sis."

Shirone turned around.

"Why do you look so sad? Don't worry too much. I'll also get out from a safe place."

Marsha averted her gaze and swallowed the pill.

"Got it. I'll be waiting."

Of course, by the time Shirone returned, the information would have already been passed to Fermi.

"Yes. See you outside."

As she felt her mind growing hazy, Marsha suddenly widened her eyes and spoke.

"Um...! Shirone."

"Yes?"

His innocent face that seemed ready to listen to anything made her heart even more troubled.

'I should tell him.'

Shouldn't she?

'What good is humanity? This child forgave me. He gave me a new life. So I should also...'

If the price of revelation was only death, she would have sacrificed her life without hesitation.

But this was Shirone's choice.

Before a sacrifice close to infinite that an ordinary person like her couldn't even imagine.

"Just. Thank you."

Marsha hid her emotions and smiled broadly.

"Sis will take care of you for life, kiddo."

"Haha."

Marsha's body—or rather, her mind—dissolved like a mirage and vanished.

"She's really impossible to stop."

Shirone shook his head and looked up at the sky, stretching.

"Should I get going too?"

Though the future ruled by gods hadn't changed, Shirone wasn't discouraged.

'Thank you.'

Because there were hearts here too.

Even if it was an error that would never happen again, those hearts would create humanity's future through Shirone.

Therefore.

'Goodbye.' Apocalypse.

"Mica."

■Construction progress is 31.6548 percent.

The dramatically increased work speed of Shirone Sphere was solely the price of pain.

"Huuuuh!"

In construction that transcended human knowledge, method and efficiency were meaningless.

'More, I can do it faster.'

As he concentrated, he felt his brain burning, followed by an actual burning smell.

'...Is this real?'

At that moment, solar wind rushed in.

'Amy.'

Shirone drew in light with transcendent telescopic vision and captured the collision of fire against fire.

The Phoenix screamed.

"Kiiiiii!"

Since they were ultimately the same attribute, the stronger fire would devour the weaker one.

"How can you..."

The Phoenix glared at Amy, who had moved 3,000 kilometers away in an instant.

"...be faster than me?"

"Because I'm the sun."

The two fire avatars in resonance with the sun communicated through light radiation.

"Of course, that's the same for you too. But."

Amy smirked.

"I'm a professional mage."

Through her unique battery, spontaneous combustion, she could move anywhere on the sun.

"The battery is different. You know what? On my planet, you're a Tier 2 creature."

Of course, even that wasn't weak.

"...Is that so?" As the Phoenix increased its size, its fierce eyes were visible even from 3,000 kilometers away.

"A mortal dares to look down on me!" The Phoenix charged at full power and swallowed Amy's body whole as it flew upward.

"Krrrr! I am fire!"

Just as it tried to burrow into the sun, a small vortex formed in the Phoenix's chest.

"Huh?"

The next moment, convection intensified rapidly, twisting the Phoenix's wings and neck.

"Kraaaaah!"

Complete combustion.

The Phoenix, engulfed in flames, realized that the essence composing it was being sucked away.

"No! No..."

The vortex exploded, and Amy, burning in female form, stood upright in the void.

"Kak! Kak!"

Before her eyes, a bird no larger than a person was now staggering.

"Kruuuu!"

The Phoenix, left without enough essence to maintain its form, hung its head in resignation.

"Well, there's nothing to regret. From phoenix... now you become that."

"Right."

Amy said.

"And someday we'll decompose again and become something else in the universe."

"Hehe."

The Phoenix raised its head.

"From fire to human. Usually it's the opposite. But is it rude of me to say this? Why don't you rule the universe when you've reached a realm beyond humanity?"

"Because I'm not alone."

Amy walked toward the Phoenix.

"If I had existed alone, I never could have come this far. The people who helped me, the people who died for me, the people who fought me, the people who hated me. I'm just one human being indebted to all of that."

For some reason, the faces of everyone she'd met so far came to mind simultaneously.

"Not just human. Human being." Amy, who had laid the half-melted, collapsed Phoenix on her knee, stroked its beak.

"You don't have to shine alone anymore. Let's deliver light to everyone together."

"Human being..."

The Phoenix, gazing at the endlessly stretched universe, raised the corner of its mouth and closed its eyes.

"Yes. That sounds good too."

As the phoenix form melted away, its essence seeped into Amy's flame.

It was the fire of heart, stronger than law.
