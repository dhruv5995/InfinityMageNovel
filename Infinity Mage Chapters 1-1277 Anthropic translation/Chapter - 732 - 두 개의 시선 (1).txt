[732] Two Gazes (1)

Ivory Tower Artificial Star.

The seven stars summoned by Taesung were discussing the world, oblivious to the passage of time.

"Yes, I will do as you say."

Numerous matters were handled.

"But..."

From ancient history to the present, it seemed there was nothing Taesung didn't know, and the stars' questions finally approached the essence.

"What does Ra truly want?"

At Tsuoi's question, the six stars fell into thought.

"He's trying to become a god."

Heukgangsi's words were close to wrong in that they failed to resolve the question.

Mini asked back.

"What's the definition of a god? Creator? If so, Ra cannot become a god."

Borbor, still sprawled like a spider, looked up toward Mini sitting on his crown.

"The fact that we exist means there's already one who created us. A god is a god, meaning we cannot become gods."

A god is a god.

Ghost-goblin Arte fluttered his fan.

"If we can create something, we're no different from gods. That's just an empty thought. If it's a true god, wouldn't it be something that transcends emptiness?"

Dream person Luber looked back at Taesung.

"I'd like to hear your thoughts at this point. What do you think Ra wants, Taesung?"

"Righteousness."

Taesung raised his index finger.

"If a god created the universe, it means the god is absolutely right in this universe. Whatever he does, it is right. Therefore, if Ra realizes absolute righteousness, he too could be called a god."

"A god is absolutely right."

Luber looked up with distant eyes.

"When dreaming, everyone is right. Perhaps a god is a being who dreams a dream that never breaks."

"That's right. Our nobility lies there."

Taesung, rising from his seat for the first time, looked down at the planet shining beneath the glass floor.

"From universe to natural world, from natural world to biological world. In the pan-universal hierarchy, we are infinitely weak. But we are beings who dream."

Taesung looked back at the stars waiting for his words with benevolent eyes.

"We can dream our own universe. Even if this place is God's dream, we must continue to dream."

In the solemn atmosphere, Taesung, who had been closing his eyes briefly, slowly opened his lips.

"The time when that dream breaks is approaching."

In the world of nothingness outside the gate of destruction, Nane had come to organize countless thoughts.

Ra Enemy's true body still didn't move as if dead, and at some point his thoughts were transmitted to his mind.

"Have your thoughts been organized?"

Nane answered the past Ra Enemy.

"Already."

"Then why do you struggle? What attachment remains in you who has realized emptiness?"

The world Nane realized was ultimately a series of suffering, and what remained at the end of that suffering was eternal nothingness.

"Annihilation is always right. Just one thing..."

Nane approached Ra Enemy's true body.

"Except that it cannot be undone."

He had no hesitation in accepting Ra Enemy's proposal, but it could not be undone.

"Because it cannot be undone, it is absolutely right."

That was also true.

"To save the sentient beings groaning in suffering. If that is the last mission remaining for me..."

Ra Enemy continued.

"Devour my dream. Become irreversible righteousness and save the sentient beings you desire."

Empty because it never existed from the beginning.

'Why do they suffer?'

Because pleasure, pain, misfortune, happiness are all just illusions in dreams that leave no substance after they pass.

"Awaken."

Nane decided to become Buddha himself and enlighten the minds of sentient beings troubled in the mundane world.

"Now it is your dream."

As Ra Enemy's true body dissolved into particles of light and seeped into Nane, his Kar value began to rise endlessly.

Kar Value: 99.9999999999...percent.

From Nane's body in the teaching posture, infinite blades spread out in a circle.

"Only those who realize will escape from the emptiness of suffering."

Nane is almost right.

Therefore his words became powerful truth, exerting influence on this world...

"Open your eyes."

The moment his tongue moved, the world of nothingness burst into fragments with cracks of light.

"Wh-what is that?"

The moment Canis's eyes widened, Harvest grabbed him and Arin and moved away at tremendous speed.

Still, Canis couldn't take his eyes off it.

"What on earth is happening..."

An energy field mixed with red and black light was endlessly expanding in the form of a sphere.

As explorers stationed near Pytharos scattered in all directions, Arin conveyed shocking truth.

"Canis, the boundary... is disappearing."

"What boundary?"

"The boundary of the supernatural. I can see something being peeled away. Probably what you're seeing now is the same as what I see."

Arin's supernatural sight penetrated the veil of the hidden world in that it grasped the nature dwelling in matter.

'That means...'

Reality and unreality were merging.

"Canis, something's coming out of there?"

The energy field Harvest pointed to was massive, over 100 meters in diameter.

"Damn it! It's demons! Everyone prepare for battle!"

From within that huge space, grotesquely shaped residents of the hidden world appeared, shouting incomprehensible words.

"Imprint our terror! Conquer this world!"

It was the bombardment announcing the start of the Great Purification.

'It's finally come!'

Buddha Mahagaruta, one of the Five Great Stars guarding Taesung's room in the Ivory Tower, lifted his eyelids with a flash.

His pupils that appeared as the brilliant light subsided were completely different from human ones.

"Has the time come?"

As he unfolded his crossed legs and placed both feet on the floor, looking up at the sky, the surrounding scenery poured down like a waterfall.

"Five Great Stars?"

At the sight of Mahagaruta who had somehow entered the artificial star, the seven stars gathered turned their heads.

'Mahagaruta? No, he's not human?'

Mahagaruta's pupils, which had lost their vitality, had two pupils in one eyeball.

"You've come, Mahagaruta."

As Taesung greeted him with a sad smile, Mahagaruta bowed with clasped hands.

"Just now, Nane became Buddha."

"What? What did you say?"

Tsuoi jumped up, and Borbor and Mini opened their mouths in disbelief.

Taesung answered calmly.

"I see. Now... will you be leaving?"

"Two righteousnesses cannot exist in one universe. That is the principle of thesis-antithesis-synthesis."

Nane had encompassed the entire world, and it surely included Mahagaruta's righteousness as well.

Arte asked.

"What happens to the altars?"

"Nane devoured Ra Enemy's dream. Soon altars everywhere in the world will open, and reality and unreality will no longer be separate."

Dream person Luber said.

"Awakening from each one's dream, they will dream only Nane's dream. It will be a nightmare. Many people will suffer."

"Even nightmares are just dreams."

Mahagaruta understood Nane.

"If I am one righteousness, then Nane is another righteousness. He chose to liberate those who dream from the suffering of this world."

Tsuoi said.

"I don't want that. I want to just suffer and live."

"That too is just an illusion created by suffering. Once suffering disappears, you will finally understand."

In the irreversible moment, it becomes truth.

"Nane saw from the farthest distance. Life endlessly reincarnates and endlessly suffers. Seen from afar, this universe is also ultimately one life form. That life form is wandering in eternal suffering. Without any meaning at all."

Mahagaruta looked around the universe.

"Someone cutting it off is not wrong either. Annihilation is always right. Except that it cannot be undone."

Because it could not be undone, Mahagaruta could not choose.

"Now my righteousness will disappear and Nane's righteousness will guide the world. I can only hope his 'righteousness' is truly right."

Taesung said.

"If he's wrong..."

There was only one case where Nane could be wrong.

"What would happen if all life forms achieved an integrated mental system and refused him with one will?"

At the sight of Taesung still not abandoning hope, Mahagaruta made a troubled expression.

Having life means being selfish, and therefore we can never become one.

"...Find a new star. Surely there will be someone to take my place."

Taesung's eyes became moist.

"I will miss you."

A gentle smile appeared on Mahagaruta's lips, and finally light flashed in his eyes.

"..."

As if he had never existed from the beginning, the stars' minds became complicated looking at the place where Buddha had vanished.

'Where did he go?'

The world of nothingness, or somewhere else that transcends even that.

Arte asked.

"Taesung, please give us guidance. What action should the Ivory Tower take?"

"I will examine the ground."

Taesung, who calmed his mind with deep breaths, looked down at the planet beneath the glass floor with sharp eyes.

'What is happening?'

Taesung's body, which had been gradually becoming blurry, finally became transparent like air and disappeared.

The 2nd-grade residents opened their mouths in bewilderment.

'This is Taesung's ability.'

She could feel all events happening on this planet as if touching them with her skin.

'Gaia.'

Because she was this planet itself.

Ymir's presence was overwhelming.

"Kahaha! This is thrilling!"

Ignoring the combined attack of Sirone, Jinsungeum, Rian, and Kido, his punches burst through the cave walls with thuds.

'This is chaos. I could die just from the wind pressure.'

Earthbound spirit Dinai was crushing the floor like a swamp, but Ymir didn't even pretend to try to escape.

"Poor things...!"

As Ymir pushed forward with his body buried up to his waist, Rian's fist struck his face.

'Yes, this is it.'

Ymir thrilled at the sparks exploding in his head.

'This makes me feel alive.'

What if you had to live in a world where no material was heavier than yourself?

What if the strongest stimulus was just a gentle breeze tickling your skin?

'I would have gone insane.'

To such a Ymir, Rian's fist was pleasure even in pain.

"Here I gooooo!"

At the monsters' battle with no room for Simta to activate, Mungyeong shuddered.

'Damn it! I can't even interfere.'

His pride was hurt by the fact that even a lowly goblin was contributing to controlling Ymir's actions.

"More! Hit me more!"

Ymir's fist, thrown with great excitement, suddenly disappeared and struck his own face.

"..."

The impact was tremendous, but his body also had durability beyond biological limits.

"This damn..."

Where Ymir's gaze turned, Sungeum was panting while deploying ether waves.

'It doesn't work. What kind of body is this?'

After striking Rian's solar plexus, Ymir turned to Sungeum and approached with big strides.

"This is why I should have dealt with you first."

This kind of battle wasn't fun.

"Sirone, I'll tie up Ymir's feet, so attack. If we two join forces, we have a chance."

Instead of an answer, the sound of knees hitting the ground was heard.

"Hnngh!"

When Sungeum turned around, Sirone was trembling with both hands while gritting his teeth.

"What's wrong? You weren't even hit..."

Sungeum's heart sank.

'It's exploding.'

The moment Sirone's face became transparent beyond pale, the entrances to the 19,000 worlds began vibrating simultaneously.

'It's coming. Something too enormous...'

Insight.

The wheel of emptiness was ending.
