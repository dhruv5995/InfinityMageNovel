On the Edge (4)

Past midnight.

"Phew."

After relaying the orders from high command to each company, Amy headed to the bathhouse at this late hour.

Though her body was weary, perhaps today might be the last day she could bathe in peace.

"Cold."

As she undressed, the chill air made her skin break out in goosebumps.

Unable to bear the empty stillness of the vacant bathroom, she quickly turned on the faucet.

'The enemy numbers forty million.'

No matter how long the border was, the number her unit would face was more than ten times their own forces.

'Arithmetically, it's impossible to hold them back. Is there some special strategy? Or is this...'

The final stand of those driven to the edge.

'This might be my end.'

Feeling the warmth of hot water flowing down from her head, Amy closed her eyes.

She heard the sound of a door opening.

"Amy?"

Cavalry Sergeant Tess was entering with a bath basket at her waist.

"Tess, still awake?"

"I'm on night duty. What about you?"

"Just... couldn't sleep."

Having been close friends since military academy, Tess could understand Amy's feelings.

'More than death, she's afraid they might never meet again.'

She wanted to see Ryan.

Tess turned on the faucet next to Amy and spoke while getting wet.

"We'll survive, definitely."

"...Yeah."

Seeing the red tinge in Amy's eyes, Tess turned her head and slowly looked over her naked form.

"You've almost completely recovered."

During Garcia's training, the burn scars never had a chance to heal.

Fortunately, now only a small scab remained on her shoulder, and even that would fall off soon.

"Thanks to my master. The training was tough, but he made sure I received the highest level of recovery treatment."

"Come to think of it, your skin is really pale now, isn't it? Maybe I should try it too?" Of course, it was a joke.

Only the person involved would know the pain of repeatedly burning and healing, of skin peeling away.

"Hmm, so this is how it is?"

Tess looked at Amy's smooth, water-glistened body with sleepy eyes.

Feeling creeped out, Amy took a defensive stance and turned around to find Tess grinning mischievously.

"Don't. That's an order."

"Hehe, now you're pulling rank on me? Then I have no choice but to use that method."

Amy quickly rinsed off the soapy water at super speed, grabbed her bath basket, and ran toward the exit.

"I'll go out first!"

Watching Amy's retreating figure as she hurried away, Tess chuckled and relaxed her crouched position.

"So innocent..."

Her heart was beating roughly and her stomach churned.

'I can't calm my nerves.'

Tess stood under the water for a long time before punching the wall with her fist.

'We're going to die.'

It would be a battle they'd almost certainly die in.

'It doesn't matter. As long as I kill one more, that's enough.'

Ever since her father was killed by demons, she had resolved to die on the battlefield.

'At least one person must survive.'

Amy.

'Ryan, you'd understand, wouldn't you?'

She didn't need to hear the answer.

The capital of Kashan was beyond any hope of restoration.

While they could only manage to set up temporary shelters in each district, the Five Great Stars came to find Shirone.

"We're returning to the Ivory Tower," Minerva said.

"Since Hell's army is moving south, this place should be safe for a while. We're also worried about the Grand Master."

Having experienced Argentis's power firsthand, Shirone nodded without complaint.

"Yes. I'll finish up here and follow you."

Freed looked back at Ryan.

'A Knight of Maha.'

The Domain of Apostasy.

True to the rumors of handling the extremes of divine transcendence, the power of a single sword stroke surpassed Freed's.

"When you return, bring that swordsman too. The Grand Master will want to meet him."

When Shirone looked back, Ryan immediately answered.

"I'll go anywhere Shirone goes."

That single answer made the Five Great Stars feel like the Ivory Tower was under pressure.

"Interesting fellow."

Freed smiled wickedly as he turned around, and the others followed him out of Kashan.

"What will you do now, Shirone?"

"There's someone I need to meet."

Just as Shirone smiled and turned toward Aganos, a black shadow fell from the sky.

It was Yula, leader of the Wind Corps.

"Lord Shirone, Her Majesty summons you."

Not minding the change in honorifics, Shirone nodded and followed her.

The underground facility of the imperial palace they arrived at had been pierced by Argentis's roots, creating a massive tunnel.

"You've slain quite the monster."

"This is just the beginning."

Yula bowed her head before a rusted iron door.

"Please enter."

After a grating sound, the iron door opened to reveal Uorin waiting in a shabby room.

"Welcome, Shirone."

Contrary to expectations, her expression was bright.

Kido sat on a makeshift bed in the corner with bandages wrapped around his stomach.

"Hey, long time no see."

"Huh? Kido?"

Since he hadn't expected to find him with Uorin, Shirone asked with a surprised expression.

"What happened?"

"It's a long story. Anyway, I seem to be in the same boat as this woman now."

He looked at Uorin, but instead of explaining about Kido, she offered him a seat first.

"Sit. I called you because there's something to discuss."

Shirone sat on the sofa across from her while Ryan moved behind him and stood at attention.

'Two Apostates.'

No matter how strong humans were, it was natural for them to be governed by social systems.

But these two now possessed enough power to face an entire nation.

"Sorry for the humble place. Given the situation, I can't help it."

"It's fine. I'm glad you're alive."

Uorin stuck out her tongue.

"Something a bit embarrassing happened."

The thrill of kneeling before Havitz was just that much to Uorin.

"I did it for you, Shirone. How much of a loss would it be if a pretty woman like me died? And Shirone, you should at least embrace an empress in your lifetime."

Shirone changed the subject.

"What about Gando?"

"He hasn't woken up yet. Pathetic. They say there's no danger to his life, but I can't guarantee it."

Only then did he feel somewhat relieved.

"Don't worry. He's strong. And you're safe too. Now we need to rebuild Kashan."

Uorin chuckled.

"Living long enough to receive sympathy from you."

"No, I meant..."

"I know. But I am Kashan. Besides, the castle still remains. And I originally like this kind of thing. The more difficult the problem..."

Uorin crossed her legs and smiled.

"The greater the pleasure of conquest."

Though her boldness was somewhat infuriating, it was a hundred times better than seeing her dejected.

"But I'm going to quit being Kashan's empress."

Shirone's eyes widened.

"Quit?"

"There's no particular merit to it. To be honest, I knew. Ever since the Legal Murder project failed, the age that Theraze could control was over."

Uorin shrugged her shoulders.

"Me. Miro. Shirone. Gaold. Ah, now Ryan too. Each of us has reached the highest realm through our own philosophy. But I can definitively say that currently, the strongest human is Havitz."

It was truly an age of extreme evil.

"Good defeating evil is only possible in sanitized history. People love hero stories. Heroes who overcome manageable frustrations and manageable adversities to achieve victory. There's no truth in that. Actually, nobody wants to know the truth."

Theraze, the oldest in humanity, had packaged the empress's history in such a way.

"But now it's impossible. There's no way to package this insane world. What remains for us is not history, but terrible truth."

Uorin pointed at Shirone.

"Shall I tell you the truth I see?"

Shirone silently waited for the answer.

"It's over, Shirone. Good and evil alike, whoever wins, beautiful hero stories will no longer be written. What remains is each person's despair and regret, anger and..."

Uorin's eyes gleamed as she spoke.

"Pain."

"Kyaaaah!"

Gaold's screams echoed miserably through the deep mountains of the southern continent.

"Uaaah! Uaaaaaaah!"

It was already the second day.

Though he hadn't even fought any battles, now just being alive brought tremendous pain washing over him.

"Mister! Are you okay?"

Gangnan shook him with a tearful expression, but Gaold's face only contorted more.

"It hurts. It hurts..."

Words leaking out while unconscious.

His hair had turned completely white, his eyes completely rolled back, foaming at the mouth and convulsing.

It was a sight Gangnan had witnessed dozens of times in the south.

"Kyaaaaaaah!"

As the pain rose without limit, Gaold crawled forward on the ground while prostrate.

His ten fingers, standing stiffly upright, clawed at the ground frantically, but no one could bear his pain for him.

"Die..."

Tears flowed down Gangnan's cheeks.

"Just die! Just die already! What's the point of living in this state!"

She resented Miro.

"Let's go to Zion right now! Kill them all! Do whatever you want and end it!"

"Miro. Miro..."

Was saying it hurt the only thing he could manage?

"You stupid fool!"

Gangnan climbed onto Gaold's chest and grabbed his throat with both hands.

"You're being used! How could that woman possibly know how much pain you're in? Even one billionth of it?"

"Keuuuu..."

She couldn't bring herself to actually break his neck.

"Just end it already."

Releasing her grip, Gangnan embraced Gaold's face and poured out tears.

"Just... let's die. Die with me."

Gaold's breathing gradually began to stabilize, but his consciousness didn't return.

"Please, please..."

Curled up in a ball and trembling, Gangnan was watched by Zulu with indifferent eyes.

"Pain."

At Shirone's words, Uorin nodded.

"Right. Behind beautifully packaged history lies pain that humans don't want to face, which has been omitted. The reason I'm giving up Kashan is because I don't want to turn away anymore. More precisely, it's because I love you."

"Uorin, I..."

"Listen to the end. I'm not asking you to embrace me right now."

Shirone closed his mouth.

"From now on, I will become one woman rather than Kashan's empress. Nothing will change anyway. In the end, you'll come to accept me."

"How can you be so sure?"

Knowing how vast Theraze's blueprint was, Shirone couldn't dismiss it lightly.

"Because you can never surpass Nane."

"It sprouted."

Looking down at the blue sprout, Shurah approached from behind Nane, a towel wrapped around her head.

"Yes. It sprouted."

Nane was silent for a long while.

"What are you thinking about?"

"That it's beautiful."

Had even the monster of the Council of Ten become a woman after sharing flesh with Nane?

Shurah smiled with her eyes.

"What kind of flower will bloom? Or will grass grow?"

"What's beautiful isn't the flower. It's that I planted something here. That heart."

Shurah listened attentively.

"Gaold's pain, Shirone's universal love, this world too—everything ultimately sprouted from one heart."

It starts with planting a heart.

"Why?"

Golden energy rippled from Nane's back.

"If nothing had been planted from the beginning, none of it would exist."

As he dug up the soil with both hands and plucked out the sprout, Shurah retreated dozens of meters.

"Bu, Buddha..."

Was he awakening again?

"Clinging, worrying, wandering in search of happiness in illusions that don't even exist!"

The moment Nane crushed the sprout.

'It disappeared.'

The Buddha's energy vanished.

"Yet the reason it's so beautiful is..."

As Nane slowly lifted his hand, the sprout remained perfectly preserved and unharmed.

"Because I planted it."

Placing the sprout back in the hole he'd dug and gently covering it with soil, Nane spoke.

"This is the final problem of this world, Shurah."

He had almost reached it.

"The only thing for me to overcome."

Relaxing from the tension, Shurah fell backward onto her bottom.
