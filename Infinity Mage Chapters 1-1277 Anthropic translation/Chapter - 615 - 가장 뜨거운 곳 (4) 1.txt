[615] The Hottest Place (4)

Arian Shirone.

The name already etched in the students' minds flashed brilliantly.

Ever since he defeated Dante in the 2000th duel, he had been featured without fail in Spirit magazine.

When such a promising talent suddenly gave up his senior class evaluation, it had become a hot topic in schools nationwide.

"What's wrong? Did something happen?"

At Shirone's question, Iruki and Ned approached.

"Where have you been until now? We've been waiting all day."

"Sorry. The Association President called for me. He came late, so..."

"The Association President?"

The students began murmuring.

So he had been meeting one-on-one with the Association President until now?

Among the 150 gathered students, only Shirone had been called - this couldn't sit well with anyone.

But as Elizabeth had said, thinking of meeting the Association President as special treatment meant no future as a mage.

"Why did the Association President call for you?"

Curtis approached, representing the students.

His eyes were full of dissatisfaction, and his previously relaxed expression was nowhere to be found.

"Why should I tell you that?"

It was an extremely personal matter, and since he had rejected the Association President's proposal anyway, there was nothing to feel guilty about.

"Hmph, since when has a place like Alpheas Magic School become so arrogant? Are you acting up because you trust the Vice Principal?"

Hearing Curtis's words, Shirone could finally grasp the atmosphere in the hall.

"Whatever happened, let's not fight. There's nothing good about draining our energy before such an important exam."

It was reasonable advice, but for the Royal Magic School students who were already offended, it felt like a losing situation.

Attention, students.

Lufist's voice came from the ceiling.

'It's starting.'

Only Fermi smiled meaningfully as the announcement continued.

Seeing you future pillars of the kingdom mingling so pleasantly fills my heart with pride as Association President.

The students checked the video recording devices installed throughout the area.

They knew these were installed for security, but they never dreamed the Association President would be watching.

'And yet he says he's proud?'

This meant he had already anticipated the students' conflicts.

In that spirit, I've prepared a special event.

The students waited tensely for what would follow.

Hidden somewhere in your location is one certified mage license.

Dozens of gazes swept around the area.

Of course, no name is written on it. So whoever possesses it becomes the owner.

Shirone's eyes sharpened.

Only Shirone, who had met with him, knew this wasn't an event prepared from the beginning.

'This is an event targeting me.'

Whoever obtains the certified license should go to the registration office on the 7th floor of the Association. From that moment, that student becomes both a certified mage and a Magic Association employee.

"A Magic Association employee?"

For an event, this seemed rather extreme.

Well then, have a pleasant time. That is all.

Amid the coexistence of wanting to crawl on the floor immediately to find the license and wondering if there was any need to be so desperate, someone spoke up.

"Well, let's just enjoy the party for now. No need to search with fire in our eyes, right?"

"Right. Whoever stumbles upon it while walking around gets lucky. It's just a simple event. Like a prize drawing."

Thinking of it that way made it seem trivial, but already only the words "certified mage license" remained in their heads.

As expected, when the students scattered in all directions, Iruki nudged Shirone's side.

"What exactly happened? You can tell us, can't you?"

"It's exactly what you're thinking. This event - he actually proposed it to me. I refused though."

"Hmm. Love-hate? Consideration? Quite complicated."

Ned asked.

"What should we do? Even though the others are pretending not to care, they're already searching everywhere. Should we look too?"

"Follow your own judgment. But I won't be doing it."

The kind of mage Shirone dreamed of becoming wasn't like that.

"Let's just watch for now. He definitely wouldn't have made it easy to find."

And so the atmosphere of this bizarre event began to ripen.

Though few students searched openly, most could be seen pretending to enjoy the feast while lifting plates or pretending to pick something up while searching under tables.

'It's not here. Where on earth is it?'

No matter how spacious the annex was, with so many people, visible locations were checked in an instant.

"As expected, they can't find it."

Iruki said.

"If this event wasn't planned, then the license was hidden after the students entered. In that case, roughly two possibilities can be suggested. First, it was hidden by magic. Second, it was hidden through outside staff."

Students nearby flinched and then lingered within a certain distance.

Ned wasn't one to miss this, but he didn't mind.

"As a Servant, you should be able to remember all the outside staff's movements."

Currently, there were 23 staff members helping with the party.

"From memory, no staff member showed behavior that could suggest hiding something. Of course, I can't confirm movements in blind spots."

"Maybe the staff are carrying it?"

"That possibility can't be denied either."

'The staff!'

Students scattered in all directions and approached the outside staff.

"Do you happen to have the license? Or did you receive something? Tell us honestly!"

The staff shook their heads with bewildered expressions, but the students' interrogation was persistent.

"Don't be like that, give us a hint at least! Is it a code? Do we need to say a keyword?"

Watching their commotion, Iruki said.

"This Association President isn't normal either."

If there was one thing that could emotionally drive the nation's most outstanding students, it would be a mage license.

"There's no way he'd entrust it to outside staff. It was hidden by magic."

From this point, Shirone's voice became quieter, and Iruki and Ned also became conscious of their surroundings.

"Right. The staff never left the annex, and they weren't replaced by anyone else either."

Ned asked.

"There were no blind spots?"

"Of course. I was watching from beginning to end."

That was well within Iruki's capabilities.

"But how was it hidden by magic? The mana control device is operating."

Shirone said.

"That's exactly the hint. Lufist is testing us."

"You bastard! Get lost! This spot is mine!"

"I was here first!"

Voices began rising from all directions.

"At first, you might accept it casually."

Iruki turned his head toward them.

"But once you see other competitors moving, you gradually become anxious. What if that guy finds the license? Even though it's really a 1-in-150 chance, it feels like your own thing is being stolen."

Ned said.

"Human pleasure centers respond more stimulatingly to others' failures than to one's own success."

"It's a crowd control method mainly used by politicians. Once the numbers increase, it becomes impossible to stop. Individual will gets swept away by the whole, and only the desire not to hand success over to others operates."

The value of parts gets absorbed into the whole.

"I don't like it."

Shirone glared at the video recording device installed in the corner.

It seemed to be saying that he too was merely a slave to the system.

"Annoying provincial upstart!"

Finally, fists began flying.

"You bastard! You hit first!"

As it escalated into conflicts between schools, the party instantly became pandemonium.

"Keke. Kekeke."

Fermi, who had been watching while leaning against the wall, twisted his lips into a grin.

"Such a beautiful night."

One who understands and exploits the system.

"The license is mine!"

"Shut up! The Association is meant for me anyway!"

Those devoured by the system.

"Stop it."

Shirone clenched both fists.

"Stop it, I said!"

One who opposes the system.

Without even knowing who presented the red and blue options.

And the meta-system reigning above that system.

'I have to stop this somehow.'

In the minds of those fighting, Lufist's intentions no longer remained.

Shirone, who had concentrated to enter the Spirit Zone, shook his head.

'It's no use after all.'

The mana control device reroutes some of the specific brain waves when humans concentrate, disrupting their focus.

Thus, it was a bizarre situation where thought was entirely possible, but only the Spirit Zone couldn't be entered.

Before the technology that turned mages into ordinary people, Shirone widened his eyes and contemplated the entire world.

'Direct!'

As the Ultima System activated, information from the mana control device decomposed into minimal units and permeated through.

'Wow...'

It felt like standing in the middle of a world where endless streams of information vibrated like jump ropes.

Following the real-time changing gaps by flowing his consciousness, Shirone finally reached the point of concentration.

"Everyone close your eyes!"

A sphere of light compressed at terrifying speed above Shirone's head, and friends who had already experienced this squeezed their eyes shut.

'Shining Impact!'

With a flash, massive white light exploded, erasing the annex's scenery into white nothingness.

"Oho?"

As light burst from all monitors illuminating the annex, Lufist, who had been resting his chin on his hand, raised the corner of his mouth.

"A Gaian..."

Simultaneously, the monitor lights went out and caught the students' surprised expressions.

"Wh-what?"

Students who had stopped fighting looked at Shirone one by one.

"Stop it. What do you think you'll accomplish fighting among ourselves? A license or whatever - we can obtain it perfectly well with our own power."

Rational words brought shame to the emotional ones, which soon rationalized and transformed into anger.

"Who are you to tell us what to do? Do you think you're some noble person?"

"Right! Do you think we're fighting over some mere license? This is a chance to enter the Association!"

Shirone opened his palm.

'Photon Cannon!'

As photons loaded with mass were born and vibrated menacingly, the students' faces turned pale.

"H-how can you use magic?"

Those who confirmed the mana control device was still operating couldn't help but be shocked.

"Don't tell me... you bypassed it?"

Curtis, ranked first in the Royal Magic School, muttered with a dazed expression.

It wasn't that he hadn't tried when the fight broke out, but a mere student breaking through the Association's security was absurd.

'Impossible! He used some trick. Otherwise...'

There couldn't be such a difference.

Shirone approached Curtis with the Photon Cannon floating.

"Move aside."

"Ugh!"

Though momentarily indignant, he who was now no different from an ordinary person had no choice.

As Curtis slowly stepped back, Shirone's gaze lowered and pierced through the floor.

'It's here.'

Through Direct, he could sense a box that someone had magically moved.

'Break through the security device presented by the Association.'

That was the minimum condition to obtain the certified mage license.

'That's what pisses me off!'

As Shirone gritted his teeth and slammed the Photon Cannon down, the floor cracked with a tremendous roar.

"He really destroyed it with light."

It was the moment they witnessed with their eyes the reality of God's particles they had only encountered in magazines.

The space below the floor was empty, and Shirone, inserting his hand, opened the box and pulled out the license.

"Ah..."

The students looked at it with envy and desperate longing.

'I want it, the certified mage license.'

And it was a license with guaranteed appointment to the Magic Association.

'Lufist, this is my answer.'

Shirone held up the license toward the video recording device and cast multiple light explosions using Elision.

Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-bang!

As three small light explosions pounded the object caught in between, the license twisted and was finally shattered to pieces.

"What...!"

While students lost their minds at the absurd situation, Shirone glared at Lufist and scattered the license fragments into the air.

The video recording device stared back expressionlessly.
