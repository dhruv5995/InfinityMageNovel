[601] A Tree Without Roots (3)

"Nade, it's so good to see you! How have you been?"

Even as Liz approached and shook his shoulders, Nade stood there with a blank expression, unable to find his escaped soul.

'How?'

She who should be in the capital Bashka was here?

'No, that's not the problem.'

At the party held after graduation exams, Nade had confessed his true feelings to Liz.

She had left school saying he was a good junior but she couldn't see him as a man, leaving behind only an apology.

Though that day's events were still vivid in Nade's mind, he couldn't understand her approaching him with such a bright expression as if nothing had happened.

"...When did you return?"

While Shirone looked on puzzledly, Nade forced himself to speak.

"This morning."

"But I heard you got a job at the capital armory..."

"Yeah. I took vacation time to come down. I had business."

"Ah, I see."

As Nade couldn't hide his dejected appearance and lowered his head, Liz smiled mischievously.

"But I'll probably be wrapping up my job soon and coming down here."

Nade's head shot up quickly, but Liz's following words crushed his hopes once again.

"Actually, I'm getting engaged this time."

"What?"

Even though Liz's voice echoed dozens of times in his head, Nade couldn't help but ask again.

Liz linked arms with a well-groomed man standing behind her and approached again.

"This is him. Say hello. Certified 8th-grade mage Clyde Oscar. He'll be taking a position at the Creas Magic Association."

"Ah, hello."

Shirone hurriedly bowed his head, but Nade was too stunned to remember to greet him.

'Engaged? What was engagement? Engaged?'

Oscar didn't mind and welcomed the two with a good-natured smile.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Oscar. You must be Nade. I've heard a lot about you from Liz."

"Ah..."

Only after Oscar extended his hand for a handshake did Nade come to his senses and slowly grasp his hand.

It was a soft and warm hand.

"Instead of standing around like this, let's go somewhere to eat. Since I met my juniors, I should treat them to something delicious."

At Liz's words, Nade waved his hands dismissively.

"No. We have to return to school soon..."

Though Nade had been making a fuss about absolutely not going to school just moments before, Shirone perceptively nodded.

"Yes. We need to go back to school."

Liz didn't even pretend to listen.

"You're lying! You think I don't know? Coming to the city at this time - anyone can see you're skipping class."

"It's true though. We really need to go."

Shirone did his best, but Liz ignored him and approached Nade.

"Let's go, okay? I'll buy you anything you want to eat."

"I don't particularly want to eat anything..."

"I really want to introduce you to him."

Only then did Nade look directly into Liz's eyes, discovering the desperation contained in her beautiful pupils.

'She remembers too.'

Perhaps she thought that because they were young then, and because so much time had passed, those feelings would have faded.

'But this is too cruel.'

What had Liz told Oscar about him?

Perhaps she had described him as a junior who once followed her around, or as a troublesome younger brother.

'Damn, what is this.'

Liz wanted to shake off even the last traces of guilt remaining from the past by introducing her fiancé.

"Come on? Nade, let's go."

The more he thought about it, the more unfair it seemed, but seeing her face as desperate as a lost kitten made his heart pound and rendered him unable to refuse.

"Fine. But I'm going to order something expensive."

"Of course! You're not just any junior - you're my direct junior from the research society."

Direct junior from the research society.

Those words seemed to explain everything.

Since it was morning, there weren't many people in the upscale restaurant.

The four of them took seats at a table by the window.

"Now, what should we eat?"

Watching her shoulders dance as she held the menu, nostalgia clouded Nade's mind.

'Dangerous.'

Her voice, way of speaking, glances, and even trivial actions - for reasons he couldn't understand, everything about her was so lovely.

"Let me introduce myself properly. I'm Oscar, and this is my fiancée Liz."

Seeing Oscar's triumphant smile made anger flare up inside Nade, but even that felt unreal before the shock of reuniting with Liz.

"I'm Nade. This is my friend Shirone."

As Shirone bowed his head, Nade added:

"He's quite famous."

"Oh my, really?"

Among magic school students in the Kingdom of Tormia, there couldn't be anyone who didn't know Shirone's name.

Even if Oscar was a professional mage, he would understand what it meant to receive the kingdom's attention.

Honestly, he wanted to wipe that smug expression off his face, but Oscar skillfully parried the provocation.

"Haha! How rude of me. Actually, for a few years after graduation I used to check Spirit magazine and such, but lately I haven't been keeping up with magic school news."

He was saying they were just students after all.

Of course that was true, but since it was a petty comment toward juniors, Liz quickly changed the subject.

"If you're quite famous, you must be graduating soon. You're seniors now, right?"

"Yes."

"That must be tough. Honestly, I still have dreams about being a senior even now."

"In my case it's okay though. I gave up on the second semester graduation evaluation."

"Ah, so that's why you came to the city today. There were quite a few kids like that in my time too. So did you give up too, Nade?"

"No. I really do have business..."

"Really? Then what's your current ranking?"

Nade felt a slight wave of fear, but lying seemed even more pathetic, so he told the truth.

"Last place."

"Pfft!"

Oscar made a show of spitting out the water he was drinking.

"Ah, sorry. It was just so unexpected. You didn't seem like it."

Actually, ever since hearing that Shirone had given up on evaluation, he hadn't held much expectation.

Even now, and when he attended magic school, giving up evaluation was a choice made when nothing else worked.

'Though I didn't expect dead last.'

Even without showing it, Nade could tell Oscar's gaze had changed.

"Hmm, I see."

On the other hand, Liz seemed to have some understanding and looked at Nade with a pitying expression.

"There must be circumstances."

"Not really. Last place is last place."

With his dignity already ruined, Nade spoke as if giving up completely.

"Hehe, why is your face like that? Did you fight with someone again?"

Only then did Nade remember the wounds remaining on his face.

'Today really is the worst day.'

As Nade slightly lowered his head, Oscar interjected.

"Giving up on evaluation is fine, and low grades don't matter, but if you're going to be a mage, you can't go around fighting like that. Once you start overconfident in your abilities, there's no progress."

Though it was advice from a senior who had already become a professional, today Nade couldn't help but take it badly.

"I wasn't fighting. This is just... I did this because I was angry."

Even knowing that all these words would flood back as regret after parting with Liz, he couldn't put a filter on his throat.

Watching the traces of self-harm, Liz smiled bitterly as if she understood.

"You're still the same, Nade."

The meal continued in a somewhat awkward atmosphere.

Mostly Liz led the conversation with Oscar listening and occasionally chiming in.

The food was delicious, but Nade couldn't tell where it was going.

"Oh my, really? So Shirone is also in the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society? It's really hard to get even one member to join. Are you capable?"

"It's only three people total. You know Iruki, right?"

Liz clasped her hands together and looked up at the ceiling.

"Ah, meeting you really brings back memories. We used to discuss what the secrets of the upper floors were all night long. It still hasn't been revealed, has it?"

"Well, no..."

Having completely closed off the upper floors, Shirone had nothing to say.

As their alumni gathering continued, Oscar, feeling left out, changed the topic.

"Not much time left now. The graduation exam, I mean. Are preparations going well? It's the most important exam of your life."

Knowing that Oscar's every word carried intention, Nade still had no choice but to be the ugly duckling.

"I don't care about exams or anything. I don't even want to become a mage."

It was quite an arrogant statement, and Oscar didn't let it slide.

"The decision is yours. But staying attached to school while saying that is contradictory, isn't it? If you're going to run away like this..."

"He'll pass."

Liz cut him off.

"He'll be able to pass. Because Nade is strong. Right?"

Faced with eyes full of conviction, Nade hurriedly turned his head to hide his reddened face.

'Damn it. If you look at me like that, what am I supposed to do?'

"Ahem."

Oscar cleared his throat and wiped his mouth with a napkin.

"If we're done eating, let's go. I have business to attend to."

"Really? We haven't even had tea yet."

"Liz, I told you we have an appointment with people from the association."

"Ah, right."

Liz reluctantly rose from her seat slowly.

"It was nice meeting you today. I'll pay for this."

"Yes. Thank you for the delicious meal."

Shirone and Nade also stood and bowed their heads.

"I'll come visit to greet the principal soon. See you then, Nade."

Though she spoke while holding her fiancé's hand, Nade's heart began beating like a broken machine again.

"Yes. Take care."

After Liz and Oscar left the restaurant side by side, Nade finally came to his senses, sighed, and plopped down in his chair.

"Ah, this is driving me crazy. Shirone, let's stop by a pharmacy. I think I'm getting indigestion."

"Who was that exactly? She's not just any senior, right? I've never seen you this nervous before."

Nade, who as head of the research society never got intimidated even in front of teachers.

"Well... it's a long story. I'll tell you as we walk."

"Got it. Let's go then."

As Shirone prepared to leave, Nade held out his hand.

"Wait! Just 10 minutes, let's stay here for just 10 minutes."

"Why? We need to go buy medicine."

"Senior Liz might still be around."

"..."

Shirone thought there was definitely something wrong with his mind.

"Why did you do that?"

Oscar, who had been walking silently for a while, asked.

"Do what?"

"Protecting those juniors too much. I have my dignity too. How can you interrupt when I'm giving advice?"

Liz smiled like a seagull.

"What? Are you jealous?"

"Who's jealous? Of those kids?"

"Then why are you bothered? Just think of it as buying cute juniors a meal."

"Honestly, it was annoying. You know what? That Nade kid was constantly provoking me."

"Hey, aren't you overreacting? Honestly, you were being a bit preachy. Those kids are doing their best to live too."

"See, you're taking their side again."

Thinking they might really fight at this rate, Liz backed down.

"Fine. I was wrong. Maybe I got too excited seeing them after so long."

When she gave in first, Oscar's mood softened a bit too.

"I'm sorry too. I couldn't help being bothered after hearing about that confession from before."

"Geez, that's all in the past. It was three years ago. Nade was only sixteen then."

"But you said he was strong? From what I saw, neither of them will become mages. They don't seem to have persistence either."

"Nade really is strong. I don't know much about that Shirone kid, but Nade will be able to pass."

Oscar blinked.

He'd known Liz for quite a while, but she had never used the word "strong" even about him.

"What kind of kid is he? Nade, I mean."

"Well. Actually, I'm not sure."

"You don't know?"

Liz raised her gaze and searched her memory.

"Blue lightning..."

"Huh?"

"The feeling of seeing only afterimages even though he's right in front of you. Nade was that kind of junior, I think."

Oscar couldn't understand what that feeling was like.
