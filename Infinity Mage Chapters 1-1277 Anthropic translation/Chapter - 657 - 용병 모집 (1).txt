[657] Mercenary Recruitment (1)

Alpheas Magic School.

Spring, when the new semester would begin, was still far away.

While most of the teachers had left for their hometowns, Bishop Ethella of the Karcis Order was absorbed in meditation at the training hall.

'A great evil is approaching.'

Even without hearing news about La Enemie, her purely refined mind was realizing the changes in the world.

'I must step forward.'

Even among the nation's greatest spiritual seekers gathered in the Karcis Order, Ethella held a unique position.

She was a bishop overseeing one of the twelve dioceses, and being the direct successor of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist passed down from the founder Karcis Jung was only possible because she was a genius who might appear once in a hundred years.

"Bishop, are you inside?"

As both a monk and a Zoner, Ethella had already sensed the visitor coming to her from a kilometer and a half away.

"Please come in."

She slowly opened her eyes and greeted her guest with a lovely smile.

"It's been a long time, Bishop Rodi."

An elderly man in his sixties, shorter than Ethella, entered the training hall leaning on a cane.

He was a kindly-faced old man with white eyebrows that spread like wings.

"You're still at the school. You should be making your rounds of the diocese soon."

"Yes. I'm planning to leave in a few days. I should have come to greet you first."

Rodi waved his hand.

"Not at all. I fully understand, given how busy you are. After all, you can't be like a leisurely old man such as myself."

Since exchanging courtesies could go on endlessly, Ethella offered him a seat.

"Please sit. But... what brings you here?"

After the greetings ended and Rodi took his seat, his expression darkened rapidly.

"I'm afraid this is news too painful for me to speak of..."

It certainly wouldn't be good news, but Ethella waited calmly.

"Archbishop Raphael has passed away."

"What?"

A mind that could maintain composure even in the most horrific situations was greatly shaken this time.

"I'm sorry, but what you just said..."

"He was murdered."

Ethella's heart sank with a thud.

"Isn't there some mistake?"

What reason would there be for the Archbishop overseeing the Karcis Order to earn someone's resentment?

Even if there were, Raphael was the successor of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist who had directly taught martial arts to Ethella—he wasn't someone whose life could easily be taken even before the world's strongest opponents.

"The Order couldn't believe it at first either. We thought he had left on a spiritual journey as always. We recovered his body from the central mountain range three months ago."

"No, why? I mean, Master was..."

Though Ethella couldn't suppress her confused emotions, Rodi's tone remained calm.

"When we confirmed the Archbishop's cause of death, there was only one suspect: Shagal."

"Shagal, you mean..."

"One of the world's 100 most dangerous individuals. According to experts, he's called Shagal of the Swift Sword. Indeed, 273 stab wounds were found on the Archbishop's body. They said it showed signs of stabbing at tremendous speed."

Ethella's lips trembled.

"Anyway, so currently the Order is scheduling the selection of the next Archbishop..."

"Where is he?"

Ethella interrupted.

"This person called Shagal—where is he now?"

They wouldn't have delivered this news to Ethella without even confirming his identity.

"We recently received word that he entered Baska."

Having delivered the facts, Rodi looked at Ethella, who was sitting with her eyes tightly closed.

"Bishop Ethella, revenge is merely evil's methodology. The doctrine of the Karcis Order that the Archbishop advocated..."

"I know."

Ethella opened her eyes again.

"I also don't approve of repaying murder with murder. However, as his disciple, I feel sorry that I couldn't even hear Master's final true intentions."

She had to meet Shagal.

She had to hear what kind of person he was and why he had to kill the Archbishop who chose the path of good.

"I'll go to the capital. Bishop Rodi, please take care of the Order's affairs."

Seeing Ethella's eyes flash with steel-like determination, Rodi let out a long breath and rose from his seat.

"Please be careful. While I don't doubt your abilities, he is a dangerous individual."

Ethella also rose and took the courtesy of a monk.

"Thank you for delivering this personally. Take care."

Even after Rodi left the training hall, Ethella stood there in a daze for a long time.

"Master."

The kind face of Raphael, who had cherished and cared for her like his own daughter since childhood, flickered in her memory.

"Sob..."

Unable to hold back her tears, Ethella finally fell to her knees.

"Sob... sob..."

Faint crying echoed softly through the training hall.

In the deep forest of the underground mountain range behind the royal castle, a campfire crackled and burned.

Sitting on a rock, Shagal looked at a short sword gleaming in the firelight.

With a thud, the short sword pierced his opposite palm, but the blade didn't come through the back of his hand.

As he slowly pulled out the short sword, the blade that had penetrated the handle revealed itself by spring force.

A magic sword that couldn't harm anyone.

It was the first gift Shagal had received when he joined the Grassleaf Circus.

"The moon isn't rising."

Looking up at the pitch-black night sky, he suddenly remembered the battle from a few months ago.

'It was this dark then too.'

Archbishop Mago Raphael of the Karcis Order.

Even he, who had killed countless strong enemies, was a person so strong that his own life couldn't be guaranteed.

"Whichever path you take, the way back is behind you."

Those words spoken during battle had somehow become his dying words, but strangely they wouldn't leave his head.

It was probably because his words reminded him of someone precious in his memory.

"Troupe Leader."

It was 25 years ago, when Shagal was seven years old.

Abandoned as a baby without knowing who his parents were, by the time he came of age, he realized there was something different about him from others.

The scent of incidents.

It was presumably an extreme development of olfactory perception that had occurred since he was a fetus who couldn't see, but at the time he simply dismissed it as being able to remember things a bit better than others.

That's why when the Grassleaf Circus, which traveled around the Merhen Kingdom performing, came after two years, Shagal could recognize that person exactly.

"Are you performing starting today?"

While the troupe members were setting up tents in the meadow, circus leader Raiden, who was peeling an apple some distance away, noticed a dirty kid like a stray dog standing beside him.

Raiden's appearance, with his bald head, was so comical that he wouldn't need clown makeup.

"Well, we need people to gather before we can perform, don't we?"

When Shagal couldn't continue the conversation and hesitated, Raiden, understanding the boy's heart, asked.

"Do you want to see the circus?"

Shagal shook his head.

"Then what?"

Shagal slowly stepped back, then suddenly kicked off the ground and performed tumbling with nimble skill.

"Oh?"

It was certainly excellent athletic ability for a kid.

"I want to join the circus too. I don't need money. Just let me eat."

Raiden made a pitiful expression, guessing Shagal's life situation.

But entry wasn't easy just for doing some tumbling.

This was evident just looking at Tia, Shagal's peer, who had mastered not only free acrobatics but also unicycling, ball rolling, and tightrope walking.

"I'm sorry, but that's something I need to discuss with the troupe members. It looks glamorous, but it's a very dangerous profession."

Shagal didn't give up.

"I don't care if I die. Whether I die today or tomorrow makes no difference anyway."

Watching the tears flow down under his chin, Raiden gestured for him to come closer and held out the short sword he'd been using to peel the apple.

"If you're tired of living like that, I'll end your breath for you."

Only later would he learn that the look in Raiden's eyes at that moment was that of a perfect professional.

"...Stab me. I'm not afraid of dying."

Raiden coldly stared at the trembling child's body, then stabbed toward his heart with lightning-fast movement.

"Kuk!"

A rough breath burst out, but Shagal never moved.

Watching him endure with clenched fists, Raiden finally smiled and pulled out the short sword.

As the blade slid out with a spring sound, Shagal, whose legs gave out, collapsed with a thud.

"Wh-what?"

"Surprised? It's a magic sword."

"Magic?"

Raiden demonstrated by pressing the tip of the blade with his finger.

"The blade goes in like this. But fast hand movements are necessary for the trick. Like this."

Holding it in reverse grip and stabbing his forearm, the blade rapidly went in and out with a whooshing sound.

"How is it? Doesn't it really look like stabbing?"

Raiden held out the short sword's handle in front of the dazed Shagal.

"Always practice. The key is to stab swiftly."

Shagal's head shot up.

"Then I'm joining the circus too?"

"Let's call you a trainee for now. The performance starts tomorrow, so go to the city with Tia and distribute promotional flyers."

"Tia?"

Raiden laughed heartily.

"There's a girl as stubborn as you. Get along well. Though it'll probably give you some headaches."

After joining the Grassleaf Circus, Shagal learned countless techniques from Raiden, and by around age fourteen, he had mastered most circus tricks.

"Tia! Come out quickly! We need to distribute flyers!"

"Wait a bit! I have to do my makeup!"

Tia, having finished her clown makeup, came out of the tent wearing a short skirt.

Though they'd lived together like siblings since age seven, to Shagal's adolescent eyes, Tia now looked different.

Hiding his inner feelings, he pointed at Tia and laughed.

"Hahaha! The snot looks too real! What, is it actually real?"

"Shut up! This is how the little kids like it!"

They needed to win the children's favor for parents to bring them to the show, didn't they?

"Does it look that weird? Should I just wipe it off?"

"No, it's not weird. It's natural for a fool to dress like a fool."

"Do you really want to die?"

Tia chased after him with claws extended, but since secondary sexual characteristics had begun, catching up to Shagal was impossible.

"Ahhh! The fool is chasing me!"

Actually, Shagal liked Tia's makeup.

Due to the nature of their profession, Tia had to become the target of adults' lewd gazes.

Each time that happened, he wanted to chase after them and punch them, but he could endure it because at least no one knew Tia's real face.

"Hey, hey! Bark! Bark!"

Woof woof! Woof woof!

The two people playing tag stopped at the sound coming from the tent on the opposite side.

"What's that?"

Going around the tent to check, they found three boys from the city throwing stones at the dog guarding the Grassleaf Circus tent.

"Die! Take that! Take that!"

Shagal shouted furiously.

"Hey! What are you doing right now! Stop it immediately!"

"Hmph! Who are you circus people to boss us around? Don't you know my dad issued your performance permit?"

"I don't care who your dad is—why are you bothering a dog that's just sitting there? Want to really get in trouble?"

When Shagal, who was a head taller than his peers, threatened them, the boys flinched but weren't more afraid than that.

"You think you can get us in trouble? Hey, clown! I'll come watch your panties later!"

Shagal's eyes flipped.

"These bastards...!"

But before he could lunge forward, Raiden had somehow approached the boys and sent them a chilling look.

"Urk!"

Before those cold eyes that had even tamed wild beasts, even these fearless ones felt their knees go weak.

"Go back. The performance hasn't started yet."

When the boys, reading the mood, turned and disappeared, Shagal, still not cooled down, protested.

"Troupe Leader! Why did you just let them go? Those guys need to be taught a lesson."

"They're still young. It's fine to forgive them once."

"What's the big deal about being young? They're rotten to the core."

"Haha! That could be true, but it might not be. How would you feel if someone said that about you because of your mistake?"

"I don't care. I don't make mistakes."

Raiden placed his hand on Shagal's head.

"Shagal, all humans make mistakes. Countless mistakes they don't even know about. Yet the reason you can think that way is..."

Raiden half-knelt to meet his eye level and said.

"Because someone has already forgiven you, hasn't it?"

Watching Shagal lost in thought with a blank expression, a smile appeared on Tia's clown face.

Because someone had already forgiven him.

Those words Raiden conveyed could have remained as belief in Shagal's heart forever.

Until he met La Enemie.
