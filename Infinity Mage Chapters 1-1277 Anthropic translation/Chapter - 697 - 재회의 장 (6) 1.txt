[697] Chapter of Reunion (6)

A master swordsman who had mastered both practice and theory to the extent of writing the beginner's edition of Kazura Palace Swordsmanship.

He had once used Clear, an eye technique, to doubt Shirone, but this time he couldn't even dare attempt it.

'Is this really that boy from back then?'

Without even clashing auras, he could feel an unapproachable presence.

'An Ivory Tower candidate. That's what makes it so regrettable.'

If only Shirone had been the First Prince, even the current Kazura could have found some ray of hope.

After Kashan's Theraze took control of Kazura, the nation's power rapidly weakened, and a defeatist mentality spread among the people.

They couldn't defeat Kashan.

The conviction that the kingdom would eventually fall had broken the will of countless talents who had been striving toward the future.

But what about Shirone?

He had now appeared before him with skills that could confidently compete with any mage in Kazura.

"You've trained tremendously. To an inhuman degree."

Shirone showed modesty.

"You're too kind. I haven't accomplished anything yet."

"...Is that so?"

This concluded their private reunion.

Walker hardened his expression and knelt before Shirone to formally carry out his official duties.

"Royal Guard Captain Ritni Walker reports. His Majesty has invited Lord Shirone to the royal castle."

The color drained from Adox and Migelan's faces.

"R-Royal Guard Captain?"

Compared to Centurion Adox, he was a figure who might as well be at the ends of heaven.

The appearance of Kazura's greatest swordsman was already enough to turn the village upside down, but his deference to Shirone was a shocking event.

'Just who the hell is that bastard?'

Shirone looked back at Emma and spoke.

"I should be going now. Thank you."

With the king's approval, there would be no more diplomatic issues.

'I need to signal Kido.'

As Shirone headed for the door, Adox blocked his path.

"Wait! No matter how noble you may be, can things end like this?"

Regardless of rank, letting Shirone go like this would mean his honor as both a soldier and a man would fall to the ground.

"Respected Guard Captain, I don't know who this person is, but he tried to assault my wife. We need to investigate the truth."

Walker's face flushed.

Making personal claims when the king's orders had been mentioned was something that starkly revealed Kazura's current state.

'No. This is also an inferiority complex.'

Walker calmed his mind and belatedly recalled Adox's words, frowning.

'He tried to assault his wife?'

Given Shirone's character, it was an unlikely event.

"Is what this man says true, Lord Shirone?"

"Yes, it's true."

If he told the truth, their lives would change.

Since only they could know which came first, Shirone wanted to leave things as they were and depart, as if he had merely visited someone else's house.

Walker, lost in thought, nodded.

"Hmm, there must be some circumstances. Please leave now. I have a carriage waiting."

Adox spoke with a dazed expression.

"Please wait a moment, Guard Captain. How can there be circumstances in attempted rape?"

"Shut up, you fool."

Feeling humiliated in front of a key figure from another nation, Walker glared menacingly at Adox.

"If this were the age of glory, your head would have rolled long ago."

How carelessly must they have guarded the border for Shirone to infiltrate the village so easily?

When the eye technique Pressing was applied, Adox's breath was cut short.

"Guh... Gurk..."

It felt as if someone was choking him.

"S-save... me..."

Just before losing consciousness, Walker turned his face away coldly and headed for the door, unable to contain his anger.

"I'll go out first and wait."

Adox collapsed to the floor with a thud, and Shirone and Rian pretended not to see and stepped over his body to go outside.

Walker's subordinates had brought a carriage.

Normally they should have brought a house carriage, but since mobility was vital in this situation, they had reduced the weight as much as possible.

Inside the carriage, Walker spoke.

"This is Kazura's current situation. I'm too ashamed to show my face."

It couldn't be said that Shirone had no part in the situation where military discipline had weakened and pseudo-religious leaders were running rampant.

"I'm sorry for coming like this. But there's something I absolutely must tell His Majesty."

"Yes. I heard it's about the lost prince."

Since he wanted to tell it directly, Shirone kept his mouth shut.

"...May I ask just one thing?"

"Please speak."

"When your conversation with His Majesty is over, might there be a situation where I need to draw my sword?"

Shirone intended to tell Orcamp the truth.

That his son had died in place of Hexa.

"Perhaps... that might happen."

"I see."

Walker furrowed his graying eyebrows.

"When that time comes, I'll do my best to cut you down. Please understand."

Rian's eyes sank into an abyss.

'That will never happen.'

Kido had already come down from the mountain and was waiting.

The group that arrived in the city by carriage jumped to Kazura's royal castle through the Magic Association's spatial movement magic circle.

Perhaps thinking it was a matter that officials would be better off not knowing about, only guards were waiting.

Walker, who had arrived at the inner palace following a secret route, checked the weapons of Shirone's group.

'I want to disarm them, but...'

They would probably refuse, and he couldn't force it anyway.

Since it was an approved matter, Walker reported to Orcamp beyond the door.

"Your Majesty, Lord Shirone has arrived."

"Let them enter."

The door opened, revealing Orcamp and Eliza sitting side by side in chairs on the platform.

'You've become quite gaunt.'

The so-called royal aura was merely an illusion manifested through titles, and Kazura's king and queen no longer shone.

"Have you been well, Your Majesty? I am Ariane Shirone."

Orcamp's eyes half-closed at his different temperament from before.

'He's become a completely different person.'

Even facing a king, there was no sign of nervousnessâ€”only the will to accomplish his purpose was conveyed.

"A soldier said he heard your words through a dream. I was skeptical at first, but it seems to be true."

Terraforce's oracle seemed to have been properly conveyed.

"I apologize for startling you. I came because I have something I absolutely must tell you."

Before listening, Orcamp waved his hand.

"Everyone leave."

As the close associates left the inner palace and the door closed, Eliza leaned forward eagerly and asked.

"Don't tell me you actually found our son?"

"Yes, I found him."

Since they hadn't expected that much, Eliza's face was struck with shock.

"R-really... our son..."

Since there was no turning back from here, Shirone's eyes also sank coldly.

"I found him, but I couldn't bring him back. Your Majesty's son is no longer of this world."

"Wh-what?"

Shirone revealed all the facts.

Though he certainly conveyed only the truth, in their minds the words were distorted and processed, sounding like a story from another world.

Orcamp asked in a voice squeezed out.

"So you're saying... our son is dead?"

"No. It's not like that."

Shirone stepped forward and knelt.

"Shirone! What are you doing?"

Rian and Kido looked back with surprised expressions, but Shirone had already made his resolution.

"The prince didn't simply die. He was sacrificed in my place to save me."

Silence flowed through the inner palace.

'Shirone... you...'

Orcamp gripped his chair.

'How can you be so cold? How can you be so cruel!'

It was something he didn't need to say.

If he had considered the parents' hearts, he could have simply said the son was dead and left.

'You don't want to leave even a trace of guilt behind. You want to spill everything and leave!'

Shirone raised his head.

"You may take revenge. You may punish me. If it's something I can bear, I'll gladly accept it."

"Whyyyy!"

Eliza screamed with a ghostly face.

"Why you! Why! Why! What are you anyway!"

Shouting in a posture as if vomiting something up, blood vessels burst in her eyes and the sound of blood boiling could be heard from her throat.

"I'll kill you! I'll kill you horribly!"

As Eliza lunged forward with her nails extended, Rian and Kido grabbed their weapons.

"Walker!"

At Orcamp's voice, the door exploded and elite guards rushed into the inner palace.

"Protect His Majesty!"

Walker, who had instantly assessed the situation, charged toward Shirone.

'I must kill him.'

Nothing was more important than the king's safety.

"Uaaaah!"

Rian twisted his body and drew his great sword.

The two swords collided, and tremendous force pushed against each other as they slid across the floor.

"Graaaah!"

Rian lowered his stance and aimed his great sword as Walker, stopping his charge, thrust his sword straight across.

"Fuuuuu."

From just one exchange, they could gauge each other's capabilities.

'Tremendous strength.'

Kido looked at each guard surrounding them one by one while spinning his spear dazzlingly.

"Hah! Come on, try me."

Shirone spoke in a calmly settled voice.

"Kido, Rian. Stop it. Lower your weapons."

"No. I can't do that."

When Rian refused, Kido, who had half-lowered his spear, hastily resumed his combat stance.

"It's okay. I don't want to fight. Lower your weapons."

Rian was just as firm as Shirone.

"No. I'm going to protect you."

Shirone frowned and shouted.

"Lower them!"

It was the only way to extinguish Rian's fire, but even so, Rian kept his mouth firmly shut.

Kido, caught between the two, looked left and right with surprised eyes and asked.

"What, what? How should I handle this? Decide quickly."

Shirone spoke calmly again.

"Rian, you promised to listen to me. It's an order. Lower your weapon."

"Then get up from that position. I'll lower it then."

"..."

Shirone also wouldn't bend his stubbornness.

"Shirone, you have no intention of defending yourself right now. And these people have hostility toward you. I can't lower my sword. Punish me when we leave this place."

Kido, judging Rian's words to be reasonable, snorted and gripped his spear even more firmly.

"Rian, I have no origin."

Rian's pupils shook.

"My roots lie not in me but in Kazura's prince. That prince died in my place. This is the starting point of my life."

'Damn it!'

Rian bit his lips until they bled.

"If I can't spill everything here... I don't think I'll be able to move forward anymore."

As reason and emotion collided, the sound of the great sword's handle cracking could be heard.

'What am I supposed to do!'

With Shirone behind him, being asked to lower his weapon in front of a sword master clearly emanating killing intent was an impossible command.

'Right, he can't lower it.'

Walker also had to protect the king.

As masters beyond ordinary human limits observed each other without even blinking, Orcamp gave an order.

"Walker, that's enough."

Walker, who had been glaring at Rian with bloodshot eyes, nodded slightly as if signaling.

'We lower them simultaneously.'

The reaction speed of those in the inner palace was like human arrows, and if they were off by even once, it would be a major disaster.

The two observed each other with the greatest concentration of their lives as they lowered their arms.

The moment two swords hit the floor with a thud, the explosive atmosphere disappeared as if it were a lie.

"Huuuuu."

As the guards followed their captain in withdrawing their weapons, Kido exhaled deeply and straightened his back.

'Traveling with humans is really tiring.'

Though it was a brief standoff, it felt as if they had fought an entire war.
