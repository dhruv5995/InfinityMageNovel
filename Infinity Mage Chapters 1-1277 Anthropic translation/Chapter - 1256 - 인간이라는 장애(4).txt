The Obstacle Called Human (4)

"Eat."

Siina held out the fruit again.

"I protected..."

"I said eat! You have to eat if you're going to protect me!"

Why was she getting angry?

She threw the fruit and buried herself in Kuan's chest.

'Why does this person have to suffer?'

Movement that destroys human common sense is proof that one has given up being human.

"Just because of me!"

What is love supposed to mean anyway?

If she had known Kuan's fate, she would never have started this from the beginning.

'Before losing his hearing.'

Before losing his sight, before cutting off one arm...

'It's because of me.'

If she hadn't been there, Kuan wouldn't have ruined his life like this at least.

"Siina."

Kuan spoke with a foolish smile.

"Don't... cry..."

He seemed to be saying it was nothing.

A clown.

Just a clown who deliberately limps, falls, and pretends he can't see to make people laugh.

"I'm sorry."

Siina steeled her heart.

"Don't worry about anything. I don't care what kind of person you are. I'll be by your side."

Only then did Kuan pick up a handful of fruit.

Though her heart ached again seeing him eat hastily as if he'd forgotten all dignity, Siina forced herself to smile.

"That's right."

Once she had gotten Kuan to eat something, Siina turned her attention to the sounds outside the cave.

"Stay here for a moment."

Though they had already moved far from the battlefield, the feeling was ominous enough that it couldn't be ignored.

She flew up into the sky and surveyed the city.

"Good heavens..."

Torches flickered throughout every street, and countless crowds of people were surging in beyond the horizon.

'What is happening?'

It seemed as if all humanity was converging on one place.

'This is strange.'

The fact that could only be seen from high in the sky, and from dozens of kilometers away, was:

'This isn't human movement.'

Even ants, who are at the pinnacle of social evolution, couldn't form processions like that.

Their voices amplified as one.

Praise God.

With goosebumps rising, only one word came to Siina's mind.

'The end.'

Demons bursting into reality, humans turned into objects, and what would come next...

Kuuuuuuu!

A burning meteor was falling across the night sky.

"Giant."

After Maya's performance ended as a bloody festival, the leaders of each nation entered emergency meetings.

King Fermi of Keshia also sat in his office with a cold expression.

'There's nowhere to run anyway.'

The processions of humans gathered from everywhere were closing in while blocking Zayb's borders.

'The disappearance of emotional illness means the underworld's system has been reset. But...'

The boundary between hell and reality had also disappeared.

'It's also the situation Satan wants most. That can't be helped. The problem is Cell Buster.'

Fermi couldn't restore the destroyed data from the future information Marsha had extracted.

'Other than the shadow and light worlds giving a few days' reprieve, there's no future I can know.'

Then, a knock came at the door.

"Your Majesty."

An aide still under the effects of Angel entered with hazy eyes.

Fermi let out a small sigh.

'Emotional illness has disappeared, but breaking free is up to the individual.'

"Um... about what you mentioned before. You know, uh... what was the name again..."

Though irritation surged in his sensitive mental state, Fermi tried to pull himself together.

"Who are you talking about?"

There weren't just one or two tasks he'd assigned to staff, and he hadn't even received reports on most of them.

"Ah, Lanstin. We've found his current location."

Fermi shot to his feet.

"What did you say?"

"Uh, well, Robe Lanstin..."

Before he could finish speaking, Fermi embraced his aide.

"Ugh! Y-Your Majesty?"

"Well done. Really well done."

Guitarman, the only countermeasure to Cell Buster - but whether they could make it in time was still unknown.

'I can see hope.'

Fermi recalled Yorga's words.

Always remember, you still have choices.

Anger changes nothing, and only the composed achieve results.

If Fermi had been irritated with his incompetent staff, today's result wouldn't have been possible.

'And even now...'

Because he could still choose, he calmed his mind.

"I believed in you, that you could do it. What you've done just now is equivalent to saving humanity."

A lie, of course.

"Haha! I'm nothing special... I'll work even harder from now on! Please trust me with more tasks!"

Though the Angel's effects were still circulating, the aide's eyes were clearer than before.

"Yes. Now go to the Corona Sector and find someone called Gun. He's a star of the Ivory Tower."

The world's second-best in communication abilities.

No, since Fermi had already purchased Rampa's magic, he was now number one.

'If Gun finds Lanstin, Seongeum will bring him.'

If communication and transport specialists cooperated, they should be able to make it in time.

"This is an urgent matter."

Now brimming with enthusiasm, the aide immediately nodded and left the office.

"Phew."

Fermi took out a cigarette and fidgeted with it as he headed to the window.

'Now it's the wave of humans.'

There was an endless pile of tasks to handle.

'World leaders are gathered in the cathedral. If this place is overrun, humanity will lose the will to fight.'

Humanity.

'That's that guy's specialty anyway.'

Having passed the burden to Shirone, Fermi lit his cigarette and exhaled a long stream of smoke.

"Phew."

He saw a meteor cutting across the night sky.

"...How annoying."

That the future fit together too perfectly.

"Kukukuku!"

Because he was so massive, Ymir had no trouble crossing space.

It was a matter of scale, not speed, and when he returned to solid form, the human planet was right before his eyes.

'How shall I handle this?'

Even without his contract with Luber, he had no intention of forgiving the humans who had humiliated him.

'But catching them one by one to crush them would be beneath me. And bothersome too.'

Ymir wanted only battle.

'Ah, that's right.'

Power gathered in his fist.

'Let's start with one good hit.'

The target the Giant King aimed for transcended individuals and humanity itself - the planet itself.

***

In front of Delta Headquarters' main gate.

Follow God's will.

The southern warriors and the human procession continued their struggle.

"Guard your hearts!"

The southern warriors with their beast-like nature fiercely swung their swords, cutting down humans, but...

'There's no end.'

The number of people in the endless procession had now exceeded millions.

"Kugh!"

When humans grabbed a warrior and brought him down, countless kicks rained down on them.

"Aaaaah! Aaah..."

The sturdy body was crushed like pulp.

"We've reached our limit."

Untara said.

"Even with Elikia's power, we can't blow them all away. It's a miracle we've held the main gate this long."

Seriousness showed in Shirone's eyes too.

"I wonder if there's any meaning to this. War is fought to win. If we have to kill all of humanity, can we even call this war?"

Humanity worldwide was losing their hearts.

Follow God's will.

Shirone thought of the final method.

"I'll reverse it."

"You will?"

Tachyon is a faster-than-light signal.

Just as God manipulated human causality, Shirone could also change their past.

"Multiple universes."

Shirone said.

"The reason they lost their hearts is because they endlessly regretted within bubble-like events. Conversely, if I change their past to create a satisfying future, maybe they could regain their hearts?"

Untara frowned.

"Unless you've gone mad, you'll explain how that's possible. Change the past? Even if such magic exists, it's the past of all humanity. Even if it's possible, could you handle their desires?"

This was why Shirone wasn't certain.

'If it were God, it wouldn't matter...'

Having no heart, God could simply grant whatever life humans wanted.

'But me?'

Could he do it?

Could he grant a request to make someone else fail so he could pass a test?

'I just need to find a future where everyone is satisfied.'

Could he grant a request to ruin someone's life because they disliked seeing that person smile brightly?

'No one is evil from the start. I just need to give them a life where such thoughts don't occur.'

Could he really... do it?

"Huuu."

Shirone, who was already on the verge of tears, steeled himself and walked toward the human procession.

"I should be able to do it."

Love.

'What Yorahan showed me... high-intensity self-sacrifice and transcendent madness that embraces and bears everything.'

"Huuuuu!"

The southern warriors retreated, and the human procession began converging on Shirone.

Follow God's will.

Cold God.

"Tachyon."

From the body of the God with a heart, an aura of mixed light and darkness flickered.

"Th-that is...?"

As Untara's eyes widened, that aura spread magnificently enough for everyone in the cathedral to see.

Causality Manipulation.

Ouroboros.

In the paradoxical state where time's flow and stillness were mixed, the world turned gray.

God's will... will... Keeeeee! Keeeeeeeee!

All the humans in the world made bizarre mechanical sounds as golden light exploded from their eyes.

'Now it begins.'

Shirone, who had entered the Ouroboros state, was seeing a completely different landscape.

The background was fragmented like a mosaic, and human bodies were also unraveled like spaghetti noodles.

Since he was racing through imaginary time, it didn't matter how long it took.

In that 0 seconds of time - that instant - Shirone understood all the past that humans possessed.

'No wonder they lost their hearts.'

Each person's desires continuously collided, causing even the will to live to disappear.

'How indifferent.'

God had no intention of even trying to understand humans.

'First, let's avoid the collisions.'

Once he became a god, creating results that satisfied everyone wasn't difficult.

'We truly are infinite beings.'

What was truly terrible was...

I just need to be happy. I just need to be superior. I'm right. You're all wrong!

Me! Me! Me!

Humans were just as indifferent to others as God was.

'Why can you only think that way?'

Isn't the concept of "I" perhaps the most disgusting word in this universe?

'Let's stop. This is foolish.'

Accepting their desires - only a machine could do such a thing.

Shirone collapsed to his knees.

'Right! Forget it all! Why should I do this for you people...!'

At that moment.

"Ah."

A sudden surge of self-loathing.

'Am I any different?'

He himself, judging others, was just another human no different from them.

'No matter how disgusting the existence called "I" is.'

We have no choice but to smile pitifully at each other and extend our hands.

'Let's live together.'

The only way to overcome the obstacle called human and reach infinity is therefore...

'Love.'

Hot tears flowed.

'You want to be happy. Of course you want to be superior.'

Because everyone is "I."

Gradually his chin lifted.

The next moment, humanity's desires that had built up enough to destroy hearts surged back up from his stomach.

"Uweeeeeeek!"

As the vomit of the underworld poured out, the human procession stopped.

Keeee! Live... Keeee!

"Uweeek! Uweeek!"

Emotional vomiting.

As Shirone endlessly spewed the dregs of evil, he heard the voices of humans in his ears.

Live...

I want to live.
