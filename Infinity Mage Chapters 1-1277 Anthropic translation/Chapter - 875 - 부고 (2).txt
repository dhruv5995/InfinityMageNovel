Obituary (2)

Bashka, the capital of Tormia.

In the administrative district of Alog Street stood a luxury hotel where high-ranking government officials stayed.

Hotel Desika, Room 1403.

Dante sat at a table by the window, looking down at the street scenery bathed in the warm morning sunlight.

Completely naked without even underwear, his arms crossed over his knees, an iced coffee in his hand.

"Fisho..."

What had woken him from sleep was a single obituary delivered through the Magic Association.

The sound of water from the bathroom stopped, and a woman emerged, drying her hair.

"What's this? Setting such a mood first thing in the morning."

Having spent a passionate night together, she too made no effort to dress and sat at the vanity.

The woman brushing her hair looked at Dante's reflection in the mirror and asked.

"Did you have a nightmare or something?"

Dante chuckled softly.

"Well. Could there be a nightmare more terrifying than this reality?"

The woman disliked philosophy.

"You're really strange today. Aren't you going to wash up? You need to go to work."

The woman knew Dante as an employee working in the Royal Archives Management Department.

But in reality, he was the Deputy Director of the National Intelligence Service, a Code Black level figure.

The fact that he had access to the top-secret encryption system, known as 'Rope', meant that all of the nation's information was stored through his mind.

The woman said while applying makeup.

"I'll be late today. I'm meeting a friend. Don't wait up for me, just go to sleep first."

"That won't be necessary."

Dante said, looking at the woman's back.

"Let's stop seeing each other."

The woman applying lipstick's hand froze, and she turned around with a furrowed brow.

"Are you... talking to me right now?"

"Both of you."

Another woman kicked off the covers and bolted upright from the bed.

"What! Me too?"

She approached Dante in protest.

"How can you do this? I haven't been around that long. You should at least see me for a month!"

The woman sitting at the vanity sighed.

"Are you already tired of us?"

She had known from the beginning that he wasn't a man she could have forever.

"Getting tired is nothing new. Life itself is boring."

"Then what's the reason?"

Dante smiled, bathed in the halo of sunlight.

"Because the real one is coming."

It was Tormia's turn.

Sadness filled Shirone's eyes.

"Fisho is dead..."

It had been predetermined from the moment he became a host to the alien organism Argones.

But questions still remained.

"What does it mean that he's dead?"

Amy spoke up.

"From what I heard from Fisho, people who become hosts to Argones have no lifespan limit. Of course, they'd be buried under infinite cancer cell proliferation, but a death judgment shouldn't be possible."

"After the graduation exam ended, Fisho left. He would have been confined in an isolation facility. They would have conducted many experiments there, and what happened after that, even in the kingdom, only a few knew."

Maya asked.

"Is that all that was written in Iruki's letter?"

Amy checked again.

"Yeah. Seeing that he used the words 'immediately now', it seems quite forceful. There's no other content besides the obituary."

"Iruki wouldn't miss that. Maybe it's classified. We'll find out when we go."

Shirone looked at Maya.

"Your schedule must be busy, can you go? To Fisho's funeral."

"Of course I have to go. He was one of the people who stayed longest in the graduating class with me."

He was a quiet older brother figure who always treated Maya with equal respect, even when Maya was the problem child of the graduating class.

"Good. Then let's leave right away."

Though permission from the Holy See had been granted, Amy was troubled about leaving her troops behind.

"Will it be okay? Without a commander..."

Tess thumped her chest.

"What are you worried about? I'm here. I'll take good care of them and have them join the main force, so go without worry."

Lian spoke up.

"I'll stay here too. Would that be alright?"

Since Tess had assumed Lian would naturally follow Shirone, she asked with a surprised expression.

"What? You're staying here?"

"From now on, it's inside the Holy See's defensive walls, so there's no danger for Shirone. On the contrary, Hell's army continues to move south. At this rate, Tormia will be within striking distance too."

Lian intended to be a shield.

"Yeah. Thanks, Lian."

Amy said.

"If it's three of us, let's take Caidra. We'll arrive at Kazra, jump to Tormia, then to Creas."

"And then?"

Iruki hadn't told them the exact destination.

"Well, there might be some arrangement, right? If not, let's go to school. The teachers will attend the funeral too."

Maya nodded.

"Ah, that's right. Everyone will gather."

It seemed like it would be a reunion with a heavy atmosphere.

Shirone's group arrived in Creas city the next morning at dawn.

For Shirone, who had wandered battlefields, the scene of people calmly preparing for morning was unfamiliar.

'This is how it used to be.'

They finished a simple meal at a dawn restaurant next to the Tormia branch of the Magic Association.

"No one's coming out."

There was no particular word from the association either.

"It might actually be thorough. People related to Fisho should know, but it feels like it's better for others not to know."

Leaving the restaurant, Shirone's group headed to Alpheas Magic School as originally planned.

Unlike thinking they were simply visiting their alma mater, seeing the main gate made Shirone's heart swell.

'Everything started here.'

Climbing over the wall of Alpheas Magic School at age twelve seemed like ancient history.

Amy and Maya also stood beside Shirone, looking up at the arch with wistful expressions.

"Let's go in."

After checking Amy's identification, the guard opened the way.

"What, what's this?"

It was a nostalgic scene, but only the landscape was the same - the atmosphere had changed greatly.

Everyone was walking in formation, and even young students had eyes full of fighting spirit.

"Militarization of the school. It can't be helped during wartime."

With bitter hearts, they visited the principal's office where Alpheas and Olivia jumped up.

"You all..."

The surprise was brief, and when they thought of Fisho's death, their expressions soon relaxed.

"You came. Welcome."

The three people bowed their heads.

"Hello, Principal, Vice Principal."

Looking at the three protagonists of the golden generation graduating class, Alpheas smiled warmly.

"Yes. Sit over here."

While drinking tea that Olivia served, Shirone's group heard about the school's situation.

"Graduation exams have been abolished starting this year. Students finish regular classes and are immediately drafted into the military."

"That's unfortunate."

"Indeed. The advantages of competition have disappeared, but more than anything, the educational content itself has become quite brutal."

Since they're sent to battlefields without taking exams, students had to receive intensive combat training.

"You must have heard about Fisho?"

Shirone nodded.

"Yes. What happened?"

"I don't know either. The Holy See is controlling information. The funeral is scheduled for three days from now."

"Why three days later?"

"It's probably a political issue. But the biggest reason is likely... because of you, Shirone."

"Me?"

Olivia said.

"It's not confirmed information, but there's a rumor that Fisho left a will for you. With the condition that it absolutely cannot be revealed until you arrive."

Shirone blinked.

'Fisho, for me?'

If they didn't have deep friendship during school days, there was one thing he could think of.

'The Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower. Or Yahweh.'

It was an issue that could be handled at that level.

"Since you're here, how about looking around the graduating class? Well, that term is just a memory now."

Trainees would be a more appropriate expression.

Following Alpheas through the steel door, they saw 30 students receiving instruction from Shiina and Sad.

"More, concentrate more!"

Students with pale faces were casting their specialized magic toward the front.

"This is the morning class. The key is to continuously cast magic without rest."

Shiina shouted.

"Karna! What are you doing! Get your head together!"

When she pointed out a female student whose power had weakened, the girl bit her lips and defiantly sat down.

"Karna! You...!"

"This kind of thing is unreasonable!"

Silence fell at Karna's outcry.

"What is this, every day! The same training, with impossible intensity! We can't even recover!"

"Stand up. This is your last chance."

When Shiina's eyes looked ominous, Mark beside her helped Karna up.

"Karna, let's try again."

"Let go! I have to speak up! This isn't magic. It's just overworking us! We came here to become strong!"

Shiina pulled out documents.

"Mino Karna. As of today, from Alpheas Magic School..."

Shirone approached.

"Stand up."

Shiina hurriedly turned her head, and the graduating class students' eyes filled with shock.

"Sh, Shirone senior..."

These were students who had heard Shirone's moving graduation speech and harbored grand dreams.

And now he had truly become the world's greatest magician, standing before his juniors.

"Stand up again and start training. This isn't magic? No, this is magic."

Karna said with a tearful expression.

"No. This kind of thing isn't magic. There's no change, no creation. Did you do this too, senior?"

"Of course it was different from your time. But the essence is the same. Instead of complaining, cast magic one more time."

If Karna were asked to name the person she most respected, she would think of Shirone without hesitation.

That's why it was even more heartbreaking.

"Why? What changes by doing that? What's left by doing it one more time right now?"

"The memory that you did it one more time remains."

Karna's lips pressed tightly shut.

"Keep accumulating those memories endlessly. In the very end, only that will protect you. That's everything."

"That's everything..."

"Yeah. Don't give yourself room to leave such a desperate event in your head - that you gave up because it was hard. Someday it'll drag you down. But if you get up now, there are no limits."

Karna's eyes regained their sharp light.

"Of course there are times when you should rest. I did too. But looking back, I realized something."

Shirone grinned.

"It was all useless."

"...Haha."

"A magician should rest not when tired or struggling. When one rest can increase the possibility of victory, a magician seeks rest."

Shirone extended his hand.

"You can control it, right? Because you're a magician too."

"Yes! Senior!"

When Karna smiled and jumped up, the students' will blazed like fire.

"Alright! Let's do it! I'll never give up!"

Shirone, who had been watching warmly, returned to his place and bowed his head to Shiina.

'Shirone...'

Since he was no longer a student, Shiina also bowed her head in return, expressing gratitude.

'Thank you.'

Mark's magic exploded with stronger power than usual.

'Shirone senior is watching!'

Maria followed suit, and other students forgot their fatigue and poured out all their mental strength.

'Please give me advice too.'

The world's strongest magician was watching.

That fact alone had the students achieving their highest concentration levels ever.
