[673] Ladum's Secret (1)

As the Brain in the Jar was deactivated, the members began regaining consciousness one by one.

No one had lost their life, but the feeling after coming to their senses was devastating.

It was the powerful force possessed by the Lord of Terror, and Shirone was equally disturbed.

'What was that? That memory...'

Though he thought it wasn't his own, when he saw Ikael's face, he felt like his heart would burst.

'La Enemy.'

He had gained another reason to meet him, setting aside the Ivory Tower test.

While the 17 members who had finished preparations for departure were moving in formation, Kargin approached Joshua.

"Are you alright?"

Joshua had become less talkative after seeing the vision of his son.

"Don't worry. I'll keep watch properly."

"That's not what I meant..."

"I didn't love him."

Joshua spat out the words.

"He's a child who doesn't even know who his father is. I always resented that. I just felt guilty. That's all."

At words that seemed to brainwash himself into believing that, Kargin asked no more.

On the path to Ladum's interior, no residents were visible.

Perhaps they were still trapped in the other world, wandering somewhere avoiding Galoper's blade.

"We've arrived."

Quan spoke as they reached the boundary line distinguishing Ladum's exterior from interior, commonly called the Siren.

"From here on, it's a different dimension. You'd better prepare yourselves."

Though there were no notable features, the feeling transmitted through the Ultima System was clearly a different world from before.

'Incredible.'

Inside the information barrier surrounding the entire radius, countless circuits were securing their respective domains.

From Baekji's sensory perspective, it was a space burning with light.

"I've heard the rumors. A high-difficulty concealment facility. They say even the best information mages can't disable all the encryption devices inside Ladum."

Even if Shirone could identify the substance of the signals, breaking through them was a separate matter.

"How do you plan to break through?"

At Arkman's question, Jane spoke.

"There are two ways to reach Ladum's center. One is to solve the codes one by one. The other is to cut the power."

"Cut the power?"

Eavian spoke as if something had occurred to her.

"Come to think of it, that's strange. Ladum is an isolated region, so where does it draw the power to operate the concealment devices?"

"The sun."

Lufist said.

"What I'm about to tell you is classified as a Grade 1 state secret."

The members gulped.

"Right now we can see the sky. That's because something at Ladum's center allows light to pass through."

"What the hell are you talking about?"

"Initially, it's in the form of a small sphere."

Above Lufist's palm, an iron ball the size of a human face was synthesized.

"It's a kind of seed. You plant this in the ground."

The sphere hit the ground with a thud.

"It's made of a substance called Photominerals that can transmit, absorb, or reflect light. It doesn't exist on this planet, and naturally I can't synthesize it either. But for the sake of explanation..."

The iron ball trembled, then vines twisted into strands and sprouted from its surface.

"It absorbs sunlight and grows on its own. Like a living thing. It's presumed that there's a special design like a genetic map inside the mineral."

Buds formed on the vines, then opened like flower petals.

"It collects photons and releases energy. Think of it as similar to photosynthesis and it'll be easier to understand."

"No, I don't understand at all. So what is this thing?"

Jane said.

"The Kingdom of Tormia has been isolating Ladum from the capital since long ago. What do you think the reason was?"

"Well, because terrorist groups and sub-races cause trouble. It's like the capital's garbage dump."

Shirone had initially understood it that way too.

"That's not wrong. But it doesn't explain the original cause of Ladum's existence. Now I'll show you Ladum's secret."

Jane took out Nemesis from her Cubic.

"Let's begin."

Following Jane's lead, Shirone equipped Nemesis and activated the Ultima System, making the feeling of Ladum's internal boundary network, the 'Siren,' manifest into reality.

Jane implemented electrical circuits with simple information magic, and Aria approached those circuits.

"I will cut the power to 'Saenghwa' by inputting the Grade 1 security code."

Aria's role was Ladum explorer and code carrier.

Since Yongroe had directly imprinted it into her unconscious, even she couldn't know the code.

Nevertheless, because she was a Grade 1 classified information holder, Lufist had attached the finest security in Quan.

Jane knocked on Aria's mind.

Whether to accept or not was Aria's decision, but the moment she refused, she would die for security purposes.

'Access granted.'

The moment she thought it, Aria's eyes flashed open and the keyword hidden in her unconscious activated.

The Siren's boundary network became blurred, and the scenery inside Ladum began revealing its true form.

Whiiiiiing!

An alarm that seemed to burst their eardrums rang out, and a skyscraper district mixed with the characteristics of various races unfolded before their eyes.

"Wh-what is that?"

Wooden structures, stone structures, mechanical ones, and even buildings that seemed too complex for human understanding.

But what shocked the members was the massive tower hundreds of meters tall standing in Ladum's deepest part, the center.

Looking up at the bud attached to the tower's peak, Lufist said.

"It's grown quite a lot."

The sub-race alliance's hideout, which had only been rumored about, was truly a flower.

"The reason the kingdom left Ladum alone. Certainly it was to isolate the trash, but in the end, they too were merely fertilizer. Ladum is a flowerpot. A flowerpot for growing an ancient weapon."

"An ancient weapon?"

Yordic turned to look at Lufist with a pale face.

"Super-massive interceptor Saenghwa. A strategic defensive weapon that collects solar energy and releases it as high-energy beams. Its power is strong enough to supply power to all of Ladum's concealment facilities through its roots."

Lufist finally gave the members their real mission.

"From now on, we will infiltrate Saenghwa, take control, and steal the seed."

'Damn, so that's what it was!'

When Saenghwa was first reported to the Kingdom of Tormia, the reason they isolated the Ladum region was that once the seed takes root, it becomes impossible to move.

They would grow Saenghwa to obtain new seeds.

Having made that decision, the kingdom closed off Ladum, and sub-races began hiding there one by one, leading to the current situation.

Kuguugugugugung!

At the vibration that shook the earth, the members looked up at Saenghwa.

"It's... it's opening."

As the flower bud unfurled, it cast a shadow over Ladum's radius.

Each petal alone covered 200 square meters, and the sight of dozens of such petals unfolding was truly spectacular.

When the flower bloomed fully, a massive flower shadow fell over the opposite side of Ladum.

That place would probably be dark as night.

"Uuuugh!"

The ground swayed up and down as if floating on the sea, then suddenly all the photons within a radius of several kilometers were sucked into the petals.

As the surroundings suddenly darkened, the members looked around frantically and Lufist shouted.

"It's an intercept! Get inside!"

"Damn it!"

A single beam shot from Saenghwa struck the western region diagonally.

In that state, it scraped the beam along the boundary line separating exterior and interior, causing a tremendous explosion to surge toward them.

"They already noticed."

The fact that they counterattacked immediately upon disabling the Siren's boundary network was proof.

Meirei covered one ear and shouted.

"I can hear La Enemy's voice! He gave the order!"

Kon shouted.

"Damn it! Do something about this! We're all going to die at this rate!"

The radius that the energy beam was destroying was so wide that they couldn't escape in time.

"Jane!"

At Lufist's voice, Jane immediately responded.

'Cosmic Rail!'

As she cast mental-type magic, Jane's voice was heard in everyone's heads.

*Tickets are not required for allies.*

"What is this supposed to mean...!"

Baikon's body, who had been grumbling, floated up against his will and settled into what looked like a wheeled carriage passenger compartment.

"What?"

All 17 members were gathered there, and in front of the phantom passenger compartment, rails one meter long were being laid at tremendous speed through the clearly visible landscape.

Public transportation magic Cosmic Rail.

Movement speed increases in proportion to the speed of laying rails, providing passengers with the same environmental conditions as real-world inertia.

This was designed to enhance convenience so passengers could focus on combat, which would be impossible without simultaneous environmental control, mental control, and physical control.

'As expected of the Magic Association's Executive Secretary.'

The algorithm moving along the rails, the Air-type physical force transporting all 17 people, plus mental control to guarantee passenger autonomy - it was the ultimate customer satisfaction service.

"Too slow! Faster!"

Even though it was achieving higher efficiency than teleportation while carrying multiple people, Lufist acted like a difficult customer.

'16 people is a bit tough.'

When Jane blew off the ceiling with a bang, the speed of rail laying increased dramatically.

Even during this, the energy beam shooting from Saenghwa was approaching in an umbrella formation, scraping the ground.

Rails were being laid at maximum speed, and the rushing wind made it difficult to even breathe.

Building tops higher than the direct trajectory were blown up by the beam, causing chunks of rock to pour down.

As Jane deployed the rails in a curving pattern, the passenger compartment's route sharply changed direction.

"Waaaaah!"

"Hold on tight!"

As the roller coaster algorithm activated and the rails rose nearly vertical, the members grabbed onto the walls.

The energy beam narrowly passed by them.

"Huff! Huff!"

Baikon, who had collapsed from exhaustion, leaned against the wall and said.

"What a damn deadly transportation magic."

"We'll continue approaching Saenghwa like this."

"What are you talking about? We'll arrive soon at this rate."

Just as Yordic, master of war chariots, was getting up while bracing against the wall, goblins jumped off building rooftops on hang gliders.

"Winner takes all!"

The goblins, belonging to Ladum's middle class, were a race that was short in stature, enjoyed human flesh, and possessed unique agility combined with cruelty.

Jane sent a warning.

"It's going to be dizzying. Be careful."

Lufist looked around at the members and said.

"Hey, mercenaries. Time to earn your pay."

Joshua aimed his bow with his Eye technique flashing, and Wig also drew his twin swords, ready to face them.

"Here we go!"

As Cosmic Rail's trajectory curved like rapids, arrows rained from the goblin squad.

"Pathetic creatures!"

The mages who teleported out of the passenger compartment responded with their respective specialties.

Just as the goblins were falling one by one, Jane's eyes widened.

"Danger!"

An electrical net was spread above the skyscrapers, blocking their path.

"Saenghwa's power has been restored. Should we descend to ground level?"

"No. Get as close as you can."

As the perilous air defense facilities regained their functions one by one, Cosmic Rail continued its precarious advance.

'Just a little more! Just a little more!'

At the point where they had traversed more than half of the concealment facility zone, photons began gathering again on Saenghwa's petals.

As it instantly became night, Jane shouted.

"Let's land! We won't dodge it this time!"

"Keep going!"

They needed to get closer even by 3 seconds, no, even 1 second to recapture Saenghwa in time.

The moment a massive sphere of light exploded from the battery embedded in the stem, Lufist shouted.

"Jump off!"

"These crazy..."

As the members fell, abandoning themselves to gravity, a massive flash of light passed overhead with a roar.
