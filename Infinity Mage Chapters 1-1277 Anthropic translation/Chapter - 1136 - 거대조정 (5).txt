Giant Adjustment (5)

When Shirone asked, that dry, emotionless voice began to echo like an auditory hallucination again.

Vorbor called me that. But my real name isn't Mika.

'Then?'

I am Vorbor.

Shirone's brow furrowed.

Of course, the body that died just now is also Vorbor. I am her analytical thinking.

'You're saying she created you herself?'

Yes. I was separated due to the extreme stress applied to her brainwaves.

Twelve-year-old Vorbor, watching the people on the streets, had also come to realize:

'They're not looking at me. They're looking at themselves looking at me.'

The boundary between self and others crumbled, and from that point on, Vorbor stopped observing people.

Her gaze turned inward.

That day's realization helped Vorbor's life. By looking within herself, she became able to understand all human nature.

'Knowing myself is knowing humanity. Something that requires long contemplation and deep insight.'

But life wasn't happy. She was still weak and had to watch the moods of her work-exhausted mother and her stepfather who resorted to violence at every turn.

"Liquor! Hey! Bring me liquor!"

Vorbor could only get a little money when her mother was in a decent mood.

Having eyes that could see through others' emotions, it wasn't particularly difficult, but...

"You worthless thing!"

With daily verbal and physical abuse, Vorbor's heart gradually grew sick.

'Misanthropy.'

Since even her stepfather's tendencies existed within her, hatred for humanity became hatred for herself.

"These damn family members!"

Her bleeding mother collapsed, broken liquor bottles scattered. Vorbor was mercilessly beaten that day.

"Die! Die!"

Just as her consciousness began to fade, her stepfather's face suddenly turned pale.

"You... who are you?"

Feeling as if the person lying on the floor was himself, he was gripped by an inexplicable terror.

"I wonder. Who am I?"

"Th-this crazy brat..."

Vorbor grabbed the stepfather trying to escape with both arms and whispered in his ear.

The feeling of having one's innermost thoughts—too shameful to speak aloud—conveyed through another's mouth.

"Huk! Heuuk!"

And when morning came, he had hanged himself with a rope from the ceiling.

Her mother regained consciousness and silently drank, while Vorbor crouched in a corner and thought.

'I killed someone. No, am I the one who died?'

With the boundary between self and others collapsed, her mind was rapidly dying.

And then.

Hello? Nice to meet you?

Sparks fired in her brain and she began to see bluish electricity before her eyes.

Vorbor asked.

"Who are you?"

Her mother turned her head but briefly frowned before losing interest.

I wonder? What could I be? Hello?

Vorbor smiled brightly.

"Mika."

Shirone nodded.

'So you're saying just before the boundary between self and others completely collapsed, she created you and escaped.'

Yes. Actually, I'm a very weak electrical signal. Born from Vorbor's brain.

'But why are you telling me all this?'

Mika got to the point.

Vorbor respected you for sacrificing yourself for humanity. She always wanted to help.

'Is that so?'

Shirone felt melancholy.

The main body has died, but I remain. I think I'll be able to help you.

'Huh?'

I don't know how this electrical signal is defined in reality, but it must be a very unique phenomenon. Now I'll seep back into the world and return to my original state, but I know I can come back.

'Hmm.'

An electricity that sees into everything in the world—

If it exists as substance beyond phenomenon—Don't worry. I won't dwell in anyone other than Vorbor. Existence doesn't mean much to me. I just want to help you.

'What do you have in mind?'

There will come a moment when you need me. Vorbor said so, so it must be right. Of course, it would have been better if she could do it directly, but that's impossible now.

It might have been an illusion, but Mika seemed sad.

If you need my help, please call me Mika. I will respond to your voice.

'But... you are Vorbor.'

Perhaps through Mika, he could feel Vorbor's life.

I like the name Mika.

From her brief answer, Shirone read a long resonance and decided to follow her words.

'Alright. I understand.'

As the current at his fingertips disappeared, Shirone stood up and looked around.

No stars were visible, and cold wind blew through the hole created by the Three Thousand Worlds.

"Mika."

Suddenly, a weak current flowed through his body.

Yes. You called?

Shirone blinked and cleared his throat.

'No, I was just muttering. Sorry. We just parted ways, this is really awkward.'

It's okay. Vorbor was human, but having already synchronized with the world, I have no concept of time. To tell you a few things—Baal has currently climbed to the 76th floor. The positions of the other Ivory Tower stars are...

Mika transmitted core information about what was currently happening within the Ivory Tower through brainwaves.

'This is... really amazing.'

Vorbor's legacy, Mika, could process all information in the world simultaneously.

Call me again if you need me.

He could tell Mika had left again as the current flowing through his body disappeared.

Savoring that feeling for a moment, Shirone looked up at the ceiling and muttered.

"Supernatural phenomenon."

He remembered conversations with friends in the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Club during magic school.

'Only at the end of the world...'

A bitter smile formed on Shirone's lips.

"But I found it, Ned."

The forest outside the Papal Territory.

Shirone's group and Eden watched the horrific ritual taking place in the village hall.

Sein felt anger knowing that one of the participants was Maximus, whom she had respected.

'To sell one's soul to Satan!'

But Sacred Eye didn't activate, and the holy sword Astasia wasn't glowing now either.

'Is that so?'

Sein became dejected.

'I'm not qualified to punish evil. From the beginning, the faith I had was fake.'

Eden, observing her, spoke.

"Let's move locations first. It's unsettling to talk in the middle of enemy territory."

Hiding on the village outskirts, Shirone's group sat in a circle in the shade.

"Eden, how did you get here?"

"The assassination of Habitz failed, and I lost my way. So I went to find my master."

A blue light swirled in her eyes.

"Sacred Eye. I followed the aura of evil with these eyes. There's tremendous evil here."

Sein was shocked.

"How?"

Was she saying that a Yorr could possess Sacred Eye, which only Lamie paladins could open?

"This is impossible! It's the Lamie Church that believes in Kria! The Yorr Church doesn't even have a god to believe in."

Eden said.

"Fighting against evil is the same. But the method is wrong. The Lamie Church says that God's messengers need three things: holy weapons, divine power, and trained organization."

"But you must have seen it too, coming here. They become twisted because they obsess only over what's visible. Paladins are brainwashed, and inquisitors torture themselves before torturing others."

"Don't judge based on partial information. It's true they made mistakes, but it's a religious order that has defeated evil for ages."

"Then one day, Satanism infiltrated the Lamie Church."

Eden ignored her and continued.

"Of course, it's not incomprehensible. Even priests can't be free from emotional illness. No, it must have been harder because they had more to protect. The demons targeted those gaps in their hearts."

Sein bit her lip.

"It's not just here. Among the cardinals of each nation, many have fallen to Satanism. The Lamie Church is the world's largest religion, so how many Satan worshippers must be beneath it? Soon the entire world will..."

"Stop it!"

Sein shouted.

"Is being the world's largest religion wrong? Then what about the Yorr Church? Surely there are Yorrs who have fallen to Satanism too."

"No, there are no such Yorrs."

"Lies! Do you think I'd believe that?"

"Because from the moment they fall to Satanism, they're no longer Yorrs. Then tell me—are those priests over there still priests to you?"

Sein couldn't answer.

"Now do you understand? What's visible—positions, ranks, purity, divine power. Of course, noble conviction is needed to attain those things, but they themselves aren't measures of good. Rather, evil targets the gaps in such rigidity."

Eden had once been like that too.

"The voice of Satan's heart that I heard was terrible, but it wasn't rare or special at all. Rather... it was the most human-like, the deepest resonance."

"I know too."

Sein honestly admitted.

"I became a holy knight and defeated evil. But the more I did, the more incomprehensible it became. What exactly is good? I thought that harming evil, cutting down demons, was good, but..."

Her hands were stained with blood.

"The founder of the Yorr Church, the First Yorr, said this: The power of good isn't eliminating evil, but the ability to turn evil into good. Therefore, that power can never take the form of destroying something, and can only be achieved through self-sacrifice."

"Sacrifice?"

Eden made an awkward expression.

"Actually, I also heard this from my master. Of course, it's still hard to fully understand and difficult even to imitate, but it's the incantation that forms the foundation of my power. I can feel the power of good in you. You'll surely be able to regain your divine power."

Sein smiled.

Though she had been comforted by a Yorr from a different religious order, she now had a realization.

'What's visible isn't important.'

It's the heart.

"Oh, and."

Eden looked back at Shirone.

"I knew you'd be here. There's also a reason I was specially dispatched to the Papal Territory—I have something to convey. It's the result of deliberation among 300 Yorrs: the Yorr Order will fight against Satanism worldwide according to Yahweh's will."

"But I have no intention of creating a religion—"

"I know. But Yorrs don't distinguish between sects. That's why we can help. Only those who stand alone can love the entire world—this is the First Yorr's teaching."

Iruki said.

"There are similarities to Shirone."

Eden hesitated briefly before speaking.

"I've had the same thought since hearing the legend. There are many common points. Practicing love and universal love. A mindset that values what's invisible more highly."

Sein asked.

"Then did that person also reach Yahweh's realm?"

"No. According to legend, he didn't even have divine power. He had no special power to fight evil."

"But he must have defeated countless powerful evils to have legends passed down to this era, right?"

"It's not precisely recorded, but when I heard the legend, one thing immediately came to mind."

Eden looked at Shirone.

"The magic sword Armang."

"Huh?"

"The object you carried around. I think the first owner of that sword was the First Yorr."

"Armang is..."

When he had asked who she was, the face of a woman who had answered that she was sharpening her blade came to mind.
