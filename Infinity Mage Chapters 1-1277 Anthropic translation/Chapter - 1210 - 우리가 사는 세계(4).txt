The World We Live In (4)

Delta Headquarters.

Kit, from the Kingdom of Paras, gazed indifferently at the Exoverse that had transformed into a black sphere.

'A singularity with no volume and infinite density.'

If nothingness contained all possibilities within zero space, then existence itself was merely an illusion.

"Do you defy God's will?"

Though the seven archangels had reversed the laws, pyramids around the world still remained standing.

If 100 were the result, there were infinite ways to achieve that 100.

All the angels had done was remove seven-eighths of the causes.

"The result cannot be changed."

For God, probability was only 0 or 100 percent.

Until all eight source concepts gathered, it would still be God's overwhelming victory.

As blue light entered Kit's eyes, the pyramid's magnetic field began to expand.

Simultaneously, the same blue light lit up in the eyes of those affected by the magnetic field.

These were humans who had lost their minds within the bubble-like expanding quantum fluctuation events.

"Kill Maya."

In Omega year 999, someone's name became the most important law in the universe.

In the sun's core, the seven archangels felt the universe's laws changing.

Though the method was different, the result would be the same.

"How...?"

Ikael said.

"They bypassed what we enforced. They can change it by any means necessary."

Satiel said.

"But we protected their hearts. At least the regular angels won't lose their phase."

But would that really be the case?

While it was fortunate individually, nothing had changed for the universe as a whole.

It meant they ultimately couldn't defy God's will, and God intended to close this world.

'Nothingness. You cannot stop what doesn't exist.'

Thus, God's breath was seeping through the gaps between all matter and all laws.

If you compared the universe to a box, even with just one hole, air would fill it completely.

'The only way is to block it completely. Unless all existence denies God with one unified will...'

It was a game God was destined to win.

Amy, having absorbed Phoenix's essence, rode the solar wind to where Shirone was.

"Shirone."

The moment she eliminated the fire incarnation within Miracle Stream's barrier, Amy became naked.

"Oh!"

She hurriedly hid behind Shirone's back, covering her body with a reddened face.

"Don't turn around."

Shirone's lips curved up.

"I could make you some clothes."

That was a good option too, but seeing the workload of Shirone Sphere, she couldn't bring herself to ask.

"It's fine. They'll just burn up again anyway."

Amy was momentarily mesmerized by the spectacular display of matter pouring from Shirone's hands.

"It's incredible."

"Yeah. Mom reversed the laws, but the apocalyptic world hasn't changed. God's thoughts are transcending human categories. This is probably... the last method I have to oppose God."

Shirone didn't say "we."

'He must know.'

The fact that unifying humanity was far more difficult than the Shirone Sphere.

Amy embraced Shirone from behind.

"Stay strong."

His chest began to swell as if her soul was penetrating through his back.

Amy said,

"Let's not try to be happy alone."

When they were left alone after Fisho's funeral, she had said the same thing.

"Huh?"

And from Shirone's eyes, hot tears flowed just like back then.

"Don't worry. You're the only man I love. That will never change."

Shirone cried silently.

Feeling his sobs with her whole body, Amy recalled something from long ago.

"Do you remember? When I first met you?"

She had met a lost, naive boy in a back alley of Creas City.

"You got pretty roughed up that day. I was mean too. Telling you to take off your clothes—"

"..."

"Haha."

"But you know, that day I went home and told my dad. That I wanted to attend magic school."

It was the day Shirone first succeeded at magic.

"That's how we met again, and went through so much together. Sometimes I think about it. What would have happened if I hadn't met you that day? If I had been fickle and gone to an ice cream shop instead, or if I had been late to that alley by 10 minutes, or even 5 minutes. If I had said even slightly different words in that situation..."

The terrifying nature of human fate when you looked back.

"I wouldn't be here now. I wouldn't be embracing you from behind like this, saying these words."

Shirone kept his mouth shut.

"If I had lived a different life, I would have lived that way too. But Shirone, I—the me right now—think that moment was a miracle. A miracle that changed my life."

So...

"I'll never change it. Even if time were rewound, even if it were rewound thousands, tens of thousands of times, I wouldn't trade that moment for any future."

Shirone lowered his head.

'I must remember this moment.'

He still didn't know why.

But if this was a world where the beginning and end were already determined, then what humans could do was ultimately...

"Shirone, I won't forget you. Even if I have to break through every probability in the universe, I'll love you."

To throw their hearts with everything they had.

"...Hm."

Shirone turned around and caressed Amy's tear-stained cheeks.

"You must remember me. I'll come find you. Even if I have to search the entire universe, I'll come to you."

Shirone knew nothing about what would happen six hours from now.

Only that in Omega year 999, at the terminus of human history set by God, they were making promises for a much more distant future.

The two looked back at the sun.

"I'll be back."

He didn't know what had happened in the core, but Amy would be helpful.

"Be careful."

"Don't worry."

Amy cupped Shirone's face and gently kissed him before deploying her fire incarnation technique.

As she moved away from Miracle Stream's barrier, she smiled and said,

"No one can kill me."

Through spontaneous combustion magic, her body instantly transported to the sun.

"Right."

After briefly feeling Amy's warmth, Shirone focused his eyes again and spoke.

"Mica."

"Construction progress is 42.0148 percent."

'I have to make this succeed.'

Perhaps for the first time, he thought that unifying humanity might be impossible.

Delta Headquarters' spire.

Sitting at the highest point, Shirone looked down at the crowd gathered at the main gate with sad eyes.

'There's no end to it.'

After Gith's press conference ended, the citizens of Rhodenin split into two factions and began demonstrating.

'No, that's not it.'

Looking into places not visible to the eye, no one was willing to listen to others.

"We must punish Gith, who tarnished Jive's honor, under kingdom law! This is the citizens' right!"

In the democratic monarchy of Jive, the capital's citizens held considerable power.

"Who tarnished whose honor! Using unproven matters to divide public opinion like this will only disadvantage us in the holy war!"

"Don't think you can get away with that kind of threat! A king who has lost moral authority is unfit to represent the citizens!"

Everyone threw in their own words, their voices flowing all the way inside Delta Headquarters.

Standing by the window, Albino gazed at the hundreds of torches burning at the main gate.

Lufist said,

"Things went exactly as Gith wanted. Those flames seem to represent the citizens' anger."

"Anger isn't good. Emotions are visible. And anything visible can be controlled."

Albino continued,

"The content of the press conference wasn't important from the start. Once you send a signal, those who receive it react in one of two ways. They either agree or disagree."

"That's how you divide them."

"Binary thinking is like human destiny. If it's not right, it's wrong. But generation 1.5 humans are different. They have one more option."

Albino said,

"Right, wrong, or no correct answer."

"There are no correct answers in the world. It's all contradictions. People fear that. That's why they desperately insist they're right. On the other hand, generation 1.5 humans accept contradictions. Even when they can't understand or accept it, they just do it. They focus solely on solving problems."

"In a sense, it's an emotional deficit."

"Very cold. They've evolved enough to reach the pinnacle of civilizational ecosystem. By now, they've probably divided up the big fish—money and power—and thrown the leftovers to the citizens. Worthless scraps like the joy of victory or citizens' sense of achievement."

"Those are good values."

"Hehe, it's like putting a 'premium' label on something unknown and selling it. Honestly, I don't really understand how such things are supposed to make my life happy. But since there are buyers, they must have sellers."

Lost in thought, Lufist asked,

"What if the citizens had remained silent after the press conference?"

"Gith would probably have been sweating blood. Since he couldn't predict public reaction. But it's a difficult task. Integration at the a priori level—that's what Ultima is."

"I see."

"The next best option would be for the Anti-King to unite the citizens, but since the purge is already over, that's why he held the press conference." Announcements always come last.

The citizens continued their endless confrontation.

"Let's wait and see. Let's suspend judgment at least until the holy war ends."

Even within Gith's faction, moderates and radicals split apart.

"The princess has died. How must His Majesty feel? Let's exercise restraint for now."

The moderates again split into emotional and rational factions.

"That's not the issue. This is frustrating. I'm saying we should hold back considering the current situation."

The emotional faction divided into anger and sympathy groups.

"Is that something to say? Don't you have children? Are you perhaps a psychopath?"

"What's that supposed to mean? Are you done talking?"

Shirone could only watch with sad eyes as the citizens fractured.

'There are no correct answers.'

There were only those wandering in search of correct answers and those running straight ahead with wrong answers.

Under a system where whoever arrived first planted their flag and dominated everyone else.

'They are now...'

Raising toasts at the top of the world.

"Oh my, Your Majesty Gith. Congratulations."

In the bathhouse prepared by Arachne, leaders of Jive's allied nations had gathered.

As Gith entered the bath, he said,

"Haha! How could this be a big deal? It's like a painful tooth being pulled—I feel refreshed."

The leader of the Pleasure District, sitting bare-chested at the edge of the bath, lit her pipe.

"Raymond was surprisingly a romantic. They say he called his wife's name before dying."

The King of Iron burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! What? Afraid he'd go to hell? What kind of king would such a guy make... Ugh, this."

Gith's eyelids trembled.

"Oh yes, good. I'm relaxing, relaxing."

Civilizational predators whose emotions didn't interfere with obtaining what they wanted.

"Your Majesty, please accept my love too."

But where these supposedly generation 1.5 humans with their cold, calculating minds directed their attention was...

"Hehe, sure. Shall I taste it?"

Toward extremely animalistic and primitive sensations.

"Aah!"

That was... the world of Omega year 999 that Shirone was witnessing.
