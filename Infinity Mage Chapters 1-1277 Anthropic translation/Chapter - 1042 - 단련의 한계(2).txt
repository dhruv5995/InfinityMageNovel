**The Limits of Training (2)**

Only after purifying Mercedes into pure mana did Margrit open the warehouse door.

"Come out."

From within the unpurified body, Ryan emerged with one eye closed.

He didn't know what conversation they had shared.

But just from looking at the Grand Duke's eyes, he could instinctively tell that someone had died.

As Ryan emerged from the warehouse, Margrit busily moved around gathering experimental equipment.

Originally, this would have been Mercedes' job.

"There isn't much time. I had originally planned to research you more thoroughly, but I'll begin the modifications immediately."

Lete would return.

"Why are you going this far?"

"...What do you mean?"

"The succubus is dead, and Lete has left. She must have been precious to you too."

"That's exactly why I'm saying this. When the boss returns, things won't be the same as now. This is the final warning. The last consideration being shown to us."

"That's exactly what I want to talk about."

Ryan felt uneasy.

"If Lete were someone like Satan, she wouldn't leave over something like this. She's being sincere. You know this too, so why are you helping us?"

"Hmm."

Margrit stopped his hands.

"Lady Lete is a good person. She's cool-headed and fair, but she has a lot of affection. That's a disposition that doesn't suit hell. But what you mustn't forget is that Lady Lete isn't a demon."

He turned his head with cold eyes.

"She's a manager of this world. A being fundamentally different from us, even different from Satan."

"That doesn't change her heart."

"Heart?"

Margrit chuckled.

"Then tell me this. I honestly don't know. When Mercedes died, Lady Lete withdrew even when hell's fate was in jeopardy. So was that heart? Or..."

A terrible truth.

"Was she simply programmed that way?"

"According to the boss, Executive Secretary Monolas was sent to counsel your error. But he never came, and Yahweh arrived first. Do you think that's lucky? I don't see it that way. Because Monolas is also a manager."

"What are you saying..."

"How could a human who lives merely decades understand the grand order? But the lord you serve probably suspects to some degree. He has that level of mental capacity. What I'm trying to say is, how much is real and how much is illusion?"

Margrit checked Ryan's scan information.

"Your ability is based on this world's user, that is, the master identity code. The reason Gehenna's chains broke would be an error that occurred when that authority transcended the system. So are you a being from the outside world?"

Ryan couldn't answer.

"Unknowable. That's as far as it goes. Even if there is an outside world, unless we directly contact information from there, we don't know who we are. Perhaps you too might be a program."

"I decide and act of my own will."

"I know. But what if even that is programming? Do you understand? We can't reach a conclusion this way. But managers are the only beings who know who they are. You're free to define them, but remember this."

The chains of Gehenna pulled from Ryan's chest were grasped in the Grand Duke's hands.

"It might be different from what we imagine. That's what the 0.5-dimensional barrier means. If you truly want to protect Yahweh, you mustn't trust anyone."

As Ryan maintained his silence, Margrit examined the broken part of the chains.

"Let's begin."

Stang National Magic School.

Shirone had kept her promise to allow the parents to observe as a condition for training Wizard.

But perhaps it would have been better not to make that promise at all.

"My goodness..."

With all the teachers and even students watching, Wizard was being bombarded by Shirone.

"Your reactions are slow!"

The seven-year-old child was being pushed back repeatedly by magic powerful enough to devastate the surrounding area.

Her pale parents screamed.

"Wizard!"

As the photon cannon exploded, a thunderous roar erupted and debris scattered across the wide training ground.

"Huuuuu!"

Through the smoke, Wizard could be seen breathing heavily after casting defensive magic.

The teachers thought this was madness.

"Headmaster! This can't go on! The child will die at this rate!"

"Mmm."

The headmaster's expression wasn't good either, but he couldn't rashly interfere with one of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars.

More than anything, what bothered him was that the expressions of the first-class residents across from them, the Ten Wizards, showed no change.

'Is it really okay to leave this be? Are they seeing something we don't know...'

At that moment an explosion occurred, and this time Wizard was sent flying dozens of meters.

"Heuuuk!"

Even in the hurricane-like wind currents, she precisely maintained her center and landed, causing wonder to fill the eyes of Bartok, leader of the Ten Wizards.

'She blocked it again.'

The more he watched, the more amazing her talent was.

'The current combat level of the Five Great Stars is quite high. Even the Ten Wizards couldn't face her individually. Yet that child...'

Then Shirone shouted.

"Don't let your guard down!"

The moment Wizard hurriedly turned her head, Shirone, who had approached within striking distance, cast a photon cannon.

A bang erupted as a flash of light pierced through Wizard's powerful barrier.

"Kuuk!"

Wizard pulled back her shoulder and lifted both feet.

'She curled up her body.'

With her defensive magic broken, it was an instinctive posture to minimize the impact somehow.

Amy marveled inwardly.

'She can't be unharmed. But that subtle difference saved Wizard's life.'

Bang! Bang! Bang!

As Wizard bounced off the ground like a rubber ball and collapsed, Shirone charged again.

"Againâ€”"

This time even the Ten Wizards widened their eyes.

Realizing from their expressions, the headmaster rushed forward and shouted at Shirone.

"S-stop this now!"

Shirone didn't stop.

During the brief time approaching Wizard, countless thoughts flashed through her mind.

'Is this right?'

She knew that in her current state, Wizard couldn't defend against her attack.

'She might really die this time.'

That's exactly why she had to do it.

'Havitz is...'

The Satan that Wizard would probably have to eliminate wouldn't stop at this level.

"Wizard! Snap out of it!"

As she shouted and arrived, Shirone swung the photon cannon compressed in her hand.

'It's over.'

Just as everyone thought that, fire lit in Wizard's eyes as a barrier formed.

Kwaaaaang!

The air barrier visibly rippled, and Wizard flew through the air and crashed into the ground.

"Wi-Wizard?"

After showing no movement for a long while, Wizard stood up with her broken right arm dangling.

"Haa. Haa."

She muttered quietly.

"I-I blocked it."

Shirone took another step forward.

'She broke through her limit. Just once more, just once more...'

At that moment, pushing through the teachers' hands, her mother came running.

"You horrible child!"

As Shirone turned around, the woman's hands grabbed her by the collar.

"What are you doing to our daughter! The child's arm is broken! She's only seven years old!"

"You promised to entrust her completely to me. If it's unpleasant to watch, you don't have to come."

Murderous intent flashed in the mother's eyes.

"So that's why you made such a promise? Thinking if you showed us something like this, we wouldn't come? Then you misjudged us. We don't need the money or anything else. We're ending this here."

"The arm can be healed. If I cast magic..."

A slap rang out.

"Oh my..."

As the mother who had struck Shirone's cheek panted angrily, the teachers' faces turned pale.

'She's insane. To hit one of the Five Great Stars.'

But Amy knew. The reason Shirone deliberately offered her cheek to the woman when she could have easily avoided it was...

'Shirone is struggling too.'

Because she thought getting hit once might ease even a little of the guilt weighing on her like indigestion.

"Ah."

Coming to her senses, the mother stared at her own hand.

Not because she had hit one of the Five Great Stars, but probably because she had never hit anyone in her life.

Shirone understood her feelings too.

'My mother would have done the same.'

Looking back at Wizard, she was too busy catching her breath to even intervene in this fight.

"Mother."

Shirone turned to face her again.

"Wizard is an exceptional child. An ordinary seven-year-old would cry from pain if their arm broke, not endure it. That means she already understands pain intellectually."

As her husband arrived belatedly after checking on their daughter's condition first, the mother shed tears.

"What are you talking about? What does understanding pain even mean? Wizard isn't a crazy child. She's too terrified to even cry."

The father also chimed in.

"Stop this now. I can't stand it anymore either. Why should my daughter be treated like this? Is it because we're uneducated, propertyless farmers?"

"It's the opposite."

Shirone's voice rose slightly.

"Because she's exceptional. I'm pushing her because she's capable. What Wizard is learning now is knowledge stained with the blood and sweat of countless talents that she could never have achieved alone. Because she has developed by receiving those benefits, when humanity faces danger, naturally she too should..."

Sacrifice herself.

'Is that really true?'

Shirone couldn't bring herself to say it.

'A beloved daughter becoming a beautiful lady, meeting a good person, loving them, and living a happy life...'

Could that be more important than the innovation that would change the world?

"...I'm sorry."

After bowing her head in apology to the parents, Shirone turned and left the training ground.

"Let's stop here for today."

As no one saw Shirone off, Wizard, having finished her treatment, approached.

"Mom, Dad. What's wrong?"

"Wizard!"

Her mother caressed Wizard's arm in its splint and shed tears.

"It must have hurt a lot. How hard it must have been."

"Where did big brother go? Is training over?"

"Yes, it's over. Mom told her to stop. I'll never entrust you to someone like that again."

"Hmm."

Wizard stared intently at Shirone's shabby, retreating figure.

"Thank you, Mom. I really almost died this time. But I'm really sorry..."

Wizard said hesitantly.

"I'd appreciate it if you didn't interfere during training from now on."

Her parents' expressions went blank.

"Wi-Wizard? What do you mean by that..."

"Sorry. I need to go to big brother first. I have questions about this training."

Seeming truly urgent, Wizard broke away from the crowd and followed after Shirone.

As no one spoke, the eyes of Bartok, leader of the Ten Wizards, deepened.

'Talent calls to talent.'

The only adult Wizard acknowledged.

She instinctively knew that desperately following in Shirone's footsteps was the only way to survive.

'There's no doubt about her potential, but I was half-doubtful about her disposition.'

When Shirone said she might die, Wizard had smiled brightly and said she would do it.

'Though her deliberation time was short.'

Probably everything she would have to bear flashed through the genius's mind.

'I can understand the Five Great Stars' feelings too.'

Would anyone want to waste time when faced with the most exceptional talent in human history?

"Big brother!"

Wizard's bright voice carried over from outside the training ground.
