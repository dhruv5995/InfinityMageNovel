The Cycling World (4)

Fire Management Corporation.

"Mmm..."

Lete, sitting at the desk in the president's office, stared at the wall and made a meaningless sound.

'Why am I so anxious?'

The fire volume was stable, and the circulation of the tributaries was flowing smoothly.

"Monorath."

The source of all anxiety was that the lowest-ranked demon from the other world was nowhere to be seen.

"No, when did he leave for Raviette? No word from him? Did he slip away somewhere else again?"

She stood up, hitting the desk and shaking her head.

"No, that can't be."

Though Monorath had probably backstabbed her a hundred million times, she believed in him.

"Surely he wouldn't do that even in this unprecedented situation? He's a manager, after all. Right, there's no way."

A living god named Rian was wandering around the other world with his karma chain severed.

'Every being in the universe carries their own karma. They cannot transcend it.'

Therefore, it was a system error.

And the demons capable of solving this level of problem could be counted on one hand, even in the other world.

"This is annoying. I already have too much work to do."

Lete, feeling uneasy, left the president's office and headed to the Karma Management Department.

On both sides of the corridor, countless informants were monitoring living gods through visions.

"Haa! Haa!"

Among them was an informant making excited moaning sounds while busily touching her body.

"Riona."

She was in charge of Ethella and Chagall, and she quickly turned her head upon hearing Lete's voice.

"Ah, President."

Lete placed her hand on her shoulder.

"You're working hard. These guys are the ones, right? I heard they made it to the rankings this time."

Riona spoke excitedly.

"Yes, they're ranked 7th all-time. Purification time: 87 years. How immense must be the good and evil that have combined? Just imagining it makes my body heat up unbearably."

Lete felt dizzy too.

"Taiji is the signal that gave birth to the universe. The circulation of yin and yang contains tremendous power. It unites two opposing concepts into one."

Riona looked back at Lete.

"Then the first universe was also born through circulation? What kind of conceptual circulation?"

"Probably... electricity."

A fact only a manager could guess.

"Energy generated through the circulation of positive and negative poles. Therefore, all concepts born from that energy principle must be divided in two, and that is the universe we exist in."

Lete raised her index finger.

"The real world and the other world. Two completely different worlds can coexist because they were designed with the principle of Taiji. But when applied to humans rather than worlds, it becomes very dangerous."

"Why?"

"It has the property of going backward against all definitions of the universe. What happens when all concepts are integrated - good and evil, black and white, material and immaterial, up and down?"

The first unity.

"The only concept that can escape the universe is born. That's what we call the First One. It's not strange that those two people carry such tremendous karma."

Riona looked back at the screen and swallowed hard.

"...What an incredible connection."

"Hoho! This is just the beginning. Those who carry karma can never be comfortable, so it'll be good to watch."

Humans wouldn't understand, but the combination of good and evil stirred a strange romance in demons.

'I hope it goes well.'

Though she didn't know what kind of result that would be.

"By the way."

Lete asked, smacking her lips.

"No word from that pig? No informant has seen where he is?"

"No. The chief secretary is also a manager, so tracking him through karma screens has limitations. Anyway... there haven't been any reports of him being spotted near Raviette."

Lete grabbed her head.

"Ugh, where is he and what is he doing? He'll do well, right? Yes, that's right. He'll definitely do well. I asked him sincerely, so this time he'll handle it properly. Right?"

Riona twisted her lips.

'I don't think so.'

She thought that perhaps Lete was the person who knew Monorath the least in the other world.

River of Unfilial Acts, 78th Tributary.

The village built along the snake-like curved river of fire was a marquis territory in the other world.

The marquis was Pikarath.

As the manager of a tributary averaging 3.5 million purification hours daily, he was now entertaining Monorath.

"Come, come! Our chief secretary who does great work for hell. Please have a drink of this too."

The marquis with a viper's face tilted a bottle toward the large-headed pig.

"Good, very good! Kweek-eek-eek!"

The Marquis Pikarath's territory was still less than halfway to his business destination.

The marquis gave orders.

"Come on, come on, you lot! What are you doing not moving quickly? While serving such a handsome and wonderful person."

As twenty succubi went to work, drool flowed from Monorath's mouth.

"Kweek! Kweek!"

As the atmosphere heated up, the marquis who had been reading the mood slyly presented some documents.

"Excuse me, Chief Secretary. This is..."

"Hm? What?"

He could see the title "78th Tributary Expansion Development Report," but the contents didn't register.

"The number of demons in the marquis territory has increased considerably. But you see, if demons increased, that means mouths to feed increased too, doesn't it?"

"Ah, right. Right."

Monorath just wanted to focus on the sensations.

"So I've come up with some alternatives, and if our chief secretary, who's the real power behind the Fire Corporation, could just put his signature here..."

"Ohhh..."

As a sensitive reaction emerged, Pikarath turned around and clapped.

A servant with ram's horns bowed and entered, handing over a small box.

"This is, as you can see..."

Opening the box revealed a palm-sized key glowing golden.

"A key made of pure flame essence..."

When Monorath slammed the table with a bang, the succubi scattered in surprise.

"Marquis Pikarath!"

At the voice full of tension, Pikarath quickly bowed his head.

"Yes, yes!"

"Are you insulting me now! Do you see me as someone who'd handle official business for something like this!"

The marquis, understanding perfectly, shouted while half-rising in his urgency.

"Bring it quickly!"

This time the door burst open powerfully as burly demons brought in huge treasure chests.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

There were four total, and Pikarath approached with quick steps and inserted the golden key.

Lifting the lid revealed treasures piled like mountains, blindingly brilliant.

Pikarath turned around awkwardly and pointed to the treasure chests as he continued.

"Whoever has this key deserves to be the owner of this treasure, something like that."

Monorath, who had been staring intently at the chests, suddenly threw back his head and laughed.

"Kekeke! Kweek! Kweek!"

"Haha! Hahahaha!"

As Pikarath laughed along, the succubi clapped and flew back in.

"You're generous! You really are generous! There's a reason I acknowledge you!"

"How could there be any question? This is all thanks to Monorath taking good care of official business."

Pikarath, returning to the drinking table, casually presented the documents.

"Kweek! Well, I always do well. Let's see, what was that story from earlier? Something about the tributary?"

"Eh, it's not even worth your concern. Actually, to be honest, should someone who manages all the fires of hell worry about such minor tributaries? Then hell wouldn't function. There are different demons for drawing the big picture."

"That's what I'm saying! You understand, but only the president - I mean, only Lete doesn't get it. So how can I not be frustrated?"

"Of course you're frustrated."

Pikarath snapped his fingers.

"Wow, now I see why our chief secretary looks so troubled. At times like this, subordinates should serve properly. I'll pay attention starting with myself!"

"Keke, well, you're doing fine."

When Pikarath quietly handed him a pen, Monorath signed the approval section with blood.

"Bravo! You're so generous!"

As the succubi laughed and clapped, Pikarath waved his hand.

"What are you doing outside? Quickly, quickly, bring it!"

Carts loaded with alcohol and food endlessly entered, filled the table, and left.

"You must have a drink. Right now there are succubi who couldn't even enter the castle standing in line."

"Kekeke! Really?"

Over the next hour, the marquis managed to get seven approval documents signed.

"Now, this is about the dispute with Maidrun Marquis Territory over fire dam control rights."

"Hey! Let's have some fun now!"

Pikarath nodded frantically and leaned toward Monorath.

"This is the end. Really! The last one! I swear!"

Thus, the 78th tributary dispute situation that had become a hot topic at the Fire Corporation was resolved.

"Ow."

Lete muttered while massaging her left shoulder.

"Why does my shoulder hurt so much lately?"

Riona turned her head.

"Aren't you overworking yourself? You haven't slept since the spirit realm closed and have only been working. Should I massage it for you?"

"I'm still okay. As long as no more damn problems arise. By the way, the Grand Duke should come soon."

Looking at Lete's tired face, Riona made a bitter expression.

'She's really capable.'

Without her, hell would have fallen into great chaos after the spirit realm closed.

"Will the Grand Duke be able to fix it when he comes?"

"I don't know. But he's number one in hell at handling hidden codes. Come to think of it, I should check. Who's the informant in charge of Rian?"

"It would be Vivian."

"Really?..."

Lete headed toward Vivian's position while tapping her shoulder.

"Gehenna's Chain. What's he doing now?"

"He's advancing without rest. From the direction, it looks like the Fire Corporation is his destination."

She couldn't help but sigh.

"Where is he now?"

"He should pass the Wailing Wall soon. But President, once he passes the Wailing Wall..."

Vivian raised the screen's altitude.

"It'll be Raviette soon. The city of magical engineering. Isn't that where the chief secretary went on business?"

"Huh?"

Lete's eyes widened.

"Oh! Right! We can just fix Rian's error there and it'll be over! Monorath can do it!"

As she clapped like a young girl, Vivian examined the high-altitude screen again.

'He's arrived.'

A pitch-black wall stretching thousands of kilometers was waiting for Sirone and Rian.

Wooooooooo!

Even before arriving, they could hear terrible crying sounds that made them want to cover their ears.

'So this is the Wailing Wall.'

No matter where they looked - up, down, left, or right - the end of the wall was invisible, and the thickness was probably similar.

Rian stopped walking.

"It's enormous."

Compared to the wall's size, their existence was smaller than dust.

"It's painful... get me out of here..."

How many must there be?

What formed the wall was, without a single exception, all human bodies.

"It's horrible."

Even the pus had rotted and turned black like oil, and the surface was grotesque with protruding faces and limbs.

"I'm hungry... thirsty, so thirsty..."

Though no one had the strength to cry out loudly, there were so many that it was noisy.

"To get to the Fire Corporation, we have to pass this gateway."

A gap smaller than a crack compared to the whole vertically bisected the wall.

"Alright. Let's go, Sirone."

Though he didn't know when Gehenna's Chain might activate, Rian's compass always pointed straight ahead.
