What is God? (1)

Uorin was.

"Haaaah!"

Watching Shirone fly alone toward Dr. Martin, she couldn't contain her excitement.

'Ah...'

Shirone, Shirone.

'You are mine.'

Shirone's failure in High Gear would certainly put Uorin in an advantageous position, but.

'But is that really what love is about?'

Shirone charging toward the strongest enemy was exactly the sight of her pouring everything into love.

'This is...'

She, who could feel her real-world state to some degree, felt embarrassed.

She might have gotten a bit too excited, but even that mistake was a sweet emotion that felt refreshing.

'Shirone. You will come to me.'

While Uorin's emotions were closer to pleasure than admiration, the hearts of other users were different.

'He's going to keep fighting?'

Looking at Dr. Martin's aircraft floating at high altitude, it was courage bordering on recklessness.

Durability: 140 billion.

Even people who couldn't grasp the magnitude of the number could feel the super form of Real Martin.

'Terrible tragedy.'

That would probably be the title.

One thing was certain - this was absolutely not a form that any individual could imagine alone.

Whiiiiiing!

From the center of the massive aircraft cobbled together from grotesque things, an eyeball popped out.

"Whyyyy."

Clearly mechanical sounds.

But it seemed to contain emotion, making listeners break out in goosebumps.

"Why isn't the result value coming out?"

The users trapped inside the infected aircraft felt suspicious about Dr. Martin's words.

'What is he talking about?'

Though communication was impossible so they couldn't share opinions, the same sense of unease was conveyed to all.

'That's not dialogue, it's a system message. Content that has nothing to do with the episode...'

It felt like the protagonist on a theater stage suddenly turning to the audience to mention ticket prices.

'It's an error.'

The Operator intuited.

'The algorithm changes exceeded the critical threshold as the system was destroyed. Even Number Seven couldn't have predicted this far.'

Then what was the result value?

'Dr. Martin's performance goal is the end of the world. Meaning, that probability isn't being calculated properly...'

Her gaze turned toward Yahweh2.

'It's not over.'

It meant Dr. Martin's calculated win rate wasn't being tallied accurately.

No matter how much he evolved, no matter how much he increased his stats to the point of destroying the system, the end wouldn't come.

'How?'

The Operator shuddered.

'He can still fight?'

She thought about the existence of the massive force pushing against Yahweh2's back.

It was sacred and reverent, but she felt a much heavier sense of responsibility.

'I know.'

The reason he had to fight.

'Because if not you, no one else can fight. Because we've all surrendered.'

No one in this world would want to bear the burden that Yahweh2 was carrying now.

Shirone gritted his teeth.

"Graaaah!"

As he shot Air God and soared vertically, a clear sense of déjà vu entered his mind.

'He's not a god.'

From Dr. Martin's dialogue, Shirone thought about the question Ankera had pondered.

Why can I not become a god?

To choose the correct answer from countless possibilities, he had to answer another question.

'What is God?'

While he could define it as something, no substance exists in that definition.

Because it cannot be imagined.

'Dr. Martin isn't a god. Number Seven who created Dr. Martin isn't a god either. God is...'

Suddenly this thought occurred to him.

'Could it be?'

Having experienced the world of High Gear, a new insight electrified his mind.

'Does it really... exist?'

God.

Real Martin let out a roar.

"For a perfect world!"

The way he spouted system messages like dialogue blurred the boundary between life and matter.

'140 billion durability.'

And even the grotesque appearance with all sorts of horrible things mixed together at will...

'There is no form.'

To Shirone's eyes, having reached Formless, it was merely a collection of signals where 1 and 0, existence and nothingness intersected.

'I can do it.'

The spirit of Immortal Function strengthened photon condensation, revealing the largest size ever.

'Michelan Gun!'

As the flash exploded, Dr. Martin's durability was shaved down by over a billion.

"...We're winning."

The Operator shot up.

"We can win."

Her words spread like ripples through every user's heart, igniting their fighting spirit.

'Fight. We're protecting this world.'

It was ironic.

Knowing it wasn't real made human unity happen much more easily.

'Fight! Fight! Fight!'

Shirone could clearly feel the users' hearts becoming one.

'They're integrating.'

Even Yahweh couldn't freely move users' hearts.

But when their hearts gathered as one, quantum signals became photon signals.

'Now!'

Permeating the sensation of Formless, they functioned as one system that could be changed.

The name of that system was...

"Ultima."

The world shook, and the virus that had infected the users' artificial intelligence began to disappear.

"I can move! I'm back!"

"Let's fight!"

Users who regained their consciousness simultaneously raised their weapons and began shooting at the creatures.

Shirone checked the ground through his screen.

'Everyone is fighting.'

In their appearance of courting death under the single-minded goal of protecting the world, where was prejudice?

Where was competition, where was discrimination, where was the gap in levels?

'There is none.'

Long, long ago, the species called human had achieved an integrated mental system.

There was a time when they used intelligence solely for humanity's advancement, for everyone's happiness.

'Why doesn't it work?'

The reason why what works in High Gear doesn't work in reality.

'Since when did humans...'

Start refusing to become one, pursuing only their own existence?

'Uorin.'

The little witch muttered.

"It's not my fault."

No matter how much she repeated it, the original sin of all life called human lay with her.

"I love you, Shirone."

Because in this world, only Yahweh remained for her to love.

She had no choice but to become a beautiful flower eternally waiting for a butterfly to fly to her.

Son of Yolga glanced sideways at the little witch's aircraft quietly looking up at the sky.

'A poisonous flower.'

When the Holy War opened, her true worth would be revealed, but that's exactly why she was someone he couldn't distance himself from.

"Anyway..."

Even while everyone was fighting, Fermi didn't participate in Shirone's Ultima.

'I wasn't infected anyway.'

Aegis communicated.

Boss, what should we do?

Fermi watched the collision between users and system over High Gear's survival.

"Heh."

Trust people?

'If you've seen Ultima's potential to this degree, you've underestimated it by far, Shirone. The human heart is much deeper and murkier than the surface you've seen throughout all history...'

Let's play along for now. Let's end this.

Son of Yolga smiled as he soared into the sky.

"Not a bad feeling."

The upper part of Dr. Martin's aircraft opened and a red flash pierced through the sky.

Metal Rain activating. Initializing the world.

'Whatever it is...'

The system doesn't lie.

Shirone, who had descended while dodging the barrage, brushed past Fermi ascending to the sky.

Buy me time.

The key was destroying Real Martin's 3rd stage aircraft before Metal Rain activated.

Without needing to communicate, Fermi ascended.

"Sure thing."

Judgments that would be impossible in reality were far too easy here for a reason.

'The core is there.'

Because they had an outside world to return to even if this place was destroyed.

'High Gear is empty, but that's why it's precious.'

Because it was nothing, they could stake everything and love it - a contradiction of the heart.

'You must already realize.'

The fact that integration is impossible unless the concept of death is removed from humans.

'You must present it.'

Clear evidence that death in reality isn't the end, brought from the outside world.

'Then humanity can integrate. But also... the moment that happens, humanity is extinct.'

That was why Argones activated.

'Even the Gaians went extinct. This world won't allow us to know the outside world.'

Why?

And to find the answer to that question, Shirone was waiting on the ground.

'I can do it.'

All users were gathering their hearts with the single-minded goal of protecting this world.

At that moment, hearts became law, becoming the greatest system quantum signals could create.

"Ultima System."

All their hearts focused as one, adding strength to Shirone's Formless.

'End it in one strike.'

Steel Rain activating. Thank you to everyone who has loved High Gear until now.

As if nothing had happened, Dr. Martin's voice had returned to perfect mechanical tones.

Rain fell from the sky.

Countless steel rods were falling to destroy the world.

"Damn! What is that?"

What they confirmed through augmented reality was that each one had the power to destroy a city.

"Fight! Fight to the end!"

But even in such a situation, the hearts of users without fear of death didn't waver.

The little witch suddenly felt nostalgia.

'We were like that.'

Even without an outside world, the Gaians were the only species to overcome the fear of death.

"We were infinitely free."

Though the mechanism of courage was different, looking at the expressions of the users here.

"Come at us! We are the masters! We'll never surrender to the system! We'll fight to the very end!"

With voices of absolute conviction, pushing forward what they pursued.

"I am..."

From what a great place did I come?

'And now, from how high a place am I falling?'

It was unfair to call it a mistake.

Implanting good and evil in the human mind was unbearable even for herself.

'You have to understand me.'

The little witch seemed to be crying.

"At least you have to...!"

The moment she tried to speak, the code comprising Shirone greatly fluctuated.

'This is it!'

From high in the sky, metal fragments gathered to become a massive Michelan Gun.

'Hand of God.'

The surroundings turned to darkness, and an enormously huge photon cannon was born at the center of the Michelan Gun.

Kukukukukukuku!

Amid countless steel rain falling, users looked up at the sky.

Looking at the massive sphere of light made one realize how futile language was.

'Just that thing.'

An idea that couldn't even be called that.

"Here I go!"

As Yahweh2 swung his arm, the Michelan Gun in the sky hurled the photon cannon.

The moment the flash struck Dr. Martin, all the creatures exploded.

Augmented reality filled with system messages, and finally Shirone became a Ranker.

Special privilege granted.

At that moment, Dr. Martin's aircraft exploded, tearing through the signals that formed the world.

The sky opened.

'There it is.'

There was a single eyeball there.

Shirone, activating Metal Wing Da Vinci, flew toward where the world's curtain had torn.

Son of Yolga, reduced to rags from brief combat, said as he fell.

"Make sure you see it clearly."

Shirone nodded, and a system message appeared for everyone on the ground.

"Huh?"

Ranker privilege activating. Yahweh2's code name will change to Ranker code name.

The Administrator, Golden Wheel, Ascension, Destruction Demon God 707's group and the Mafia group, even the Ten Men...

"Haha."

Could only stare blankly at the one and only concept ascending to the sky.

Yahweh.
