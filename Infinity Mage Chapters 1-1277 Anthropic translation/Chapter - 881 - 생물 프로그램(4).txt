Biology Program (4)

"I see."

Argones, who had been staring intently at the screen, sat down in Fisho's chair and crossed his legs.

Though it was clearly an event from a different time, to Sirone it felt as if he were right there before him.

"Do you know me?"

So he asked, and surprisingly, an answer came.

"Of course. I am Fisho, after all."

Argones' mucous substance flowed rapidly over the surface, then transformed into Fisho's body.

"I'm also your father."

The skin liquefied again, immediately changing into the face of Vincent, Sirone's father.

"I'm also your woman."

This time it was Amy.

Argones chuckled.

"No, was it this one?"

All the connections he had made so far rapidly revealed themselves as if playing back footage.

Sirone said:

"But I am not."

Therefore, it was not the truth.

As if hearing this, Argones regained his original form and raised the corners of his mouth.

"Hexa. A protocol that exists outside the biological realm. Certainly, I cannot dominate you. But..."

Argones kicked off from the chair and rushed forward, grabbing the video recording device and thrusting his face close.

"That doesn't mean you cannot be annihilated."

Sirone's eyes widened.

In the still-vibrating screen, Argones' face was rapidly pushing outward.

'No.'

Argones, who had permeated the video recording device, was multiplying cells and emerging again.

The synchronization matched perfectly, creating an optical illusion as if he had leaped through time.

"Isn't that right?"

As Argones let his arm dangle and swung it like a whip, Sirone cast instantaneous movement.

Sticking to the wall and looking up, he saw Argones' arm had hardened like a blade.

"No need to be surprised. I was just checking what kind of signal Hexa's protocol receives."

There was no way for Argones to escape from the space sealed by Material's barrier.

"Destroying the barrier of cognition to expand the unit of time. For a human, you're certainly unique."

He seemed to already suspect that time had been reversed through the Timebomb.

"...What do you want?"

Argones shook his head.

"I want nothing. You know what I mean, right? An asteroid doesn't collide because it hates this planet. It just crashes. Living beings also have their own inertia. Instinct."

Argones seeped down into the floor, then emerged with his upper body from the ceiling.

"All the desires of that biological realm. The synthesis and antithesis of those desires form the world. My host seemed to understand this."

Fisho was an insect mage who studied the ecosystem in his mind.

"It was a beneficial conversation, but he chose heresy. The world's secrets must not be revealed. They must be annihilated."

"By what right?"

"You still don't understand. Annihilation is also a desire of living beings. It's not because I have the right. Cells annihilate themselves when danger approaches the system. The same goes for Fisho."

"Apoptosis."

If Anchera prevented the collapse of the natural world, Argones seemed to prevent the collapse of the biological world.

"All nature of living beings begins from me. And the further they get from me, the more the biological realm collapses. Therefore, you, me, Havitz, Miro - we're all dangerous elements."

It was surprising to hear that Havitz, the incarnation of desire, was a dangerous element to Argones.

"When something is carried through to one extreme, perspective disappears. Extremes are dangerous. I don't know who will win, but it would be better if no one wins. Only a world that is complex and full of all kinds of doubts will be safe for you all."

"If someone wins?"

"Apoptosis."

It meant he would annihilate all living beings when setting the information propagation unit to planetary scale.

Sirone said:

"Guffin left the photon system."

Argones' body snapped and landed fluidly on the floor.

And there was silence.

"The Gaian transcended you and transcended Anchera. As long as we have that faith, we won't give up."

"You think of me as a villain."

Argones' flesh, with his hand on the video recording device, began to collapse softly.

"Well, that's your limit. Faith? With just something like that, you won't be able to understand Guffin."

"What do you mean?"

The mucous substance seeped into the video recording device.

"You'd better think about why the Gaian left humanity behind. Even though Guffin has left, the fight isn't over yet."

Argones' finger, with most of his body having seeped in, pointed at Sirone.

"Save yourself."

The last voice leaked out.

"Those are Guffin's words."

While keeping Argones' message in his head, the video recording device twisted grotesquely.

With a bang, an explosion occurred inside and the smell of burning cytoplasm filled the air.

Sirone, who had been silently watching the scene where nothing remained, removed Material's barrier.

And he fell into contemplation about how to handle the will that Fisho had left behind.

When he made his decision and turned around, Sirone's eyes held firm resolve.

"That's how it happened."

When Sirone finished the story related to Fisho's will, Iruki stroked his chin.

"Hmm, so no one should win."

From the perspective of humans opposing the ultimate evil, it was a story that couldn't be dismissed lightly.

"It's surprising that me is included? You said she swallowed Anchera's dream. So does that make Ra and Argones enemies?"

"He said there are no allies or enemies. They just suppress phenomena that cross the line according to their standards. Both Ra and Argones."

Iruki nodded.

"This is troublesome. We'll need to prepare, but the information will spread instantly. I understand your feelings."

"I can neither reveal it nor not reveal it. For now, I'll go to the Ivory Tower and ask Taeseong. Taeseong should be able to make a more accurate judgment."

While each was lost in thought, Sirone asked:

"What will you do from now on?"

"Nothing will change. Havitz's army is right at our doorstep, so we have to stop them. I don't know if we can, though."

Iruki actually comforted Sirone instead.

"I'll leave Argones' problem to you. Don't worry about the kingdom. It's our job to handle that."

"...Save yourself."

The two looked up at the sky together.

In front of Fisho's grave after people had left, Cayden placed a single chrysanthemum flower.

"Was it a satisfying life?"

Though he had deliberately arrived late to avoid getting involved with his classmates, there was someone who had the same thought.

"You're late."

When he turned his head, Eden was standing with the sun behind him.

"You came too?"

"Of course I had to. We're friends."

Cayden, Eden, and Fisho had once fought as a team in Scramble Royale.

Cayden slowly stood up.

"I heard you were in Zion."

"The Spirit Zone closed and the monks were dispatched to various parts of the world. I stopped by briefly before supporting the Central Continent War."

"I see. Good luck."

As Cayden turned and walked away, Eden asked:

"What are you planning to do?"

"...What?"

"Aren't you going to fight? You were born with the fate of the Red Cross. It's an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities."

Humanity needed Cayden.

"I don't believe in fate." Honestly, I don't know.

"I'm not a seeker. I'm not a clergyman like you either. Why should I fight? For whom?"

Eden thought of countless reasons.

But the one reason he couldn't give among all those was 'for yourself.'

Because if Cayden became a hero who saved the world, that would mean his unhappiness.

"Right, it's not something I can force. Anyway, take care. Contact me if you change your mind."

Cayden, who had been motionless for a moment, finally moved without answering.

Then, Alpheas Magic School alumni walked in groups of three or five from the cemetery entrance.

Familiar faces.

He saw Sirone, Iruki, and Amy, and behind them Screamer and Maya were walking.

With time seeming to stop and his thoughts freezing, only his heart beat rapidly.

Screamer pleaded with Maya:

"Hey, don't be like that and come to my match just once. It would be even better if you performed too."

"Performed?"

Maya, who had been thinking for a moment, turned her head with a huff.

"No."

"You... do you still hate me?"

"I don't hate you, but I don't particularly like you either. Honestly, you were the one who hated me, weren't you?"

"I said I'm sorry. I regret it too. And you won back then anyway, right? Now that I think about it, it's unfair."

Amy pointed ahead.

"Huh? Isn't that Cayden? Eden's there too."

While Cayden remained frozen, Eden ran over waving his hand.

"Hi! Long time no see."

While Eden was talking with Sirone, Screamer approached Cayden.

"Hey? What are you doing?"

Cayden looked as if his soul had left his body.

"What are you looking at?"

Screamer walked behind Cayden and aligned his gaze, but couldn't see anything.

'Maya.'

Cayden was trembling.

The moment he saw her, what he realized was the enormity of the harsh fate he had to bear.

'It's Cayden.'

Maya's heart fluttered for a moment, but she hurriedly came to her senses and shook her head.

'No, it's okay now.'

Since she had decided to bear the price of loving Sirone, there would be no need to ask about the graduation exam incident.

"Hey, say something! What's wrong with you?"

Amy, who knew why Cayden was frozen, sighed and grabbed his hand to pull him along.

Cayden, who had taken a step as if he might fall, finally came to his senses and looked around.

"Ah..."

Maya was looking at him and smiling.

"What are you doing? You should say hello."

As Amy coached him in frustration, Cayden approached with an awkward gait.

"Hi, hello..."

"Yeah, it's really been a long time. The first time since the graduation exam, right? Have you been well?"

When there was no answer, Maya tilted her head.

"What's wrong, Cayden? Are you feeling unwell?"

When Cayden placed his hands on Maya's shoulders, everyone stopped talking and looked at them.

"Ma, Maya."

Amy's face turned ashen.

'Not that, you idiot.'

Right now, Cayden's head was probably filled with nothing but the thought that he had to confess his love.

'Destroy my fate.'

Cayden silently tilted his face, bringing his lips close to Maya's lips.

"...Huh?"

Just as his classmates' eyes widened, Maya pushed Cayden away in disgust.

"What are you doing! Like a pervert!"

Amy held her forehead, and Cayden, who had stepped back awkwardly, looked at his friends' gazes.

"I'm sorry."

Ignoring all those stares, Cayden bowed his head to Maya and walked away.

"What's wrong with him? He was weird before, but now he seems completely crazy."

Amy said:

"He just doesn't know. He's never done what he wanted, not even once."

When Cayden desperately wanted something, the result always led to the worst.

'But if it's the opposite...'

If he gave up that desperate prayer himself, it would at least exceed Amy's imagination.

'Though it's a shame.'

While having such soldier-like thoughts, Alpheas and Olivia walked over.

"You haven't left yet."

"Headmaster."

Sirone, who had finished talking with Eden, approached Alpheas.

"There's something I've wanted to ask for a while. What happened to Teacher Ethella?"

"Why doesn't anyone tell me? Did something bad happen by any chance?"

"Romy Ethella is..."

Alpheas said with sad eyes:

"She lost her heart."
