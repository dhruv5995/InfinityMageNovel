Dark Victory (3)

Emotional Disease Case, Number 4

312.

In the mountain ranges surrounding the royal castle of Tormia live vicious monsters.

"Huff! Huff!"

Monsters called humans.

"It hurts. It hurts so damn much."

The serial killer Lichera had kidnapped and murdered a total of 23 women and children over 4 years, making him a heinous criminal.

But even this man who had driven countless people to suffering couldn't endure his own pain.

"Aaaaah!"

The moment his foot caught on a stone, a crushing impact rushed through him as if his toe bones were being pulverized.

"It hurts! Damn it!"

When emotional disease reaches its intermediate stage, the sense of pain becomes 200 times greater than normal.

If he gave up what he loved, he could postpone the agony for a while, but...

"Sob! Sob!"

All that remained for this weeping man was his own body.

'Hungry. So hungry.'

Even hunger felt 200 times worse, but he couldn't go down to the city where martial law had been declared.

Crawling up the mountain, he squeezed himself into the cave that served as his hideout.

"Please spare me. Please..."

His last victim, designated as emergency rations, was trembling while bound with rope.

"Shut up."

The blade held in his blunt hand, with severed finger joints, ended the hostage's life.

The pleasure of killing was long forgotten.

"Let's eat, I need to eat something—"

The moment he bit into the flesh of the corpse with hot blood still flowing and delivered it to his starving stomach.

"Graaaah!"

His throat burned as if on fire.

The memory of surviving the early stages of emotional disease by giving up human flesh flashed through his mind.

'No, no!'

Feeling pain was proof that he still loved human flesh, and in that case, the threshold of emotional disease would spike rapidly.

"Aaaaah! It hurts! Please stop!"

His screams echoed thunderously through the cave, and the echo pierced his eardrums like an awl.

"Hiiik! Hiiik!"

Beyond the limits of endurance, he gripped the knife and fell to his knees.

'I'd rather...'

The tip of the blade brought to his throat trembled, and hot tears flowed down.

"I don't want to. I don't want to die."

Being indifferent to others' lives didn't mean his own life was worthless.

"Sob! Sob! Bastards! I'll kill them all!"

Lichera brought the knife down to his finger joint and cut it off like a guillotine.

...

The pain was so intense that no scream came out, his head jerked back, and then a shriek burst forth.

"Aaaaah!"

Still, the emotional disease didn't disappear.

It was already so severe that cutting off a single finger couldn't return it to the dormant stage.

"I don't want to die!"

One finger joint, then another - Lichera repeated this cruel self-harm.

"Aaaaah!"

Three days later, the World Health Organization received the corpse with cooperation from the Tormia patrol.

When Seriel examined it at the time, Lichera's corpse was said to be horrific to behold.

A scream burst from Son Yujung's mouth as she was flung from the lunar surface and crashed toward the planet.

"Graaaah!"

Son Yujung's enraged face was so wild it resembled a monkey more than a human.

Looking down from the lunar surface, Nane smiled with his eyes.

"Go and gain enlightenment."

Son Yujung's body caught fire like a match as she entered the atmosphere.

Her clothes began to burn away.

"I'll kill you! Once I save my friend, I'll definitely come back and kill you!"

Originally her purpose was to go to hell, but her mind was spinning from the battle with Buddha.

Nane wiped the blood flowing from his lips.

"Still not coming to your senses."

As he shook his head and turned away, fire lit up in Son Yujung's eyes.

"You..."

Kukukukukukuku!

At that moment the world's scenery changed as the blue sky overlapped with flaming clouds.

"Hell."

The sword of dharma embedded in her solar plexus shattered like glass as a golden band was fastened around her neck.

"Grrrr!"

Son Yujung's figure falling several kilometers looked like a falling meteor from a distance.

KWAAAAANG!

Residents who heard the roar could see flames briefly blazing on the horizon.

"Owwww."

Son Yujung lay sprawled in the center of the crater, unable to move a single finger.

'Buddha. That damn bastard.'

It was a massive shockwave that even the avatar of the stone monkey, said to have the strongest durability, couldn't handle.

'I want to fight him again.'

Just as she was thinking that, a human poked his head over the crater's edge.

"A person, it's a person."

It was the demon of Lichera, who had died in reality.

When Son Yujung raised her head, a group appeared behind Lichera.

Someone whistled.

"What's this, fashion?"

She was naked except for a single golden ring hanging around her slender neck.

'Gingoa.'

She could make clothes with a single hair, but she had no sense of shame in her raw instincts anyway.

She was just annoyed by the familiar metallic sensation that was slightly pressing against her neck.

'That damn Buddha bastard! Why is he giving me grief again! What the hell did I even do!'

Go and gain enlightenment.

The biggest man among the group that appeared kicked Lichera's rear.

"What are you doing? Get down there quickly."

"Hiiik!"

At the sight of him rolling down the slope, the onlookers burst into laughter.

"Hahaha! What an idiot."

Lichera, face-planted on the ground, clenched his fists and swallowed his anger.

'Bear with it.'

Even Lichera, called a monster in reality, was nothing more than a docile sheep among greater monsters.

'If I get on their bad side, terrible things will happen. I can't even die.'

Lichera had seen it.

A heinous criminal who had foolishly defied a senior and crawled on the ground for 300 years with severed limbs.

"Hey there, pretty lady. Should we help you out?"

Before the words were finished, Son Yujung lifted both feet and landed with a tumbling motion.

"What? Do you guys like me?"

Sitting with her staff hanging down, she showed no human dignity.

"You're all ugly. I'm in a bad mood right now, so let's just fight. If you win, I'll do whatever."

A moment of silence flowed.

"Heh, interesting woman. Then let's see—"

Before he could finish speaking, Son Yujung's thighs split along the muscle fibers and swelled.

"What, what?"

Before he could react, her body shot forward like an arrow and smashed the man's head.

"That's one."

Sirone pointed ahead.

"That's Labiet over there."

A city far more massive than other structures on the horizon came into their view.

"The city of magical engineering. The scale is tremendous."

"Yeah. Hell's society can be broadly divided into two parts. Military and domestic affairs. Most demons that invaded the human world are soldiers. Of course, Satan is the supreme commander."

"Then domestic affairs are different?"

"No, Satan's power is absolute. It's just that in practical terms, there's not much for him to do. The territories of the underworld are governed by nobles from the domestic affairs department."

Sirone opened his palm.

"Baron, viscount, count, marquis, duke - they govern increasingly larger territories, and among them, dukes who encompass capital-level cities are called grand dukes."

"Then Labiet is?"

"It's a grand duchy ruled by a demon named Magritt. As far as I know, he's said to be the best in the underworld when it comes to magical engineering. They say there's no secret in the world that he doesn't know."

Lian felt something off.

"It's strange to hear you praising a demon."

It was just stating facts, not praise, but Lian's words were understandable.

"I suppose it feels different from hell's army. Those guys invaded us after all. But the residents here just have a different system - they're living their lives in this society called hell."

Sirone continued.

"Of course, that doesn't mean they're good at all. Demons are still demons. But Grand Duke Magritt understands hell the best, so we should be able to get information about Gehenna's chains."

"If it's because of me, it's fine. It's the karma I bear, so I just need to handle it myself. But..."

Lian looked up at the sky.

"It'll be dark soon."

Just as water evaporates to form clouds in reality, the sky here was formed by hellfire ascending and gathering.

However, when night came, the flames would scatter, and what followed was a terrible cold wave.

"It might be good to rest in the city for about a day. Pushing too hard affects your mental strength."

Sirone was worried.

As the two picked up speed heading toward Labiet, Lian asked again.

"But what exactly is magical engineering? I haven't seen any mechanical devices on our way here."

"As you saw with the Wailing Wall, the logic of the underworld is different from reality. Card games and chess have different forms because their systems are different. To cut to the conclusion, there is engineering here too. But..."

Sirone hesitated for a moment.

"You probably won't like it. Most likely."

Only when they arrived at Labiet's gates could Lian understand Sirone's words.

"What is this?"

A barrier similar to what they'd seen at the Wailing Wall massively surrounded the city.

"Gatekeeper sir, humans have arrived."

However, it was much more standardized, and the patterns with embedded human faces were uniform as if machine-stamped.

Looking at the arch-shaped gate that resembled specific human organs, Lian felt dizzy.

'How horrific.'

Two withered legs were bent and decorated on either side of the gate.

'They must be over 10 meters. Are they really human?'

Two arms embracing the gate's arch were visible, and at the center of the arch, an old woman's face had her eyes closed.

'Overall, it looks like an elderly person crouching with head in hands. But...'

The positioning, as if limbs had been severed and placed far apart, was disgustingly unpleasant.

"Yahweh."

The gatekeepers, recognizing him with typical demonic instinct, lowered their voices while pointing spears.

"How dare you come here? Get lost. Before we slice you up right now."

"We're on our way to the Crater. And we have business with this place's master, Magritt."

"Heh."

They laughed at the absurdity.

"So what? Did anyone ask? You don't seem to understand - regardless of reason, you can't enter."

"I can enter."

The gatekeepers' shoulders flinched.

"There are no enemies in hell - that's Satan's doctrine, isn't it? I'd prefer if you let me through quietly before I force my way through."

"Hmph!"

No matter what, when it came to conflict with Yahweh, Labiet city would be the one to suffer losses.

'Minimizing damage to the city is my role. It's better to let him through and follow orders from above.'

The fact that there was life here - that was what made the underworld's residents different from hell's army.

"Open the gate."

At the center of the arch, the old woman's small face suddenly opened her eyes and bared her teeth.

"Goaaaah!"

Then both arms came down like clock hands and began prying fingers into the gate.

The sight of seemingly tearing into her own body made Lian's brow furrow involuntarily.

"Goaaaah! Graaaah!"

The sound of flesh tearing could be heard, and dark red blood gushed between the gates.

In that state, when she pulled her fingers left and right, the gate opened wide with a cracking sound.

The gatekeeper said.

"No enemies exist in hell."

Or everyone is an enemy.

"But Yahweh, you're an exception. You won't receive good treatment inside either."

"...Let's go, Lian."

As Sirone walked forward calmly, Lian following behind gave a bitter smile.

"Now I'm really getting a sense of it."

Just where exactly he had fallen.
