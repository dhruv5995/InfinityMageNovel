What is God (3)

Shirone wore a blank expression.

'This isn't a mistake.'

Even this very thought was flowing in reverse, as if time itself had been turned backward.

"Huh? Huh?"

His confusion was brief—Shirone soon checked his condition with a cool, composed mind.

'Come to think of it...'

His thinking when experiencing the multiverse was completely opposite to when he was in the outside world.

'Thought reverses based on inside and outside. In other words...'

Time flows backward.

"Hmm."

Lost in deep thought, Shirone moved straight ahead through the indefinable space.

'I'm walking forward.'

Or was he really?

'What if I'm actually walking backward, and the direction of time is flowing in reverse?'

Let's conduct a thought experiment.

'What if we recorded someone walking forward on a video device, then played that video in reverse?'

The movement would look awkward.

'But the reason it looks awkward is because we're accustomed to our time. If time itself flowed in the opposite direction in that world...'

Rather, Shirone walking forward would seem awkward.

'I get it now.'

Shirone exhaled deeply.

'The reason time reverses.'

Because this world is composed of the combination of two signals—photons and quantum particles.

'That's exactly the pupils. The eye that looks from inside to outside, and the eye that looks from outside to inside. Depending on that perspective... the direction of time flips.'

'For example.'

Shirone thought of a marionette puppet.

'The puppet is connected by strings, and the control bar that manipulates those strings floats above its head. And the puppet has the will to believe it can move on its own.'

At least it's convinced of that.

'The control bar moved. The puppet raised its right arm. Now then...'

Here's the question.

'The puppet thinks the control bar moved because it raised its right arm.'

This is humanity's perspective on the world.

'To put it more intuitively... because I dug the ground, the ground should rightfully be dug.'

In other words, the puppet raising its arm is the cause, and the control bar moving is the result.

'Conversely, from the outside world's perspective...'

Moving the control bar is the cause, and the puppet raising its right arm is the result.

'It changes depending on your perspective. That is, cause and effect are completely reversed, so...'

The thought system also becomes opposite.

'And the sense of perceiving time is also reversed.'

Shirone felt a thrill.

'For God...'

Time flows backward.

'What Ikael said to me. Bedium's final words. That's what it was.'

The pieces were coming together.

'They say God is time. Then how does that God's thinking process work?'

What is a result to us is a cause to them.

'I marry because I love her. That's human thinking. But...'

God would say this:

'I marry. Because I will love her.'

That kind of reversal.

'I can use magic. Because I will learn magic. I became the world's greatest swordsman. Because I will work that hard. I went to prison. Because I will become a murderer.'

A reversal where the results that humans must achieve through countless acts of will are accomplished from the very beginning.

What is God?

'The end of all time.'

A result.

'God is a result to us.'

Expanding this thought, one could infer what the outside world in reality is.

'They know all history, the Omega. If we reverse the world from God's perspective...'

Civilization declines, life disappears, the universe shrinks, and finally reaches that point.

'There must be a moment when the beginning starts. And if we apply God's perspective there...'

Shirone bit his lip.

"There's another universe with negative time."

The outside world.

'The universe was born through some kind of amplification. But that universe wasn't one—'

'There were two.'

If there are two directions of time, it's reasonable that there should also be two universes.

'And that universe has reversed causality. Based on this inference...'

He was devastated by the terrible truth.

"The final point of the world we're living in now—that is, the result of this place becomes the beginning in the outside world."

Why is this dangerous?

'Humanity will someday conquer the universe.'

When humans reach the same position as the Creator—that is, when they master everything that exists—humans become God.

'Also, paradoxically, that God is positioned at the moment of the minus universe's birth.'

'What kind of God would that be?'

What do we ultimately become?

"Machines."

Like High Gear, the pinnacle of mechanical civilization without lifespan, aging, or disease.

'Programs.'

This could be inferred from what the administrators sent from the outside world said about moving according to their mission.

'Why do they need administrators?'

From here on it's just hypothesis, but strangely, their judgment made sense.

It must be because they see from God's perspective.

'There are two universes. The problem is that the outside world's universe knew everything from the beginning.'

Because it started as God.

'But in that world, God is heading toward extinction.'

It will become human, become biological, become matter, and eventually meet its end.

'Even God can't stop time. Because God is time itself. Then what choice would God make?'

"Control the results of the world we live in."

The multiverse.

"To absolutely prevent reaching the final result, they scattered this world into bubbles."

The entire universe's diagram formed in his mind.

'In the beginning was light.'

With that light at the center, the universe spreads in both directions, and plus and minus time race forward.

'One side has human causality. The other side has divine causality.'

At the coordinates where human causality applies, infinite universes bubble and swarm.

'That is, God manages this place. And as long as those bubbles don't disappear and are maintained...'

The God on the opposite side is eternal.

'Without being demoted to human, it extends endlessly. Ultimately controlling our causality.'

What grudge could God possibly have?

'Cold calculation. Just logical judgment. Anyway, God is... our final form.'

Shirone exhaled deeply.

"I found it, Gaold. Where God is."

But they cannot meet.

'To meet God, one must escape from reality to the outside world. Now I understand. Why we shouldn't approach the outside world. Why Argones activates.'

Because it's the act of killing God.

'Has Nane already met them? Probably. But the fact that he hasn't come means... Am I Nane who devoured Ankera's dream? Or am I Ankera who devoured Nane's dream?'

Shirone shook his head.

'Enough random thoughts. I can think about it when I get out. Let's return to the original world for now.'

Now he roughly understood the method.

'I can reverse it.'

If negative exists in time's directionality, then the mind can also become a signal that can be reversed.

'Using God's perspective, God's thinking.'

Reverse causality.

"Heuuuu!"

It was work that overturned the world's standards and human essence, but Shirone was Yahweh.

'I can do it. If it were impossible, I wouldn't have realized the reversal of thought in this place.'

He started with something very small.

'I exist.'

The countless thoughts that began from there started reversing as if time itself was turned backward.

"Uuuuu!"

It was such a major undertaking that Shirone's knowledge foundation, the 5-dimensional multi-cube, completely collapsed.

'I will return.'

To the place where the people I love are.

'I will go.'

As his mind gradually reversed, light slowly seeped into the indefinable space.

His head hurt as if it would split.

"Uaaaah!"

Darkness fell like fragments, and light suddenly burst through the gaps with rough force.

'Reversal of causality.'

Shirone recalled when he entered Taeguk while battling Giyorgi.

'Guffin's message.'
—They are watching you. Don't trust anything. Save yourself from the terrible truth.

'That's what it was.'

In the perfectly inverted 5-dimensional multi-cube, Shirone defined God's thinking like this:

Ouroboros.

"We won! We won!"

As Dr. Martin's machine crashed to the ground, users burst into cheers.

"This means no service termination, right? I almost lost all my parts."

"Are parts important? This is our hideout. What fun would there be in living without High Gear?"

While users from East and West countries chatted amicably, there were those who remained silent.

'Yahweh.'

They were the users who had shared hearts with Shirone in High Gear's world.

Operator looked up at the sky.

'Where did you go?'

Abnormal departure from High Gear's world wasn't unrelated to reality.

Fermi approached Uorin.

"The situation is quite serious. Even though I thought escaping would mean reality anyway, he's not waking up."

According to Hwangeumryun's subordinates' confirmation, Shirone was still trapped in sleep.

"He's fine."

Uorin's voice was trembling.

"He'll come back. That's the kind of person he is. He won't abandon this world under any circumstances."

"What if he doesn't come back?"

She had never thought about what she would do in a world without Shirone.

"I'd probably be angry."

Though her voice was calm, the little witch's face was completely distorted when she turned her head.

"I don't know what comes after that."

Making expressions with a machine's face meant the signal itself was distorted.

'Eve was originally Gaia.'

Though Ultima seemed to have disappeared for some reason, her current appearance was eeriness itself.

"L-look!"

Destroyer707 pointed at the sky.

Everyone looked up, and Operator's shoulders began trembling.

"Ah!"

The sky's scenery seemed to be sucked into a whirlpool, then a familiar machine revealed itself.

The result came first.

"Yahweh!"

As if gravity had collapsed, a hole opened in the sky and light shot up from the ground.

"Oh? He's back?"

The moment Fermi spoke, Uorin leaped out.

"Aaaaah!"

What was I trying to do?

'Right, I just need you to be here. It's okay if you don't love me. Just as long as you exist in this world.'

Compared to the despair she felt when Yahweh disappeared, the current situation was a blessing.

Shirone, who landed on the ground, was certain.

'I'm back.'

Even if it was no different from countless other illusions, his heart was definitely crying out that this was the place.

Uorin ran toward him.

"Here! Here!"

And just as she was about to throw herself at him, Operator ran from the side and embraced Shirone.

"You..."

Uorin's steps stopped, and the users also looked back at her with bewildered expressions.

"You idiot!"

Operator shouted angrily.

"Why are you so reckless? What's so important about someone like Dr. Martin! High Gear can just be rebuilt. But if something happens to you..."

There really would be nowhere to go.

Perhaps it was a fear like losing parents, so Shirone understood her.

"I'm sorry. But I came back like this."

Destroyer707's group and the users came running over.

"You were really the best. This Solar War was the greatest experience of my life! It's all thanks to you!"

"Want to stay in contact outside? Oh, you're human, right? I'll give you my address..."

Fermi placed his hand on Uorin's shoulder.

"Don't be too heartbroken. It's not romantic love. Though who knows about the future."

"Hmph, what do you take me for? Ten thousand years is nothing. You think my emotions would be shaken by one little kid like that?"

"Well, that's true."

It was a satisfactory result for Fermi too, and Shirone led the users over and spoke.

"Let's go back."

To the world where we live.
