[610] The Five Great Schools (3)

"Yeah, hello."

Nade returned the greeting.

Unlike before, there was no sense of him avoiding her, but somehow that seemed to push Sabina away even more.

"What happened?"

True to her nature, she asked directly, but Nade only gave a bitter smile.

He knew Sabina's feelings and wanted to be honest with her, but the wounds from doing so would surely become poison during the graduation exam.

"I hope you graduate."

Nade was sincere.

She was one of the few people who had accepted his true self as it was.

When Sabina realized Nade's consideration and turned away dejectedly, Pandora, who had been watching, stabbed with her words.

"Lucky you. Even in this situation, you have the luxury to worry about men."

Before the second half of the senior year began, she had visited the headquarters of Aloneth, a perfume manufacturing company, to learn the secret arts of fragrance mage Mael.

Like Fisho's insect magic, it wasn't a field advantageous for evaluations, but once she graduated, she would receive high scores for specialization, so her success was guaranteed.

"Don't get cocky because you're ranked higher. In society, air mages are a dime a dozen."

Azelio Pandora (Final Senior Year Ranking: 19th Place).

Major: Fragrance Magic, Aloneth School.

Special Notes: Mael's direct disciple.

The psychological boost from securing a place in Class Two thanks to Scramble Royale was significant.

Sabina approached her, remembering how she had bullied Pandora during their advanced class days.

"What, what is it?"

Contrary to Pandora's dismay, Sabina carefully reached out and straightened her crooked collar.

"Yeah, you work hard too. When we get into society, let's go shopping together."

When she first transferred to Alpheas Magic School, it had hurt her pride to have to compete with students from rural areas.

But after going through the fierce process of senior year for a year, her life at the Royal Magic School had long been erased.

'Now this is my alma mater.'

Pandora, watching Sabina walk away, said quietly.

"You make sure to pass too. You worked hard."

None of the senior students had been lazy.

'Hehe, she's not a bad kid.'

Sabina smiled with her eyes as she walked away, and the bell signaling 5 AM rang.

Head teacher Collie arrived at the assembly point, leading three giant carriages.

"We'll take the carriages to the Craes branch of the Magic Association. Mind your behavior even inside the carriages, and hurry up and board since we don't have much time."

The 30 students divided into groups of 10 and boarded the carriages.

Shirone, Iruki, and Nade got on the first carriage, and Dorothy was sitting at the far end opposite them.

"Ugh."

Shirone and Nade, who had briefly glanced at Iruki, quietly settled into their seats.

'Of all people, Dorothy...'

Though they hadn't heard the details, Iruki and Dorothy had definitely dated and broken up in exactly 13 minutes.

The reason was that there wasn't anything particularly compelling about it, and the brutally realistic Iruki and the fourth-dimensional Dorothy, who wanted something beyond reality, had reached a proper compromise with just a few words of conversation.

"Are you okay?"

Surprisingly, Iruki spoke first.

"Yeah. It was really hard, but I'm feeling a bit better now."

"I'm sorry if I hurt you. But what's important to us is the graduation exam."

"Right. I think I can overcome it. Don't get too hurt either and focus on the exam."

Nade was dumbfounded.

"...You guys are doing this on purpose, right?"

The 13-minute romance and breakup seemed absurd to him, but the parties involved seemed sincere as they looked in different directions.

Not only Iruki, but Dorothy wasn't ordinary either.

Taylor Dorothy (Final Senior Year Ranking: 13th Place).

Major: Joner's Manipulation School.

Special Notes: Utilizes mental sharing system Mimesis. Maximizes omnipotence through unique manipulation pattern input method.

If the atmosphere in the first carriage was awkward, the atmosphere in the third carriage was filled with killing intent that seemed ready to explode at any moment.

This was due to the nerve war between Fermi, who sat at the end reading a book, and Electric Monster Raikon, who sat at the opposite end.

After being betrayed by the upper ranks of Estas, Raikon had killed the child that Jolgah had tried to protect, and was pursued by Fermi until the upper ranks disappeared.

Though no major battle occurred because Fermi's injuries were serious at the time, in fact, even if they had clashed, Fermi would have been the one to die.

"Hey, Fermi."

Fermi turned his head.

"Do you know why I didn't kill you back then?"

Fermi raised the corner of his mouth as if intrigued.

"Because I can just kill you during the graduation exam anyway. You know, right? That no one needs to take responsibility for deaths that occur during the graduation exam."

They were on their way to the Magic Association to sign the papers for that.

"In other words, you're already a dead man. So how about you put down that book and pray instead? You don't have much life left anyway."

Gunjo Raikon (Final Senior Year Ranking: 3rd Place).

Major: Electric Magic, Lightning School.

Special Notes: Son of Gunjo Vedium, the strongest hitman of the Black Line. Masters the highest level movement technique, Spark Magic.

Fermi closed his book.

"Raikon, do you love me?"

"What, what are you talking about?"

Raikon's face twisted menacingly.

"Hatred and love have similarities. In that you throw all your emotions into them. So I became a little disgusted with hating you."

"..."

"So I thought about it. What's the greatest revenge I can take on someone I hate? It's erasing them. Not pretending to be indifferent, but really erasing them. Just as hatred and love are similar, revenge and forgiveness seem to have similarities too. So I..."

Fermi opened his book again and turned his gaze away.

"I don't care what you do."

"You bastard...!"

As Raikon jumped up, Hersy reached out to stop him.

"Hold back. That's psychological warfare too."

Was it really?

It was hard to believe, but because it was Fermi, confusion arose.

'I can't be swayed. If I get caught up in his words, it's over.'

That's what Hersy thought.

'The Gold Ring is disbanded and there's no more collusion. Now we need to focus our attack on Fermi.'

Becoming the next Fermi was Hersy's intention.

'From now on, I'll control the graduation exam.'

Meyer Hersy (Final Senior Year Ranking: 23rd Place).

Major: Sound Magic, Sonar School.

Special Notes: Superhuman hearing that can detect even the heartbeat sounds of living beings.

Leaving their respective circumstances behind, the three carriages arrived at the Craes branch of the Magic Association.

As they opened the doors and got out, the sky was brightening to a bluish color.

"Welcome. This way, please."

An association staff member who had been waiting guided Collie.

Moving in double file, they reached the 5th basement floor of the association, where Oscar was waiting in front of an iron door with a spatial movement magic circle.

"Before using the spatial movement magic circle, I'll explain the precautions."

Though he would soon become the son-in-law of the headquarters director, he couldn't be excused from the dawn shift duties that the association's low-ranking members handled.

"First, the coordinates we're moving to are a security zone 4 kilometers from the capital..."

Nade wasn't listening to Oscar's words.

Though their eyes had briefly met when they first encountered each other here, it was better for both of them not to show it.

'This must be awkward for him.'

Shirone looked at Nade with concern, but couldn't read any particular emotion from his expression.

"Well then, have a good trip."

When Oscar opened the iron door, a massive magic circle with a diameter of 100 meters was revealed.

Being a military facility, you could tell from the scale alone that astronomical amounts of money had been invested.

"Impressive. They could transport an entire company at once."

If Dante, an expert in information magic, said so, it must be true.

The light from the magic circle gradually brightened, and after about 5 minutes, they were engulfed in white light so bright that you couldn't see the face of the person right next to you.

"Don't move."

With Collie's final warning, the light flashed as if to explode, and all the senior students disappeared.

Torumia Royal Castle, Krata.

The royal castle, where hundreds of thousands of people resided, was a city in itself, and the armory located at the western outer gate was busy today as well with official and unofficial weapon manufacturing.

Liz, the armory's magical component manager, walked around the warehouse checking the parts specifications one by one.

The same routine as always.

But she no longer had the companion who had promised her a future.

"Manager. Manager."

A craftsman who had worked at the armory for 30 years called out to Liz.

"Yes? Oh, yes."

"What are you thinking about so deeply?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize..."

"No, I'm worried. Did something happen during your vacation?"

Liz confessed honestly.

"My fianc√© stood me up."

It was at a point where the wound was somewhat healing.

"Oh my... What a worthless bastard."

"Actually, he's not that bad of a person..."

"No, it's not about his character, but his eyes that are worthless. To kick away a beauty like Miss Liz. He'll regret it later."

Liz's mood improved a little at the craftsman's wit.

"Go inside and rest. No delivery companies will come today. I'll organize the warehouse."

"Oh my, why?"

"The plaza is blocked so transportation is stopped. Seems like the Magic Association is having some event. Something called the Five Great Schools parade ceremony."

The Five Great Schools.

Then Alpheas Magic School would be included too.

'Nade will be coming too.'

She hadn't felt good since that day when she had said harsh words and left.

No, actually, she had wanted to see him.

'What am I doing now... I'll just look like a strange woman.'

The craftsman stared at Liz, who was hesitating like a puppy that needed to pee.

He didn't know what was going on, but experience knew what words to say at this moment.

"Do what you want to do. I don't know the story, but."

"Pardon?"

"There are things you only learn at this age. Regretting after trying is much better than regretting without trying."

Strangely, those words resonated with Liz's heart.

Alog Central Plaza.

As the core institutions of Bashka were concentrated here, the scale of the plaza was enormous, and citizens and merchants were quite dissatisfied with all the 8-lane roads extending in all directions being blocked.

But the reason their complaints didn't get out of hand was because of the pride they held in their hearts about the magical power of the Kingdom of Torumia.

The 6-meter-high platform installed in the center of the plaza was carved from a single piece of artificial ivory, and it was so elaborate and beautiful that it seemed too precious to use for just a few hours and throw away.

As soldiers from the royal castle guard, a cooperating organization, controlled the citizens along the outer edge of the plaza, carriages that had departed from various parts of the kingdom began to arrive.

While the military band's drum line preparing for the parade ceremony heightened the tension with a fast beat, the chorus shouted.

"Oris Magic School!"

Three carriages stopped on Central Plaza's 6th road, and 30 senior students in black suits appeared.

"Kai Knight Magic School!"

"Bermin Magic School!"

As students gathered in front of the barricades one after another, Alpheas Magic School's carriage stopped on 3rd road.

"Alpheas Magic School!"

"We're here. Let's get out."

The students, who had been watching the countless crowds on the way, looked a bit nervous.

"Waaaaaaah!"

As soon as their feet touched the ground, the cheers of the people made their hearts race.

'This is really...'

The place where the core hub of the Kingdom of Torumia's magic is located.

The people's longing and reverent gazes that they couldn't feel at school seemed to penetrate their skin.

"Are they really all mages? They look so young?"

"They're kids who will become mages soon. Didn't they say only the most outstanding students in the kingdom were invited?"

The students gathered here today would eventually become mages and enter all fields - economy, society, military, politics, arts, science - to lead the Kingdom of Torumia.

'My heart... feels like it's going to burst.'

Mark thrilled at the gazes of people looking at future leaders.

For him, who had only associated with those who dreamed of becoming mages since childhood, this first taste of society's attention was enough to draw out a passion he didn't know he had.

'Clever, this association president.'

Collie nodded as he felt the atmosphere of the central plaza.

Rufist's plan was working perfectly - internally imprinting the association's image on the elites who would become future employees, and externally emphasizing what the most important institution in the Kingdom of Torumia was.
