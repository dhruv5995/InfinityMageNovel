[725] Face-off (2)

Seongeum and Sambo gazed upon the landscape where a massive crater spread out as if a meteor had crashed down.

"That place is..."

It was the very center of the Jessica Labyrinth.

"Something seems to have crashed there."

Mungyeong's voice was grave because the crater's scale was beyond imagination.

'Yet there's no sign of whatever crashed. What on earth fell here?'

Jix, the leader of Volcano, muttered.

"Ymir's molar."

Though Seongeum had forcibly made him serve as a guide after annihilating Volcano, this was his first time reaching the center as well.

However, there were stories passed down like legends.

"According to rumors, Jessica is said to be a region where Ymir's molar crashed long, long ago."

"A molar? You're saying a mere tooth created such a pit when it fell?"

The crater was a full 2 kilometers in diameter.

"Your Highness, according to ancient texts, Ymir was a giant who absorbed over ten thousand bodies. If a molar was extracted in that gigantic state, its mass would be considerable indeed."

Jix let out a hollow laugh.

"You're misunderstanding something."

Mungyeong turned with a displeased expression.

"Misunderstanding?"

"You know about Heaven, don't you? The Art of Saga is a technique that melts humans to create giants. And Ymir was an unprecedented giant who reached the 10th stage of the Art of Saga. Do you know what that means?"

Seongeum asked with an indifferent attitude.

"What does it mean?"

"The number of humans that go into the Art of Saga is roughly 8 to 10. Then 10 of those giants gather again to birth the next stage giant. By this calculation, the number of humans needed to reach the 10th stage of the Art of Saga is..."

Jix held up one finger.

"It reaches 10 billion people."

"10 billion..."

Mungyeong couldn't imagine Ymir in her mind.

"That is the King of Giants, Ymir. Setting aside how he integrated 10 billion minds, the number itself is absurd. Even if not in gigantic form, if such a being's molar crashed down, a pit of this magnitude could easily be created—that's my assessment."

Seongeum rested her chin in her hand, lost in thought.

"If that's the case... what kind of event could have extracted such a being's molar?"

"It's unknowable. Perhaps someone from before recorded history had a proper battle with Ymir."

Jix looked around the vast crater.

"As you know, giants are granted the right to depart for a new world the moment they surpass the 6th stage. The reason is they can manipulate telomere levels from that point."

Mungyeong recalled classified information from the Jincheon Space Nation.

"Fragmentation and gigantification."

"Right. 6th stage giants can create new entities from parts of their body. They can also transform into gigantic form by extremely depleting their telomeres. The average height of 6th stage giants is 80 meters, but when they activate gigantification, they approach 2 kilometers."

Having devoted his life to studying giants, his information was comparable to the Jincheon Space Nation's.

"What's peculiar is that from the 6th stage onward, average height actually decreases. We call this condensation. It's a phenomenon where power increases as size decreases. Volcano estimates that Ymir's condensed form would be only around 3 meters at most."

"A 3-meter giant made from 10 billion humans?"

"Probably the Ymir who battled here in the distant past wasn't as gigantic as one might think. Actually, I don't want to think about it. It makes you realize how small humans are."

As Mungyeong maintained silence, Seongeum raised her head.

'From that high place...'

In the real sky before the artificial sky was created, Ymir must have battled some being.

'The power of a single molar?'

In the midst of that, a molar was extracted and crashed here, and judging by the shockwave, everything would have been swept away.

In the place where civilization vanished, giants had built pyramids to honor Ymir.

"So it's a giant relic."

What remained in the ruins was only one thing—Ymir's molar.

"Yes, now that we've confirmed it, that's enough."

Jix's eyes became distant.

"Though I didn't achieve it personally, my comrades can now rest in peace."

It was a sight he had devoted his life to witness.

"Kill me. My role ends here."

The only reason he had come this far following Seongeum, who killed his comrades, was to complete Volcano's mission.

"It's too early to end the journey."

Seongeum stepped toward the crater.

"Ymir's molar. Shouldn't we confirm with our own eyes what it is?"

"Your Highness, but..."

Mungyeong, who had hurriedly approached, instinctively sensed Sambo's distance and quickly stopped.

"It's dangerous."

That was the essence of her feeling.

This was a place where not just a part of Ymir, but a real piece of Ymir's body remained.

"I'm concerned something strange might occur."

"This won't do, that won't do."

Seongeum clicked her tongue and looked back at Mungyeong.

"If you're afraid of a mere tooth, how will you take the Ivory Tower test? As I know it, one of the candidates has already been to Heaven."

Before leaving the Imperial City, an inspector from the Jincheon Space Nation had visited and said this:

"Your Majesty, one of the Ivory Tower candidates is acquainted with me, so I wish to offer advice. His name is Shirone."

"Advice is unnecessary. It's not children showing off talents. Isn't it a matter of fighting with lives on the line to produce results?"

"Of course. Your Majesty's upright character is known throughout the realm. However, that's precisely why I speak."

At this point, Seongeum became curious too.

"Is he strong, this Shirone?"

"He is strong."

The words came out without a moment's hesitation.

"Shirone is certainly strong. But it's not simply a matter of winning or losing. Your Majesty is also a heroine of the realm, so heaven will decide the battle's outcome. What I'm concerned about is..."

Anchal turned his head slightly and continued, recalling the Shirone he had observed at Alpheas Magic School.

"He is a human with completely different temperament from anyone Your Majesty has had to fight before."

"Completely different temperament?"

"Your Majesty's nature is to break rather than bend. And because you absolutely never break, that's what's magnificent. Truly a steel pine tree forged a thousand times. But this Shirone..."

Anchal's worry arose at this point.

"He will never try to break Your Majesty."

"..."

"No matter what strong wind blows, Your Majesty won't budge an inch. But a gentle breeze can melt even steel."

Seongeum slapped her knee.

"What are you talking about... Are you also seeing me as just a woman! Whatever kind of person Shirone is, I will never give my heart!"

"It's not because Your Majesty is a woman."

Anchal spoke with a serious expression.

"It's because you're human."

Seongeum's brow furrowed.

"No, perhaps it's because you're a living being."

"What on earth are you saying now..."

"Perhaps!"

Anchal firmly cut off her words.

"Simply because Your Majesty exists."

Seongeum corrected her expression and asked.

"Is he that vast?"

Anchal brought his forehead to his politely clasped hands.

"I have no way to measure his size."

"Hmm, Shirone, you said?"

"Your Majesty, the strongest candidate in this test is someone called Nane. But his strength is clearly visible strength. Your Majesty will never retreat. However..."

Anchal slowly raised his head.

"One cannot collide with what doesn't exist."

Seongeum's eyelids fluttered rapidly.

"Your Majesty, be wary of Shirone. Never let him enter Your Majesty's range."

"I understand what you mean."

Seongeum lifted her chin and said.

"But don't worry. No one in this world can enter within one step of me."

Emerging from her recollection, Seongeum resumed walking.

"The candidates competing with me are not easy opponents. If they risk their lives in competition, then I too have no risks to avoid."

Unable to break Seongeum's stubbornness, Mungyeong sighed and followed behind, while Jix also entered the crater with Sambo.

The pit, 2 kilometers in diameter, was several hundred meters deep and narrowed like a funnel.

'It's small. Only something truly small hitting with tremendous force could create such a pit.'

Jix's shoulders trembled as he witnessed Volcano's hypothesis proven true.

"Where exactly is Ymir's molar..."

As Seongeum muttered, the crater shook violently and earth from all four directions began being sucked downward.

"Don't come closer."

As Seongeum stopped the group, four massive statues rose from where the ground collapsed.

"Those are ancient weapons! Your Highness, it's dangerous!"

Jix stopped Mungyeong.

"Wait! Those are Yol! Trial gateways! If we approach, we'll also be caught by the law!"

Just as angelic law is called Hera, in Heaven, giant law is called Yol.

You who have reached this place.

The four statues that slowly rose finally left the ground and floated up to 10 meters high.

In poses curled like fetuses, they looked down at Seongeum with beast-like faces and long horns embedded in their foreheads.

Are you a being who crosses the universe?

The sound they made while trembling their iron bodies seemed to directly strike the heart.

"If you're asking whether I'm a giant, I'd say no. But if you're asking whether I can cross the universe..."

Seongeum covered her mouth with her sleeve and smirked.

"Why couldn't I do what you can do?"

...Prove Yol.

Powerful flashes shot from the long horns of the four statues and struck Seongeum.

"Your Highness!"

Unable to avoid the law's activation, Seongeum's body was enveloped in light, floated up, and emitted tremendous brilliance.

"Huh!"

An enormous shock rushed at Seongeum and hurled her consciousness to the far reaches of the universe.

'This place is...'

The planet she lived on was visible only for an instant, then the cosmic scenery of stars densely scattered in pitch-black darkness unfolded.

'I'm flying endlessly.'

In the inertia of consciousness moving at nearly light speed, Seongeum realized a fear of massive scale.

'Compared to the vast universe, humans too are merely dust.'

The distance was so vast she felt certain she could never return to her original world.

'And this is...'

Seongeum's body, wrapped in Yol's flash, stood vertically and her petal-like lips gently parted.

"My one step."

Ether Wave

Infinite Path.

From the far reaches of the universe where Seongeum was flung, space crumpled and rushed toward her true body.

"Your Highness..."

Having finally confirmed her one step, Mungyeong trembled with emotion and shed tears of admiration.

'Jin Seongeum's single step crosses the universe.'

Absolutely no one could approach her.

"Is it sufficient now?"

As Seongeum landed on the ground, the four statues that had been silent sank through the floor.

Simultaneously, something white quickly shot up from the center and fell before Seongeum.

Jix's eyes lit up as he shouted.

"Ymir's molar!"

Seongeum, who disliked others' body parts touching her, fixed the space and observed from a distance.

A single molar, small enough to believe it was human, glittered in the artificial sunlight.

'This is serious! The legend was true!'

Since a giant of Ymir's level could create new entities with even a single tooth, Mungyeong hastily drew her sword.

"What's this?"

When there was no reaction even after a long time, Jix offered his opinion.

"Ymir is the only being in Heaven's army who can choose his battlefield. Perhaps his will is preventing rebirth."

"Hmph, how disappointing."

Her pride hurt, Seongeum tossed the molar, which Jix hurriedly caught with both hands.

"Ra Enemy is not here. It's unfortunate, but it can't be helped. Let's move on to the next."

A strategy to explore all three labyrinths from the start was only possible for Jin Seongeum.

"Then where will you go?"

Andre was closer in terms of distance, but to Seongeum who could leap across stars, it was meaningless anyway.

Seongeum looked beyond the horizon and said.

"I'm going to meet Shirone."
