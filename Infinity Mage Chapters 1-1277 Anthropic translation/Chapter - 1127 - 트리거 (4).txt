Trigger (4)

"What's going on?"

Rufist and Flu, who had just left Yongrae's conference room, froze in front of the corridor window.

Beyond the horizon, a massive pyramid loomed hazily in the distance.

A structure so large that even with modern technology, it would take several years to build.

'Impossible.'

It made no sense that such a thing could be erected in an instant.

Sirone came running over.

"Mr. Rufist."

He was the one who had triggered the simultaneous event at Delta headquarters again after Ikael's group departed for the sun.

Some kind of agreement that Sirone wasn't aware of had taken place, but they didn't show it.

Flu asked.

"What is that thing?"

"It seems the Paras Kingdom has made a move. Most likely... it's a structure from an ancient civilization."

Rufist's expression grew serious.

"I know it was built through direct intervention from the outside world. But why now?"

"Ancient civilizations existed before human history. It's just speculation, but I think it's a passage connecting to the outside world. The world's system will change soon."

Sirone spoke about the angels' condition.

"The angels with hearts haven't changed. That means it won't immediately harm humans."

"That may be true, but the repercussions will be huge. Above all, the intensity will grow stronger over time."

A Delta administrator approached.

"An emergency holy meeting is beginning. Representatives from each nation are to gather quickly at headquarters."

Other nations also seemed to be in turmoil over the current situation.

'Kitra will come too.'

Rufist said.

"Let's go. Something will come up. It's better to listen first and then respond."

"Go ahead."

At the unexpected statement, Rufist turned his head, but Sirone kept his mouth shut.

'Wizard.'

By now, things should have been settled one way or another, but it was strange how quiet everything was.

"I have somewhere to stop by briefly."

As Sirone ran down the corridor, Rufist and Flu looked at each other's faces.

"He hasn't noticed, has he?"

"No."

It would only be a matter of time anyway.

At the place where she had fought Habitz, Wizard had been lost in thought for a long time.

When even her tears had dried up, she slowly raised both hands and grabbed her throat.

"As expected."

Dying was the right thing to do.

With her already broken spirit, how could she possibly face Habitz again?

As strength entered her grip and oxygen was cut off from her brain, the scenery began to sparkle.

Her face flushed red, but her expression didn't change.

'I'm not afraid of dying.'

What she truly feared was Sirone's face looking down pitifully at her corpse.

'I'm sorry, brother.'

As consciousness faded and death approached, her heart gradually felt lighter.

It must be because she had been carrying so much.

"Huk. Huk."

Tears flowed down.

'I'm going to die.'

Rather than living while disappointing Sirone, it was better to become a corpse and meet him that way.

'Just a little more.'

As her mind convulsed in shock and she could no longer even feel pain...

"Uaaaang."

Wizard ultimately released her hands.

Promise me just one thing.

Sirone had said.

Do whatever you want. If you think that way, I'll support you. However...

You must never think it's impossible.

"I'm sorry. Sorry..."

She had to fight.

The fate given to her, her genius talent, existed solely for that purpose.

Grabbing her trembling legs, Wizard stood up.

'I'll kill Habitz.'

Now she couldn't look at it indifferently, but she understood Habitz that much more.

'I just can't kill him.'

And that was precisely the method Gustav's 4th generation was using to target Habitz.

"Habitz can't be killed."

Balkan said.

"The event of killing Habitz doesn't occur. Therefore, in order to kill Habitz..."

Zetaro said.

"We must not kill him."

"Right. It's contradictory, but as long as we like Habitz, we can still approach him."

Natasha asked.

"What about Vanishing?"

"It's certainly difficult to expect purity from us. But that's something you say because you don't know Habitz well."

Smodo said.

"There's no way to stop Vanishing, but if we can prevent it from activating, that's what you want to say?"

That was also contradictory, but.

"I first realized it when he married Abella. On their wedding night, she tied Habitz tightly to the bed."

Zetaro also recalled that time.

"We noticed the assassination plan late and went to Habitz's room. It was close."

"No, it was already too late. If Abella had stabbed him with 'Legal Kill', Habitz would have died. But then Habitz..."

Told Balkan to leave.

"Everything is just a joke. Regarding death that approaches with goodwill, Habitz seems to almost look forward to it. Even his own death would be interesting to him."

Smodo said.

"It's easy to say, but actually difficult to do. A mental state that can maintain such contradiction isn't human."

"Or it's sincere."

Balkan turned his head.

"You."

The three people's gazes turned to Zetaro.

Habitz strolled through the forest, muttering.

"How chewy."

Having committed all the evil acts in the world, there was one thing he had never experienced.

'Dying.'

Ten shadows appeared at his feet, and Shiok revealed itself again.

"Satan, did you call?"

Though he still thought Wizard should be killed, a fanatic couldn't harbor complaints against their god.

"Two are missing. We've lost teeth."

"I apologize."

Currently, the 4th and 12th positions were dead.

But that was only from a human perspective; from a god's perspective, concepts don't disappear.

"Select them quickly."

Pressing wouldn't help, but Habitz wanted to play properly.

"Understood."

Shiok.

Twelve positions that could uniquely travel between reality and hell while the spiritual realm was closed.

In a deep cave of the hidden world.

Etela lay facing the darkness, fallen into sleep as if dead.

She had asked for purification time countless times.

87 trillion years, 2,875 quintillion...

The moment she heard the seventh longest time since the hidden world's existence, she collapsed.

'I wish I had died instead.'

Even while sleeping, she desperately wished.

If she could close her eyes like this and forget herself, she wanted never to wake up again.

"Huh..."

Tired even of sleep, clear tears flowed when she realized reality.

Shagal, connected by the Taiji chains, leaned against the cave wall, lost in thought.

There was more than enough time.

'Team leader.'

Raiden, the circus troupe leader.

He had killed Tia, the only one he loved, and Shagal had plunged a dagger into Raiden's body.

'All lies?'

The Grass Leaf Circus had never existed in the world.

'No, is that really so?'

Having fallen to hell and ended up in this state, a thought suddenly occurred to him.

'Then what's real?'

Do people other than himself live carrying the real thing in their memories?

His gaze turned toward Etela.

'Tia.'

Though he couldn't see her face as she lay turned away, to Shagal she was definitely Tia.

'Because I think so.'

In truth, he didn't know Tia's face or who she was.

"Tia."

At Shagal's voice, Etela's shoulders flinched, but there was no further movement.

The chains scraped the floor coldly as he crawled like a beast and climbed on top of Etela.

The same act every day, the same routine.

The Taiji chains made them feel each other's emotions as their own in a chilling way.

Shame, resentment, pleasure and anger mixed together, ultimately making them understand nothing.

A whirlpool of yin and yang.

Lian asked.

"Pamagwangcheonseong?"

"Yeah. I'm thinking of attacking the demon world through sacred sound. It's theoretically possible, but I don't know how effective it will be."

"That's harsh."

Jin-gang's resolve.

"Even if successful, sacred sound won't become free. Even if the body disappears, the soul remains. Jin-gang knows this fact but still wants revenge."

With a bitter expression, Lian, who had been lost in thought, looked back at Sirone.

"You won't just leave it alone, right? Now I'm here. If I purify the karma of sacred sound with Gehenna's fire..."

"Even so, we can't bring him to reality. The only way is to use Shiok."

Twelve fanatics who create gaps in time.

"The number 12 in law means cognition. Humans accept the whole by dividing it into 12 pieces. 12 hours, 12 constellations, 12 apostles, and Shiok. None of it would be coincidence. Even if Shiok dies, that concept will be replaced by someone."

"So you're saying to put Jin-seongeum in that Shiok position. But... where do we need to go to meet him?"

Lichera, the murderer's face hanging from Son Yu-jeong's waist, showed interest.

"He's probably at the Hwagongsa System Control Branch."

Everyone's gaze turned there.

"System Control Branch?"

"Ah, I've heard about it. Living beings who fall to hell alive are taken by Heukseung. But exceptionally, elites selected by Satan go there."

"Elites."

Sirone stroked his chin.

"Those who succumbed to Satan's temptation. Then Mortasinger would be there too."

10th in the Council of Ten, and also the reason Son Yu-jeong had followed Ikael down to the human world.

"Mortasinger?"

Son Yu-jeong grabbed Lichera's hair and lifted him up.

"Where is he now?"

"Well, even if you ask where he is..."

"Answer quickly!"

Grabbing the chains and spinning rapidly, Lichera's saliva shot out in a ring formation.

"Uaaa! I don't know either! Only that he's in the west of hell! And even that's not certain!"

Sirone said.

"Stop."

"You idiot! What do you know?"

When Son Yu-jeong didn't listen, Sirone spoke with sincerity in his voice again.

"I said stop."

The Gingoa around her neck tightened, and Son Yu-jeong's eyes widened.

"Huaaaaa!"

In that state, she fell to her knees and looked at Sirone with the world's most pitiful expression.

"Huh?"

Only after regaining her senses did she feel the aura and also cast her gaze toward the distant mountains.

Sirone's expression became serious.

"Lian."

"Yeah, what is that thing?"

From a cave in the mountains, an indescribable strange energy was shimmering like a mirage.

"Hiya~~~~~~"

As if nothing had happened, Son Yu-jeong pursed her lips and stood up, and Sirone gave instructions.

"Let's go check it out."

Using spatial movement to land in front of the cave, groaning sounds could be heard from within the darkness.

A man and a woman.

'Shining.'

Floating a sphere of light in his palm and advancing about 30 meters, he could see blurry silhouettes.

A familiar face.

"Teacher Etela?"

Since Etela wouldn't be crying if it were a beautiful relationship, Lian grasped the situation.

"This piece of trash..."

Immediately drawing his great sword and kicking off the ground, Shagal turned his head.

Pulling his body away like a beast and raising both arms instinctively, rapid sword strikes poured down.

Son Yu-jeong gaped in bewilderment.

'Wow, what killing intent...'

Dozens of daggers flew simultaneously, but Lian didn't retreat.

"Huuuup!"

Deflecting the daggers with a single swing, he pressed forward using the broad side of his great sword as a shield.

"Huh?"

At that moment, Sirone noticed the chains connecting Etela and Shagal.

"Lian! Wait..."

Before he could finish speaking, Lian pressed Shagal against the wall with the power of divine transcendence.

"Kkeulleok!"

Unable to withstand the pressure, Shagal spewed a bowlful of blood from his mouth.

And simultaneously, Etela, who had been covering her body, retched and spat blood in exactly the same way.

Lian, belatedly realizing this fact, stepped back from Shagal, who was glaring like a beast.

"What? Why is she..."

Sirone muttered with a somber expression.

"Taiji chains."

They were entangled in the worst possible way.
