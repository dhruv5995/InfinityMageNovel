[634] What's Truly Important (4)

From the Light Angel avatar overlapping at a single coordinate, 300 flashes of light spread out like a web.

To human eyes, it was clearly simultaneous, but in reality, it was mixed with infinitesimal margins of error.

299 avatars excluding Shirone, who had deployed Force Dimension, threw their spears at different points in time, and Nade, who had cast Spark magic, repeated birth and extinction between the torrential flashes.

While 87 spears stuck in the ground sequentially lost their light, 93 spears were still descending from the sky, and the Light Angel was wielding spears of light in infinitely segmented time.

85, 73, 49...

The eyelids of those who had blinked just after the Angel's Punishment began its bombardment hadn't even closed one-tenth of the way yet.

In the vast gap between spears that had just reached the ground and spears still gripped in the Light Angel's hands, Nade realized in the realm of pure signals.

That with each repetition of Angel's Punishment, the Light Angel's temporal energy was extremely narrowing the possibility of evasion.

3, 2, 1.

At the same moment Nade avoided the last 299th spear, his possibilities were bound to Movement Zero.

Shirone's Light Angel, having released Force Dimension, drove the 300th spear down to earth.

Of course, Nade was still standing at the center of vast space.

But that was already just the terminus of events reached after passing through every point.

And the spear of light pierced through.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

Pierced by one of the 300 spears that seemed scattered in all directions, Nade straightened his upper body and screamed.

The audience couldn't even guess at the battle between time and electricity that unfolded in that instant ocean of eternity, merely marveling at the massive spectacle of light.

"Direct hit!"

As the flash that pierced through Nade's body disappeared, all remaining participants concentrated their firepower.

"Take him down!"

Richard's magic stone spewed flames at maximum output, and Iruki's Nuclear Fusion caused a massive explosion.

Frings's ice wave swept through, followed by Amy's Inferno falling in a parabolic arc.

It was firepower worthy of the graduation exam's final act, but the percentage of Nade's numbers floating on the analysts' retinas was falling so slowly it was hard to confirm without close inspection.

"It's useless. Anti-magic can't even make a dent."

"The 2000 System being too excellent is also problematic."

Baical thought that in cases like this, it might have been better if the system had gone down instead.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

Plasma spread around Nade, then scratch-like white light expanded outward.

"Crazy bastard!"

The remaining six scattered in all directions with Nade at the center.

Pop! The air burned as Nade appeared in front of Frings.

'I have to dodge...!'

His body moved faster than thought.

'...it!'

Nade's fingertips grazed past his skin.

Druz Frings. Final graduation rank 7th confirmed. Remaining participants: 6.

'Death just from a graze?'

From the final 10 onward, the feeling was completely different with each rank difference, so the key was to last as long as possible.

"That's a clear standard."

Elizabeth asked.

"A standard for final rankings?"

"No. Too luxurious a standard to use just for ranking."

"Then?"

"We're not determining the kingdom's number one."

Baical felt the thrill of a scout.

"We're determining number one throughout the kingdom's entire history."

In perfect chaos, the scouts' attention focused on who could last how long against Nade, who was close to a force of nature.

'I can dodge! I can fight more!'

Richard, spouting flames from his left leg, flew up into the sky and looked down at Nade.

His neural circuits predicted movement patterns and his freezing magic stone fired sharp ice bullets in rapid succession, just as Nade disappeared.

Warning! Frame departure!

Disappearing faster than lenses capable of capturing 120 frames per second could catch, Richard gritted his teeth and activated his left foot's propulsion.

"Damn!"

Nade's fingertips appearing in the sky narrowly missed Richard, but he hadn't really dodged by seeing it anyway.

"Hup!"

Before they knew it, Nade was attacking Amy, and the next moment appeared before Iruki, Dante, and Shirone.

"Is nature fair?"

Without any calculation, only the will to annihilate enemies caught in the electric field remained.

'At this rate, we're done for!'

Dante, activating Pascal, converted all three-dimensional cubic surfaces into spatial movement magic circles.

'Monster!'

As Nade charging at Dante entered the spatial movement magic circle, thick bundles of electricity occupied all movement coordinates and blazed with light.

"Grrrr!"

As Dante gritted his teeth at the information overload that threatened to break Pascal, Nade escaped the magic circle and rushed toward Amy.

'Triple meditation evolution!'

As consciousness pierced through meditation again, sensitivity that could count even the number of fine hairs enveloped her entire body, making the world as clear as if her skin had been peeled away.

"Ugh!"

Lightning grazed dangerously past her nose tip, and immediately Nade disappeared.

'Don't come to me!'

While everyone was thinking the same thing, Nade rushed toward Shirone.

'Shirone's elimination...!'

As he activated Shirone's Buddha Image Explosion and raised his upper body, Nade circled around to target Richard.

'No way! Damn it!'

Warning! Frame departure!

While Richard retreated with jet power, Nade's face suddenly approached right before his eyes.

'Huh? I'm flying at tremendous speed right now?'

Why was Nade still in front of him?

A fist was captured in the last frame of the 120 frames per second.

The next moment, the entire world spun as Richard's mechanical devices shut down.

Ainka Richard. Final graduation rank 6th confirmed. Remaining participants: 5.

Making it to the final 5 felt completely different from making it to the final 10.

'From now on, it's the upper ranks.'

The four people facing Nade engaged in ranking battles even while dodging transcendent lightning.

'Is it my turn this time?'

As Nade passed by Shirone and charged at him, electricity sparked in Iruki's eyes.

'Overdrive!'

The servant's brain was analyzing all of Nade's possibilities, but it was still barely enough time to keep up.

"Ugh!"

Nade passed by Iruki, who had hastily thrown his body aside, in a claw-swinging posture.

'Damn! I can't last long like this?'

Then Nade stopped by stepping on the ground and charged at Iruki again.

'Why am I the only one getting targeted twice!'

It was so unfair that he thought he'd definitely have to settle this score after the exam ended.

"Ah, seriously!"

Nade's blindingly intense lightning passed over Iruki's face as he flopped down.

'I'll deal with you later.'

As Iruki hastily raised his upper body, he saw Dante's hundred serial magic circles aimed at him.

"Nade isn't the only enemy."

"Son of a bitch..."

Iruki inserted Spirit Zone into Dante's Pascal and attempted cancellation, but there was still an ironclad encryption.

'I can't make it in time!'

As flames were mounted in front of the hundred circles, Albino said.

"Don't think."

Just as the amplified flames passing through the magic circle tunnel were about to pass through the muzzle.

"What?"

Cancellation dismantled Pascal.

"You're not a machine, Iruki."

100 percent was the safest number in the world, but not the most efficient.

"The probability humans need to do something is sufficient at just 50 percent. Believe not in probability, but in yourself, in the life given to you."

It wasn't a lucky hit or perfect calculation.

He simply made his move at the point when he thought he was ready within some probability of probabilities, and at that point, Iruki's future also began to break through existing limits and expand into infinite possibilities.

'Intuition? That doesn't suit me...'

While Dante was flustered by the unexpected situation, Amy leaped up and swung Ifrit's fist.

"Nade and Iruki aren't the only enemies."

"Phew."

Looking at Amy, Dante blew his hair with his mouth.

Since his omniscience had already been seen through, magic itself was impossible, and as flames struck him hard, the 2000 bracelet lit up.

Airhain Dante. Final graduation rank 5th confirmed. Remaining participants: 4.

'Yes! Almost there!'

The eyes of Amy, Iruki, and Shirone became more intense than before.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

Though the reduced numbers meant more frequent encounters with Nade, as the abilities of Triple Meditation Evolution, Overdrive, and Buddha Image Explosion were fully utilized, the chaotic battlefield finally began to form a new system.

'We're really crazy! We're this fast but nobody's getting eliminated!'

As Triple Meditation Evolution continued, Amy felt pain like thousands of needles piercing her body, but that pain was the most powerful weapon for survival.

Frustrated, Nade targeted Iruki this time, but Overdrive enhanced with intuition was showing far superior efficiency than before.

'I'm anxious.'

Since it wasn't 100 percent probability, he could fall into an abyss the next moment.

'But I feel amazing!'

For the first time, he felt truly alive, and as explosive equations calculated at tremendous speed, he pummeled Nade's body.

'You need to get hit.'

Though it misfired several times, once the Atomic Bomb exploded, its power was incomparable to before.

Then Fire Strike and Photon Cannon flew simultaneously from left and right.

"Nade's mana level is currently 1.21 billion Magicles. They've brought it down tremendously."

"But it's still meaningless."

Literally, Nade was an impregnable fortress, and after 20 minutes passed, the three's fatigue reached its limit.

'That Buddha Image Explosion is really annoying.'

While Shirone maintained stable evasion, the graduation exam shifted to a survival structure between Amy and Iruki.

'Just need to hold out a little longer.'

Since Iruki wasn't at 100 percent either, the longer it dragged on, the more advantageous it was for Amy.

'But...'

She felt her agility declining as she began adapting to the sensations of Triple Meditation Evolution.

'I can't end it like this.'

A thirsty person digs a well, and Amy attempted her final method.

'I just need to eliminate Nade!'

Elizabeth focused on Amy, who destroyed her position and charged forward.

"She's making her move."

"Good judgment. I think if not now, there won't be another chance."

Facing Nade, who approached like a ghost while continuously casting Spark magic, Amy clenched both fists tight.

No matter how amazing the magic, since the body casting that magic was ultimately human, schema was powerful.

'The moment he attacks me is my chance!'

Even so, to strike Nade who avoided the instant he made contact required capturing a moment of counter-counter-counter timing.

'Self-image memory!'

As Nade approached Amy closely and swung his claws.

"Ugh!"

Amy's red eyes flashed at maximum speed as she twisted her waist and swung her fist.

'Facing forward without retreat. Finding life beyond death?'

As Baical held his breath and watched.

'This ends it, you bastard!'

Amy's fist struck Nade's jaw precisely.
