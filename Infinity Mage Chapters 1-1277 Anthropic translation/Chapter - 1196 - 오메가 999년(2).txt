Omega Year 999 (2)

Underground facilities of the Holy Temple.

Walking while listening to the unsettling noise from the engine room, Uorin was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

'I can't see it.'

The vibrations of the timeline were too intense and fast - she could no longer establish any reference point.

'Where should I go?'

Shirone was using Elikia to suppress Havitz's assassination game, but variables remained.

'If he could keep using it, he would have continued. That means there's a delay in the ability to break Vanishing.'

Probably once per hour.

Most importantly, with Shirone simultaneously handling multiple events, it was impossible for him to only keep Havitz in check.

'If someone elsewhere faces a crisis, Shirone will use this ability.'

Because he was Yahweh.

In this situation, if other nations had to target someone, it would undoubtedly be the Empress of Kashan.

'Every kingdom is after me.'

Why wouldn't they be?

The Windstorm was annihilated and even Gando was dead.

Throughout Kashan's history, had the Empress ever been in such a defenseless state?

'Is this my end?'

At the dizzying thought, Uorin pressed her hand against the wall.

"Huff. Huff."

Her chest felt tight like she had indigestion, and with blood not circulating properly, severe dizziness struck.

Kido supported her.

"Are you okay? I'll carry you on my back. You should rest."

"Haha."

Laughter burst out.

"Isn't this truly absurd? All that remains for the Empress of Kashan is a single pet goblin."

Kido didn't get angry.

"Let's escape from the Holy Temple. While the guards protect your decoy, we need to flee. If they discover the Empress above ground is fake, we won't be able to get out then."

"No."

"Why are you being so stubborn? You're smart. Kashan or whatever - you need to survive for there to be a future."

"Still, no."

Uorin gritted her teeth.

"I can give up the empire anytime. But I must remain Kashan's Empress until the end."

"Why?"

"Because otherwise, I'll become nothing to Shirone."

Kido closed his mouth.

"Without voice in the Holy Temple, without powerful military force, without the Empress's authority, what am I? Just a woman. An ordinary woman who can't fight like Amy."

Uorin grabbed Kido's shoulder.

"Do you know how long I've waited for Shirone? You wouldn't understand. Since before humanity even began... I've been waiting for Shirone! So why! Why should I give up!"

"Alright. Calm down."

"I'll never give up! There must be some way. If I just hold on a little longer, just a little more..."

She who longed only for passionate love had become merely a primitive being on Gaia.

But...

'I can't fight.'

Even adopting only the best genes throughout history, becoming Amy was impossible.

Not Shirone, not Lian, not Kuan, not Gaold, not Miro... none of the strong ones.

'It was impossible.'

Because something beyond life itself was needed, something unreachable through traits alone.

"I'll protect it."

That was the nature of the defeat she felt toward Amy.

"I can't lose even Kashan."

"Yeah, I understand."

Kido gripped his double-edged spear in one hand and moved forward while supporting Uorin.

"Let's try it. Where should we go?"

Just as Uorin was about to activate her future sight again, thick smoke began to spread.

"What?"

Before they knew it, an old Oriental-style door stood there, opening with an eerie sound.

"Ghost Gate."

Jincheon's Director Anchal revealed himself.

"Future sight doesn't work on me, who deals with illusions. This is the end, Empress of Kashan."

The magic eye embedded in his uncovered eye glowed with a clear blue light.

Uorin clenched her fists.

'Damn it.'

Breaking through the surface guards and discovering the decoy was fake - that alone proved he was first-rate.

"Found you, Empress."

Natasha hung from the pipe lines, and below in the darkness, a masked swordsman approached.

It was Lai, Tormia's Guard Captain.

'Three of them, no less.'

Anchal spoke.

"You used your head well, but you're not the only one with brains. Give up. Kashan is finished."

Kido didn't let Uorin answer.

"Hmph, you think she'd even blink at trash like you targeting her? Get lost if you don't want to die."

Of course, he knew the enemy's strength.

'There's hope. Thirteen minutes remain until Havitz's assassination game. If we can just hold out until then...'

Anchal asked.

"Who wants to go first?"

When Natasha and Lai didn't respond, she nodded and kicked off the ground.

'Whoever catches her gets the prize.'

The moment combat began, shockwaves exploded everywhere except around Uorin.

"Wind Orchid."

As the magic eye glowed, hundreds of blades flew toward Kido from thin air.

"Kruuuh!"

It had less penetrating power than Avatar techniques but nearly infinite applications.

'Really troublesome.'

Anchal of the mind, Natasha of speed, Lai of technique.

'Ten more minutes.'

Small wounds accumulated on Kido's body as he simultaneously received attacks from all three.

'This is a goblin's level?'

Anchal was amazed.

'No, he's already transcended species limitations. This is something that's neither human nor goblin.'

Fire lit up in Kido's eyes.

'Immovable Mind.'

He destroyed illusions with Buddhist enlightenment and bound Natasha's speed with earthbound spirits.

Lai infiltrated from behind.

'I'll take him.'

Kido deflected the attack to the side, then opened his eyes wide and spun while swinging his spear.

'Dominion of Origin.'

Cutting between atoms - the ultimate strike that could sever all matter.

"Kuk!"

The assassins who had distanced themselves saw electricity flowing through the air like snakes.

'We would have died if we'd blocked that unknowingly.'

Kido, breathing heavily, stood before Uorin.

'Two more minutes.'

Anchal approached.

"Grotesque. No, should I say disgusting?"

"A taste of the Great Purification - you are not truth. You're a monster mixed with all kinds of enlightenment."

Her gaze fixed on Uorin.

"Does the Empress of Kashan have no sense of morality? What exactly did you feed this beast?"

'Everything except my own flesh.'

Everything her power could procure had gone into forming Kido's body.

"So what? What business is it of yours what I feed my dog? Should I feed you to him too?"

Anchal's magic eye flashed.

"No shame whatsoever."

Smoke rose from all directions and Natasha and Lai finished preparing to move, when...

Elikia's light enveloped the Holy Temple.

'What about Havitz?'

Having experienced this before, they weren't particularly surprised and first checked Satan's location.

'...I see.'

As Anchal stepped back, the Ghost Gate opened.

"Leave the Holy Temple immediately, Empress. This may be your last chance."

The Ghost Gate disappeared like a dream, and Natasha and Lai melted into the darkness.

Kido knelt down.

"Whew, we should be fine for a while."

Since Havitz's location was revealed, killing Uorin would violate international law.

"Don't let your guard down. They'll be back soon."

"Of course you're elimination priority number one. But the side that eliminates you gets disqualified from leadership. They can't move carelessly."

As long as Elikia existed.

'The worst situation would be multiple deaths when Elikia isn't activated.'

In that case, since they wouldn't know who Havitz killed, they couldn't identify the culprit.

'Thank you, Shirone.'

Though it probably wasn't a choice made for Uorin's sake.

"Let's go. Keep future sight active even if it's difficult. We can't let Anchal track us like this time."

"Right."

Walking through the engine room, Kido looked up at the ceiling.

'Another death.'

Rest in peace.

Ten minutes before Elikia's activation.

Zetaro was walking toward the Gustav sector with drooping shoulders.

'Smodo went home first.'

Why Smodo?

'Because he wanted to play with me more? No, was I never on his mind from the beginning? Why exactly...?'

The truth was unknowable.

'It'll start again soon. Thinking about Havitz means it's before Vanishing activates. Who will be the next target? Maybe this time he'll finally choose me...'

Zetaro's steps stopped.

Havitz, with split lips, was walking from the other end of the corridor while muttering to himself.

"Tch, got hit once. So that's the strategy you'll use? Fine, then I'll..."

At that moment, their gazes collided.

While Zetaro's heart pounded as if it would burst, Havitz paid no attention whatsoever.

"Mm, that's right. It'll be really interesting. The charm of this game is that you can lose."

From his manner of passing by as if seeing him for the first time, Zetaro realized.

'I'm no longer fun to him.'

It was a declaration of severed ties.

"Has an hour passed already?"

Dismissing thoughts of Wizard, Havitz ran down the corridor in Vanishing state.

'Let me finish this quickly.'

It was the Corona sector's royal office.

"The demons' power has grown too strong. At this rate, the Ivory Tower will be destroyed. We need to act quickly..."

Even though he opened the door roughly, the officials inside were absorbed in their meeting.

People playing card games, Armin, and the stars of the Ivory Tower were all gathered together.

Havitz snorted.

"Who should I kill?"

Having been caught by Elikia twice, Havitz chose the strategy of coming early and waiting.

"You."

He held a blade to King Woodlai's neck while waiting for the time to come, watching the meeting.

'4 seconds. 3 seconds. 2 seconds...'

At that moment, Woodlai's eyes suddenly widened and he kicked his chair, launching his body.

"Your Majesty!"

A red orb that popped out of his pocket split in two and rolled across the floor.

⟨The Yeager Family's Final Cry⟩.

An object of which few remained, so rare that no amount of money could buy it.

"These guys really..."

Just as Havitz raised his glaring eyes and charged forward, Elikia's light spread brilliantly.

'Havitz!'

The stars of the Ivory Tower, realizing at speeds beyond normal parameters, all turned simultaneously.

"Kill him!"

Before Elikia disappeared.

As Armin cast stop magic, Siok rotated upward and destroyed time.

'Perfect Form.'

Amid the ultra-high-speed battle, Havitz looked back at King Woodlai.

Guards were already protecting him.

He would lose the game.

Faced with an unprecedented event in Satan's history, Havitz charged forward having lost his reason.

"Block him!"

The stars blocked Woodlai, but what Havitz aimed for was the maid lying prostrate.

"Gasp!"

As the blade pierced the maid's neck, not only the stars but even Siok stopped fighting.

'This... is not play.'

A murder committed to avoid losing the game was proof that Satan was being cornered.

The stars were enraged by the meaningless sacrifice.

"Even third-raters wouldn't do such a thing...!"

"So what?"

Havitz said, pulling his blade from the maid's neck.

"Not a bad result, right? If I lose this game, from then on I'll commit massacres."

Indeed, that was true.

'Havitz proposed the game. There's no penalty for defeat. But why is he so obsessed with this game?'

Vanishing activated again.

"Shall I prove it now?"

Even having lost Havitz, the stars maintained Spirit Zone with unprecedented mental strength.

'Damn! I missed something. Focus, focus.'

"Hmph."

Contrary to his threat, Havitz moved toward the door with a sneer.

'I can't end the game.'

At least until midnight when the 'Truth and Lies' game concluded, he had to maintain the rules.

"Stay scared for a while."

The moment Havitz looked back at the stars and opened the door, an impact struck his side.

"Kueok!"

Pushed back several meters, he clutched his stomach and raised his pained face.

"Kruuuh!"

The stars who had regained their senses opened their eyes wide.

"Who are you?"

"Sorry. Just for a moment..."

Wizard, who had entered through the crack in the door, said indifferently.

"I'm in the middle of hide-and-seek."
