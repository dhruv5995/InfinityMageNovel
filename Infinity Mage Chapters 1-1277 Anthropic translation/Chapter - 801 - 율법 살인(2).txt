Legal Murder (2)

Gustav's imperial capital, Marsak, was bustling with women who had come to become servants of the empire.

'How could this be...'

Despite Habitz's infamy spreading throughout the world, over 300 people had applied.

"Do you know what kind of person His Imperial Majesty is?"

She asked a sharp-chinned, cold-looking woman waiting in the left line.

"Hmph, you're the same as me. I'd prefer if we kept our words to ourselves. We're competitors from now on."

'Not me though...'

Unlike the other candidates, Abella was someone who had come to kill Habitz.

"Is it for the money?"

The woman turned back coldly.

"What else would it be? Regardless of background, not to mention the pay, the employee benefits are excellent too. Most importantly, you become a servant of the imperial palace."

A commoner's worth was determined by nobles, and being a servant of the imperial palace was a position that even nobles wouldn't look down upon.

"But he's a tyrant, isn't he?"

Everyone turned to look at Abella, and the atmosphere at the scene froze like the Arctic.

"Hey, what did you just say?"

The guard captain leading the servants approached with large strides, his eyes filled with murderous intent.

'It's okay. I'll be okay.'

The part Abella needed to be most careful about in the project was loving Habitz.

If she lost her original value as an alphafish, the law would be twisted, and then everything would be over.

"Repeat what you just said. You'd better pray to God that my ears are playing tricks on me."

"Uncle Habitz is a tyrant."

At her reply that showed no reverence for the emperor, the guard captain drew his sword.

"If you kill me, you'll die too."

The blade stopped abruptly near Abella's neck.

"What do you mean by that?"

"I didn't come here to serve the emperor. I came to meet Uncle Habitz personally."

"You... know His Imperial Majesty?"

"If you're suspicious, just report it to your superiors. Tell Uncle Habitz that Abella has come."

He didn't have the courage to do such a thing.

'This is troublesome.'

Moreover, if by any chance her words were true, he absolutely must not commit any rudeness.

'Let's leave it to someone else. Getting involved will only lead to death.'

The guard captain sheathed his sword and returned to his position, muttering a word.

"Stay quiet. There are procedures for everything."

It looked like he was backing down, and Abella stuck her tongue out at the guard captain's back.

The woman who had been watching this absurd situation up close said with shocked eyes:

"Are you crazy? Why did you tell such a lie?"

She acknowledged that the quick thinking befitting a servant candidate was admirable, but if the truth came out, it would mean death on the spot.

"I have to survive for now. And that guard captain probably can't even verify it - he's a coward."

The woman chuckled and extended her hand.

"Let's introduce ourselves properly. I'm Catenia from Manaka. I'm thirty-two years old. I'm your senior, right?"

"Yes. I'm Abella. I'm twenty-three."

After finishing their introductions, Catenia asked:

"But are you really that bold? How can you so easily say such insulting words about the empire's emperor?"

Honestly, she didn't know.

'Uncle Habitz.'

When she heard about his eccentric, almost evil deeds, she felt angry, but in a corner of her heart...

Mmm, it's okay. It's okay.

When he patted her back and said it was okay, it was the first time in her life she felt like she had a shelter.

"Well, because it's true."

Abella shrugged and deflected.

"That's true... Honestly, I'm scared too. But I'm hoping that since I'm older, I won't be taken as a concubine. Oh, sorry."

Unlike Catenia, Abella was of the right age to enter Habitz's bed.

"It's okay. I'm actually going to become a concubine."

"What?"

Even Catenia, who liked money, would have thought differently if she had to go to Habitz's side.

"Group 4, enter!"

As the guards opened the castle gate, 30 people rushed through the arch.

Befitting the world's largest artificial structure, the imperial palace's path seemed endless, and they finally stopped in front of a spacious central government building.

'They've come.'

Another spy from Kashan had secretly infiltrated the location for the first interview.

Empress Uorin's assassin, El Crouch.

Once a doll maker, he had learned black magic from an Eastern puppeteer and modified his own body into a doll.

'Two lives remaining.'

He had lived for over 200 years by dispersing his life into porcelain dolls, but now even that was nearing its end.

'Well, I've lived long enough.'

On the day he left Kashan, Uorin had said:

"I'm sorry, Crouch."

When Crouch, who had no flesh attached, raised his head, the mechanical devices that filled him instead of organs turned.

"For Your Majesty to apologize is unthinkable."

Uorin smiled bitterly.

"We've known each other for so long. No matter how much I think about it, you're the only one who can move <Legal Murder> to Marsak."

"It's an honor."

Crouch's mission was as a courier.

"The biggest problem is still Balkan. We can't send multiple assassins to someone who can read crowd energy."

"Multiple. He can't read one person's killing intent, but he notices two or more people's killing intent."

"Right. The more the numbers increase, the clearer the crowd energy becomes. Currently, Alphafish is training to eliminate hostility toward Habitz. So there's no problem with your infiltration."

"The real problem is on the day of the plan."

If Alphafish revealed killing intent, it would make two people including Crouch, so Balkan would read the crowd energy.

"I'll have to be dead by the moment Alphafish kills Habitz."

It had to remain singular throughout, and it was something only Crouch, who had multiple lives, could do.

"You might have to die twice."

That would mean permanent death.

"To deliver <Legal Murder> to Alphafish, you must go through 'initialization.' That process is dangerous."

"I understand, Your Majesty."

"So, Crouch."

Uorin approached Crouch.

"I'm not assigning this to you because you have two lives. It's because I believe you... can escape at least once. Don't die."

Crouch's facial muscles made of wire twisted, and his mouth curved upward crookedly.

"It's a life Your Majesty gave me. Even if all the porcelain dolls I offered you break, I won't resent it."

"That's not what I mean."

Crouch smiled with his eyes, though without eyelids it just looked like they were wide open.

"You don't need to make excuses like a girl even to me."

Uorin puffed her cheeks.

"What?"

"Until the day I return, please preserve your precious body."

Crouch, who left Kashan, assassinated a servant in Marsak and performed her role instead.

'My name is Orphe.'

As a master of disguise, he had perfectly imitated not only her appearance but also her personality and minor habits.

Even Abella, who knew from the operation that he would be at the first interview location, couldn't find Crouch.

'He must be watching me.'

When their eyes met as she looked around, Crouch quietly averted his gaze.

'Nothing good comes from recognizing each other.'

The waiting interviewers approached the women of Group 4 and conducted physical examinations.

They felt their bodies to confirm whether they were male or female, and women with tattoos were also eliminated.

"Pass. To the next checkpoint."

Six women were eliminated, and the remaining 24 followed the guards to arrive at a small waiting room.

"Congratulations on passing the first interview."

A manager with a goatee stood on the platform holding a roster.

"Of course, you still have to go through second, third, and fourth interviews, plus a final exam."

The servants' eyes filled with determination.

"The final selection is 30 people. It's a competition where one in ten will be eliminated. However, we'll be making a special selection at this checkpoint."

"Special selection?"

The servant candidates murmured among themselves.

"Is there anyone here who would like to serve closely beside His Imperial Majesty in the Heavenly Emperor's quarters?"

No one wanted to serve a murderer, and a cold silence flowed.

"I'm not forcing anyone. But anyway, the final selection will be by lottery. If you're not confident about passing..."

"I'll do it."

Everyone's gaze focused on one spot, and Catenia said with a bewildered expression, stammering:

"You, you..."

Abella shrugged.

"I told you, this is what I meant."

The manager checked the number on her name tag and quickly flipped through his ledger.

"Hmm, Yuce Abella. Of gypsy origin..."

There seemed to be nothing particularly unusual.

"Go through that door. The servants will re-examine you, and if there's nothing particularly wrong, you'll pass immediately."

"Yes. But I have one request."

The manager closed his ledger and lifted his chin, as if granting a dying person's wish.

"Speak."

"Since His Imperial Majesty Habitz might remember me, could I give advance notice?"

"His Imperial Majesty?"

The manager looked around and said:

"Are you mentally ill? If so, I can't let you pass. Lives are at stake."

"It's your life that's at stake, manager. If you leave me like this, you don't know what trouble might come later."

'Damn! Why does this happen to me...!'

Feeling the same emotion as the guard captain's heart, the manager frowned and asked:

"Then what's your relationship with His Imperial Majesty?"

Abella looked around at the candidates watching with pale faces and smiled brightly.

"We're childhood friends."

"Your Majesty! The head servant requests an audience!"

The doors to the great hall opened, and an old woman over seventy crossed the grand hall with a deadpan expression.

Balkan, sitting on the throne, was snoring loudly, and military tactical maps were spread on the floor.

Habitz and the other four freaks were sitting there chatting and playing with dolls using military figurines.

"Rumble! Bang! Cannon boom!"

The comedian Zetaro was horrified.

"Aaah! My eyeball fell out! Put it back in quickly! Eyeball! Gather the eyeballs!"

The battle doll Natasha moved a soldier piece.

"Die! Die! Die! Die!"

The domestic king Smodo crumpled the map.

"All the women of the Paris Kingdom are mine! Wait, even just the fertile women aged 10-20 would be roughly 4.47 million..."

The head servant cleared her throat.

"Ahem, Your Imperial Majesty."

Habitz threw a sailing ship and turned his head.

"What? I'm busy now. We're in a state council meeting."

"Is there perhaps a name Yuce Abella among the friends you made long ago?"

"Who? Hmm."

If she had lied, it could cost her head, but the head servant just kept her mouth shut like a clam.

'If I die, I die.'

She doesn't imagine the future.

This was the first requirement for being the head servant of the Gustav Empire.

"I don't know."

The head servant bowed her head.

"I understand. However..."

Balkan rolled over and said as if talking in his sleep:

"Oh, you know, there was that girl he met before. Something about opening a flower shop or something..."

Habitz's eyes widened as he stood up.

"Yuce Abella!"

The four freaks all turned to look at him simultaneously.

"Right! It was Abella! But why? Why are you suddenly looking for her?"

The name was hazy, but he had never forgotten the promise he made with that girl back then.

"I'm not looking for her, but a child who became a servant this time wishes to have an audience with Your Majesty."

"Abella came looking for me?"

Habitz's shoulders trembled.

"She completed the flower garden!"
