The Definition of Love (3)

"I will pass on the dream."

Ruber fell into deep thought.

'Systemically, it's possible. But it goes against the administrator's code of conduct.'

Drimo wasn't the exclusive domain of any particular species.

From the most basic organisms to higher life forms, it was a space that processed the ideals of all who dreamed.

'Above all, Terraforce.'

Currently, they too were constantly demanding channels that could influence humanity.

'If I allow inheritance dreams, I'll also have to permit Terraforce's channels. Of course, both have their own reasonable justifications, but...'

Creating a precedent meant that operating Drimo would become a bit more restrictive.

Monga bit her lip and called out.

"Lord Ruber."

Now, at the point where Yorahan's dream would soon fill Drimo completely, there was no choice.

"I understand."

Ruber nodded.

"Your dream will not be processed in Drimo, but will manifest and be passed down in other people's dreams from now on."

"Thank you."

Yorahan's smile was so gentle that even Ruber ended up sighing.

"Then let's store your dream in the database. Before that, please decide on a name for the dream."

"A name...?"

"You wouldn't understand in your era. Naming is the most important task in the universe."

Once, even Sirone didn't understand.

But through the journey so far, now he could vaguely grasp it.

'The reason why naming is important.'

Because this universe we inhabit is a database that God calculates and processes.

And if those defined names connect to the Idea through missing links.

'Only those with names transcend classification.'

Among countless beings, becoming something special that can influence all things in the universe.

"A name."

Yorahan thought for a moment.

"Yorahan and Armang."

Then he lifted his head and spoke to Ruber.

"I'll call it Yore."

"Understood."

Whatever the reason for choosing the name, what truly mattered was the life that name would have to navigate.

"From now on, countless people will dream your dream. It will continue endlessly through generations. Perhaps it might even become a religion. You will become the god of a religion called Yore."

"...I see."

Though he had accomplished what he had desperately wanted during his lifetime, his expression remained calm.

Then Armang spoke.

"I also have a condition."

Ruber frowned, but he couldn't deny that the two were already one.

"Speak."

"I want to protect my husband's dream. Please send me to reality."

"But you're already..."

"I don't need life. I'm from the Hwajok. Even if I become an object, as long as I can see Yorahan's dream come true, I'll be satisfied."

"Hmm."

Ruber knew the method.

'I can export her as an object. But the administration won't allow it. In the end, it'll be my decision...'

Drimo began to shake.

"Understood. You'll become an object with a special concept and go to reality. What do you want to become?"

"A sword."

Armang didn't hesitate.

"A sword would be good."

"...Approved."

Yorahan and Armang looked at each other.

Though this would be their eternal farewell, their hearts would extend and connect with someone else's heart.

"I love you."

The two kissed, and with that as the last act, Yorahan's avatar disappeared.

Monga looked back at Ruber.

"Will it be okay?"

"It's what they define."

Looking at Drimo, which had regained stability, he said.

"We've avoided destruction."

Armang regained consciousness.

'Where is this?'

Though she had no eyes, nose, or ears, information about the space came through the sensation of Sosegyechang.

A prison.

The king of Micas and the guards were collapsed, and she could sense Yorahan by the wall.

'Ah.'

Though she had no legs, the sword shook, but she soon learned how to use herself.

'Since I resonated with the divine sword.'

Armang floated through Geomgyeok manipulation and flew to the wall where Yorahan had died, leaning beside him.

'Honey.'

Perhaps because he had forgiven everything, he wore the happiest expression.

'Such a kind person.'

Though she once hated humans, and even now couldn't say she liked them...

'I'm glad I met you.'

She wouldn't trade the time she spent loving with Yorahan for anything else.

Armang's phantom appeared around the demon sword and embraced Yorahan's body.

'You're so kind, and your heart so tender, that you're always hurt by people.'

He had only wished for everyone to be happy together.

'I'll protect you.'

The demon sword's blade opened like the jointed legs of an insect and swallowed Yorahan's body.

'So that no one can wound your heart, I'll become a shell harder than anything else...'

Yorahan rose, wearing armor.

"I'll protect you."

Geumgang Armament.

The voice was Yorahan's, but it was Armang who moved his vocal cords.

"Let's go."

To find those who dream Yorahan's dream.

The Flame Demon.

Rete roared at the avatar of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who struck lightning from the sky.

"Kraaaah!"

Once again Rete's body was pierced, and hellfire flew from all directions to repair the holes.

"Krrrgh!"

At that moment, she realized.

'I can't go.'

There was no way to reach Yahweh.

'No.'

She too was an administrator, so she didn't have special feelings for this world.

'But I...'

If there was one difference from other administrators.

'I must protect the Other World.'

Rete, having restored her body with hellfire, this time poured flames toward the ground.

"Huaaaah!"

The thick flames that lasted about three minutes spread in concentric circles for several kilometers.

"Krrrr..."

When the flames disappeared, Son Yujung stood firmly on the earth, holding her staff forward.

'Strong.'

Without a doubt, she was the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.

'There's no time now.'

With that thought, Rete's body gradually shrank and returned to the form of a Hwagongsa executive.

Son Yujung lowered her staff.

"Are you giving up?"

"Fighting like this is meaningless. There's not much time left now. We must choose."

"Choose what?"

"Whether Ultima is possible."

After thinking for a moment, Son Yujung pointed her staff.

"Leader of the demons, your evil deeds have crossed the line. Come at me. I don't want to eliminate an opponent who has given up."

"I won't die."

Rete smiled bitterly.

"Hwagongsa employees don't get to leave work. Not until this world closes. But you know too, don't you? That also means the end of the real world."

Richera's face, hanging from Son Yujung's waist, shouted.

"What are you doing? Kill her quickly! If that woman weren't here, I wouldn't have to live like this!"

"You be quiet."

Son Yujung unfastened the chain from her waist, entrusted Richera to Mortasinger, and approached Rete.

"Is this a threat now? But I don't compromise. My righteousness won't change."

Rete's eyes filled with sadness.

"Your righteousness and my wrongness both exist because someone defined them. If what you truly want is integration, this method won't help."

"I don't understand difficult words. I'm different from Yahweh. If you want to persuade me, you'll have to break me."

At that moment, light entered Rete's eyes.

Son Yujung stopped approaching and became alert, but Rete maintained that state for quite a while.

'There's no choice.'

Because protecting the world where demons would live was more important than an administrator's duties.

"I am..."

For the first time, she began to speak administrator classified information aloud.

"A mind program."

Son Yujung simply listened.

"The universe consists of five systems. Reality, Drimo, the Other World, The Abyss, and the Under Coder that connects these four systems. Except for Under Coder, all have administrators to varying degrees, but only I operate on quantum signals."

It's called Hidden Code.

"My name is Rete of Oblivion. I'm the only being who can manage demons. As long as I don't violate administrator authority, whatever sins I commit are processed through oblivion. A thousand times, ten thousand times - I give chances."

Just as she had with Executive Secretary Monorath.

"If there weren't such a program, the chaos of unpredictable demons would be recognized as errors. Therefore, unlike other administrators, I can change standards and am designed to actively respond to chaotic situations."

Son Yujung doesn't understand difficult words.

However, precisely because of that, she intuitively grasped that perhaps this information was the most important matter in the universe.

'I don't know. Why is this important? If Sirone were in this place...'

Would he have shown a different reaction from herself?

Rete continued.

"And now, with you overwhelming me, my mind program has changed. I want to protect the world where demons live. That's the same logic as Yahweh wanting to protect the real world. But at this rate, the universe will close."

If you flip the perspective of good and evil, Rete was also fighting for the same reason as Sirone.

Mortasinger said.

"Yujung, you can't trust her. She's the woman who has deceived us countless times and dragged the situation this far. Because she can change standards, she can also lie."

"Right."

Son Yujung had also once been the epitome of chaos. But the reason she could now reach the avatar of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven was...

'Because she had a heart.'

Rete said.

"Yahweh understood both good and evil love, but ultimately couldn't embrace evil. He abandoned his own darkness."

The condensation of that darkness was Gyorgi of the Catacombs.

"As an administrator, I'm certain that we absolutely cannot reach Ultima as things are. I'll help Yahweh. If you send me, I can prevent the world's end."

Son Yujung gritted her teeth.

"Why? You hate Yahweh."

"Yes. All administrators only perform their duties according to their programs. I hate Yahweh too. But you know, don't you? That's precisely why..."

Rete pressed her chest.

"Only I can love Yahweh."

Perhaps this was the very core of it all, Son Yujung accepted with animal instinct.

Son Yujung asked.

"How many hours are left until the world's end?"

"Two hours."

Based on the temple, it was midnight, 12 o'clock.

"I'm already far from Yahweh. Considering the time it takes me to get there, ten minutes is the limit."

Rete spread both hands.

"Decide within that time. Whether to send me to Yahweh or keep me bound here."

Only 600 seconds.

It was an impossibly short time to stake humanity's fate on, but such was the world.

Son Yujung endlessly repeated judgments of possibility and impossibility.

"Hrrgh."

Her hair, falling like wild horse claws, gradually began to turn white.

"Yu, Yujung."

Mortasinger called out worriedly, but she too had no words to offer.

Because we can never know another's truth.

'Should I trust Rete?'

Son Yujung shook her head.

'No, I shouldn't trust anyone. Only I must save myself.'

Suddenly she had this thought.

That unknowable truth... might perhaps be the most terrible thing in the world.
