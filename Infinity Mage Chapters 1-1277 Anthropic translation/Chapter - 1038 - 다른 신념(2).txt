Another Belief (2)

The Iron Kingdom, one of the Seven Star Kingdoms of the Holy Empire, is a powerhouse representing the eight southern continent kingdoms.

Their advanced politics and financial power more than compensate for the geographical disadvantage of being located at the southernmost tip.

But at some point, subtle tectonic shifts began occurring in the southern continent's power structure.

It started with Angel's Tears.

That was the name of the hallucinogenic drug openly distributed in the small kingdom called Keshia.

"How quiet."

Keshia's capital was truly quiet.

The rampant crime and terrorism of the past, the sight of homeless girls wailing—none of it could be found anymore.

Like a literal ghost town, only occasional groans leaked out between the tightly shut houses.

Fermi looked up at the blazing sun.

"Isn't this also a form of peace?"

His untrimmed beard richly covered his lower jaw, and his dyed hair now only remained at the ends of his long locks.

"Fermi."

At the calling voice, Fermi turned around and revealed a smile like mischievous madness.

"Niaka."

Though Fermi was from the central continent, the southern accent now naturally colored his speech.

"What's the matter? Everyone should be sleeping at this hour."

A dark-skinned man of medium height approached Fermi, constantly sniffing.

"I was looking for you. I was going to go to the company. Do you have any of that stuff? Angel's Tears."

Commonly called Angel.

"Of course I do."

Fermi rummaged through his pocket while looking into Niaka's severely dilated pupils.

"Inject the proper amount. It's no fun if you take too much. Here, take this and go back."

A small plastic bag was filled with white powder that sparkled like sugar.

"Thanks. But I don't have money. I can't work. Want to come home with me? You can take my wife if she's okay with you."

No one worked in Keshia.

"It's fine. Money isn't necessary anymore."

Seven kingdoms of the southern continent, excluding the Iron Kingdom, were in Fermi's grasp.

"Here, take this to your wife. This level of service is basic customer hospitality."

Fermi patted Niaka's shoulder and pressed another drug bag into his hand.

"Sniff sniff."

Niaka held the bag to his nose and inhaled, his eyelids trembling as he moaned.

"Ahhh. Now I can live a little."

With his focus half-returned, Niaka asked without removing the bag from his nose.

"Fermi. You don't do Angel, do you?"

"Why do you think that?"

"I don't know. I just get that feeling. Why don't you do this good stuff? Doesn't it hurt?"

"If I indulge too, who would make the drugs? At least one person has to protect this city. Don't you think?"

"Well..."

After sniffing a couple more times, Niaka waved his hand as he headed home.

"Thanks anyway."

Fermi saw him off with a smile.

"Keep to the proper dosage. That's a warning."

By tomorrow, Niaka probably wouldn't even remember meeting Fermi.

After lingering briefly, Fermi walked down the desolate road where only dust and trash rolled around.

The symbol of the Golden Wheel glittered on the spire of the modern building standing at the end of the block.

"Have you arrived, Chairman?"

As he entered the building, coolness that chased away the midday heat enveloped his skin.

"Yes. The excavation team?"

The employee following behind with a makeup-free face also had slightly dilated pupils.

"They woke up two hours ago. They're waiting in the recovery room now."

Fermi's eyes darkened.

'Three days and seventeen hours in real time. This excavation work was quite tough.'

As he entered through the automatic door, a white space equipped with the latest medical facilities appeared.

Two hundred beds were arranged along the walls, all empty without exception.

"Oh? You're here?"

The bathroom door opened and Marsha, freshly washed, came out drying her hair.

"Where were you? I kept looking for you."

The Parrot Mercenary Corps, which had joined hands with the Golden Wheel, had now leaped to 2nd place in the global guild rankings.

It was remarkable growth, not just among mercenary guilds but including all existing guilds.

"I went out for some air. A walk."

"...You go out often these days. There's nothing to see anyway since no one walks the streets."

"Isn't that what makes it wonderful?"

Marsha, pondering Fermi's words, picked up a metal box from the bed.

"Here. This one was tough. It was a dangerous zone and buried too deep. I think we dug down about 200 years..."

"Thank you for your hard work."

Fermi, receiving the box, confirmed through the gem embedded in the center that it had never been opened.

"How much should I give you?"

Marsha said while putting on her sweater.

"Still being stingy? You've swept up all the money from seven kingdoms and you're still tight-fisted."

"That's why I'm asking."

"Since we'll be working together for a long time, I'll take a reasonable amount. 8 billion gold. Prepare it all in large gold coins."

Fermi smiled with his eyes.

"Four days' wages is 8 billion gold."

"How many mouths do we have to feed? When divided among everyone, there's nothing left. Anyway, prepare it like that. I'm going drinking."

As Marsha passed by patting his shoulder, Fermi said while putting away the box.

"I'll deliver it the usual way."

"Oh, and."

Just before leaving, Marsha turned around.

"You need to shave. You... haven't visited the children even once since then?"

"That's rather a personal matter."

"Right. You'll handle it well, I'm sure. It's just... it would be much better than taking walks through desolate streets."

After Marsha left the recovery room and the automatic door closed, Fermi looked in the mirror.

It seemed like a strange person was standing there.

"...Has it already become like this?"

When you're grave-robbing future events that no one knows, you tend to forget the present time.

Fermi entered the bathroom, showered with warm water, and soaped his face.

Scritch scritch.

The beard that had grown for who knows how long was cleanly shaved off his skin.

Looking intently at his own face, he grabbed his long hair and began cutting it off with the razor.

Then, looking in the mirror, the clean face of the person called Fermi was finally revealed.

"Chairman."

As he came out of the bathroom naked, the secretary waiting outside entered and bowed her head.

"Bring me my clothes. I'm going there."

"...Yes."

She, whose thoughts were slowed by Angel intoxication, understood and brought a fine suit.

Fermi, neatly buttoning up, looked at himself in the full-length mirror for a long time.

"Hmm."

Thinking he was ready, he headed to a room where dozens of children lay sleeping.

They had IVs inserted, and doctors in gowns were checking times and adjusting drug dosages.

"Chairman."

As the masked doctor bowed, Fermi placed a hand on his shoulder and moved forward.

"Fe, Fermi."

The only adult woman in this room sat up with hazy eyes.

It was Rachel, a comrade of Fermi's mother Yogurt and director of the Aramoneth Orphanage.

"Teacher."

And perhaps... she was also the first person Fermi had ever loved.

The doctor quickly flipped through the chart.

"Angel dosage hasn't exceeded the average. Emotional sickness is suppressed, and conscious activity is about four hours a day."

Rachel said.

"Fermi, this isn't right. Giving drugs to these young children. This is too great a sin."

Until he 'excavated' the history of emotional sickness outbreaks, he had tried never to see her again.

To Fermi, Rachel was both a replacement for Yogurt and one woman.

"Thanks to the medicine, they can sleep comfortably. You know, Teacher. Without this medicine, they suffer."

How could she not know? But due to long-term Angel administration, her rationality had weakened.

"I don't know. What should I do... What should I do with these children? Is this really the best way?"

"You don't need to think. I'll think. Don't do anything. I'll solve it. Teacher, just lie down comfortably and dream."

Looking up at Fermi who gently laid her on the bed, Rachel's eyes wavered.

'Fermi.'

It was the same then too.

A colleague's son—even if it was a momentary mistake, the reason she had allowed her lips to a nine-year-old boy was...

'Because you were so outstanding and brilliant.'

She had ended up relying on that enormous feeling that nothing would be impossible for him.

"Fermi. I, actually you..."

"I'll come again."

As if he knew even that feeling, Fermi preemptively cut off Rachel's slip of tongue.

"Ah, ahhh..."

When the IV drip was increased, her eyelids trembled and she fell into deep sleep.

"Let her sleep for a while. Emotional changes or amplification could worsen the condition."

"Understood."

While the doctor bowed, Fermi looked around at the orphanage children.

Though they occasionally convulsed, they all slept with peaceful faces.

"Have fun playing."

In sweet dreams, not the hell of reality.

"Chairman."

As Fermi left the room, a Golden Wheel attendant followed behind with clicking footsteps.

"The Holy Council meeting is approaching. Shouldn't we take at least nearby Iron before then?"

"Leave it alone for now. They have the cards we need."

If it was Fermi's word, there was no need to question its reliability.

"Understood. Then I'll announce our candidacy as representatives of the seven southern kingdoms excluding Iron."

"Hmm."

Fermi thought of Shirone.

"Hold off on that too. We'll have visitors soon. We should match our hand to the very end, shouldn't we?"

"Yes. Then."

The attendant who recorded those words stopped walking, and Fermi entered his office alone.

After placing the box he received from Marsha on the shelf, he sat in the chair in front of the full glass window.

'Mother.'

Looking at the desolate cityscape, Fermi recalled Yogurt's face he had met in Estas.

'Don't worry. I'll do well.'

Because I'm your son.

She who left the world after giving humanity the opportunity to choose their future.

A heroine comparable to the Extreme Line Maze, but whose nature was closer to universal love.

"Grrr..."

Blood vessels rose along Fermi's neck.

'Is it starting again?'

The reason he didn't touch Angel was because mental cloudiness made 'excavating' history difficult.

"Damn it."

As the pain of emotional sickness stabbed through his entire body, his nose bridge twisted like a beast's.

What should he give up?

He had already abandoned everything except what was necessary to achieve his purpose.

Suddenly, murderous intent filled Fermi's eyes and he turned with a terrifying expression.

Gripping a military knife in his right hand in reverse, he drove it down hard into his left hand.

Thunk!

Red blood flowed down the blade that had pierced through his hand bones and even the chair's armrest.

"Tsk."

Clicking his tongue, Fermi pulled out a cigarette, tilted his head sideways, and lit it.

"Phew."

Then, leaning back against the chair, he blew smoke in a long stream toward the scenery outside the window.

"...That's a bit better now."

The sun blazed unpleasantly bright.
