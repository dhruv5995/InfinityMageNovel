[575] The Omnipotent Monster (2)

As if time had been accelerated tens of thousands of times, icicles formed in the sky and struck down at the ground.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Frings emerged between the thick ice pillars.

'Frings? Why?'

Even if he launched a surprise attack, combat would be impossible anyway. Since no one on the current allied team had a higher rank than Shirone, he could just call "Kang" and end it.

"This isn't fun, but..."

Ultra-thin Ice.

As Frings swung his arm, the atmosphere froze thinly and rushed toward Shirone.

It was so sharp and thin that it would be invisible to the naked eye if light didn't reflect off it, and the forest trees were cleanly cut down as they fell.

"Frings! Kang!"

Shirone's eyes filled with shock as he dodged the Ultra-thin Ice and called Kang.

'What?'

Lulu's electrical signal didn't enter his mind.

"Did you think it would be too easy just because there's a judge? You should properly understand the rules."

As Ultra-thin Ice was cast consecutively, the landscape began to be severed as if perspective had disappeared.

'What's going on?'

Shirone, who had escaped through the gaps in the slashing, rolled on the ground and shouted again.

"Frings! Kang!"

This time too, Kang didn't work, but through two attempts he was able to find the cause of the problem.

'It disappeared.'

Frings' presence had suddenly vanished from the synesthesia felt through the Spirit Zone.

'I see.'

To call Kang on a specific target, the Spirit Zone must be in contact.

During combat, it's common for each other's Spirit Zones to overlap so they don't pay attention to it, but in a black and white match it's different.

If one evades the Spirit Zone and moves out of range the moment Kang is called, the judge won't activate either.

'That's the theory. But is it really possible?'

Unless entering the Image Zone, the Spirit Zone isn't something whose form can be confirmed with the eyes.

Therefore, evading the Spirit Zone through synesthesia combining the five senses required murderously keen sensitivity.

"I'm quite sensitive, you see."

He had fought countless mages until now, but this was the first time he'd encountered tactics that evaded the Spirit Zone.

'Senior class rank 3, Frings. He's not in that position just by luck?'

It now made sense why Frings hadn't shown much interest in card collection until now.

'Kang was impossible from the start. He has confidence that he can absolutely avoid it.'

Unless it was Arin's level of mental activity, it would be difficult to catch Frings with just omnidirectional conversion.

'But is that really so?'

Just as Shirone's eyes blazed with competitive spirit, Frings raised both arms and cast magic.

"Ice Soul Rampage."

Hundreds of tadpole-shaped freezing clouds spread out from Frings as the center, penetrating the forest's features.

As if an ice age had arrived, frost began to form on everything as it froze.

'Dangerous!'

This wasn't the 2000th floor.

The reason flame and cold are called the best attack magic in actual combat is because they deal with environments where living beings cannot survive.

"Shall we begin?"

Frings charged forward with ice demon spikes.

"Now, today's integrated class is omnidirectional conversion. The Spirit Zone changes according to a mage's mind, but it's inefficient for use in actual combat. Therefore, learning the basics of omnidirectional conversion is important."

In a gathering of advanced class students, Ethella explained omnidirectional conversion as usual.

The children who had just entered the advanced class perked up their ears, while students around Class 5 or 4 just waited for practice time with bored expressions.

"Ah, boring."

At Mark's muttering, Maria put her index finger to her lips.

"Shh. The teacher will hear."

"Sorry. But I think I'm in a slump lately."

"You're training hard though?"

Mark and Maria, who were receiving personal guidance from Sadd, had improved dramatically and were currently 1st and 2nd place in Class 4.

"That's the problem. I'm training hard but it's boring. I think it's time to leave the advanced class."

Maria had been having similar thoughts lately.

"Well, the seniors we know also worried about advancing to the senior class around this time. But the spot hasn't opened up yet, has it?"

Aider, currently hospitalized in the infirmary, hadn't decided whether to drop out of the senior class.

"Annoying. If he has full-body fractures and trauma, he should just give up this year instead of being stubborn. Just blocking underclassmen's paths."

"How can you say that? To a senior."

"Tch, I heard he got what he deserved for messing with Senior Shirone. It turned out well anyway. Just open up the spot. I'll apply as first priority. That's okay, right?"

Maria shrugged her shoulders.

"Do what you want. I'll do it the proper way."

She believed there was no merit to entering the senior class immediately other than experiencing the graduation exam early.

"Wooaaaah!"

As Ethella entered the Image Zone and quickly demonstrated omnidirectional conversion, cheers erupted from the Class 7 side.

"Now, does everyone understand? Then from now on, spread out by class and practice omnidirectional conversion..."

KWAAAAANG!

Suddenly an explosive sound burst from the forest and broken trees shot up into the sky.

"Wh-what?"

While the advanced class students looked on in bewilderment, Ethella quickly turned to examine the forest.

Without needing to detect with the Spirit Zone, two senior class students had entered the integrated class training ground.

"Huh? Senior Shirone?"

Chased by Frings' indiscriminate attacks, Shirone realized he had somehow entered the integrated class training ground.

"Oh no...!"

Without even time to regret his mistake, the ice demon's ice spikes flew precisely at his vital points.

'The precision is truly incredible. In terms of senses alone, it's a level that surpasses Dante.'

With the forest's cover gone, Shirone and Frings began using attack magic in earnest.

Irregularly reflecting flashes, exploding ice fragments.

At the unimaginably high-level offense and defense, the advanced class children watched in a daze.

But their admiration was brief - as the magic's power increased exponentially and threatened the surroundings, the lower class students jumped up.

"Aaaaah! It's dangerous!"

Frings, who had retreated in a riding stance, bent all ten fingers and cast magic.

'Ice Wave!'

As a wave of freezing scraped the ground and thousands of ice spikes extended forward, Shirone also cast Fury.

KWAKWAKWAKWAKWAAAAANG!

Ice Wave fragments scattered in all directions, and frozen powder sparkled as if stars had appeared in broad daylight.

"Stop it! This is class time!"

Ethella shouted, but Shirone and Frings, half-lost in a trance, didn't stop fighting.

As the Homing Photon Cannon made a wide detour around the training ground, even the advanced class upper-level students turned and ran.

"R-run!"

The distance was far, but the Homing Photon Cannon's speed was so fast they couldn't help but think it was flying toward them.

"Move aside. What's going on?"

Hearing the sound of Fisho's insect magic Explosion Bug, Shiina and Sadd, who had flown over via spatial movement, pushed through the crowd of students.

"Huh? That's..."

As Sadd blinked, the lower class children shouted.

"Senior Shirone and Senior Frings are fighting! Teacher Sadd, please stop them quickly!"

Sadd's brow furrowed.

'That's not the level of kids fighting.'

It wasn't just a matter of power - lethal variations and tactics that could only be seen on an actual battlefield were crossing in real time.

Unless they went into the battlefield together to join in, they couldn't intervene right now, which is why Ethella and Shiina were also just looking for an opportunity.

'Light Wings!'

Following the trajectory of Shirone flying low with wings of light spread, ice spears struck down.

The Homing Photon Cannon completed with time division approached powerfully, but Frings used ultra-precise movement to induce the trajectory and create a miss.

'The difference in precision is clear. It's a bit annoying.'

As the irritated Shirone cast Photon Cannon as a direct shot, an ice wall one meter thick rose in front of Frings.

The Photon Cannon pierced through the ice wall with a roar, but Frings' expression remained indifferent.

'The power has already decreased.'

Bunching highly reflective ice in his fist, he swung his arm and the Photon Cannon bounced away.

"Really amazing..."

Admiration was heard from among the Class 4 students.

Being students facing the senior class, they knew how precise and sensory the current battle was.

"Senior Shirone..."

Especially the shock Mark received was beyond imagination.

'I thought I had desperately caught up.'

Without comparing to anyone, he was confident that no one had trained more intensely than himself.

'I'm not the only one running. Everyone is running.'

In such a race, what more would he have to sacrifice to run faster than others?

"Maria, let's double our training from today."

"...Okay."

In the increasingly fierce battle, Frings prepared his ace technique while timing it.

"Shall we finish this soon?"

As he brought both hands to his right side, freezing mist began compressing at a bizarre speed.

At the same time, Shirone also floated a Photon Cannon in front of him, preparing to launch a counter.

"Ultra Ice...!"

Just as Frings was about to cast magic, a rough whirlwind rose from under his feet and froze as it was.

Shiina's magic Ice Tornado.

Sharp ice spikes crossed over Frings' entire body, but there wasn't a single wound anywhere.

Meanwhile, Ethella, who had approached behind Shirone, was also choking his neck with her arms hooked under his armpits.

"Ugh!"

At the pressure like steel whips tightening, Shirone finally canceled the Photon Cannon.

But his gaze was still fixed on Frings, and his breathing was rough with excited emotion.

"Frings, what do you think you're doing?"

As Shiina approached, Frings could only move his eyes to look at her while unable to move.

"I apologize. There was a minor disagreement."

Shiina, who had already received hints about Scramble Royale at the faculty meeting, didn't even snort.

"Stop it right now, if you want to keep attending school."

'Nice figure.'

Frings didn't listen at all.

"I can't leave school. But in cases like this, wouldn't mutual fault be appropriate?"

Shiina's face reddened.

'Really, these guys...'

The heads of the underground research societies who stubbornly refused to listen to teachers as if they had been mortal enemies in a past life.

Even when she sent them to the senior class, she had hoped they would mature a little, but they hadn't graduated for years and continued to be a headache.

"Shirone, please stop."

Ethella loosened her choking grip and admonished.

"But..."

Frings was the one who had initiated the fight.

"The underclassmen could have been hurt."

Only then did Shirone look around to see students who had taken classes with him until last year looking at him with frightened faces.

"...I'm sorry."

Anyway, Fisho would have collected the Scramble, and with teachers involved, further combat was meaningless.

Shiina, who had released the Ice Tornado, spoke.

"Go back to the senior class immediately. If you cause an incident like this one more time, there will be no forgiveness then."

"I shall do as ordered."

Frings gave a gentlemanly bow and headed toward the forest, but in a direction completely unrelated to the senior class.

"Ugh, annoying. Stress."

Shiina, pressing her temples firmly with her hands, called to Shirone who was standing dejectedly.

"Shirone, come see me for a moment."

"Now?"

It was the height of Scramble Royale.

"Sorry, but right now is a bit..."

Shiina's eyes filled with intensity.

"Right now. Even if you're in the senior class, this is still a school. Or are you saying you look down on advanced class teachers now?"

"No! I would never think that...!"

"Since you understand, follow me."

As Shiina took Shirone down the mountain, Ethella smiled and managed the atmosphere.

"Now, everyone! Now you clearly understand why you must diligently hone omnidirectional conversion, right? The key to conversion is..."

While the students made blank expressions, Sadd clicked his tongue and shook his head.

'Teacher Ethella, that's not it.'
