[794] Beta Fish (4)

"It's over. Completely ruined."

Even though the intro was almost finished and Maya showed no signs of moving, Palmers clutched his head.

'Has she been consumed by nerves?'

The phenomenon where one's mind suddenly goes blank and no thoughts emerge was common among newcomers.

As it came time for Maya's voice to come in, Palmers, unable to bear looking at reality, squeezed his eyes shut.

"Like a sudden shower..."

A refreshing voice like dawn breaking.

"Huh?"

Palmers opened his eyes, and the song began as intense drum beats exploded.

"Light descends from the sky!"

Explosive vocal power that pierced through all the instruments' sounds burst forth, pushing against the audience.

'She hit perfect timing. This is much better than during rehearsal, isn't it?'

Maya's voice, now surrendering her body to the rhythm, was the most genuine he'd ever heard.

'I'm not afraid.'

Because mistakes cannot exist in sincerity.

'I've practiced countless times.'

Though she couldn't think of anything, the rhythm, the melody, the time of the song flowed in her subconscious.

"Like a sudden downpour!"

As her ears gradually opened and she could see the world, Shirone was smiling just like in the song lyrics.

"Inescapable light pours down!"

Though it's impossible to clearly define how sincerity transforms technique, the audience was definitely feeling it.

"That singer's pretty good, isn't she?"

"Right. The other invited singers are also well-known, but even though she's a newcomer, her level is high."

Shirone's mouth was itching at people's praise.

'That person is my classmate.'

She thought she should just watch from afar until Maya climbed to even greater heights.

"Amazing! Maya!"

It was a spectacular debut stage.

At a point 14 kilometers from the competition venue, a group was moving at high speed.

Those flying low using wind power, those running purely on muscle strength, those borrowing mechanical power.

Though their methods varied, their speeds - worthy of being called arrows - were nearly equal.

"Lord Mortasinger, we'll arrive at the venue soon."

It was the language of Heaven.

"Good. We wait 2 kilometers out."

A woman with her face covered by cloth bearing the image of a black cube spoke from the center of the group.

"All the pretty ones must die."

It was Mortasinger (10,048 years old), 10th in the Council of Ten's hierarchy.

"The response won't be easy. The World Beauty Contest is one of Arachne's major businesses."

"Even so, it's just an earthly nation. We who once ruled Heaven's citizens need not worry."

Ra Enemy had drawn in the Council of Ten and the Immortal Community to establish an altar.

The reason was that they could easily infiltrate the human world through resets, but Ra's final choice was Nane.

'Anyway, he has absolutely no sense of responsibility.'

She'd heard that Beron and Park-nyeo had died, and Sura had become Nane's disciple and was learning Buddhism.

'If I'd known this would happen, I should have brought Yoo-jeong from Heaven too. Then this situation would already be over.'

2nd in the Council of Ten's hierarchy.

But at that time, he wouldn't permit breaking the precepts, so he'd be sleeping lazily, leaving everything to his avatar.

'Whatever! Now I'm doing things my way too.'

The other executives were equally eccentric, so when Nane laid down his Buddha nature, they scattered across the world with only a few followers each.

'Just try complaining later!'

Left to handle the community alone, Mortasinger moved the organization based on personal emotions.

'It's already miserable being ugly, and now they're holding a beauty contest? These earthly humans are really hopeless!'

A man with a protruding belly and tiger-like whiskers approached Mortasinger's side.

"Is there meaning in this fight?"

He was called Bodhidharma, who had reached the realm of Vajrayana, and behind him followed Huike, a one-armed monk.

"..."

Though not traditional citizens of the three realms, Heaven was anyway a place where countless otherworldly species flowed in.

Most importantly, their realms far exceeded that of Mortasinger, who was over 10,000 years old.

"Meaning can be found if you look for it. If you don't intend to follow my will, leave here."

Other immortals of similar level had already left the community following the Council's executives.

"The path of enlightenment isn't elsewhere. We will stay by your side."

Among the Council of Ten, Mortasinger was the only executive who relied not on enlightenment but on irregular equations.

"No need for pity. I'm strong enough."

The Council of Ten is strong.

'That's why it's pitiful.'

A perfectly twisted human.

Even Vajrayana couldn't destroy her irregular equations.

The first day of the competition was for introducing each country's representatives, revealing the identities of the veiled women.

"Everyone! This is Miss Biden!"

Unlike her languid yawning in the waiting room, she appeared on stage like a shy girl.

"Wooooo! Amazing! Biden's the best!"

The other contestants felt sick inside watching her gently turn her head with a blush.

'Completely fake. Ugh, my mouth is itching to death.'

After simple self-introductions and interviews, it was Miss Tormia's turn.

"Oh? I should watch this."

Shirone, who had been patrolling the venue checking for terrorist threats, stopped and stood on tiptoes.

"Don't be surprised! This Miss Tormia is royalty, befitting a beauty representing her nation!"

"Royalty?"

"Allow me to introduce Alfred Pony!"

As the elaborately dressed Pony walked onto the stage, the audience cheered and welcomed her.

"Pony?"

Shirone's eyes widened instead.

"What about school?"

Though various thoughts crossed his mind, the conclusion was that she was much more beautiful than during their school days.

'Maya and Pony. This is awkward.'

Finally, as the representative of the host country Arachne stepped forward, the biggest applause erupted.

"Rangi! Rangi!"

A man with hearts seemingly carved in his eyes pushed through the crowd and ran right up to the stage.

"I love you!"

It was the man who had grabbed Shirone during the beauty contest parade and launched into a long speech.

"Oh my?"

While the stage-experienced Rangi looked down without panic, security guards grabbed him.

"Get him out! What do you think you're doing!"

The moment he first saw Rangi, he realized it like destiny.

"You're the person I've been looking for!"

Shirone, watching this absurd scene, suddenly turned around at a chill running down his spine.

"What?"

From a distance invisible to human eyes, clear killing intent was shooting in a straight line.

"It's a sniper attack!"

Countless steel balls were flying toward the venue from the mountains.

'Those are...?'

If Shirone's eyes were accurate, they were weapons called Arcs used by Mecha citizens.

"Get down!"

Justin, the only one watching the ridge, was first to see the steel balls and move.

He pushed all the contestants away with both arms, dropping them below the stage, but couldn't avoid Rangi who was in the center.

"What...?"

The explosive spheres had reached 200 meters ahead, and his mind went blank at the bombardment that covered the sky.

"Miss Rangi!"

The man who had shaken off the security guards climbed onto the stage and threw himself while embracing Rangi like a tackle.

"Kyaaah!"

In her eyes as she fell backward, hundreds of steel balls spinning like a whirlwind could be seen.

'Is this a dream?'

As her brain, sensing death, activated time's seesaw, particles of light bubbled like soap bubbles in the middle of the landscape.

'Shi... ro...'

Light formed Shirone faster than the speed of thought.

'...ne?'

The spheres that met powerful resistance began to burst into bright red flames like popping corn.

'From as high as possible!'

Countless spheres that soared skyward writhing like whirlwinds exploded simultaneously.

"Aaaaah! It's terrorism!"

As the audience scattered in all directions at the earth-shaking explosion, the security team activated their manual.

"Rangi, are you okay?"

When Shirone turned around, the stunned Rangi unconsciously nodded.

"Justin! How's that side?"

Justin climbed onto the stage, picking his ear.

"Everyone's safe. But this..."

Pony suddenly popped up.

"Shirone! Why are you here?"

"What about you? What about school?"

After thinking for a moment, she raised the corners of her mouth.

Justin shouted.

"They're coming!"

About 200 people were rapidly approaching from the point where the sniper-like bombardment had been carried out.

Even then, Pony, who had been pondering her answer, looked straight at Shirone with shining eyes.

"It's a tactical choice."

"Really?"

The corners of Shirone's mouth rose.

"I don't need to protect you, right?"

Following Pony's hands, rough water streams surged up and clumped together in mid-air.

"Are you kidding?"

Simultaneously, Shirone cast teleportation and descended below the stage as the Immortal Community charged in.

"Kill them! Kill all the pretty ones!"

'What the hell?'

Just looking at the Mecha equipped with Pipers, they were clearly citizens, but the reason for terrorism was too crude.

"They're terrorists! Execute them all on site!"

Security forces deployed to fight back, but the immortals' skills were truly one against a hundred.

"Hahaha! Pathetic earthly humans!"

Those with steel framework attached to their bodies jumped around like springs, and when they kicked, armor shattered with a clang.

'Probably strength assistance devices...'

The moment Pony, having grasped the mechanism, drew up the power of water, sharp wind flew in.

"Aaaaah!"

At the singing voice heard from behind, Pony's concentration soared dramatically as her specialty Water Dragon caused a flood.

"Wow."

Rangi wore a blank expression watching the massive water flow cover the blade winds and sweep away even the Mecha tribe.

"What are you spacing out for? You're also from a military academy, right? Grab anything and get ready to fight quickly."

Having given instructions, Pony looked back at Maya, who had cast sound magic moments before.

"Ah, um... hello? How have you been?"

"Tch!"

The reunion with the person who had directly caused her to fail the graduation exam wasn't entirely pleasant.

"Right. Let's catch up later, but first let's fight."

While a few people came to their senses, most contestants were paralyzed with fear.

"Kyaaaah! Save me! What are the guards doing!"

"Take me away! Do you know who I am! Stop fighting and evacuate me first!"

Thinking it was fortunate the audience couldn't hear this, Rangi approached Pony's side.

"From what I can see, those people are incredibly strong."

Though security forces were guarding the stage in double and triple layers, it seemed they'd be breached in an instant.

"You knew Shirone, didn't you?"

Rangi flinched with a guilty expression, hunching her shoulders.

"I think heaven helped us. I don't know which of us three they came for, but..."

Pony's prediction was wrong, but.

"At least we won't die here."

Where her gaze reached, Shirone was charging toward the enemies' leader.

"What are you doing!"

The woman with her face covered by cloth bearing Mecha's symbol flew into the sky laughing.

"Kekekeke! Why? Mad because I'm bullying the pretty girls?"

'I'll end this in one shot.'

Just as he loaded the Photon Cannon, Bodhidharma and Huike simultaneously attacked from the left and right flanks.

'Strong!'

Bodhidharma, falling harder than gravity, threw a straight punch downward.

"Elegant Vajra Fist!"

Wind pressure that seemed to stamp out the exact shape of a fist struck Shirone hard like steel.

'It's Avatar Technique.'

Shirone, placing Yahweh's sphere on his palm, struck the wind fist upward from below.

"Release."

With a pop sound, the Vajra Fist dissolved and spread massively into the atmosphere.

"Huh?"

Bodhidharma's eyes widened bizarrely.

'It's Vajra Fist because it doesn't dissolve. But...'

Huike charged.

"Vajra Nature."

His body, capable of transforming anything it touched into vajra, was covered in sharp diamonds.

"Stop! Huike!"

A flash of light directly hit Huike's solar plexus, and the diamonds shattered helplessly.

"Keok!"

As Huike's face was revealed with eyes wide in shock, Mortasinger's laughter abruptly stopped.

"Super Unification Theory?"

The ultimate power that Mecha pursues.

And the Norse call this Yahweh.
