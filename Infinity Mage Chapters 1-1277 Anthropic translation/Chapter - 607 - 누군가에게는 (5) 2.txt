[607] To Someone (5)

In the instant moment when Armand's blade wrapping around Shirone's body formed a framework, a disparity in speed occurred.

Unlike when the Diamond Armed activation had the robe cover his body imperceptibly, Shirone could clearly feel the flow of fibers shooting from the blade, while conversely, Nade was approaching at an incredibly fast speed.

'I can't match the timing.'

Before he could even transform into Diamond Armed state, Nade's claws raked from the top of Shirone's head down to his face.

'I have to reverse it!'

As he manifested Time Rewind, the reality of his face burning away scattered into a nightmare that never happened, and the claws passed before Shirone's eyes as he bent his upper body back sharply.

It was like lightning striking.

"Damn...!"

He had avoided the attack by reversing one second of the past into reality, but Armand had also regressed to its state before Diamond Armed was activated.

'Let's escape!'

He cast teleportation with all his might, but the Spark magic leaped through space like the movement of electrons, embedding Nade at the destination.

"Graaah!"

As if unable to bear the saturated state of electricity himself, Nade once again unleashed lightning in all directions.

The power manifested as the Spirit Zone perfectly synchronized with electricity was beyond the concept of human artifice, and as all the atmospheric charge discharged at once, a massive lightning bolt struck the ground.

KRAAACK!

There was no reason for it.

It was simply a massive lightning bolt.

"Damn! What the hell did you do to end up like that!"

Iruki shouted as he rolled down the hillside while holding Oscar.

If his mind had already assimilated with electricity, even escaping would be impossible.

"I... I didn't know."

Oscar, who had fed lightning to Nade, made pathetic excuses, but there was no time to be angry at him.

"Stay here! I have to save Shirone!"

Climbing up the hillside, Iruki saw Shirone who looked like he would be burned by Nade's hands at any moment.

'That can't even be cancelled.'

Only a god could do it.

"Nade! Snap out of it!"

Shirone shouted without giving up, but now even his voice couldn't reach him.

Thunder and lightning struck down, and Nade, clothed in plasma, suddenly approached right before his eyes.

'Diamond Armed!'

As he perceived one second into the future with Time Rewind, golden trajectories unfolded grotesquely, containing even Armand's countless transformations.

"Hnngh!"

Armand was equipped by a hair's breadth, and Akamai mounted outside the artificial brain activated Antithesis.

'It's not working.'

Taking away the will from a being without motivation for action changed nothing, and Nade's claws struck his side hard.

"Urgh!"

Silver metal from Ringer's armor plating stood out where the claws had struck, but the shock of electricity entering through the conductor was considerable.

'Scatter Movement!'

Seven photon cannons excluding Shirone scattered in all directions, but not one could even touch a hair on Nade's head.

'Then...!'

Creating distance, Shirone gritted his teeth and swung his tentacles.

Two tentacles created black afterimages as they writhed, then struck Nade at a speed invisible to the eye.

With a snap, the tentacles were caught by Nade's arms crossed in an X-shape.

"What...!"

As he clenched both fists, the tentacles burned with crackling sounds and broke off.

'That's the problem.'

Iruki bit his lips.

The power of Magic Assimilation was close to catastrophic, but more serious than that was the assimilation itself.

'He didn't see and catch it with his eyes.'

It was clearly sensory reception followed by reaction.

Like reacting and dodging the moment a stone thrown from behind touches your hair.

'That's the terror of 100 percent affinity.'

If the Spirit Zone was electricity, the reaction speed of his senses had already surpassed the realm of living beings.

This was the basis for Iruki's judgment that it would be difficult for the current Shirone to capture Nade.

"GRAAAH!"

Still, there were blind spots.

The more Nade's control was eroded by Magic Assimilation, the further he would drift from human thought.

As expected, he wasn't moving even in good moments, absorbing plasma charges according to natural providence.

"Nade! Please...!"

Flash! Thousands of wire-like electric strikes shot out from Nade's body.

In the intensely bright light that could blind them, as Shirone and Iruki briefly turned their heads, Nade had already arrived in front of Oscar.

"Aaaah! Someone save me!"

Shirone and Iruki leaped simultaneously, but Nade's hand was already aimed at Oscar, charged with electricity.

"Nade! Don't!"

"GRAAAAH!"

Just as Nade was about to burn Oscar's skull, Iruki shouted.

"It's the life Liz gave you!"

The electricity surrounding Nade flickered, and his claws stopped dead in front of Oscar's eyes.

"Hnngh!"

As Oscar, who had already lost his mind, burst into tears like a child while trembling in all his limbs, Iruki shouted again.

"If you cross the line, you can never come back!"

The electric charge surrounding Nade began to stabilize.

"Liz..."

A hoarse voice leaked out.

"She was everything to me."

"Save me! Please save me!"

He was only holding on with reason, but even for mages, death was frightening.

And for Oscar, who had already lost his reason, only the pitiful instinct to preserve life remained.

"That bastard actually controlled it."

The violence of Magic Assimilation awakened by lightning was on a different dimension from what Iruki had seen, but once again Nade had suppressed it.

"Shirone."

As Nade looked back at Shirone, alien memories floated in his mind like they belonged to someone else.

'I tried to kill him.'

Facing Shirone who was on full alert wearing Armand's robe, Nade said with tears in his voice.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

As soon as he finished speaking, Nade collapsed, buckling from his knees.

"Nade! Get a hold of yourself! Nade!"

Shirone ran over and shook him, but only a single tear flowed from his closed eyes.

"Mmm."

The first thing Nade saw when he woke up was the dormitory ceiling flickering between his eyelids.

"..."

He couldn't even think of getting up as he reconnected the scattered thoughts in his head.

"Huh? Iruki! Nade's awake!"

Shirone, who had entered through the door, called to Iruki in the hallway.

"Oh? Really."

Iruki's smiling face entered the vision of Nade, who still wasn't moving.

"Sleep well?"

"...How long has it been?"

Shirone said.

"A day and a half. It's almost evening now."

"I see..."

Nade, lost in thought again, asked after a while.

"What about Oscar?"

"He's alive."

He had thought this would be what Nade was most curious about.

"No, I remember that. What happened to him?"

Shirone exchanged glances with Iruki.

"I went to check the plaza this morning, and it was posted on the bulletin board. Oscar was accepted through special recruitment."

"..."

Whether he had persisted to the end even after going through all that chaos, or whether things had naturally worked out while his mind was elsewhere, there was no way to know, but it was probably the former.

"Oscar is also a mage, so he probably made the best decision."

"Yeah. Adults... live such difficult lives."

Iruki said.

"Nothing's more important than making a living."

"I talked with him briefly after you fainted, and Oscar said he hadn't intended to do that from the start either. He received a proposal from the branch manager's daughter at a social gathering in the capital and was going to come alone, but Liz insisted and even used her vacation time..."

"She did that to meet me."

Nade understood her feelings.

"What will you do now? Want to come to the press room with us? If you're really still angry..."

Nade's head turned to the side.

"It doesn't matter either way. Whether he gets a job at the association or not. I'm just worried about Liz. She must have left by now, right?"

"Probably so. She knows about Oscar's situation by now."

Nade closed his eyes.

"Let me rest a little more. I'm tired."

Shirone pulled the blanket up to his neck.

"Yeah, sleep a little more. We'll go eat dinner and bring some back for you too."

There was no answer, and Shirone and Iruki carefully left the room, watching their footsteps.

One hour later.

Shirone opened the door carrying dinner on a tray.

"Nade, at least eat this. Huh?"

Iruki, who followed him in, also looked around blankly.

The blanket was neatly folded, and curtains fluttered in the wind coming through the open window.

'He's probably already left, but...'

Still, Nade headed for the Dolphin Inn.

He had come with an empty heart, but the moment he peered inside through the inn's window, his heart sank.

"Liz..."

He could see the back of Liz sitting at the bar with her head down, empty liquor bottles lined up beside her.

At the thought that she too still had something keeping her here, tears welled up in Nade's eyes.

"Isn't that woman drinking too much?"

"Leave her alone. She probably got her heart broken or something."

Hearing the murmuring from behind, Liz downed another strong drink.

Her body naturally hunched over, and only her slender wrists precariously supported her heavy head.

"Why..."

Why had she come here following Oscar?

At the peak of happiness before her engagement ceremony with the man she loved, why had he been the person who came to mind?

"Graaah!"

The warehouse had completely vanished without a trace, and neither the wizard nor the mage were visible.

Struck by Ultrix's lightning, Nade couldn't suppress the murderous intent boiling up from his very soul.

'Damn! This is the first time!'

Though Magic Assimilation sometimes occurred instinctively, he couldn't control the electricity that had entered from outside.

"AAAAH!"

As electricity discharged, the area around Liz turned black and burned.

"Run away!"

Nade desperately suppressed his power and squeezed out the words.

"Nade! What's happening?"

"Go quickly! If you stay here, you'll die too!"

"Then what about you?"

She couldn't run away leaving behind the person who had saved her life.

"It doesn't matter. I'm already..."

Nade, whose thoughts arrived somewhere, twisted one corner of his mouth and said.

"A guy with no value worth living for anyway."

Abandoned by his family and turned into a monster, life held no meaning for him.

"No. I'm going with you."

Liz, having made her decision, approached.

"Are you crazy? Don't come closer."

The moment she touched him, she would be electrocuted, and if she wasn't in a Magic Assimilation state, she couldn't endure it.

"You just have to endure it. You're enduring it now, aren't you?"

Liz slowly extended her hand and placed it on Nade's shoulder.

"Nngh!"

At the thought that he couldn't kill her, he desperately suppressed his power, and vicious blood vessels rose on his face.

"Stop... please. I can't endure any more..."

"Then we'll die together."

Confirming it was effective, Liz squeezed her eyes shut and pulled Nade into a tight embrace.

"AAAAH!"

Simultaneously cutting off the electricity discharge, Nade writhed in agony.

"Let go! Just leave!"

"You can do it! Just a little more strength!"

"I have no reason to live anyway! It's better for someone like me to die!"

"Why don't you have a reason to live! You saved me!"

"Stupid, that was..."

At the moment of mental explosion when his limbs spread out, Liz kissed him.

"Mmph!"

As the soft woman's lips transmitted through his entire nervous system, his runaway mind began to gradually regain stability.

Nade embraced Liz's waist, and the two trembled in infinite freedom, entrusting everything to each other's actions.

Blue electricity.

That's how Liz defined it.

No matter how much time passed, it would remain forever as an afterimage - her first kiss.

"*sob* *sob*"

Liz's shoulders shook sadly as she buried her face in her arms, and Nade, watching from outside the window, also shed tears while covering his face with his palm.

"Waaah. Waaaah."

Sweet lies weren't necessary.

"*sob* *sob*"

There had been a time when just liking someone was enough.

"Waaaaaah. Waaaah."

So many things that had to be let go because of their purity.

Leaving all of those things behind, Nade's most brilliant school days were coming to an end.
