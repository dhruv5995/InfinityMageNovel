[592] The Incident of That Day (3)

"Do you happen to know me?"

Shirone asked.

"What are you talking about? How would I know you?"

As expected, the Miro he'd discovered when first entering Estas must have been the one who had met Shirone.

"I'm not sure how to explain this, but..."

It was the truth.

"I know you, Miro. I fought alongside you and learned many things from you."

Miro's face, which had been blinking for a moment, soon became serious.

"You succeeded."

She was referring to Guffin's mission.

"Then how long after time closed did you come here?"

"Nineteen years."

It was an encounter with a boy who had come from nineteen years in the future.

Shirone prepared his answers in advance, imagining the hypothetical questions Miro might ask - what became of her fate, whether she was living happily, how the final war turned out.

But what he heard was a cold voice.

"Why did you come here?"

"Pardon?"

"If the mission succeeded, you should have buried the incident by destroying Estas or whatever. Why did you come back in?"

"Well, that's..."

Frustrated, Miro continued.

"Did you really come in without knowing where this place is? An infinite temporal loop structure. Your entry must have twisted the incident! How are you going to take responsibility?"

As Shirone stood there speechless and dazed, Miro, who had been racking her brain, asked another question.

"Are you perhaps Fermini?"

He didn't want that kind of misunderstanding.

"No. I'm Shirone."

Shirone?

Miro frowned.

"Hmm. Shirone."

No matter how much she searched her memory, it was a name she'd never heard before.

"Anyway, don't do anything from now on. Stay outside the incident as much as possible."

"I can't do that. The reason I came here is..."

"I don't need to hear your reasons. Just prepare for the end of your life. When 'Hexa' dies anyway, this world will end too."

"What's Hexa?"

Miro pointed to the child in her arms.

"This child. Guffin plans to remove Hexa from the cosmic reset. Understand? If Hexa disappears, Ankera will destroy humanity."

Remove from the cosmic reset.

"Does that mean it won't disappear even if there's a reset?"

When he immediately got to the core of the matter, Miro was momentarily puzzled but soon accepted it.

'Well, there's no such thing as coincidence.'

The possibility of someone without that level of information infiltrating the upper levels nineteen years later approached zero.

"Right. Only Hexa can withstand Ra's reset. So you sacrifice yourself. Let me complete my mission."

Shirone gulped.

"Perhaps that child might be me."

"What?"

Miro, who had been looking at him incredulously, stared intently at Hexa's face.

"Now that you mention it, there does seem to be a resemblance."

While appearance changes with growth, the fundamental impression doesn't easily disappear.

"But I'm not sure. If you're Hexa, why did you come here?"

Shirone was frustrated by the situation of continuing hypotheticals.

"I might be Guffin's son."

"What?"

Miro's eyes widened greatly.

"So tell me. What exactly is happening here?"

"Haha..."

The laughter gradually grew louder until it peaked.

"Hahahaha!"

Since it didn't feel purely pleasant, Shirone was both bewildered and angry.

"Why are you laughing?"

"You're Guffin's son? No, that's absolutely impossible."

"How would you know that, Miro? Did you ask Guffin directly?"

"No, that's..."

Miro laughed again as if it were absurd, then continued.

"There's no need to ask. There's absolutely no way you could be Guffin's son."

"So how can you be so certain about that?"

Shirone's voice rose, but Miro looked even more bewildered.

"You really don't know? Guffin is the most famous mage in this world. There's no one who doesn't know that."

"How is that a reason?"

Finally, when Shirone raised his voice, Miro also shouted as if frustrated.

"You fool! Guffin doesn't look like us!"

Silence flowed.

"...What?"

Shirone's face went blank.

"Doesn't look... like us?"

Only then did Miro realize.

"Ah, was he erased?"

In Shirone's timeline, no being could accurately recall Guffin's appearance.

"Sorry. I didn't think that far. I haven't experienced erasure yet either. Anyway, you're probably not Guffin's child. You look completely different."

"You mean he's not human?"

Miro pondered seriously.

When a completely new intelligent species appeared, the question of which category to place them in was a matter decided through compromise between the individual and society's members.

"He's... human. At least he has all human characteristics, and Guffin claimed to be human too."

That's why Guffin was protecting humanity against heaven.

"But he's a species called ancient Gaians. For you to claim to be his child is rather..."

Shirone knew this fact too, but had never heard about the Gaians' appearance.

"Then what does Guffin look like?"

Miro rested her chin on her hand.

"Hmm, you'd be a bit surprised at first sight. Should I say mysterious? So his face is..."

As Miro carefully recalled Guffin's appearance, her eyes shook with shock.

"I can't remember."

"What?"

Instead of answering, Miro looked at Hexa.

Though still sleeping in her arms, his physical presence was gradually fading.

"This is terrible! The incident has been twisted! Hexa died in a later timeline!"

Because the beginning and end were connected, Hexa's death could affect the current Hexa.

"Huh? Huh?"

Shirone raised both hands with a panicked expression.

As Hexa's presence faded, Shirone's body was also gradually becoming blurred.

"Why is this happening?"

This proved it definitively.

"Hexa. You really are Hexa."

If Hexa dies, Shirone cannot exist either.

Furthermore, the fact that Guffin's memory was disappearing meant the temporal closed curve had opened.

In other words, it meant she would face Guffin's erasure without completing his mission.

"No!"

Miro jumped up and grabbed Shirone by the collar.

"Get away from these coordinates immediately!"

She didn't know what future would unfold, but creating variables was the only way to survive.

"But... where should I go?"

"Guffin's Gate! Come there! I'll fix Hexa there! That incident must be protected at all costs!"

Shirone nodded repeatedly.

"Quickly! There's no time!"

As Miro left the room, Shirone also cast Space-Time of Enlightenment and Eternity.

"Krrrrgh!"

Once again his head felt like it would split, and massive incidents were perceived in their entirety.

"Huff! Huff!"

The space was the same, but in a completely different timeline, Shirone fell forward and gasped for breath.

He was alive.

His physical presence was reviving once again.

'Why did Miro's mission fail?'

That was his first thought.

'I only met Miro.'

And he had never harmed Miro or intended to.

The only part he could guess was...

'Because I asked about Guffin.'

His curiosity about Guffin had caused things to go wrong.

'That means my future self's obsession with Guffin resulted in Miro's mission failure?'

Mission failure meant nothing other than Hexa's death.

'I have to go to the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society!'

That was where Guffin's Gate that Miro mentioned was located.

'Please don't let me be too late.'

After checking the warehouse marker, Shirone ran in the opposite direction from where Miro had gone.

Time: 12:53 AM
Location: Estas Warehouse 65

"Ugh."

In the wake of Miro's rampage, only corpses remained.

"Damn bitch."

The sole survivor was Lukang, an assassin from Mars Unit 1.

Despite his young age of twenty-three, he was talented enough to join Mars, the Tormia Kingdom's secret unit, recognized for his swordsmanship and excellent judgment.

"Thought I had it made in life."

Though it was a dangerous profession, he had confidence he could do well and his future had seemed bright.

'This is just telling us to go die.'

All 42 Mars members had written wills before coming here.

Not because they might die, but as a kind of death certificate, knowing they would never return.

'What good is patriotism?'

Honestly, he didn't want to do it.

He wanted to shout that he'd remove his Mars badge and quit right now, that he'd return to his hometown.

'What use is honor if you're dead?'

But no one did that, and in the end, everyone was dying.

Even refusing the mission would have meant death anyway, but if he was going to die such a dog's death, he should have at least struggled for appearances.

"Heh heh heh! Damn world."

As Lukang supported himself with both hands and backed away, only his crushed lower body from the pelvis down remained eerily in place.

'How do you fight a monster?'

If Miro hadn't been concerned about the child, his body would already have become jerky like his comrades.

'There's a limit to enduring with Schema too.'

As his strength faded, bloody fluid flowed down below his organs.

"Is this the end..."

Just as his eyes lost focus, the door opened and a group of people entered.

<Incident Coordinates>

Time: 1:01 AM
Location: Estas Warehouse 65

"Oh? There's a survivor..."

Behind the petite woman stood two men who looked powerfully built just from sight, and one tall woman.

"Yolga."

Lukang struggled to lift his head and take her in.

Her dark brown hair curved gently to cover her forehead, and her face was clear and transparent.

Though small in stature, she was a remarkable beauty.

"Damn it!"

Lukang contorted his face like a demon.

Against the inhuman monster Miro, the only ones who could possibly hold out were Yolga and her companions.

What did it mean to show up now when they hadn't shown a trace while Mars was dying off?

"Are you alright? You're badly injured."

Yolga approached, pulling back her hood.

"Badly injured? Does this look just injured to you? It's all because of you. Disgusting thing."

"Calm your excitement. It's dangerous."

"I'm going to die anyway. Everyone dies because of you."

Yolga closed her mouth.

"I know. If you hadn't seduced the king, Mars wouldn't have needed to deploy."

"I'm sorry. But we still need Guffin. We're not yet strong enough to handle heaven's army."

"Shut up! What do I care about heaven's army! I'm about to die and what does all that matter!"

"I'm sorry."

Watching Yolga bow her head, Lukang gathered bloody saliva in his mouth.

"Ptui!"

And spat on her face.

"You bastard!"

Edgar, the two-meter giant standing behind Yolga, swung his mechanical arm as he approached.

"Don't you have any convictions? Are you that afraid of dying?"

"I'm just bitter about dying a dog's death. We were never a match for Miro from the start. You must have needed meat shields."

"You don't have much life left, but I'll end it now."

As Edgar approached, clanging his steel fists together, Yolga raised her hand to stop his approach.

"If you have any last words, speak them. I'll convey them."

"Hmph, you won't make it back either. It's all over."

After grumbling and thinking for a moment, Lukang sneered.

"If you want to repent so badly, how about a kiss? You were quite something when I first saw you."

"..."

"Ah, did they say you were married? What does it matter, if we're all going to die anyway? Oh, but come to think of it, I don't have a lower body, do I?"

The more murderous intent swirled in the eyes of Yolga's companions, the better Lukang felt.

"Heh heh heh, anyway you guys too..."

Then Yolga slowly brought her face close.

"I'm truly sorry."

Grasping Lukang's face, she gave him a deep kiss.
