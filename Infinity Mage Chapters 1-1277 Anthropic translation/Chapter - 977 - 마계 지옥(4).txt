Demon Realm Hell (4)

The Jincheon Empire was one of the nations that suffered the greatest damage from the demons.

However, as a country that boasted the world's largest population before the war began, hundreds of millions of humans still survived there even now.

"Oh Satan."

Vassago, with multiple horns that were nauseating just to look at cascading down his back like hair, spread all four of his arms wide toward the sky.

"Dye the entire world with evil."

As the demon realm opened, cracks began to form in his muscular body as it turned gray and petrified.

Though his body maintained its form despite countless cracks appearing as if glued together, it suddenly crumbled in the gentle breeze, and the 3rd Legion Commander of Hell's army vanished.

In the quiet mountains where neither humans nor even demons were present, unbelievable changes began to occur.

The grass that had turned pitch black grew to heights exceeding dozens of meters, breaking the surrounding trees.

The winged insects fled, but they too began rapidly changing form due to incomprehensible causes and crashed to the ground.

Then animals began shrieking, and finally the entire mountain's landscape began transforming into an impossible harmony that couldn't exist in reality.

The chaotic energy that comprised Vassago was spreading in the form of radiation, causing biological mutations.

"We're too late."

Earth Dragon Gaitan looked down at the scene of the entire mountain moving alive like a giant monster.

Sirone spoke with a regretful expression.

"Vassago's ability is mental radiation. He spreads his psyche like waves to change the cells of living beings. Since the demon realm has opened, this is just the beginning. Countless mutants will enter human cities."

Even while speaking, mental radiation surged in, and sparks flew from Miracle Stream's defensive barrier.

White Dragon Astraiker, paired with Gaitan, observed the city beyond the mountain range and spoke.

"First, we should control human access. It would be good to confirm the range of the radiation."

"Right."

Unable to imagine what monsters awaited them, Sirone and the apostles descended into the mountain.

"Kraaaah!"

When 4th Legion Commander Gamagin opened the demon realm, the entire continental plate of the Ten Island Kingdoms began to shake.

"What the—!"

By the time Sirone caught him with Hand of God, the life force had already drained away.

"Messiah! Please take cover!"

As if coordinated, legion commanders from around the world were simultaneously opening demon realms.

'They have no intention of fighting.'

Since they were focused solely on opening demon realms, the only way to stop them was persuasion, but experience at Old Gustav had already shown this to be nearly impossible.

A clear earthquake from the demon realm's power launched all terrestrial creatures with legs into the air.

Landslides occurred in the mountain ranges, and tsunamis could be seen rushing in from the reddish sunset.

'Damn it!'

The water volume was massive enough to engulf all ten kingdoms on the islands before receding.

Hand of God expanded to its largest size and pressed down one wave, but tsunamis were rushing in from all directions around the islands.

And simultaneously, 5th Legion Commander Marbas in the Middle East opened the demon realm of explosion.

"I shall burn everything!"

Though it had just reached morning, the desert temperature rose rapidly and the oases began drying up.

People were already suffering from the heat, and wailing could be heard from the dried-up oases.

And again at Bashka's royal castle, Sirone was waiting for the dimly brightening dawn.

At the table, friends drunk on alcohol and sleep were snoring or talking in their sleep, and only Lian kept watch, sipping alcohol at regular intervals.

"The situation doesn't look good."

"Yeah..."

Though he didn't want to give his friends more information than they needed to handle, Lian was someone he could trust.

"While we were drinking, terrible tragedies struck around the world. Roughly 1.8 million deaths. The Ten Island Kingdoms suffered the most damage. There will probably be an emergency declared in the morning."

"...I see."

Lian followed his principle of not thinking about swords.

"Sirone, you should rest too. I'll take all our friends back to their quarters."

"No, let's do it together."

Lian carried the men stacked on his back, while Sirone lifted the women into the air with Miracle Stream.

That none of them showed signs of waking was partly due to exhaustion, but it also meant this was a place they could trust.

'That trust feels so good.'

Praying that they could rest even a little more comfortably, Sirone and Lian left the dining hall.

The next morning's situation was exactly as Sirone had expected, and honestly, worse than that.

Even though the central continent wasn't affected, the officials fell into a panic state and muttered the same words.

"All demon realms have been opened."

An emergency meeting was called, and everyone except Taeseong and Zulu, who hadn't yet regained consciousness, gathered at the royal castle.

Though the succession ceremony was scheduled for the afternoon, given the urgent situation, Pony sat on the throne.

The first thing she did after receiving the king's authority, even temporarily, was to look at Sirone.

"Did you know?"

"Yeah. Rather than knowing, I was there. Sorry. I tried, but stopping the demon realms was beyond my ability."

"According to the reported times, this was when we were together yesterday! Why didn't you tell us then—"

Pony closed her mouth.

Knowing wouldn't change anything, and Sirone was the only one who could take action.

"And there's an error in the report. Not all of them have been opened."

Sirone said.

"What I first ordered the Twelve Apostles was to find the locations of the legion commanders. That way I could use Simultaneous Events. Some I timed right, others I couldn't, but there's one legion commander I couldn't find."

"1st Legion Commander Baal."

Sirone nodded at Miro's words.

"Yes. And Baal's demon realm is Deadly Cross—meteor impact. What's different from other demon realms is that once a meteor collides, the planet itself is destroyed."

Taeseong could no longer protect the planet.

Sein asked.

"How can you guarantee Baal hasn't opened his demon realm? Meteor impact takes time. In other words, he might have already opened the demon realm and vanished?"

"There's an expert in this field. Someone who can survey space through Spirit Zone."

Amy made a dumbfounded expression.

"Sending Spirit Zone outside space? Who is it?"

Sirone raised his index finger and said.

"Ivory Tower 3-star resident Arnold Lampa."

Lampa's location was an uninhabited island in the middle of the sea, 200 kilometers east of Galiant.

"Demon realms are not phenomena. They are systems that exist prior to that."

There, Sirone discussed this demon realm—more precisely, Baal—with Lampa.

"For instance, it's about overturning laws. In that sense, it's the same type as the hidden codes of Sheol that the Five Stars mentioned. Just much larger and more complex codes. You could say there's a world with its own independent laws within the overall laws?"

"Yes. Jincheon, the Ten Island Kingdoms, the Middle East, and Old Gustav are no longer the environments we knew. I've requested cooperation from the World Climate Organization, but I don't know how effective it will be."

"What I'd like to tell you about that is this: I too can use detached-type Spirit Zone to draw in meteors from near space. It's magic called Meteor."

Lampa's satellite Chongi, who was listening from a short distance away, corrected the mistake.

"That might have been possible 30 years ago."

Though Lampa clicked his tongue at his disciple's poor timing, Sirone smiled at him.

"If Meteor directly draws in meteors, then Baal's demon realm is probably the principle of changing laws—the orbit of meteors. But even so, he can only use meteors within the solar system."

"How many are there?"

"Within distance to strike the planet in 30 days, there are 7,543. Of those, 1,411 have the mass to cause fatal impact. Additionally, even I cannot move these 1,411 meteors. They're not Meteor-class."

"Probably all of them will be used. When the demon realm opens, the meteors' orbits will be subtly altered."

"Yes. I've already checked, and there's no special movement so far. The demon realm hasn't opened yet."

"Understood. Please keep watching. If you notice anything strange, please inform me."

Lampa and Chongi bowed their heads.

Sirone in Bashka conveyed his entire conversation with Lampa to everyone.

Though it was fortunate that the demon realm hadn't opened yet, everyone looked disgusted.

"1,411 meteors?"

Just one meteor impact from Meteor magic would finish an entire city.

"It's okay. I'll look into that more. For the World Climate Organization side, I'll work with Pony to proceed."

Hearing this far, his friends also realized why Sirone only conveyed necessary information.

'This isn't my specialty. It's a problem I can't solve. If I listened to all of this, I wouldn't be able to do anything.'

As if reading Nade's thoughts, Sirone nodded.

"Now let's have a meeting about what we can do. First is the royal succession. Once Pony takes full authority of Tormia, I can effectively convey my voice to each nation."

A listening official asked with a worried voice.

"Which country will listen to us? Our military strength has already hit rock bottom due to the demon invasion."

"But we have the Holy War's Supreme Commander. Only Iruki knows the core technology of elemental bombs. Using this strategically, we can gain support from other nations."

"But then other countries will also be able to use elemental bombs. Isn't this rather dangerous?"

Though he had a point, his tone wasn't pleasant given that he was a close aide to Adolf XIII.

"Elemental bombs are important in war. The Light of Agape suppresses demons, but to deliver powerful force like above Bashka, we need the explosive power of elemental bombs. We'll make bombs but only use them in ways that utilize Agape."

This time Pony asked.

"Can we control it?"

"We have to. Let's create a task force. Mr. Rufist can manage it. Also, Nade Group can monopolize bomb manufacturing. With these two things, we can exert influence on other nations."

While the official completely shut his mouth, Miro asked.

"What about Heaven's army?"

"They're still scattered around the world. They're gradually gathering, but won't be able to act quickly."

"Why? Because Nane has gone into hiding?"

"That's an important part, but there's internal strife. The biggest incident is that Ikael sided with humans."

Pony's eyes widened.

"Really? How did you win over the enemy's commander?"

"I didn't win her over. She's my real mother."

Silence flowed through the hall.

Amy already knew, but the other friends couldn't close their mouths in surprise.

"An archangel—no, the Archangel is your mother?"

Even the officials held their breath and watched as Sirone met Amy's eyes and smiled.
