[408] Final Decision (8)

It was a gloomy day.

He rolled up his clothes and packed them, along with dried food and first aid supplies in case of emergency.

Gripping the fully loaded military backpack with his right hand, he stored it in Kubrick's slot.

Shirone, who had been examining Armand and its scabbard, stored even that in Kubrick's second slot.

Total load weight: 38.7 kilograms. It could be said he had packed optimally while leaving spare space.

"......"

After looking around the room to see if he had forgotten anything, Shirone checked the time.

Confirming it was close to midnight, he took out Maya's letter that he had carefully kept in his desk drawer and read it again.

Maya had begun to like Shirone on the day of the Supernatural Psychic Research Society's presentation.

When Shirone stood before Maya at the graduation class welcome party, she felt it was like destiny.

The reason she had asked who he wanted to kiss was actually half-joking, half-serious - the result of her absurd delusion that he might choose her.

Her heart was inscribed completely on the four pages of letter paper. Rather than decorating or packaging her words, it was a confession that put all her effort into conveying her true feelings.

*If you accept my heart, please come to the park at midnight two days from now.*

*Even if you don't come, I will never resent or hate you.*

*Just this once, I hope you'll show me your true feelings. I love you.*

Shirone folded the letter along the creases Maya had made and put it in the envelope. Then, as if handling something precious, he carefully tucked it into his inner pocket and pressed it gently with his palm.

"Maya......"

Shirone left his dormitory earlier than the promised time. How could he make her wait on a day like this?

When he arrived at the park, it was ten minutes early.

Under the only lit lamp, he waited for Maya to appear.

*Dong. Dong. Dong.*

The bell struck midnight.

Dark clouds thickened as wind and rain swept in. Thunder rumbled in the distant sky, then cold raindrops began to fall.

*Whoooooosh!*

Countless percussion instruments disrupted Shirone's hearing.

Water streamed down from his wet hair, and his clothes gradually grew heavier as they absorbed the rain.

Shirone kept watching the path Maya would walk down.

*Dong.*

The bell struck one o'clock.

Even then, Maya did not come.

*Splash, splash* - he heard someone walking behind him through the water.

Only after the raindrops falling on his head were blocked did Shirone finally turn around.

Amy stood there holding an umbrella.

The two simply looked into each other's eyes.

Amy hoped Shirone would speak first, while Shirone had nothing to say to her.

Amy's emotions, which she had been suppressing, finally exploded.

Resentment, anger, bewilderment, betrayal, and perhaps something even more desperate.

Gritting her teeth, she spoke in a trembling voice.

"Why did you come out?"

Shirone didn't answer.

"Tell me. Why are you here? Are you really with Maya......"

"It's none of your business."

Amy's heart sank with a thud.

She had known Maya would confess.

Even knowing this, she had given her consent out of confidence that she had seen Shirone's heart with her own eyes. Her regret after giving consent came from anxiety about Maya's courage.

Amy had paced anxiously around her room before finally being unable to bear it and running to the park.

Shirone had been waiting for Maya. And now he was looking at her with such cold eyes.

"No. That can't be."

Amy's voice choked up.

"What's wrong? You've been so strange lately. You're strange now too. Tell me! Tell me what's happening! If you don't tell me, I won't see you anymore either."

"Fine. I don't care."

Amy couldn't believe it.

Why did he have to treat her so coldly?

This wasn't the Shirone she knew. She was afraid.

For the first time, she became completely vulnerable before Shirone.

"Why? Why are you doing this? Why won't you tell me anything? Is it because I didn't do what Maya did? You fool, I also, I also......"

Shirone suddenly pulled Amy into his arms. There was no other way to hide his face that was about to crumple.

Hot tears mixed with cold rainwater and flowed down his cheeks.

"Amy, thank you for everything."

Overwhelmed with sorrow, Amy burst into tears.

She grabbed Shirone's collar and tried to push him away, but her hands only slipped.

"No. Don't hold me. Tell me! Tell me why you're doing this! You bad person!"

Her hands had no strength.

Time was pushing her back while a cliff waited ahead. For the first time, she wanted to turn back time.

Shirone smiled sadly as he spoke his final words.

"Goodbye, Amy......"

*Thud.*

The umbrella fell from Amy's hand. The sharp sound of rain rushed in enormously.

Even as Shirone left her and moved away, she couldn't move, wearing a dazed expression.

Tears welled up so she couldn't see anything.

"Ugh. Uugh."

The moment the sobs that had been blocked in her throat burst out, the sky rumbled and cried for her.

*Bang bang! Bang bang!*

Collie, the graduation class head teacher, woke up to the sound of knocking on the annex door.

Hastily putting on a robe and rubbing his sleepy eyes, he opened the door to find Maya standing there, soaked with rainwater.

"Maya? What's wrong at this hour?"

"Teacher......"

Unable to control her emotions, Maya threw herself into Collie's arms and burst into tears.

"Waaahhh!"

Though bewildered, Collie assessed Maya's condition. It seemed the priority was to calm her trembling body.

Collie put logs in the fireplace and lit a fire, then sat Maya down and handed her a towel.

He boiled cocoa and placed it in front of her, but she only stared blankly at the fireplace flames.

'She went.'

Collie instinctively knew that the day Maya had talked about was today.

Though he didn't show it during graduation class activities, she was a student he cared deeply about, having personally enrolled her in magic school and taught her.

'She's a tender child. She takes care of others' feelings but neglects her own.'

Collie had first seen Maya at the opening stage of singer Canaria's outdoor performance.

Commoners also had the opportunity to watch from outside the barricades, and the nobles seemed to like this arrangement.

So the performance planner went further and devised a strategy to highlight Canaria's excellence by having a commoner perform in the opening act.

That's how fourteen-year-old Maya was recruited.

But the planner's scheme backfired spectacularly. The fourteen-year-old girl's folk song was so beautiful it gave people goosebumps.

Naturally, the nobles felt displeased, and as soon as the song ended, they began pouring out jeers and criticism.

There were even nobles who called for the tribal chief and demanded he bring Maya to their beds for a large sum of money.

The chief attacked the nobles, was beaten nearly to death, and was driven away. Maya gave up her dream of being a singer that very day.

Collie had recommended the path of a mage to Maya.

Though her disposition was tender, she definitely had talent for magic, and she succeeded in entering the Spirit Zone within two years.

He didn't hope for her to become a great mage or anything.

If she could become a mage, raise up her tribe, and someday truly sing the songs she wanted to sing, wouldn't that be enough?

"Did Shirone not come out?"

Maya smiled slightly. It was the only happiness she could find in her pain.

"No. He came out. Foolishly, even though I told him not to come out like that. Even though it would be fine to cut off someone like me, he came out. For me, he waited for over an hour."

Maya covered her face with both hands.

"That's why my heart hurts. Because I like that Shirone so much. Because I want to be his woman."

"Why didn't you at least try talking to him? Maybe he really came out because he likes you?"

Maya shook her head.

"I knew from the beginning that I couldn't win Shirone's heart. Even knowing that, I confessed. Because I liked him so much, because I felt I couldn't bear it without telling him. So even knowing it was hell, I entered it."

Maya looked back at Collie with a frightened expression.

"But what should I do? It hurts so much. It hurts so much I feel like I might die. Will I be able to forget Shirone? Will I be able to return to how I was before meeting Shirone and live?"

Collie spoke his thoughts honestly.

"Maya, you can't erase past memories. That's something you'll have to carry for your entire life."

"I don't think I can. Being this hurt...... how......"

Maya finally broke down sobbing.

Collie approached and embraced her, patting her back.

"You don't need to be afraid. The wound won't disappear, but as you live, so many new wounds will appear that you won't know which one was left by Shirone. Then you'll be okay again. You'll just live like that."

Maya rubbed her face against Collie's chest.

"That's not living. Without any hope...... how can I live?"

"Maya, you don't live because of hope. You create hope in order to live. You won't be able to forget, but everything will be okay. You'll be able to create another hope."

"I don't want that. I want Shirone to come to me. I want Shirone to love me."

When you're cut by a knife, it doesn't hurt. What really hurts is from the moment you realize you've been cut.

So what Maya was feeling now wasn't pain but fear. Fear of the pain that was to come.

'Being tender-hearted will make it harder for her. But Maya, an artist is someone who speaks of humanity. You can never see humans by looking down from high places. So remember today's pain. Sing from the lowest place. Then someday everyone will comfort your wounds.'

Collie stroked Maya's back.

Like a baby bird with broken wings in a storm, her shoulders trembled pitifully.

3 AM.

Since he had never intended to sleep anyway, Shirone washed himself and changed into new clothes after returning to his dormitory.

Sitting at his desk and briefly blocking his thoughts, a sigh tinged with the aftermath of tears naturally escaped.

"Is everything settled now?"

He had withdrawn from the Supernatural Psychic Research Society. Nade had been very angry, but in the end embraced him and told him to come back no matter what he did.

And today he had finished his own farewell to Maya and Amy.

He wanted to cut all ties before going to heaven.

No, he had to.

If he had lingering attachments to this place, he would hesitate at the crucial moment. He would waver in situations where he absolutely had to die.

In the short time available, Shirone had settled all the relationships he could.

But the faces of precious people still came to mind.

Rian, Tess, and...... his parents who always only wished for their son's happiness.

He was glad he had told them he loved them before leaving home.

That was truly the best thing Shirone had done in his life.

He opened the drawer and took out clean letter paper. The farewells he couldn't finish in person would now have to be conveyed in writing.

Shirone, who had been spinning the pen tip with his finger, finally began writing on the paper.

*Last Will and Testament*

"Sob. Sob sob."

Tears flowed from sorrow.

He had wanted to graduate from magic school. He had wanted to experience the world with his friends. He had wanted to feel again the flutter he felt when he held Amy's hand.

"Mom......"

To Shirone, his parents were only Vincent and Olina. That fact would never change.

He should have known before going to heaven.

No, he shouldn't have met Ikael in the first place.

But he had come to know.

Though he hadn't shown it to anyone, the answer to the question he had carried in his heart his entire life was with her.

'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.'

Shirone wiped his tears with his sleeve as he wrote his will.

Gratitude to those who had helped him, stories of how happy he had been receiving so much love, respect for his parents.

All the things he had carried for nineteen years were being emptied out.
