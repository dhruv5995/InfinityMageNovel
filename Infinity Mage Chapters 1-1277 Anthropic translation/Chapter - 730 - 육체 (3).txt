[730] Flesh (3)

10 minutes before Rian realized the Heart Sword.

As Shirone stepped aside, Seongeum's finger pointed at empty air.

Embarrassed, she quietly lowered her arm.

"You're telling me to go first?"

Anshal had said you cannot collide with what doesn't exist, but Shirone was clearly right in front of Seongeum's eyes.

"No, you're running away. You know you can't beat me, so you're trying to smooth things over like this."

Turning toward Shirone, Seongeum pointed at Shirone's forehead with an even more resolute gesture.

"I am one step ahead of you. If you acknowledge the truth, then honestly admit your defeat."

Shirone thought for a moment, then bowed his head.

"I lost. You are above me."

"No!"

Seongeum was angry.

"That's not what I want!"

The victory Seongeum had envisioned, the feeling of being at the top, wasn't like this at all.

"Aren't you frustrated? You're about to lose your position as the world's greatest mage. If you're going to give up so easily, what did you come all this way for?"

'What did I give my all for?'

Now he seemed to understand.

"It was..."

Shirone placed both hands on his chest.

"To become who I am now."

"..."

Seongeum felt dizzy.

"Risking my life, fighting and winning so hard to get here..."

The truth was, he didn't want to fight.

"Fighting you, or raising my Kar score. Why? If I just step back one step..."

Shirone was happy.

"No one is unhappy. Maybe we could even become good friends. If you would concede one step."

"Concede... one step?"

Seongeum imagined walking side by side with Shirone.

'No.'

Next to Shirone was Mungyeong, next to Mungyeong were the warriors of Sambo, and next to them all of humanity holding hands...

"No!"

It was an imagination that denied Seongeum's life.

"It can't be that easy! Someone will try to use you! Someone will try to step on you to prove themselves!"

It's impossible to love everyone.

"Right. I don't mean to run away. Rather, I'll engage in battle even more actively. But no longer..."

Shirone's skin became even more transparent.

"I don't want to fight for illusions that don't even exist."

"Illusions? You call them illusions?"

What had she been fighting for all this time?

"Let's fight together. For everyone's happiness, not illusions. You should be able to do it."

You cannot collide with what doesn't exist.

Finally, Anshal's words pierced through the curtain in her mind.

'Together. All together...'

Seongeum stared intently at the hand Shirone extended, then slowly moved her arm.

'If I just take this hand...'

It would be such a simple thing.

'We would become equals.'

That thought blocked Seongeum's heart.

"I refuse, idealist."

Shirone's words were right in that everyone dreams of them, but unrealistic in that no one could achieve them.

"Don't mistake yourself for having given me an advantage. I will walk my own path. If the world needs saving, Jin Seongeum will accomplish it. That is the highest mission."

Mungyeong clenched both fists.

'Well done, Your Highness!'

Though he had been anxious when she gave up that advantage, she was indeed worthy of the noblest bloodline of the Jincheon Empire.

'That's how you should go. Without looking back, just advance toward the highest place.'

Seongeum turned away coldly.

"Let's go back. There's no La Enemy here either. We'll enter the last remaining labyrinth and subdue Nane."

Just then, a tearing sound of ripping air came from outside Andre.

"What's that?"

The Sambo warriors all turned around simultaneously.

"There seems to be someone outside too. Shall we check?"

Mungyeong couldn't give orders.

'That's the sound a sword makes.'

Being a master among masters, what he could tell was that it had been swung at unimaginable speed.

"Huh? What?"

Feeling a strange heaviness right after hearing the sound, Jiks pulled Ymir's molar from his pocket.

"Hey, this..."

Strangely, it felt heavier than before.

"Aaaaah!"

Eventually it became too heavy for human strength to hold, and Jiks collapsed with a thud as his shoulder dislocated.

"Sa-save me! This, this!"

He screamed with his hand stuck to the floor, but none of the Sambo could approach.

With cracking sounds, all five of Jiks' fingers broke and were drawn into Ymir's molar.

Crack. Crack.

The twisting that started from his hand spread throughout his body in a horrific scene, and just as Jiks couldn't even make a sound of pain.

With the sound of hundreds of bones breaking, everything clumped together toward Ymir's molar.

As the mass of flesh the size of a human torso continued to compress, the sound of waves could be heard through Seongeum's ether.

"Stand back! It's a gravity wave!"

We still don't know the true meaning of gravity.

'Mass enough to crumple a person?'

To beings of the five senses, gravity is converted to mass, but Anke Ra, who once dreamed of the universe, defined it like this:

How fiercely does one exist?

"It's awakening! We must evacuate!"

Before Ymir's battle instincts awakened, it was just a single molar.

"Shut up! I will never run away!"

But the presence of flesh emanating as the mind that integrated 10 billion humans awakened was...

"Your Highness! It's Ymir!"

A powerful presence nailed into spacetime, unshakeable by any waves of the universe.

"Who awakened me?"

The regeneration that started from the molar formed a face, and flesh quickly regenerated along the shoulder line.

"That, that is..."

Even Mungyeong, who was worried about Seongeum, was mesmerized by the figure of one who appears in myths.

Nearly 3 meters tall with broad shoulders.

A sturdy lower jaw, and following an even thicker neckline, arms as thick as logs bent at his sides.

The King of Giants, Ymir (Molar).

As his flesh regenerated, the gravity waves disappeared, but just his existence made the surrounding space feel like it was rippling.

"What are you guys?"

Even with two candidates for the Ivory Tower present, Ymir looked around disinterestedly as if he didn't care.

"Where is this? Why did I wake up?"

Though it was part of the main body, it wasn't perfect, so the memories carved in flesh were fragmentary.

When Ymir took a step, the ceiling shook with a thud.

"Hmm."

As the Sambo warriors created distance, Ymir alternately looked at Shirone and Seongeum.

"Not bad. But boring things."

Since the molar had separated from the main body long ago, Ymir's brain had no memory of Shirone.

"Are you Ymir?"

Jin Seongeum was the first to step forward.

"Indeed, you have a solid appearance befitting the title of king. I heard you absorbed 10 billion humans..."

Ymir's face twisted frighteningly.

"Your next words will determine your lifespan."

As long as she didn't bring up what he didn't want to hear, Ymir was ready to peacefully fall back asleep.

"Those 10 billion people, could they kneel before me?"

"Kekekeke."

Ymir's eyes rolled back and his fighting spirit rose, causing dust to fall from the labyrinth ceiling.

"Wrong."

The Sambo warriors burst out.

"Kill him! Protect Her Highness!"

Befitting the empire's finest elite, their speed was lightning-fast, but the moment they made eye contact with Ymir, they realized.

'We'll be shattered.'

The mind struck Sambo's heads first.

Divine Transcendence.

Heart Fist.

Following that, as Ymir's fists swung in all directions, the faces of all 18 Sambo members exploded like watermelons.

"Kahahaha!"

Among the 18 faceless warriors falling, there was only one who hadn't been struck by Ymir's mind.

'I'll kill him!'

It was Daeseok, Sambo's vice-captain.

"A decent reaction after a long time?"

As Ymir grinned widely and raised his fist toward him, Daeseok bent his upper body back with all his might.

'I wasn't hit!'

The fact that his mind was still intact was proof.

'Right in front of my eyes...!'

Just as he measured the distance with superhuman eyesight and raised his sword, Ymir's fist stopped with a pop.

"Aaaaah!"

In the tremendous wind, the skin on Daeseok's face was blown away.

"Aaaaah!"

All his hair was pulled out, his pupils burst, and his ears were torn off.

Aaaah.

When the screaming finally stopped, before Ymir stood a skeleton with no skin, kneeling.

"Dae, Daeseok..."

Mungyeong couldn't accept the miserable end of someone with similar skills to his own.

"My body's gotten quite stiff."

As if everything so far had just been a warm-up, Ymir rolled his shoulders and looked back at Seongeum.

"One person."

Seongeum's shoulders trembled.

'Flesh?'

Weren't humans, weren't living beings great because they had minds?

"Your Highness, please withdraw. I'll hold him off."

Having accepted Daeseok's death, Mungyeong blocked Seongeum's front and raised his sword.

"Run away."

Shirone said.

"There's no need to create more sacrifices. You can escape. Leave this place now."

"So it was all just words in the end?"

Seongeum narrowed her eyes and shot back.

"Does your talk of fighting only apply to opponents you can beat? And yet you ask me to concede one step?"

"I'll stop him."

Setting aside the 19,000 Shirones, he couldn't leave as long as Rian and Kido remained.

"This is my labyrinth. Take your subordinates and withdraw."

Honestly speaking, even with Seongeum's abilities, there was no guarantee she could escape from Ymir.

"I'm the one who brought that giant."

Seongeum passed Mungyeong and approached Ymir.

"I'll take responsibility."

"No! If you get close...!"

Before Shirone could finish speaking, Ymir struck the ground and launched his body.

With a thud, the ground collapsed, and Ymir's body rushed toward Seongeum at terrifying speed.

Ether Wave.

Theater.

As the ether vibrated, space began to ripple outward from her center like waves.

"Your Highness...!"

Mungyeong's voice flew to the ends of the world.

"Kahahaha!"

Ymir's laughter echoed oppressively.

'How?'

If spatial wavelengths were expressed as rapids, Ymir's presence was as fierce as a rock splitting the rapids in two.

'I must push him away!'

Hearing the sound of gravity wave tides spreading from Ymir's body, Seongeum bit her lips.

"You use an interesting technique."

Ymir's voice wandered around like a rubber band, sometimes distant, sometimes close.

"The type I hate most."

The vibration's range spanned from world's end to world's end.

The moment she made eye contact with the foremost of the immeasurably shaking Ymirs.

Seongeum realized.

'I'm hit.'

The mind struck first.

'I can't avoid it.'

In the time stretched to its limit in an instant, Ymir's fist slowly flew toward her forehead.

Against the highest blow a living being could achieve, Seongeum's body couldn't function in any way.

'Am I going to die?'

That was all the thought that could fit in such a brief moment, and just as Ymir's fist was about to break through Seongeum's advantage.

'Sibulsangpokmaei!'

Shirone, who had countered space waves with time waves, was approaching by flowing against the ether waves.

'You too?'

As both were breaking through the iron wall, Seongeum's pride crumbled and she expanded Immortal Function to its limit.

Ether Wave.

Super Theater.

Shirone was pushed away again, but Ymir alone still held his position.

The fist that seemed like it would be pushed back but wasn't, once again pushed through the entire atmosphere as it approached Seongeum.

'This is the end.'

Just as Seongeum's ego was about to shatter into pieces in her infinitely expanding consciousness.

Time's seesaw began to regain balance.

'How?'

In the ether spreading at light speed, someone was approaching at tremendous speed against the current.

'That's impossible...!'

Now Seongeum's head was faster than Ymir's fist, and in her eyes she saw Shirone deploying a black and white magic circle.

'Valhalla Action!'

What Shirone, who had drawn in all 19,000 people's time and reversed cause and effect, had leaped over was.

"..."

Jin Seongeum's one step.

'Got it! I caught her!'

Just as he grabbed Seongeum's waist and launched his body, Ymir's fist crossed through empty air.

KWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWANG!

The wind pressure pushed away all the ground as it advanced, then exploded with a pop deep in the cave.

Ymir's face twisted horribly.

"Graaaah!"

His Heart Fist had been broken.
