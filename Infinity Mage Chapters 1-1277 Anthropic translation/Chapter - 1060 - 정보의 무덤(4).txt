Grave of Information (4)

When they arrived at the counter, a woman with black hair flowing down to her shoulders greeted the two of them.

"Hello. This is the High Gear user registration page. Is this your first time for both of you?"

She looked human, but there were seam lines on her face with small bolts embedded symmetrically on both sides.

It was crude if you could call it that, but somehow the mechanical aura she gave off seemed like it might be someone's taste.

"This friend here is new, but I have a user code. Can I register now?"

"Yes. Please tell me your code name."

"Son of Yolga. Dongguk."

When Sirone turned his head with a surprised expression, Fermi shrugged his shoulders.

The woman's eyes sparkled.

"Oh my, you're a ranker. Dongguk ranking 7th, Son of Yolga. It's an honor to meet such a distinguished person."

Fermi smiled mysteriously with his eyes.

'Her acting is top-notch. Well, with a mechanical face, she probably doesn't need to put in much effort.'

Tutorial administrator Magneti.

There was no way she, who managed High Gear's real-time users, wouldn't know Fermi's true identity.

Magneti manipulated the screen as she spoke.

"According to High Gear regulations, a special privilege is activated for Son of Yolga who registered a new user. As a 'New Face' reward, 100 million galactic credits will be provided."

Sirone looked at Fermi intently.

"Hey."

"We should take what we can get. Don't worry. I'll use the 100 million galactic credits on you."

"Forget it."

Sirone didn't want to get involved any further.

"I didn't come here to play High Gear. You said I could contact an operator here."

"You're so impatient."

Fermi asked Magneti.

"Could you pass along a message to High Gear's original designer? It's urgent."

"Designating a specific operator goes against regulations. If you have suggestions, please tell them to me."

"As expected..."

When Fermi seemed about to give up, Sirone approached Magneti.

"It'll just take a moment. Once you hear my story, the operator will change their mind too."

"I'm sorry, but I cannot approve that. High Gear's operators follow their own regulations."

"Operators? Then you're not an AI. Are you human from the planet I'm on?"

"...That question exceeds my authority."

Though her voice was monotone, Sirone didn't miss that her reaction was slightly delayed.

"You know too, don't you, what situation humanity is in right now. The fate of the world is at stake."

"Huh? The fate of the world..."

Magneti's mechanical face began to twist strangely as she savored those words.

"Pff..."

And finally, she couldn't hold it in.

"Puhahaha! The fate of the world? This is killing me! It's more serious than I thought!"

"What's so funny about that?"

As killing intent slowly crept into Sirone's expression, Fermi clicked his tongue.

'As expected... In the underground coder full of fakes and anonymity, 'sincerity' was nothing but a laughingstock.'

"I'm asking what's so funny!"

When Sirone glared, Fermi said.

"Calm down. This is a virtual world. Nobody cares whether the world ends or not."

"How can you say that? Do you know how many people died fighting? Is this reality funny to you? Not a chance. You've just run away from reality."

Fermi felt hopeless about how to make him understand.

"Sigh. So this place is..."

That's when Magneti's laughter disappeared.

"You can think whatever you want, but verbal abuse toward operators can result in penalties. You could be blocked from accessing High Gear for a certain period, or permanently banned."

"Go ahead and try."

Light from Miracle Stream blazed from Sirone's body.

"If I attack this place, would you still be able to laugh? Would you realize what reality is then?"

"I can just reconnect."

Sirone's eyebrows twitched.

"On the other hand, you'll be permanently banned and never see me again. That's the worst thing that can happen in this space. So do whatever you want."

"Mr. Sirone."

Sirone had never revealed his name.

"This sounds ridiculous coming from me, but I'm so angry I'll play along just this once. This isn't reality. You don't know what kind of person I am outside. I could be a fighter battling for the world, or I could be the kind of villain you so despise."

Fermi agreed.

"Right."

"I also don't know who you are. Of course, I've heard the name - you're famous. Right now you're spouting off about saving the world in this place, but how would I know? When you wake up from this dream, you might be using your power to enjoy yourself to the fullest."

"I would never...!"

"Whether that's actually true or not doesn't matter. What really matters is that nobody cares. That's what the underground coder is like. So please leave reality in reality and maintain manners here. Your seriousness is making the users here uncomfortable."

Fermi kept nodding his head.

'Right, that's exactly what I was trying to say.'

"I don't understand."

Sirone clenched his fists.

"Whether it's reality or the underground coder, it's the same people. Even if it's not a real body, I'm talking to a person right now. Why are you turning away? Your world is being destroyed!"

"...What a pain in the ass."

Sirone was frustrated.

"How can I prove it? If I kneel down here, will you believe my sincerity?"

Magneti snorted.

"Kneel? There are countless people who want to become dogs and bark, feel the pleasure of being murdered, and become corpses. A serial killer from reality takes care of the sick here. Still don't get it? It's all fake."

"Fine."

Miracle Stream shot up to the ceiling.

"Then I'll destroy that fake. So go back. Go back, open your window, and look outside."

Magneti's hand moved to the screen.

"...Attacking an operator results in permanent banishment. I clearly warned you."

In the tense moment on the verge of action, Sirone threw himself toward Magneti.

"Wait..."

Just as Fermi reached out his hand.

"Please."

Sirone, who had stopped in front of the counter, placed his hands on the floor.

"I want to save the world. Too many people are suffering. There's no way to convey sincerity, so you might be getting fooled by me, but..."

Even so.

"Couldn't you just let yourself be fooled? Maybe this way we could save someone, even one more life."

Magneti glared at Sirone.

The mechanical face that had been full of emotion grew cold again.

"Sigh."

Finally, she opened her mouth.

"What should I tell them?"

Sirone looked up with a surprised expression.

"There's one thing you should know. Though we're both operators, I'm not in a position to give orders to the Operator. If it's a strange message, they won't even respond."

Sirone jumped up.

"Yes! That's fine. Just tell them that Sirone, no, Yahweh wants to meet them..."

"Fermi."

Fermi interrupted.

"Tell them that Ardino Fermi has brought a very big business proposal. And that they'll definitely be satisfied."

Then he looked at Sirone and shrugged.

"It's better if I do it since I've done business under my real name before. The name Yahweh won't work here."

"Alright. I sent it."

Magneti finished the transmission, but even after waiting 5 minutes, there was no response.

As if she had expected this, she said.

"As expected, no response..."

*Beep beep.*

At that moment, an alarm message appeared on the screen installed in the counter.

'It really came.'

Honestly, even she hadn't expected it.

"A response came. I'll play it now."

As Sirone and Fermi kept their mouths shut, a heavily compressed, modulated voice flowed out.

*Screw off.*

That's it? That's the end?

While Sirone made a dumbfounded expression, Magneti rested her chin on the counter and said.

"Even this is exceptional. The underground coder is a festival of countless role-playing, but the Operator's personality is genuinely eccentric."

Fermi agreed.

"If my name doesn't work either, there's no other way. Let's go into High Gear and find a method."

"But they did respond."

Sirone didn't give up.

"If they really weren't interested, they wouldn't have even said to screw off. Let's try once more."

"No, that's..."

When Sirone poked his side, Fermi raised both hands and was pushed toward the counter.

"Alright. I got it."

Fermi looked at Magneti.

"Could we send one more message?"

Since she thought Sirone's words made sense, she readily nodded.

"Sure. What should I send?"

"Hmm."

Fermi's eyes changed.

"I'm thinking of putting a recording device presumed to contain data from the outside world up for conditional auction..."

Sirone's head turned quickly.

"The conditions are three things. First, someone capable of decoding the records. Second, sharing the accessed data with me. Third, the auction goes to the first bidder."

As she tapped the screen, Magneti swallowed her saliva.

"However, since we're not strangers, if you're interested, I think it would be fine to deal privately. That's all."

Sirone's eyes narrowed as he looked at Fermi.

'I knew he'd have a way.'

Anyway, you have to poke him to get him to talk.

"Sent."

The moment she finished speaking, a loud bell rang and Magneti blinked.

"Code name Operator is requesting voice chat with operator privileges. Do you accept?"

There was no need to ask.

When Fermi nodded, an agitated voice that even modulation couldn't hide came through.

*Hey, what are you? Using the operator channel privately? I thought you were smart.*

"Either way, it's an intriguing proposal, isn't it?"

*Don't get the wrong idea. I connected because I was so annoyed. You think I'd lose in a first-come-first-served situation?*

"Actually... that's not confirmed yet either."

*Where are you trying to sell drugs? The fact that you mentioned an auction means you haven't found a way to decode the recording device yet. To prevent the resulting drop in value, you chose the extreme competitive method of first-come-first-served, right?*

'So picky as always.'

Fermi's expression didn't change at all.

"Of course that's true, but the situation is a bit delicate. If you don't accept the proposal, it'll go to some random guy. There's one robber next to me pointing a knife at me."

*What's that supposed to mean?*

Sirone stepped forward.

"Hello, Mr. Operator. I'm called Sirone. I heard about the Abyss..."

*Shut up. I didn't connect to you.*

Sirone felt a surge of anger.

*Sirone? You think something will change because Yahweh butts in? I don't need that kind of recording device.*

Fermi smiled with his eyes.

"Come on, that's not true. Just looking at what you buy at auctions, I can guess what you're obsessed with."

"Let's not do this and work together. Good things are good things, right? Just make me one program to use in the Abyss."

A moment of silence passed.

*No way. I have to do the Solar War. Aren't you going to? You'll get eaten by the Western Kingdom.*

Sirone stepped forward again.

"Mr. Operator, I don't know what the Solar War is, but..."

*If you don't know, screw off. Why do you keep butting in? And how do you not know about the Solar War? Stupid.*

Blood vessels bulged in Sirone's neck.

"I don't know. But is that more important than human lives?"

*Haha! You talk big. You think you're still Yahweh here? If you're confident, come find me. If you beat me in a duel, I'll grant any request.*

Fermi sighed.

'I don't like this.'

Defeating the Operator, who was ranked 1st in the Western Kingdom and 1st overall, in a one-on-one fight was nearly impossible.

"Fine!"

Sirone shouted.

"You just wait right there! I'll completely smash this High Gear thing or whatever!"
