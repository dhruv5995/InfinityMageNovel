The Presence of Absence (4)

Ymir's face contorted.

More than the weight he was currently feeling, the unit of continuously increasing pressure was truly eerie.

'What the hell is this now?'

Just as Ymir's knees were about to buckle under the limitlessly rising pressure.

Kuuuuuung!

The ground collapsed first, sinking about 3 meters deep.

"Hmm."

Gaold's expression as he glared down at Ymir buried in the ground was unexpectedly serious.

'He endured it?'

Only Gaold knew what a mere 3-meter-deep crater meant.

"What, what is it?"

Shirone's group looked around.

If the atmospheric pressure was enough to buckle Ymir's knees, the city should have been blown away already.

"What happened?"

Just as Tess was muttering, a fierce, tearing voice came from across the sky.

"You stupid bastard!"

Looking up, they saw Minerva riding a jet, rapidly diving toward the ground.

Upon arrival, she approached Gaold and grabbed him by the collar, pulling him close.

"Are you insane? It's not for someone like you to act up while Taeseong sacrifices herself! At this rate, if the city gets blown away...!"

When Amanta, Freed, Ting arrived from behind with Taeseong, she turned her head.

"Hah. Hah."

As expected, Taeseong's eyes were half-rolled upward as she breathed heavily.

'Gaia's ability.'

She, as the avatar of the star, had absorbed all the impact Gaold had inflicted on the planet moments ago.

Miro, realizing the situation, looked toward where Ymir was with a newly shocked expression.

'Yet the ground was still crushed...'

It meant Taeseong's condition wasn't normal.

Shirone approached her.

"Are you okay?"

Taeseong, having recovered from the shock, smiled.

"Don't worry. A star doesn't perish from this level of impact. It's fine."

Though Shirone knew this too, it was also true that the pain she endured was separate from the impact itself.

Taeseong looked around and asked.

"Where is... Ryan?"

Shirone couldn't answer, and sensing the atmosphere, she changed the subject.

"Listen carefully. The reason I came here is to seal Ymir."

Though it was welcome news to hear, it didn't feel realistic at all.

'Seal Ymir?'

He was a creature of pure strength that even Shirone's Hand of God couldn't completely subdue.

Taeseong extended her hand.

"Shirone, give me the key to Planet Hexa."

It was the planet she had received as a gift from Taeseong when she became one of the Five Great Stars of the Integrated Space Management Department.

"Ah..."

As Shirone took out the pendant from her chest, Taeseong received it and said.

"I will now activate the law of the Five Pointed Star."

In the number of laws, 5 symbolizes 'external force,' and all types of summoning and sealing belong to this category.

Particularly what Taeseong was attempting now was literally the Five Pointed Star using stars and planets.

"These damn things keep coming."

Hearing the conversation from the pit, Ymir clenched his fist and his body floated into the air.

Shirone's group once again made disgusted expressions at the sight of him overcoming gravity with pure muscle strength.

Landing on the ground, Ymir asked Taeseong.

"You're going to seal me?"

"That's right. Unfortunately, your existence is meaningless to the universe. If you weren't influencing anything it would be different, but now that you've started acting, I have no choice but to use this method."

Ymir slowly raised his knee.

"Is that so?"

The next moment, he struck the ground with a thud, and tremendous shock settled into Taeseong's avatar.

"Ugh!"

"Taeseong-nim!"

As the Five Great Stars hurriedly supported her, Ymir looked down at the ground he had stomped.

"Hmm, quite solid."

Where he had struck with the resolve to collapse the entire area, only the shape of his footprint was imprinted.

"I'll give you some credit. But can you really stop me with just that much?"

Even the law of 'Legal Death' couldn't find a way to annihilate Ymir's existence.

"I can do it."

Taeseong hung 5 pendants on her fingers and pressed her hands together as if in prayer.

"Please stop Ymir for a moment."

Though those gathered here were unprecedented powerhouses in the world, no one could answer.

The only times Ymir had ever stopped were when he chose not to move himself.

"An interesting game. I'll gladly play along. But shouldn't I have a goal too?"

Ymir lowered his stance and said.

"The game ends the moment I kill you."

"Block him!"

Shirone's group moved simultaneously.

Hand of God, Solar and Lunar Halo, and now even Ting's law of 'Penetration' all acted upon Ymir.

Freed charged forward.

'Taeseong is preventing the planet's destruction.'

Though it was truly heartbreaking to see her in pain.

"...This is it, isn't it?"

The fighting spirit of a swordsman facing the strongest enemy naturally pulled at the corners of his mouth.

"Hiyaaaah!"

Steel magic was engraved on his sword.

'I'll cut off at least an arm.'

As he swung his body to the limit of his schema, a massive iron ring created afterimages.

Though not quite reaching the realm of Breaking Heaven, Ymir had also absorbed his fill of binding laws.

A thrilling sensation struck Freed's mind.

'It connected properly.'

That's what he thought.

Until his sword engraved with steel magic shattered into pieces with a clang.

"Ticklish."

What Freed saw was...

'Ah.'

Not Ymir's fist, but his son's figure smiling in a tunnel of light.

'Son, daddy is...'

Before he could even finish smiling, Ymir's fist burst Freed's face.

"Freed!"

As the headless corpse still stood upright, Amanta threw the World Wheel fiercely.

Kiiiiiiing!

Even trapped in Gaold's Vacuum Press, Ymir twisted his waist and caught the World Wheel.

"Huh?"

With cracking sounds, all of Ymir's fingers caught in the spokes broke.

'Got him!'

Balance of the world.

If Ymir was an existence that soared infinitely above the universe's average, at minimum his torso should be blown away, but.

"Graaaah!"

With three fingers broken, Ymir gripped the wheel tightly.

The moment the World Wheel shattered with a crack, Amanta suddenly had this thought.

'Perhaps the world has already...'

Tilted so much that it no longer allows balance.

"Taha!"

Amanta's body was torn to shreds by Ymir's fist wind, and everyone could only watch.

"Haha."

Arius laughed helplessly.

'If he's so strong that he can't sense the universe... he's something that shouldn't exist in the first place.'

Shirone's eyes glared fiercely.

'Ankera.'

How contradictory it was.

The fact that an existence meant to ensure world stability had created such an absurd monster.

'Integration of 10 billion Gaians.'

The fact that most users' authority was contained in a single entity was a cosmic monopoly on power.

'Everyone will die at this rate.'

The reason damage had been minimal so far was because all the fighters knew their own limits.

'I have no choice but to take a risk.'

Ataraxia.

Physical Realm.

As his mind transcendentally amplified, Hand of God's ability values drew a massive upward curve.

"Ugh!"

Ymir's movements became sluggish.

But as expected, Shirone's solo Ultima System could only go this far.

"Quickly! I can't maintain the Physical Realm for long!"

Miro shouted.

"Gaold! Press down!"

Air Press was cast immediately, and once again the giant's body was buried deep in the ground.

"Now! Attack!"

The moment all firepower concentrated on Ymir, the power approached G3 level, the standard for teleportation mages.

"You bastards!"

Breaking through Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's palm like glass, Ymir charged at Taeseong.

"I'll kill you!"

There were no more means to stop him, and his massive fist flew toward Taeseong's face.

"I won!"

Thud!

Shock swept through Shirone's group, who thought everything was over.

"H-how?"

Ymir's fist trembled in midair, unable to reach Taeseong.

Tears flowed down Tess's cheeks.

"Ryan!"

A human form appeared faintly in front of Taeseong, and biological tissues began attaching to it.

"A final struggle?"

Having no interest in an enemy already defeated, Ymir coldly amplified his power.

"Huh?"

His arm wouldn't extend.

"Graaaah!"

Though his power rose endlessly, Ryan's mind was rising to the same level.

'Divine Transcendence.'

If you will it, you make it so.

'Don't imagine.'

The moment you think about what you can and cannot do, the world of thought closes.

'With the form called 'I' completely erased...'

The ultimate realm of the physical.

'Just reach it!'

Physical Transcendence.

Divine Transcendence.

As Idea's bandwidth expanded, signals shot out at incomparable speed.

Ryan's body recovered instantly, and while gripping Ymir's fist, he twisted it.

"Ugh!"

Though the time his arm twisted was brief, it was the first incident of Ymir succumbing to force.

'Now's the time.'

Taeseong's eyes lit up as she spread her arms.

"Law of the Five Pointed Star."

The 5 pendants that turned to light were fastened like handcuffs to Ymir's hands, ankles, and neck.

"Teleportation."

As planets from distant parts of the universe pulled at Ymir's body, his limbs spread wide.

"Graaaaaaah!"

As Ymir strained with veins bulging in his neck, his limbs gradually moved toward his body's center.

"Damn it!"

But ultimately unable to bear the weight of the planets on his hands, feet, and neck, his body spread out again.

'This won't work.'

If he stubbornly persisted like this, his face and limbs would be torn off.

"It won't take long."

Squeezing out his last strength, Ymir trembled as he looked down at Taeseong.

"Wait for me."

The moment he finished speaking, Ymir's body transformed into light along with the 5 stars and disappeared.

Minerva asked.

"What happened? Is he dead?"

"No, unfortunately not."

After sensing something for a moment, Taeseong displayed a vision with a serious face.

"See for yourself. This is Ymir's current state."

Miro's face turned pale.

"Good heavens..."

In the middle of the vast universe, Ymir floated fixed at the points of the Five Pointed Star.

Tess asked.

"Are those twinkling things stars?"

"Stars? No."

Shirone bit her lips tightly.

"They're galaxies."

Dozens of galaxies stretched across the distance from Ymir's face to his feet.

"Yes. Using stellar keys warps space for planetary teleportation. I thought this could separate Ymir's limbs, maybe even his neck, but..."

Shirone said.

"He overcame spatial distortion with size."

"Yes. This is the result of pouring all his power into gigantification. Naturally, his physical strength approaches zero. We should be fine for a while."

Miro agreed.

"Well, even sending a signal to move one finger would require crossing the universe."

Ymir in the vision shrugged his shoulders.

"Hehehe."

Though no voice could be heard in space, just seeing his eyes as he turned his head was chilling.

'Those eyes are larger than galaxies?'

Ymir moved his lips.

"Don't celebrate too much. My power may be weakened, but the Five Pointed Star's planets have also become smaller than my cells."

They could understand just from reading his lips.

"It must be somewhere. The moment my power concentrates there, the seal will break and you'll face destruction."

Ymir's eyes bulged.

"Uaaaah! Uaaaah!"

The battle cry transmitting strength throughout his body spread between galaxies through his flesh.

To be continued in the next volume.
