[517] The Nameless Swordsman (1)

The border region between Biden and the Kingdom of Ferris was a dangerous area where local skirmishes constantly broke out even after the armistice agreement was signed.

However, it was also the perfect place for swordsmen undergoing knightly training to gain real combat experience.

Rafne Village, located slightly toward the Biden side in the border region.

One swordsman crossed the village entrance.

His physique, which possessed both agility and strength, proved that his muscles weren't built merely for show, and the massive straight sword strapped to his back served as evidence of this fact.

It was Ozent Rian, a knight-errant who had dropped out of Kaizen Sword Academy to wander the world and gain real combat experience.

"Damn it..."

A sound like scraping metal leaked from his completely hoarse throat.

While wandering the world in search of battlefields, he had become a mercenary for the Biden Kingdom and fought local battles against Ferris soldiers.

However, the truth was that it had been a war of attrition orchestrated through secret negotiations between two regional administrators to receive support funds from the kingdom, and most of the hired mercenaries were killed to silence them.

Though Rian had suddenly come under attack even from his own allies, he had ultimately survived and made it to this place.

'If only I had been a little more careful...'

Well, wherever you go, such is the life of a mercenary.

Hadn't the Parrot Mercenary Company he'd met in Galiant also been caught up in nobles' power struggles and fallen to become a bandit group?

'I won't be able to beg for food here either.'

One of the reasons battlefields were so harsh was that even after leaving the battlefield, there was nowhere proper to rest.

The village he'd just arrived at was no different - there wasn't even a market, let alone food scraps rolling around on the ground.

Many houses had collapsed roofs that hadn't even been repaired, and the people's faces were drained of vitality.

'Then I'll have to cross the mountain tonight.'

There was no one who would give Rian food.

If he threatened them with his sword, they would reluctantly give him something, but he had seen countless knight-errants who had wandered the world only to eventually become bandits that way.

"Huff! Huff!"

Suddenly his head grew hot and began spinning.

The wound on his side where he'd been hit by an arrow during the war began throbbing severely.

He had given it emergency treatment, but hadn't been able to eliminate the infection, and moreover, having eaten nothing for days, his body had no strength left to endure.

Thud!

Rian squeezed out his last bit of strength and collapsed with his back against a stone wall by the roadside.

"Huuuuu!"

The breath flowing from his throat was so hot it seemed like it would melt his teeth.

"Am I dying?"

He hadn't known this even when he had boasted to Clump and stormed out.

That there was no limit to bad things.

Fatigue, pain, fear, despair - all the things that destroy humans tormented Rian.

There was no instructor who would say "that's enough" and stop the misfortune.

The world simply said this:

If you can't endure it, die.

'Well, that's fine too.'

Rian couldn't remember how he had escaped the battlefield.

Only the omniscient image of himself covered in blood, screaming and rampaging through the encirclement of soldiers from both kingdoms remained.

'Dying is also a fine choice.'

Rian smiled emptily.

Not because he found it funny, but because he wanted to confirm whether he could still smile.

For the first time in endless despair, he felt like running away from his own life.

'Because I'm not afraid of death.'

He was only afraid of becoming bones buried in the ground without having accomplished anything.

"Shirone... Tess..."

Rian blinked slowly. Each time his eyelids closed, his vision narrowed by half.

"I'm sorry..."

"Mister, what's wrong?"

At the edge of his fading consciousness, he heard a young girl's voice.

"Are you okay? Please pull yourself together."

The sight of a girl's face rushing into his vision, narrowed like a hole punched in black paper, was Rian's last memory.

I can't tell yet. But it should be possible.

Smile. Smile.

It's dangerous, but it's worth trying.

Smile. Smile.

"Gasp!"

Rian's eyes shot open as he bolted upright.

He couldn't remember the dream, but the sound that repeated quietly like an auditory hallucination still lingered in his auditory nerves.

"Damn it!"

The curse that invariably came out whenever he had dreams with auditory hallucinations.

Was he gradually going insane?

Rian deliberately turned away from negative thoughts.

'What the hell is Smile?'

The only clue was his grandfather's story he'd heard when receiving the straight sword <Idea>.

When his grandfather had arrived at a strange village after suffering fatal wounds while subjugating a bandit group, he had met an old man and his granddaughter who saved his life.

He didn't know what kind of treatment he'd received, but the word he'd constantly heard while unconscious was "Smile."

'Is it a secret contained in the Objet?'

Rian stared intently at <Idea> leaning against the wall, but unlike Armand, the sword conveyed no information to him.

"Huh?"

Only after his thoughts were organized to that point did he realize that he didn't even know where he was.

The moment Rian hastily got out of bed and grasped the handle of his straight sword, the door burst open and a girl about eight years old with brown hair braided on both sides entered.

"Oh? Mister's awake! Mom, mister's awake!"

When the girl turned toward the door and shouted, a woman in her mid-thirties entered shortly after.

She couldn't be called beautiful, but she had a refined impression for a village devastated by war.

"You're awake. Thank goodness."

Realizing that the first people he encountered were a young girl and a woman, and that their eyes and tone held no hostility, Rian finally relaxed his expression.

"Where is this place?"

"It's a village belonging to the Biden Kingdom."

Like someone living in a war zone, she first provided information that could identify friend from foe.

"Ah, the village..."

Come to think of it, he remembered.

There had been a girl who spoke to him just before he lost consciousness.

"But how did you bring me here?"

"You don't seem to remember. You walked here yourself, holding my daughter's hand. Though you did collapse as soon as you came in."

Had he?

When he thought that he must have wanted to live after all, he felt bitter.

"Come out for now. I've prepared a meal."

After the woman left with her daughter, Rian examined his bandaged body.

The area where he'd been hit by the arrow had healed completely.

For him, who couldn't use Schema, to recover this quickly in such a short time should have been impossible, but it was now a familiar situation.

Whenever he had dreams with auditory hallucinations, all his wounds were always completely healed.

'Maybe grandfather also... had dreams?'

After pondering briefly, Rian hurriedly got up and went outside, thinking he'd been terribly rude after receiving help.

The house wasn't very large, so as soon as he left the room, he could see the living room.

The girl was sitting at an old round dining table, and the woman was cooking soup.

"I was very rude. Thanks to you, I saved my life."

When Rian sat next to the girl and offered his thanks, the woman shook her head.

"I just disinfected the wound and applied medicine. It was really amazing. It was the first time I'd seen a wound heal with my own eyes. That must be Schema, right?"

Even if one was ignorant about swordsmanship, living in a war zone meant hearing various things.

"Ah, yes. Well... something like that."

Rian didn't feel the need to explain a phenomenon he didn't understand himself.

"But mister, you're a mercenary, right? What's your name?"

"Me? Rian. What about you?"

Since doing rough work often brought dishonor to one's family name, it was rare for knight-errants to reveal their surnames.

"Rian? Hmm, Rian."

The girl kept muttering the name Rian, then said with a slightly disappointed expression.

"I don't know. Mister, you must not be a very famous mercenary. Oh, my name is Liz."

Rian felt a pang.

He'd never expected his name to be known in such a small village, but hearing it through the mouth of an innocent child strangely hurt his feelings.

"But kid, I'm not a mister. I'm only nineteen years old."

Liz shrugged.

"I know. All the misters say that. That they're teenagers at heart."

"..."

While Rian stared with a dumbfounded expression, the woman walked to the table carrying a bowl of soup.

"You shouldn't tease oppa. Sorry, Liz is just playing around."

"But he called me a little kid!"

Ignoring her daughter's words, the woman sat across from them.

"Even after long travels, you don't have much facial hair. Liz is still young so she doesn't know."

"But that means my face is..."

The woman covered her mouth and giggled.

"I'm joking. Looking at you now, you're a youthful and handsome young man."

"Haha, I wasn't trying to hear that..."

Rian blushed and lowered his head, then noticed the girl and mother's gazes and awkwardly smacked his lips.

The playful nature seemed to be hereditary between mother and daughter.

"Well then, I'll eat well."

Rian got straight to the point and began devouring the soup ravenously.

Honestly, even if there were a few bugs in the soup, he felt he could eat it gratefully.

After waiting for Rian to satisfy his hunger, the woman extended her hand for a handshake and introduced herself.

"I'm Sylvia. This is my daughter Liz."

Liz, who made eye contact with Rian, stuck out her tongue.

"Then your husband..."

"He's dead. He left us three years ago on the battlefield."

Liz, reminded of her father, shouted excitedly.

"I hate war! I hate those bandits who keep coming too!"

"Liz, what did mom tell you? When we have guests..."

Liz ignored her mother's words and grabbed Rian's wrist.

"Oppa, you're really strong, right? Since I saved you, please get rid of the bandits who bother mom."

"Didn't you say I wasn't famous earlier?"

"It's okay. Those bandits aren't famous either. And I heard there are incredibly strong knights who aren't famous. Oppa is like that, right? You're actually incredibly strong, right? I've never seen anyone carry a sword as big as oppa's."

Liz's eyes were sincere.

'Is that so...'

Of course it would have been goodwill and kindness, but there must have been a child's desperate hope underlying the decision to save the dying Rian.

But Rian couldn't help them.

One thing he'd learned for certain while wandering the world:

The sword meant killing, and killing meant responsibility.

It was true that he'd received help, but whether he could bear the responsibility when he chose to kill was another matter entirely.

'I can't live here forever.'

"Don't worry too much about it. Liz doesn't know how the world works yet. And... it's not entirely bad."

'Not entirely bad?'

Rian was actually more concerned by those words.

Come to think of it, where had Sylvia gotten the anti-inflammatory medicine?

In war zones, the value of medicine was beyond imagination.

Also, having enough food to readily offer it to strangers didn't match the desolate atmosphere he'd felt when first arriving at the village.

'Those bastards...'

Rian, who had intuited the situation, tensed his eyes and raised his head.

"Don't tell me those bandits are doing something to you..."

"Hey! Sylvia!"

Just then, the shout of a drunk man came from outside the door.

Liz turned pale and hid behind her mother, and Sylvia's complexion also darkened as she slowly stood up.

Bang!

A man who seemed ready to break down the door kicked it and strode in.

He was tall, and a scar ran across the bridge of his nose.

It was Fox, the vice-captain of the Red Spear Bandit Group.

"Where is he? That bastard who supposedly slept here last night! Don't tell me you're hiding him...!"

As he looked around the house with sharp eyes, he stopped his gaze at the dining table.

The guy was much younger and more handsome than he'd heard.

"Ho? So that's how it is?"
