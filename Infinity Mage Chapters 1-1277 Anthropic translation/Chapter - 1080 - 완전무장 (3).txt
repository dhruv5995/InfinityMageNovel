Full Armament (3)

While Sirone was lost in thought, the Mafia gang was engaged in covert communication.

What are we going to do? Go with the original plan?

I feel kind of bad about it. We already got a lot from the settlement. Do we really need to go this far?

We don't have a choice. This is East Country. Some bastard stirred up trouble on the bulletin board and public opinion turned against us.

While expressing their intention to settle through the news had been effective, the problem was West Country's exclusive bulletin board.

Those who were displeased with helping East Country users began to denounce the Mafia gang.

There were even rumors they were East Country spies, and some even talked about executing them.

If West Country crushes us, there's no way out. What good are high-quality parts if we can't hunt?

Right. And if a major guild issues an execution order, we'd have no choice but to quit High Gear.

Having reached this conclusion, the Mafia gang looked back at Sirone, who was deep in thought.

Sona spoke up.

"How about turning off Donatello? That part also consumes quite a bit of power."

"Ah, right."

Yahweh 2's power was at 16 percent.

'I'll need to use the auxiliary charger to get back.'

As Sirone prepared to leave, the Mafia gang carefully observed Yahweh 2's gait.

Did he turn it off?

I can't tell. There's no sign of awkwardness at all.

Because he handled Donatello so skillfully, there was no way to confirm from external observation.

Let's just do it. We shoot on three.

Having synchronized their timing through communication, they simultaneously aimed their weapons at Yahweh 2's head.

Gunshots erupted.

Sirone, who had launched his body into the air, quickly rolled across the white sand and dropped to one knee.

Mafia clicked his tongue and asked, "Donatello—you kept it on the whole time, didn't you?"

Sirone remained silent.

He had seriously considered the Mafia gang's betrayal ever since receiving Fermi's communication.

'He was checking if I was safe.'

A victory pose?

'In a situation where direct communication was impossible, it was almost the only way to convey a message to me.'

It was the possibility that things Sirone wasn't aware of were happening outside.

What could it be?

'West Country's traitor. News, or bulletin boards...'

It was a conclusion that came easily with just a little thought.

Dexgamseong said, "Judging by your reaction, no explanation is needed. Still, thanks for settling cleanly. So, couldn't you just die quietly? We won't touch the loot."

They were level 100 grade parts anyway, and legendary items were impossible to drop.

"If you want to kill me, then kill me."

Sirone said, "Mutual trust only lasts until the deal is finished. We've settled up, so now we're just enemy countries, right?"

Sirone smiled as he activated the Michelan Gun.

"Let's begin, High Gear."

The Mafia gang thought, 'He's not a bad guy.'

Even in conditions disadvantageous to himself, he clearly distinguished right from wrong.

'He makes people feel ashamed. He's probably even more impressive in reality. But that's exactly why...'

The Mafia gang aimed their guns again.

'We won't feel guilty about this.'

Firepower exceeding level 200 poured down like rain, and Yahweh 2 instantly jumped through space.

'Damn! That technique...!'

The impact was completely different from what they'd seen in videos.

Moon Island's white beach filled with gunpowder smoke and haze, and gunshots rained down incessantly.

A flash directly hit an ally.

Bwoooooong!

The machine was destroyed by missile-level force, and the remaining six increased their output even more.

Turn on infrared! Securing visibility comes first!

Sirone puffed out his cheeks.

'Phew. A 150-level difference really is tough.'

If it were a boss creature, he could read the patterns, but user patterns were in the realm of quantum mechanics.

If it weren't for his sense of space-time from the beginning, the gap would have been too large to even compete.

But that's exactly why the Mafia gang was shocked.

'What the hell is this?'

He dodges most shots completely, and even when we try to suppress him with output, he jumps through space.

'Damn! Having 15 more selective options isn't even an advantage.'

Meanwhile, counterattacks continued, resulting in another casualty.

Hey! Let's use grenades too! How can we win when he's unleashing unlimited attacks like that!

Wait. There's one opportunity. Because it's not unlimited.

Power limitations are unavoidable. We catch him when he tries to use the auxiliary charging device.

The battle continued, producing two more casualties.

Hey! What are we going to do?

Wait.

Mafia was just as anxious, but from now on it was a battle of patience.

A red signal appeared in Sirone's augmented reality.

'2 percent power remaining.'

Knowing what the enemies were aiming for, he had held out as long as possible, but couldn't delay any longer.

"Damn!"

Sirone threw a flash to create an explosion, then ducked behind a rock wall and pulled out the auxiliary charging device.

Now!

Mafia, Dexgamseong, and Sona's machines all opened up, launching their equipped grenades.

'Homing communication.'

The grenades flying toward Sirone's hiding spot with smoke trails suddenly exploded.

"Huh?"

At the same time, Sirone emerged from behind the rock wall with the auxiliary charging device attached.

"Good! Now we can fight properly...!"

As the haze cleared, a slender machine was bent forward in a sword-swinging pose.

"Operator?"

The skill of cutting through all the grenades with Taedo Black was breathtaking regardless of friend or foe.

"A real Operator."

Slowly straightening up and sheathing the black blade, she looked at Sirone and said, "Finally met you?"

Though Operator was from West Country, making him tense up, she charged at the Mafia gang instead.

"Uh..."

Before the words finished, her fist struck Mafia directly in the face.

Crunch!

A penetration judgment registered as his face was smashed, and Dexgamseong and Sona scattered left and right.

What? Why is she attacking us?

Who knows? Must be an execution. Let's get out of here!

The Operator, who had been casually watching them, drew the sword from her back again.

"Collapse."

The sword struck the white sand, and a sphere's magnetic field began pulling the machines toward it.

"Aaaaah!"

Though only one meter in diameter, Dexgamseong and Sona were pulled in at terrifying speed and collided.

Kwaaaaang!

They crashed so hard that limbs were torn off, making Sirone's blood run cold.

'An ability like a black hole.'

Dexgamseong, left with only his face, asked, "Why... why did you attack us..."

"I'll end it here. I won't execute you, so don't betray West Country anymore. Feel free to post this on the bulletin board."

Hearing this, Dexgamseong said nothing more, and the casualties also quietly disappeared.

With only the loot they left behind remaining, the Operator turned to Sirone.

She vanished with a pop sound.

'Behind!'

Following the position detected by Donatello, he hurriedly turned around to find the Operator's face suddenly close to his.

"Ugh!"

More embarrassed than afraid, Sirone hunched his head, then admired anew a moment later.

'Incredibly fast.'

Is this the speed of the overall ranking number one?

"Let's go somewhere quiet."

Without giving him time to respond, the Operator lifted Sirone's machine in her arms.

"Huh?"

Since this was his first time being held by a woman like this, the feeling was quite strange.

Looking up at the Operator's face from within her embrace, he was momentarily entranced by her beauty when—

Kuuuuuung!

Pushing off the ground with tremendous force, she shot up into the sky like a rocket.

Landing on the highest cliff on Moon Island in a single leap, she set Sirone down.

"I saw the news."

Sirone, who had been admiring the scenery, turned his head.

"Ah, don't worry too much about it. Actually, I had some misconceptions too, and you and I—"

The Operator pointed to the ground.

"Apologize to me directly."

Whoosh, the wind blew.

'Definitely quirky.'

Since there was no reason he couldn't apologize twice for something he'd already apologized for once, Sirone readily opened his mouth.

"I'm sorry for speaking harshly back then. After trying High Gear myself, I understand what you meant."

Quietly withdrawing her hand was her only response, but she seemed pleased somehow.

"I'm sorry too. For looking down on you."

"No, that's fine."

"I knew. Arian Sirone. Alpheas Magic School graduate. Called the Yahweh of the age."

Sirone was startled.

"Do you happen to know me..."

"No. This is the first time I've met you. But I saw you in dreams. You appeared in countless people's dreams. I created the Michelan Gun based on that image."

The Operator gazed at the moon.

"Creating one world requires a lot of inspiration. Since I don't go outside, I get most of my inspiration from people's dreams. Dream people hate it, but this whole world with High Gear is illegal anyway."

"Why don't you want to go outside?"

Without drawing the Operator into reality, exploring the Apocalypse would be impossible.

"I woke up every day to the sound of my parents fighting. Their hatred for each other was so great that someone like me wasn't even on their radar. Or maybe that hatred was actually directed at me. Because having a child like me defines them as a couple. I bought a separate building and set up a workshop. I can make plenty of money using under-coders."

Sirone listened quietly.

"Reality was so hateful that I needed a perfect world where I could escape. That's when I started designing High Gear. You know what the most terrible thing is? No matter how long you live here, when you open your eyes, barely any time has passed. Gradually, I became even more reluctant to go out, and eventually became number one in the rankings."

She looked at Sirone.

"I know much more terrible things are happening in reality than what I'm going through. But do I have to suffer while worrying about all that too? Even if I should, then why don't my parents care about my pain?"

"No one will blame you. There's no such thing as qualifications for suffering in this world."

Pleased by Sirone's words, the Operator continued murmuring with her small mouth.

"The person who gave you the West Country free pass—it's the Little Witch, right? Her true identity is probably the former Empress of Kashan."

"...Yes."

If she could hack dreams, lies probably wouldn't work.

"A guild member was attacked in reality. Even though it seems like a simple method, it's an incredibly difficult task. Synchronizing with the outside world from under-coders."

She probably used time magic.

"She probably knows my location too. She's cruel, so she might kill me."

"Don't worry. She won't seek your consent through such methods. True to the original promise."

"Hmph, I don't care. Tell her to do whatever she wants. I'm not pretending not to know out of fear. One minute in reality is almost 30 minutes here. If I get injured outside, I might miss the Solar War."

"You really love High Gear."

For the first time, a smile appeared on the Operator's lips.

"Honestly, I was happy when you praised my world. It felt like receiving comfort. I'll give you Michelan and Donatello. Work hard until the Solar War."

"If I win, you'll help me."

"That won't happen, but..."

The Operator slowly turned toward Sirone.

"If I win, won't you live with me?"

"Huh?"

"What you want to see, what you want to have, what you want to do—I'll give you everything. I can create anything. You're suffering too much in reality. Let's travel to beautiful places together and play High Gear together. Time here is slower than reality. You don't need to worry about others' opinions. Don't you want to put everything down and rest for a while?"

The reason he couldn't immediately refuse was because what she said was true.

Sirone shook his head.

"I'm sorry. The world you created is beautiful, but I don't feel it's real. My heart is in reality."

"...I see."

She accepted it readily.

"I saw it in dreams. You fought so fiercely to save the real world. To you, everything here must be fake. Just as reality is fake to me."

The Operator slowly approached, tilted her head, and kissed Sirone on the lips.

After the brief kiss, she stepped back, and Sirone looked at her questioningly.

"It's a reward for the compliment. In High Gear, everyone enjoys themselves freely, but I've never done this with anyone yet. Think of it as respect sent to you from a fake world."

Leaping up, she looked down at Sirone from within the moon's halo.

"See you at the Solar War."
