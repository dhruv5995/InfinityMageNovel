Chapter 692: Chapter of Reunion (1)

The head of the Lightning Guard has a duty to provide the most clear and rational answers to the king's questions.

The types of questions range from metaphysical to mundane.

While being asked about the secrets of the universe is troublesome, when asked what the most difficult question to answer was, Albino said this:

"What should we have for lunch today?"

This anecdote shows just how much a nation's king relies on the head of the Lightning Guard.

That's why it wasn't strange that the Mercordain family's mansion was located in the royal castle's administrative district, unlike other nobles.

"Hmm, so the head of the Lightning Guard lives here?"

Kido had heard the term "Lightning Guard" to the point of exhaustion since his days as commander-in-chief of the Speed Killers.

"Not head, but chief. But it's still not restored. Just how badly was it destroyed?"

When Lian looked over with his tall stature, dozens of workers were busy with construction inside the mansion.

"This is the royal castle's administrative district, right? Was there a civil war or something?"

"Haha! No. Iruki blew it away. That magic he cast at the end during the graduation exam."

Arganeth, Iruki's mother who had received the butler's report, quickly crossed the garden toward them.

"Welcome, Shirone."

"Hello. You're as beautiful as ever."

Arganeth covered her face and twisted her body bashfully.

"Oh my, saying such things is rather troublesome. My husband is also at work right now, so he comes home very late."

Shirone smiled and said, "I don't think that matters much."

"Hoho! That's right. Iruki also went to work at the Lightning Guard. He takes after his father - he doesn't even think about coming home."

The scene was vivid even without seeing it.

"Could I ask for a Lightning Guard entry pass? I have some things to discuss with Iruki."

The Lightning Guard wasn't a place you could go to chat with friends, but as Shirone was at the center of the Radum incident, there was sufficient work-related connection.

"I'll write you an inner castle entry pass. Iruki is probably waiting too. Times are unstable these days."

As the lady of the Mercordain house, confidential information inevitably flowed to her like gossip, whether she wanted to hear it or not.

"Yes, thank you."

Having received the inner castle entry pass, Shirone's group crossed the threshold of the inner castle, which could be called the core of the royal castle.

Beautiful gardens had various departmental buildings erected in them, and the people passing by were all notable nobles.

Shirone spotted his friend sitting on a garden bench with disheveled hair, blankly staring at the sky.

"Iruki!"

When he called out happily in the not-too-noisy street, Iruki, who had been sipping tea, turned his head.

"Over here, over here!"

His eyes seemed quite dim as he couldn't find Shirone, so Shirone even waved his hands to indicate his location.

Iruki, who had been stretching his neck like a turtle and watching intently, finally smiled and picked up his teacup.

"Oh, Shirone."

Mercordain Iruki (20 years old).

A regular-level researcher at the Lightning Guard, the king's direct advisory organization.

Even though he had thought his friends would always remain the same, meeting again in society brought overwhelming emotions.

"I was waiting for you. You're an hour early. Come in."

Shirone tilted his head, but perfectly understanding a human like Iruki was impossible anyway.

As Iruki crossed the corridor as if it were his own home, soldiers and administrators all showed respect without exception.

"As expected of the Lightning Guard. You've made it big, haven't you?"

"Haha."

Iruki, whose eyes had become sunken as if he'd heard a terrifying joke, merely let out a dry laugh.

Having brought Shirone's group to the research lab, Iruki served tea while staring intently at Kido's face.

"By the way, who's this? It's rude to say this upon first meeting, but haven't you been told you look like a goblin?"

At this poor attempt at humor, Kido snapped back, "I am a goblin! Aren't you my long-lost half-brother?"

Shirone introduced him directly.

"This is Kido. I'm planning to travel with him from now on."

"Ah, Kido the Devourer. Commander-in-chief of the Speed Killers. Radum political ranking 179th, combat ranking 7th, special ability is Taste of Memory."

While Shirone was surprised by Iruki already showing his Lightning Guard colors, Kido didn't seem pleased.

"My combat ability is only 7th? There was no sub-human who could beat me except Draker. Humans' intelligence is really lousy too."

"According to that lousy intelligence, you're currently ranked 1st."

All the Spectrum executives who had been ranked above Kido were reported dead.

Having nothing to say, Kido openly showed his dislike for this human and turned away, but Shirone felt strangely reassured.

"You're still the same. How have you been lately?"

A sigh that seemed to make the ground cave in was heard.

"Predictions, predictions. My job is collecting data on what happens in the royal castle and writing prediction reports in 1-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour intervals. For example, right now Madeleine is coming in and..."

Just as he finished speaking, a maid opened the door and entered.

"Lord Iruki, a meeting of regular-level researchers has been called. They say it's an urgent matter."

"I understand. I'll be there on time."

After Madeleine left, Iruki pointed to the closed door.

"See? It's like this. She probably has a 64.8% chance of getting an upset stomach within 72 hours. There was an incident yesterday where the royal castle's ice water supply was contaminated, low-quality ice is supplied in order of low rank, and today's dessert time features fruit shaved ice. And according to my data analysis! She's only skipped fruit shaved ice twice in five years!"

As Iruki slammed the table and shouted, a pitiful silence fell over the research lab.

"...You're having a hard time."

Iruki, sitting on the sofa, covered his face with both hands.

"Don't say it so casually. I checked Madeleine's medical records, water source reports, medical compendium, and personal observation logs. Ah, why did we train so desperately at magic school? Big data or whatever, I'm dying to sleep."

It certainly seemed like unnecessary analysis, but all information begins from the combination of small things.

This too was training that a member of the Lightning Guard had to go through, and the higher the rank, the higher the quality of information handled.

With the highest-grade brains running at full capacity 24 hours a day, they predict the overall kingdom's systems and analyze risk factors.

'At the pinnacle of that is Iruki's father.'

Judging from Iruki's case, the quantity and quality of information that Mercordain Albino handled was beyond imagination.

"Hang in there, Iruki."

Knowing what Shirone wanted to say, Iruki propped his chin and pouted his lips.

"Well, good days will come if I keep at it. I'm not the only one suffering. At least it's better than Nade."

"Speaking of which, where's Nade?"

"He's working at an alchemy company in the provinces. It seems he joined the transport crew, and the work is incredibly hard."

"But didn't he say he was going to open a shop?"

"That's true, but when you consider material costs and such, it seems a bit insufficient. He says he's saving money with Miss Liz to start with a small shop."

"If it's about money, he could rather..."

From a friend's perspective, it wasn't appealing, but with Nade's skills, there were plenty of brokers in the world who would hire him for big money.

"You know his personality. He won't use magic. I tried to lend him money, but he says to become a great merchant, you need to understand the bottom-level dynamics first. It's not wrong. I'm doing the same thing now."

"I see. Everyone's working hard."

The sight of his friends living their best lives was probably the human value that Shirone had risked his life to protect.

"How about you? I did see the Radum report in father's study, but is there a chance of passing the test with this?"

"I'm not sure about that. That's why I came to get some advice from you. And also to tell you about what I experienced."

Shirone briefly told him about what happened in Radum, adding explanations from Lian and Kido.

"Hmm, so La Enemy was ultimately destroyed. It's certainly an ambiguous situation."

The condition for passing the test was to find La Enemy and then safely arrive at the Ivory Tower.

But the La that Shirone had met was only a past event, and currently even that place had been destroyed.

"Alright, I'll solve it for you. We just need to ask the person directly involved."

"Huh? The person involved?"

Iruki, who seemed to have made up his mind, got up from his seat and opened the lock on a secret safe under his desk.

"What are you doing? I'm really anxious right now."

"Did you think I was just investigating upset stomachs? The one good thing about joining the Lightning Guard is being able to freely 'steal' looks at Level 1 classified information. Let's see, if I calculate the route..."

A leaky pot at school, still leaky in society.

"I don't know what you're thinking, but is this really okay? That's a violation of the kingdom's security laws."

"For civilians, yes. Between the same departments, it's just classified information access. At worst I'd get disciplinary action for overstepping authority. Alright, calculation's done. Let's go."

As Iruki put on his coat and went into the corridor, Madeleine, who had been smiling brightly while holding fruit shaved ice, was startled.

"Oh my! Where are you going? The meeting is about to..."

"Something came up. Tell them I can't attend."

"Regular-level staff don't have absence privileges!"

"Say anything to get me out of it. Oh, say my mother is currently giving birth to her second child. Tell them I'm going instead of father."

"What?"

Looking back at Madeleine standing there dumbfounded, Iruki pointed to the fruit shaved ice.

"Throw that away and eat mine instead."

Around the time Iruki was leaving the research lab, each department of Tormia Royal Castle faced a major emergency.

"They just entered through the outer castle gate!"

A Level 1 alert was issued, and guards in full armor guarded the Grand Hall like an iron fortress.

On the throne sat Adolf, King of the Tormia Kingdom, but unusually the queen was nowhere to be seen.

This was because they considered the kingdom's dignity being compromised.

"They've entered the inner castle!"

Just the reports of rapidly breaking through the nation's defenses brought anger to Adolf's face.

"Your Majesty, shall we activate the mana control device?"

"Stop. No need to provoke unnecessarily. And anyway..."

He couldn't bring himself to say that it probably wouldn't work anyway.

"They've arrived at the royal castle!"

Simultaneously with the report, a woman's voice shaking the interior began to resonate loudly, amplified by sound magic.

"Don't look at my panties!"

"...Huh?"

The ministers who had been frowning at the loud noise all turned toward the Grand Hall's entrance.

"Look down! Control your optic nerves!"

The black girl striding through the corridor held out the star badge, symbol of the Ivory Tower, in one hand while holding up her short skirt with the other.

Behind her followed a large black man wearing sunglasses with a huge greatsword slung over his shoulder.

"Don't look at my panties!"

Just as maids and even high-ranking officials bowed their heads deeply and stepped back to clear the way, the girl suddenly stopped.

Then the black man crouched down and stretched one leg out long while touching his sunglasses with his finger.

"You! You just looked at my panties!"

"No! I didn't look! I absolutely never..."

"You must have imagined it! Don't think anything! Before I rip your brain out!"

As the tremendously amplified voice shook the corridor, the official felt like his eardrums were about to burst.

'Damn it! If she doesn't want to show it, she shouldn't!'

What kind of mentality is it to blatantly lift up your skirt while walking and then throw a tantrum telling people not to look?

"What I tell you not to do, just don't do it! Got it?"

"Yes! I understand!"

The girl coldly turned and walked down the corridor, then kicked open the door connected to the Grand Hall.

"King Adolf, raise your hand! The Ivory Tower System Inspection Department has come to investigate the truth of this incident!"

The guard soldiers all drew their weapons at once, but King Adolf slowly raised his hand to stop them.

"I am King Adolf."

The girl, who had snorted at the promised ceremony, held out her star badge and said, "I am Byeolya Tsuoi, a 2-star resident of the Ivory Tower."

Her alias was Black Harmony.

"And this is..."

As Tsuoi pointed with her thumb, the black man sat again with one leg stretched out while pushing his sunglasses with his middle finger.

"..."

He was Byeolya Tsuoi's satellite, Carl Musso (Dog? Pig).
