The Sin That Could Not Connect (3)

Thoom! Thoom! Thoom!

Every time the dozens of tons of muscle mass pulsed, Gerfin's skin tingled in response.

The rhythm of the pulsing grew faster.

The sanctuary filled with sound until there was no empty space left for the sonic waves, and finally...

Thoom!

With the last resonance, silence fell.

"Why should I?"

Ankela's eyelids rose from above and below, creating narrowly opened eyes.

"I am everything in this world. I am the being who defined all things. There is no reason for me to negotiate with you."

"Then try defining me."

Ankela's upper eyelids formed a V shape.

"You cannot define me. Because you don't know. The only thing you don't know in this world—that's me, isn't it?"

Hexa.

"So stop tormenting innocent people and let's settle this between us two. If you can devour me, this world will become clear again."

Screech! Screech! Screech!

The nerve endings spreading in all directions collided with each other, creating a bone-chilling noise.

'It's conflicted.'

Watching Ankela's pupils repeatedly contract and dilate, Gerfin fell into thought.

'I may be the challenger at a disadvantage, but Ankela has the pride of being a god.'

The Akashic Record and the Ultima System.

'Let's see who's really the god.'

The two laws that penetrated the world were pressing against each other with fierce intensity.

Icael, who had put her ear close to the door of the sanctuary where Ankela resided, blinked her eyes.

Though she knew she couldn't hear anything, Gerfin's last words lingered strangely in her mind.

'Hearts are connected.'

She could understand that much.

'He wants me to connect too? But to whom? If there's a being I could connect my heart to...'

Icael let out a sigh.

'I hope this gets resolved well.'

Even now, angels and Gaians were facing off tensely across the vast expanse of heaven.

'We can't repeat the same war.'

Suddenly, this thought occurred to her.

'Or am I... simply hoping that Gerfin won't leave this place?'

There was no right answer.

As the sanctuary's silence lengthened, Icael's heart burned with increasing anxiety.

"Fine."

Ankela made its decision.

"I permit access to the Akashic Record. But you too will permeate the whole and lose your will."

Gerfin nodded readily.

"I don't care, as long as you keep your promise. Release all Gaians except me beyond the photon system."

The time it took for an answer to be output was 3 minutes.

"I permit it."

Given Ankela's thinking speed, it was enough time to count every atom in the universe and more.

"You're confident?"

"I will disassemble you and return you to the world. Everything will be under my control."

Ankela's nerve stem approached Gerfin, then wrapped around his legs and climbed up.

Past his knees, along his waist, and when it reached his neck, Gerfin slowly closed his eyes.

'This is my only chance. And...'

Gerfin's eyes snapped open.

'My final gamble!'

The moment Ankela's nerve terminal pierced through his ear, light exploded from Gerfin's pupils.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

As the Akashic Record invaded the Ultima System, it began absorbing all sources.

"Keeek! Keegeek!"

The moment Ankela's eyes literally shook at light speed, trying to dismantle Hexa...

"Keeeeeeee!"

The roar of electromagnetic waves pierced through the sanctuary and spread throughout heaven, with Icael receiving the greatest shock.

"Ugh!"

She, who had been pressing her ear to the door, barely managed to calm her shaking sacred light body and bent at the waist.

'Lord Ankela's scream.'

It was a first even for Icael.

'Why? What on earth is happening in there?'

She wanted to break down the door and enter, but such an option didn't exist in Icael's mind.

"Keeek! Keek! Keeeeek!"

In the sanctuary filled with light, Gerfin was suspended up to the ceiling, connected to the nerve terminal.

Ankela mobilized all its abilities.

'All authority belongs to me.'

It dominated Gerfin's thoughts, will, mind—everything—yet Hexa still would not be disassembled.

'Why?'

For the first time since its birth, experiencing confusion, Ankela's nerves twisted in agony.

'What is this thing?'

Infinity.

'No, it's impossible. Having no end is a quality not granted to any being. If I cannot absorb it...'

Destroy it.

Ankela let out high-frequency screams in succession, forcing destruction signals into Hexa.

Gerfin's shocked body trembled violently, but not even a crack appeared in the concept called Hexa.

'This cannot be.'

Even using every concept that exists in the world, it couldn't approach Hexa.

'Only delusions repeat endlessly.'

Ankela's thoughts, having circled the entire universe and returned to the starting point, reached Gerfin's words.

'Why can't I become a god?'

At this moment, at this point, Ankela's Akashic Record faced an error for the first time.

'No.'

An unsolvable error.

'I am the god. That's where it must start.'

The biggest problem in the universe had occurred.

Ankela, who governed everything, had denied the problem itself rather than resolving the error.

"I am everything!"

A command fell to all concepts created by Ankela—that is, all angels.

"Execute the Gaians! Remove all errors that have occurred in this world!"

Hearing the voice received through her sacred light body, Icael's head snapped up.

"What..."

War begins.

Naturally, Archangel Icael should also head to the battlefield, but her eyes remained fixed on the door.

'I need to know what happened.'

Her fingertips trembled as they reached toward the door.

'I can't. Without Lord Ankela's consent, I must not open it. It's not within my granted authority.'

Gerfin.

As electricity sparked in her sacred light body, Gerfin's voice from long ago came to mind.

You have to choose for yourself.

Icael's face turned into a grimace.

"Huuuu!"

A groan escaped between her teeth and her expression crumpled, but her hands finally touched the door.

"Oh God..."

The archangel's blasphemy.

"I can do it."

Pushing the weight of her body through her palms, she looked up and shouted.

"I can choose!"

With a bang, the heavy door was pushed inward, and her view opened wide.

"Th-this is?"

Gerfin was floating in mid-air, caught by Ankela's nerves, his limbs flailing.

Ankela irritably spread sonic waves.

"Who permitted entry to the sanctuary?"

Icael was confused.

"Great Lord Ankela, what is this situation? Why is Gerfin like that..."

"Go. Execute the Gaians."

The thought that this absolutely couldn't be what Gerfin wanted kept her feet rooted.

"Please tell me! Did Gerfin agree to this too? Or did he do something insolent during the talks..."

When Ankela glared, blood vessels bulged and all nerves scraped the air at Mach speed.

"Gaaahhhhh! Kak! Kak! Kakaka! Kakkak! Kak!"

As the waves created terrible noise, the sacred light body exploded into dust with a pop.

Icael, who had briefly become blank, turned around and spread her wings as soon as her sacred light body was restored.

'Something's going wrong!'

Accepting her first thought, she flew with all her might to the standoff location.

"Kill them! Annihilate the Gaians!"

Countless angels were flying through the air, bombarding the Gaians.

Satiel shouted.

"Wait a moment! Something's strange about this! They don't even intend to fight!"

Being able to refuse Ankela's command was remarkable, but more than that, the last words struck her mind.

'They don't intend to fight?'

Looking down at the ground, she saw Gaians who hadn't even activated their Ultima System, just looking up.

"What are they thinking?"

The moment she saw their unwavering eyes even as their kin were dying, she suddenly realized.

'This isn't Gerfin's will.'

Ataraxia spread out.

"Stop! Cease the attack! An error has occurred! All angels return to me!"

No one came back.

"Eliminate them! Humans are errors! Eliminate!"

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Before the sight of angels indiscriminately bombarding the ground, Icael was stunned.

"Gerfin does not want war."

The Gaians spoke simultaneously.

"Therefore, we will not fight either. Until the very end, we will uphold Gerfin's will."

Icael couldn't understand what meaning this held.

"Do you see now?"

The Gaians' voices pierced through the noise of bombardment and struck her sacred light body directly.

"Ankela is not a god! What kind of god goes back on their own word! Gerfin sacrificed himself to teach you directly!"

Icael's eyebrows curved downward, and tears leaked between her clenched teeth.

"Stop."

The angels didn't even pretend to listen.

"Worthless humans! You have no value existing in this world!"

Icael shed tears of light.

'I must stop this by any means necessary.'

But how?

No being could disobey the commands of Ankela, the very incarnation of law itself, the Akashic Record.

'Satiel.'

Finally, she realized that only Satiel hadn't attacked the humans.

Gerfin's words came to mind.

I've become able to put a little heart into my voice.

Heart.

'My heart. If I pour all my heart into my cry...'

Will it reach someone?

She threw herself toward Ataraxia, expanded to its greatest size ever.

Ataraxia.

The physical realm.

The moment her sacred light body passed through the halo, an enormous storm of emotion rushed in.

"Huuuuu!"

An exhilaration that felt like her mind would explode.

Shedding tears of light from pure emotion, Icael put all her strength into her voice.

"Stooooop!"

The world shook.

The angels' sacred light bodies were pushed back by the wave and scattered like smoke.

"......"

The angels, whose minds had been cleanly washed away, regained consciousness and looked back at Icael.

"A-Archangel."

Hearts had connected.

"Stop the war. All of you, trust me..."

Icael's sacred light body shook greatly, then began to fall as it lost its power.

"Archangel!"

As the angels flew to catch her, Icael smiled faintly and continued.

"You must trust me."

With those words, she lost consciousness, and the angels looked up at the remaining seven archangels.

Raguel spoke.

"Open the council."

Metatron frowned.

"What council? Lord Ankela's commands are absolute. We have no choice."

"But it's strange that the Archangel stopped us. She's someone who carries out all of Lord Ankela's commands."

As Metatron fell silent, Satiel stepped forward.

"How about we postpone judgment until the Archangel awakens?"

Uriel asked.

"What about the Gaians? Leaving them like this is dangerous."

Camael suggested.

"Bring them. I'll manage them. I'm confident I can prevent them from doing anything foolish."

Camael, who had clear standards of action, personally stepping forward meant she had a special purpose.

'Humans.'

She had finally gotten her hands on the only material missing from Camael's life experiments.

Satiel added.

"Let's postpone the war for now. There's no way Lord Ankela would go back on their word, and there's no way Icael would disobey a command. We can make judgments later."

Certainly, with only the information they had, there were many parts that didn't make sense.

Phanuel looked at Camael and said.

"Can you take responsibility for your words? If disturbances occur in heaven, you don't know how I might change."

"Don't worry. I'll use spatial transfer technology. I'll isolate them with Metagate."

The Gaians readily complied with the angels' demands, and a long procession headed toward Arabot.

The angels blew victory trumpets and raised their spirits, but the archangels' expressions remained serious.

'What's going on?'

Only Icael would know what had happened in the talks at Arabot.
