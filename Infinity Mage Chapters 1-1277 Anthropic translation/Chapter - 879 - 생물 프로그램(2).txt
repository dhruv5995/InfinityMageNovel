Biology Program (2)

'Has he finally arrived?'

The one with the strongest power in the world.

Even the protesting officials had no choice but to close their mouths when Shirone actually arrived.

With everyone's attention focused on one spot, Shirone walked toward the Alpheas Magic School group.

"Hello?"

Since Fisho had stayed in the graduating class for a long time, there were faces Shirone didn't recognize.

Seriel ran to Amy.

"Amy!"

Seeing her friend's face after so long, Amy also embraced Seriel fiercely.

There was a smell of cigarettes.

"Amy! You cunning girl! How could you live without even one contact? I'm disappointed!"

"Sorry. I had my circumstances."

Until being dispatched to the battlefield, she had overcome death's threshold countless times at the training camp.

But it seemed Seriel hadn't had it easy either, her face much thinner than before.

"Is it hard?"

"Hehe, what hardships could I have? You're the one having a harder time fighting on the battlefield. But anyway..."

Seriel looked back and forth between Shirone and Amy, puffing out her cheeks with a smile as she whispered.

"Coming in together with Shirone means you were together last night too? You cunning thing."

"No! Shirone came to pick me up. He tried to bring Maya too, but she had already left..."

From behind the classmates, Maya waved her hand.

'Shirone.'

Then she made eye contact with Shirone, but there seemed to be no changed emotions compared to before.

'Well, of course.'

Maya didn't know that Shirone had followed her to the hotel.

Although nothing had happened, if Shirone had even the slightest feelings, it would have shown in his eyes.

'It's okay. Because I love him. It won't hurt more than the pain of having to forget.'

Maya forced a smile.

Unlike the foreign officials who were being cautious, the classmates treated Shirone without reserve.

"Shirone, you've become completely famous, haven't you?"

Screamer, currently the Creas Colosseum champion, extended his hand to Shirone.

"Oh? Screamer! It's really been a long time!"

During school days, they had been appalled by his aggressive nature, but now he emanated the aura of a refined fighter.

Not only classmates but even seniors flocked to greet Shirone, making things chaotic for a while.

"Shirone! Do you remember me? When you were in the advanced class, you bumped into me at the lake garden. You even helped carry my books then."

"Ah, yes..."

Did that happen?

He couldn't remember such trivial things, but it wasn't an atmosphere where he could pretend not to know.

Everyone was welcome, and the fact that they shared the same school roots felt reassuring.

"What's that? What kind of reunion is this?"

The foreign officials wore bewildered expressions.

Wasn't one of the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower a position before which even a nation's king should kneel?

They couldn't understand the scene of people patting Shirone's head teasingly or pulling at his clothes.

"They all like him. I can imagine what kind of school life he had."

Some officials showed respect, but most were those who had attended with their nation's fate at stake.

"Hmph! Nonsense! This isn't the time to be leisurely spending time. Isn't that right?"

Officials dispatched from the southern continent nodded with sharp eyes.

'There's definitely something. We must find out.'

Although demons were invading the world, such crises weren't unprecedented in history.

The human system was still intact, and the war situation couldn't be considered entirely bleak now.

'When the world war passes, the power structure will be reorganized. This time it's our turn.'

While everyone was thinking the same thing, an official from the Miel Kingdom approached Shirone.

"Star of the Ivory Tower."

The bustling noise disappeared.

"As you know, you have the authority to view Fisho's will."

"Yes, I heard. Where is the will?"

A staff member from the Ultra-Creature Research Institute spoke.

"It's not a will but a video. Something Fisho recorded for you. Currently, no one except Fisho has been able to check this video."

"A video..."

The Miel Kingdom official interjected again.

"This is a time when all kingdoms must unite to fight the demons. If Fisho's will is closely related, I think it's right to share the information."

An official from the Benibaru Kingdom stepped forward.

"If it can't be disclosed to everyone, please at least select representatives. I should add that the Benibaru Kingdom is sending the most military supplies to the holy war."

Realizing the intention to monopolize information, officials rushed over one after another, shouting.

"We won't yield to Benibaru. Our kingdom has sent the most soldiers to Valkyrie!"

"Nonsense! If you're going to argue like that...!"

While the officials were squabbling, Shirone looked at them with calm eyes.

As voices grew louder and the atmosphere became chaotic, Shirone's voice was heard.

"Stop it."

Though his voice was quiet, the officials sensed something ominous and closed their mouths.

The cheerfully smiling figure disappeared, and there stood Shirone emanating the aura of a mage.

"Let me tell you something."

The officials listened intently.

"There are people who haven't arrived yet. People who miss Fisho. I'm the same."

Shirone looked around.

"I want to mourn my departed friend. If you don't feel the same way..."

Cold eyes pierced through the officials.

"Just stay quiet."

"Ugh!"

There was no way to express it, but Shirone's voice had an irrefutable force.

"L-let's wait for now."

As the officials quietly retreated, Shirone turned around with an eye-smile again.

"Now, let's prepare too."

Under the name of the world's strongest mage, he could see what attitude the officials took.

But most of those looking at Shirone were thinking something completely different.

'He hasn't changed at all.'

Now they knew too.

How much courage and sacrifice it required to get angry purely for others' sake.

'Why didn't we know back then?'

Perhaps the person who had the hardest time during school days was Shirone.

"Oh? It's Iruki."

A carriage from the Holy War arrived and Iruki got out.

Powerful knights that no foreign official could command were guarding his side.

When Dorothy passed through them without hesitation and linked arms with Iruki, the students murmured.

"What? Are those two dating?"

This was the first time Shirone had heard this.

"Iruki, you..."

Before he could finish speaking, a luxury carriage quickly approached and stopped at the entrance.

Nade with a coat over his shoulders and Liz neatly dressed in a suit got out side by side.

"Shirone!"

Tears welled up in Shirone's eyes.

"Nade!"

At the reunion of the three musketeers who were called the troublemakers of the magic school, the classmates also became lost in nostalgic memories.

While countless words were exchanged, when the appointed time came, Dante crossed the cemetery entrance.

"It's Dante."

Closer and Sabina, who had been part of the three musketeers like Shirone's group, lit up.

'Working at the Royal Records Management Department? Bullshit.'

Whenever they visited the capital, they looked for Dante but had never seen him once.

Given his information magic skills, he was probably an intelligence agent, specifically one dealing with top secrets.

'Can't be resentful about it.'

Since so many people had gathered, there was no time to sort out emotions as words flew back and forth.

It was simply joyful.

"Is everyone here now? Then the funeralâ€”"

Just as the Ultra-Creature Research Institute staff was about to begin the ceremony, a huge carriage entered.

"What's that?"

Seeing what was loaded in the cargo compartment the carriage was pulling, people were stunned.

It was a giant wreath made of gold.

"Is this Fisho's funeral venue?"

When a delivery company employee asked while holding settlement documents, the venue manager signed and asked.

"It is, but who sent it?"

"I don't know. When anonymity is requested, there's no way for us to know. Anyway, we've delivered it for sure."

Since it wasn't a weight humans could carry, two mages moved the wreath with air magic.

While surprised gazes followed, Shirone looked at the black ribbon hanging on the wreath.

A short phrase was written there.

In remembrance.

"It's Fermi."

Everyone had guessed.

"Who else but that guy would do such a thing? What's he doing with his life? He was annoying before, but now I miss him."

"He's probably raking in money somewhere again. If that's pure gold, it would be worth over 2 billion gold."

Nade had heard about Fermi, but it wasn't yet time to bring it up to Shirone.

"Now we'll begin Fisho's funeral."

With Shirone's classmates positioned closest to the grave, a coffin without a body was brought in.

They hadn't heard the reason why there was no body, but it seemed better not to ask.

"He was an outstanding mage and biologist. His sacrifice will forever remain in the hearts of those left behind..."

The classmates' faces were full of sorrow, and when the coffin was buried, several shed tears.

Even after the funeral ended, the lingering feeling continued, but the officials couldn't wait any longer.

"Now, let's make the announcement."

The director of the Ultra-Creature Research Institute appeared, pulling a heavy iron box on a cart.

"This video recording device contains about 27 minutes of recorded footage that Fisho left behind."

Heavy tension flowed.

"Currently, we haven't been able to check the video either. Of course, you won't believe us, but..."

The officials nodded.

"Fisho said the method to prove it would also be in this video. We trust that when the Star of the Ivory Tower checks the video, he will prove our innocence."

Now all that remained was to decide who Shirone would check the video with.

Seriel approached.

"Shirone, this is important for humanity. I have some information too. I'll cooperate as much as possible."

Iruki and Dante also helped.

"Let us go in together too. You know we're not doing this out of simple curiosity, right?"

Shirone, who had been lost in thought, spoke.

"Let me check it first. There must be a reason he gave me the authority. Can't we decide after that?"

That method was the most reasonable.

"Would that be alright?"

The director nodded.

"All authority lies with Mr. Shirone. Where would be a good place to check? A sealed room with magic control, orâ€”"

"No. I'll just do it somewhere nearby. I'll have to decide again after I watch it anyway."

There was no one here who could penetrate Shirone's ninth sense and access information.

"That place looks good."

It was a building 200 meters from the cemetery where the caretakers stayed overnight.

As the iron box was levitated with magic, the director pointed to the building.

"Let's go. We'll open it inside the building."

When Shirone entered the building with the director, the remaining hundreds of people waited anxiously.

Time passed endlessly.

"Damn it! What are they doing? Wasn't it a 27-minute video? It's already been over 50 minutes."

Someone pointed to the building.

"They're coming out!"

When Shirone, walking slowly, reached the people, the sound of swallowing could be heard.

Seriel asked.

"How was it, Shirone? Did you check Fisho's will?"

"Yes. I saw everything."

The director proceeded with the final procedure.

"The deceased Fisho said to disclose the video only to those Shirone agrees to. Now, please make your decision about the transfer of authority."

Shirone was lost in careful thought.

"I will..."

Not even breathing could be heard.

And finally, Shirone, having made his decision, raised his head and declared to the assembly.

"I will not disclose the video to anyone."

Fisho had been right.
