The Ugly One (1)

Gentle waves crashed against the white sandy beach.

Perhaps because hell's army was sweeping across the entire world, the current tranquility, with only scenery remaining, felt thrilling.

"How beautiful."

Seong-eum's face as she gazed beyond the sea was more beautiful than the ocean itself, in Shirone's eyes.

"Space is an illusion...

If I were to erase my existence, what meaning would the size of the world we live in have?"

"I used to think that."

Seong-eum turned to look at Shirone.

"Since time is an illusion, space is also an illusion. But looking at the sea like this, what does it matter?"

Isn't it simply beautiful?

To someone outside this planet, the sea might be nothing more than disgusting vomit, but to Seong-eum, it was beautiful.

"That is what the heart is."

Planting one's heart in a world of illusions.

"That's right."

The reason Shirone enjoyed spending time with Seong-eum was because she understood him.

"But Shirone, unlike you, I don't have such a steadfast philosophy toward the world. All I can do is prevent my homeland from being destroyed."

Only for Jincheon.

"Seong-eum, tell me. After spending a day with me, what happens to you? What are you planning to do?"

Seong-eum changed the subject.

"Shirone, do you think I could be a good mother?"

"Huh? Mother?"

"I want to have a child. One who resembles me, but looks exactly like my husband rather than me."

As if she was already carrying life, Seong-eum wrapped both hands around her belly.

"How much distance could I put between myself and my child?"

Shirone couldn't dare to answer.

"Let's go see the children, Shirone. I want to."

Without even waiting for an answer, Seong-eum grabbed Shirone's hand and cast an ether wave.

They arrived at Yeomra's playground.

While noble ladies sat in a corner chatting, children were running around playing.

"Hahaha! Don't you stand there!"

Though war was raging outside Yeomra, the children playing in the playground were simply cheerful.

Even as Shirone and Seong-eum entered the playground, the ladies didn't recognize the face of the empire's princess.

"Hoho, children are truly carefree."

The fact that there were still people in Yeomra who could smile brought Seong-eum endless joy.

"Those are my children. The children I must protect."

She approached the children and said something to them, then started playing ball.

Watching her mercilessly spike the ball against the clumsy children, Shirone couldn't help but chuckle.

'Come to think of it...'

Seong-eum didn't put any distance between herself and the children.

"Hey! You! Eat this!"

Just then, a child entered the playground, grabbed a handful of dirt, and threw it at the other children.

"Stop it! You're getting our clothes dirty!"

"Take that! Take that!"

Even though his friends said they didn't like it, he kept throwing dirt until the end, making Shirone furrow his brow.

"That boy came again, Lady Jang's son."

"I thought he wouldn't come today. But it's awkward to take the kids and leave now."

The ladies whispered and gossiped, but no one stepped forward to stop him.

Shirone guessed that the noble with the surname Jang held a higher position than them.

"Stop that. The other friends don't like it."

Seong-eum gently scolded him, but the boy who threw dirt actually looked at her mockingly.

"Who are you, lady, to tell me what to do? I came to the playground to play however I want."

"Ah, lady?"

With a dumbfounded expression, Seong-eum flicked the Jang boy on the forehead.

"Such words to an unmarried woman."

"Ow!"

Clutching his forehead, the Jang boy glared at the children hiding behind Seong-eum.

"Hmph, boring."

Though they couldn't speak due to their parents' class status, hiding their hateful gazes was too much for the children.

The Jang boy walked to a corner of the playground and rolled a large stone aside.

Ants were swarming, and he began stomping on them with his feet, looking at them with disgust and awe.

"Die! Die! Die!"

Watching the child, Shirone was seized by an indescribable unpleasant emotion.

Perhaps because he felt a strange kinship with what was happening in this world.

"Stop it!"

Shirone scolded, but the child's eyes were already filled with mysterious madness.

"I said stop."

Unable to watch any longer, Shirone pushed the child's shoulder, and he fell backward with a thud.

"Damn it! Who are you?"

With his Western appearance, Shirone could never be a Jincheon noble.

"Even small creatures have precious lives. No, there's no such thing as lowly creatures in this world."

"How ridiculous. And you're not even a noble yourself. Do you know who I am?"

As light burst from Shirone's eyes, the child flinched and froze.

"Uh, uh..."

It was Yahweh's wrath that would have made even demons wet themselves.

"Baby, what's wrong?"

When a fierce-looking woman approached from afar, the ladies' faces turned pale.

'Lady Jang. This is trouble.'

Seeing his mother, the child began to cry.

"Mom! This man... waaah!"

Lady Jang, holding her child, glared at Shirone viciously and snapped.

"Who are you? Why are you bothering our child?"

"He was killing ants in the playground."

"What? Ants?"

Lady Jang's face turned incredulous.

"You made our son cry for such a trivial reason? And kids can do that while playing. What would a child know?"

"That's exactly the problem."

What was truly terrible was not knowing.

Shirone looked sadly at the child crying in his mother's arms.

'When that child goes home...'

The mother would massage her tired child's legs, and the father would spoon rice into his mouth, but.

"I don't want to." Habitz said to the sky.

"I don't want to go back."

Who was he talking to?

The Gustav 4th Knights looked at each other and whispered.

"He does that sometimes. Who does he think is in the sky?"

"It must be delusion. Honestly, Habitz and all of us aren't exactly sane people."

Natasha put her hand to her lips.

"Maybe he's sensing the existence of God..."

Vulcan muttered.

"What if this world is false..."

"Huh?"

Sometimes when reading crowd psychology, chilling thoughts occur.

"I mean, if there's a separate outer world, and we're nothing more than virtual personalities connected to that outer world."

Vulcan looked at his friends.

"What kind of existence would Habitz be in that outer world?"

A young child.

Also, if a child who clearly realized this world was fake entered here.

'What kind of life would they live?'

Just a playground.

'Children don't play games they lose.' Because it's not fun.

'Why doesn't Habitz die? What's the reason for his near-invincibility, breaking through extreme probabilities?'

Was he already designed that way?

'By whom? Is it a system where he can manipulate his own probability? But if that were possible...'

The world would already be overflowing with second Habitzes, second emperors, second rich people.

Sumodo asked.

"Why do you stop talking mid-sentence? So what is Habitz?"

Vulcan snapped out of his delusion.

"No, I just had that thought."

The persuasiveness was zero from the assumption of a non-existent outer world.

'Even Buddha only fights to eliminate the suffering of this world. He doesn't know of an outer world.'

Vulcan looked at Habitz.

'But you, what exactly are you looking at?'

Perhaps Habitz is...

"I want to play more."

Deep, dark loneliness swirled in Habitz's eyes as he looked up at the sky.

'I want to have exciting fun.'

"Take him away." Shirone said.

"Teach him what's important first. Otherwise, he'll be lonely for life."

Lady Jang was furious.

"How dare a lowly thing try to teach anyone? Do you know who I am? If I just open my mouth at the government office..."

"Please just take him away!"

When Shirone shouted, Seong-eum turned with a surprised expression.

'Take him away, please!'

He wasn't angry at the child.

"I've never seen such an ill-mannered brat!"

The naturally fierce Lady Jang stood up abruptly and slapped Shirone's cheek.

With a slapping sound, it was Lady Jang's face, not Shirone's, that turned.

"Owww!"

Just as she couldn't even get angry at the incomprehensible phenomenon, Seong-eum approached them.

"Follow that person's words."

The moment Lady Jang turned her head and saw Seong-eum, her face was colored with shock.

"P-Princess!"

Though she had only seen Seong-eum from hundreds of meters away, a noble's eyes could never forget the emperor's bloodline.

"This humble one greets the Princess!" 

Seong-eum waved her hand.

"Take your son and go home. In these troubled times..."

After Lady Jang left with her son, the other ladies also hurriedly returned home.

Seong-eum said to Shirone.

"Let's go too. I think we've enjoyed ourselves enough."

"Now tell me what you're thinking. What happens to you when you return to the imperial palace?"

"You're already guessing why I'm not telling you."

"It would help you. But if you hear my story, you won't be able to make a choice."

"I can choose."

"It won't be a good choice."

"That's also my choice to make."

Seong-eum sighed.

"Shirone, the demons are killing people. If you could stop this, you'd do anything, wouldn't you?"

"Of course."

"What if I came up with something amazing that could win this war? Could you marry me?"

"Yes."

Though it was a sudden question, there was no impossible situation in Shirone's resolve.

"I'd do anything. Of course I love Amy, but besides that feeling, nothing else matters."

Seong-eum, who had been looking at Shirone with sorrowful eyes, smiled and created distance between them.

"That's enough."

Shirone's space was taken away, and Seong-eum's voice remained faintly as she moved away alone.

Goodbye, Shirone.

"Wait!" Seong-eum had already left.

"Damn! What the hell is this?"

Spreading his light wings and rising into the sky, Shirone flew toward Yeomra at maximum speed.

It was slow compared to Seong-eum's speed.

"Seong-eum! Where is Seong-eum!"

As he walked toward the great hall shouting, Anchal appeared and blocked his path.

"Stop! No one can approach!"

"What kind of act is this? Does it make sense to kill a perfectly fine person to win a war?"

"The Princess proposed it herself! Aren't you also sacrificing for the world!"

"Even so, I won't commit suicide! Seong-eum's death won't even end the war!"

Shirone pushed past Anchal's shoulder.

"She's going to close the Spiritual Realm!"

His steps stopped abruptly.

"What?"

"You know demons are endlessly produced, right? But if the Spiritual Realm closes, reinforcement becomes impossible."

"How is that possible?"

"With equipment developed by the Jincheon Space Nation, the Princess will open the Immortal Function. She'll swallow the entire space of hell with her ether wave ability."

'The Spiritual Realm closes.'

No matter what evil humans committed, it meant demons couldn't cross over to reality.

'We can win.'

His heart pounded.

"Wait."

A terrible thought suddenly flashed through his mind.

"What nonsense is this? Then what about Seong-eum? Do you know what happens to Seong-eum?"

"Yes. The Princess's mind will..."

Anchal hung his head and gritted his teeth.

"Wander through terrible hell." Forever.
