Meanwhile, there were those who, even after being struck by Eden's divine power, still refused to repent.

"Grrrr, no. I don't want to go back."

Eden said.

"Foolish soul, why don't you understand that the end of corruption is nothing but emptiness?"

"Uaaaah! Just leave me alone!"

Was this pain?

He thought it would be better to die than live an ascetic life like before.

'Satanism. It's truly vicious. To think it can corrupt a person's mind to this extent.'

The priests shouted.

"I want to enjoy more!"

Even brains pickled in pleasure regained extreme rationality when cornered.

'I have to kill that woman.'

They suddenly changed their expressions and shed pitiful tears while extending both hands.

"Ah, I repent, O God."

Nade shouted.

"Eden! Don't be fooled! Change the barrier to physical force!"

She too had doubts, but couldn't push away even those who were repenting.

"I was foolish. So please die, damn woman."

An eerie feeling of being unable to distinguish good from evil coldly touched Eden's nape.

Nade blocked their path.

"I'll handle this!"

Before Eden could stop him, thunder rumbled and massive electricity shot up to the sky.

These idiots!

When the incarnation of the Thunder God roared, the pale priests stepped back.

But brains craving only pleasure whipped their bodies beyond the fear of death.

"Uaaaah!"

Unlike the priests charging in desperation, Nade's emotions turned cold.

"Lightning of Truth and Falsehood."

The incarnation of the Thunder God scattered into electrons and permeated the air at light speed.

"Grk!"

The priests hesitated as an unpleasant feeling made their skin crawl.

Nade extended his hand.

"Those who do not repent, do not approach. If you disobey my command, you will face judgment."

The priests looked at each other's faces.

When nothing special happened, one of them moved forward with desperate eyes.

"I repent. This foolish one..." CRASH!

The moment he took a step, blue lightning struck down upon his head.

As the fallen priest's limbs trembled, Eden's eyes widened.

'What is that?'

The power was still violent, but the Thunder God's anger was perfectly controlled.

"Nade, this is...?"

"The Thunder God's judgment. It's similar to a lie detector. It reads the opponent's brainwaves and reacts automatically. If you deceive yourself..."

CRASH!

Lightning struck down on someone else's head again.

"This is what happens."

Nade's explanation itself became binding, making the priests unable to move.

"Don't try any tricks. I don't have the ability or magnanimity to embrace everyone like Sirone."

That was the deciding blow.

While the evil priests were thus immobilized, the repentant priests struggled fiercely.

"O God! Do not forgive me!"

As much as they didn't want to escape pleasure, the hearts of those who had escaped were miserable.

Iruki didn't care.

'This side and that side, it's all about gods.'

He was simply subduing the enemies before him to fulfill Sirone's dream.

'Cancellation.'

Amidal's ability Dreamer was canceled again, and the priests' divine power was applied.

"Kraaaah! This bastard!"

The demon's anger at being beaten by those he once treated like slaves pierced the sky.

"I'll kill you all!"

Amidal took a stance with his dagger pulled to his side and bent his upper body.

"Take this, my strongest technique!"

Gripping the dagger's handle tightly, he shouted while imagining a storm of sword energy.

"Infinite Sky Slash!"

A technique that would shred several hundred meters with sword energy.

"Hyaaaah! Hyaaaah!"

As he rapidly moved the blade in and out of its sheath, the priests hurriedly stopped in their tracks.

"Uaaaah! Faster! Faster!"

The expressions of those watching became blank.

No sword energy was born into reality, only a child swinging a dagger around.

Iruki said pathetically.

"What are you doing?"

Realizing his ability had been canceled again, Amidal threw down his dagger.

"Damn it!"

"Play house with your friends. I'll send you home soon."

"You bastard!"

As the priests closed in again, Amidal glared at Iruki and gritted his teeth.

"It really works, you damn..." 

The priests' divine power struck simultaneously, and shortly after, the sound of bones crushing was heard.

Iruki turned his head.

"Where's Sirone?"

He was engaged in fierce battle with three Satanism executives who had raised their emblems to the sky.

Evangelist Elka peered into Yahweh's heart with her mirror.

'Converting him would be huge.'

If Yahweh joined Satanism, the ideological war would end at that moment.

'What does he want? Let's play together.'

The Sirone reflected in her mirror was shedding tears of blood with a sad face.

'Really disgusting.'

This makes me look like some woman who deserves to die.

"Anyway, making me..."

With angry eyes raised, she punched the mirror reflecting Yahweh with her fist.

"Into a bad demon!"

CRASH! The mirror shattered and a powerful shock surged into the real Sirone's heart.

"Grrrrrr!"

Satanism elder Yuprapus shaped the demonic energy collected by Marit into a long spear.

"Emblem Spear."

A spear with an ominous dark red light like blood rushed quickly toward Sirone.

Hand of God blocked it, but the center of the light palm was pierced with a pop.

Elka's lips curled up.

'We are the Catacombs.'

The Yahweh assassination organization.

'Demonic flow is different from demonic energy. This is a weapon made from the emotions of humans you love. Therefore...'

Unlike the demons that Yahweh cut from his heart, it could strike back at Miracle Stream.

'The number of Satanism believers is approximately 30 million.'

No matter how powerful Sirone's Ultima was, it was insufficient to handle alone.

'Only for this moment.'

This was why Giorghi, leader of the Catacombs, gave up direct confrontation with Yahweh and established Satanism.

'Damn!'

Sirone experienced the split second as the Emblem Spear flew at light speed.

'Why?'

Why is the unification of evil so easy?

Even burning one's life in effort, not even a single human could be brought up to Ultima.

'How?'

Why does evil unite into a massive flow?

Without time to find the answer, the Emblem Spear pierced Sirone's side.

Yuprapus let out a roar.

"Uooooh!"

Just as the thrilling ecstasy was about to blow away his mind, Sirone grabbed the spear.

"Still far from it."

Giorghi's strategy was excellent, but Hexa wouldn't break with just 30 million people.

"Hyaaaah!"

Light of Agape flowed from Sirone's body as he grasped the spear, then traveled up the shaft.

Elka examined the broken mirror.

"Huh?"

The light swelled like liquid, then exploded in a massive flash and swept across her face.

"Kraaaaaaah!"

As her eyes, nose, and mouth all melted away and she flailed her arms, Sirone shouted.

"I'll never give up!"

As the Emblem Spear embedded in his side shattered, Hand of God was born anew.

Elka crawled on the ground and shouted.

"Maximus!"

Hearing the cry, Maximus shrugged his shoulders and recalled her instructions.

If he converted Seina...

She had promised the ultimate pleasure.

"Gr-Grand Priest."

As Maximus's eyes changed, Seina, who had been half-doubtful, hurriedly stepped back.

"Seina, I..."

Even if he had passed Eden's barrier, no one knew if he had truly repented.

"Don't come near me!"

She reached for the holy sword Astasia, but no sacred blue light flowed.

'I've lost my divine power. I can't fight like this.'

Elka shouted again.

"Grab her!"

Maximus, his eyes bulging, quickly approached and grabbed her shoulder.

"Seina!"

Seeing his eyes prepared for death, Seina couldn't bring herself to draw her sword.

"I'm sorry."

Maximus knelt before her feet and said, tears streaming down.

"I've succumbed to the devil. Cut off the neck of this sinner who has defiled God's name."

Elka pounded the ground in frustration.

"Aaaagh! So annoying! This damn..."

Hand of God flew in an arc and crushed Elka's body with a thud.

Eden shouted.

"Seina! Get away!"

The Dark King Gultan, who had been lying nearby, activated quantization and flew toward her.

"Nade!"

As Iruki shouted, Fist Fighter Marit gave orders to the priests.

"Charge!"

The moment the priests' legs, who had feared the Thunder God's judgment, moved forcibly.

"Uaaah! No!"

Dozens of lightning bolts fell simultaneously, scratching the air, and corpses exploded with crackling sounds.

In the vision obscured by blood and entrails, Maximus unleashed divine power.

"Begone, demon! Gah!"

The holy sword Astasia protruded from Maximus's stomach, having pierced through from behind.

"Ah, aah..."

Seina, who had stabbed the Grand Priest, released her hand from the sword's handle and slowly stepped back.

"Wh-why did I?"

Gultan was touching her heart.

'Mental Sculpting.'

Having lowered her mental barriers by making her stab Maximus, he roughly clenched his hand.

"Hrrrrgh!"

As her heart's form changed, red energy swirled in Seina's eyes.

"...Satan."

'Got it.'

Seina had been converted.

Just as Gultan disappeared underground with her, Nade's lightning struck hard.

"Damn! I missed them!"

Since it was movement that ignored space-time, he couldn't track their trajectory.

Sirone shot out.

"Mica!"

Yes. Coordinates 39398749...

Transcendent perception transmitted Gultan's coordinates as he moved like jumping through space to Sirone.

'It's complicated. He's trying to avoid pursuit.'

Gultan, who had been moving freely in all directions, turned around with a victor's smile.

"Hehe, at this rate he'll never be able to chase..."

Sirone was coming.

"Uaaaah! Uaaaah!"

Startled, Gultan jumped through space, but Mica didn't lose track of his coordinates.

'He targeted Seina from the beginning. To prevent the Vatican's truth from being exposed.'

"Don't come! Please! Just once!"

Sirone shouted.

"Stop right there!"

Giorghi read aloud from the Devil's Bible.

"God said, Agrippa, why do you weep so sadly? Agrippa said, The woman I love has married my brother."

Agrippa Gospel Chapter 3.

"Lost lamb, stay away from jealousy and resentment. Kill your brother and take your sister-in-law."

Agrippa said.

"If I kill my brother, people will blame me. If I take my sister-in-law, I will lose my job."

God said.

"Now all of your brother's things have become yours, so no one can blame you. You may bury your sister-in-law in the ground late at night."

Agrippa knelt and said.

"I am afraid. I fear the hypocrites will put me in prison. I fear they will cut off my head."

"I will be with you, so you need not pay a price to get what you want. Take whatever you desire. The sanctuary of murderers..."

Thud, the Devil's Bible closed.

"Melchidou."

"Got him?...!"

Just before Sirone's hand could reach them, Gultan and Seina were enveloped in red light and disappeared.

"What?"

It wasn't the quantization ability.

"Mica."

Nothing.

'Nothing? What do you mean?'

They don't exist in the world. It appears they've escaped the phase space that can be specified by coordinates.

'Hidden Code. But as far as I know, to create such a powerful ability...'

Sirone's brow furrowed.

"Giorghi."

It was Yahweh's demon.
