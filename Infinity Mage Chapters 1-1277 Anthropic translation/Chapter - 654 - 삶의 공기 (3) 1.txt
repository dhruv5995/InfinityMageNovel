[654] The Air of Life (3)

"Ra Enemy?"

Sirone couldn't understand how the man before him knew about Ra Enemy.

No, more than that, wasn't he claiming to have met someone they hadn't even encountered yet?

"How do you know about that?"

Every time Chagall swayed his upper body, Lian couldn't help but flinch.

'He's undoubtedly a powerhouse.'

Chagall, one of the world's 100 most dangerous individuals.

His hometown was the Kingdom of MÃ¤rchen, located west of the Mediterranean, where he was born as a bastard child in a fairy-tale-like beautiful tourist destination.

Some killers are born with severed emotions, but Chagall was a murderer developed through experience.

"Sniff sniff. Sniff sniff."

What he was detecting from Sirone through his sense of smell wasn't scent molecules, but the perfume of events.

Just as certain smells trigger memories of specific events, Chagall could sense the perfume of the events themselves.

And this meant that Chagall had already encountered Ra Enemy at least once.

And if Chagall's memory was accurate, he had probably killed Ra Enemy more than seven times.

If Chagall's memory was accurate.

"Where is Ra Enemy?"

His already murky voice echoed through the underground waterway tunnel, creating an even more eerie feeling.

"I don't know. We came here on Mr. Brooks' request."

It was such thick murderous intent that it made one not even want to get involved, regardless of skill level.

"Brooks?"

After being hired three months ago, he had been working trapped in the underground waterway, eliminating countless demi-humans.

It was enjoyable work for Chagall, but delivering Brooks' letters was still something he didn't like.

Anyway, the reason he was hired was because there was evidence of Ra Enemy in Baschka.

Chagall erased the commission from his mind.

"If you won't talk, I'll have to ask your body directly."

"Urgh!"

The air in the waterway, which they thought was already filled with murderous intent, suddenly expanded, feeling like thousands of blades piercing them.

'He's coming.'

The swaying motion left and right gradually quickened, then his arms disappeared as if severed.

With a whoosh of trembling air, Sirone and Lian simultaneously kicked off the ground and descended the stairs.

Bang! With an explosive sound, Chagall's twin daggers struck Lian's great sword vertically.

'It's okay. I can hold out...'

Just as he thought that, the air trembled again and countless blades spread like afterimages rushed in from all directions.

"Hraaaah!"

Blood spurted from his arms and legs, but Lian didn't care and swung his great sword widely.

With a sword strike that dominated the entire radius of the waterway, Chagall bounced back like a rubber ball.

'That guy doesn't have a scent.'

Moving like a ghost past Lian, Sirone prepared to fight and equipped his magic.

Even in that split second, he could see the man's upper body swaying left and right, giving him an eerie feeling.

Lian instantly approached and blocked Sirone's front.

A thunderous sound echoed through the waterway, and Chagall's eyes wavered with momentary bewilderment.

'What?'

At a reaction that was impossible to achieve through mere speed, Chagall's sense of smell activated again.

'An event I've experienced somewhere before.'

He recalled memories from when he had killed Ra Enemy.

"Sirone, go up."

Since the man seemed too murky in his murderous nature to be just a mercenary, Lian chose to send Sirone away.

"But..."

"It's fine. The mission comes first."

Knowing Lian's abilities, Sirone made eye contact with Chagall over his shoulder.

Could he really break through that man and escape the waterway?

'Now!'

As Sirone moved to the side, Chagall's gaze moved exactly following Sirone's trajectory.

Then his body dissolved like smoke, and Chagall's dagger thrust straight at Sirone's forehead.

'What?'

But the dagger only cut through empty air, and Sirone's figure was nowhere to be found.

Sirone, who had escaped in the opposite direction using Shunpo, destroyed the waterway's iron gate with Photon Cannon and went up.

Even then, Chagall couldn't organize his thoughts and just stared at the retreating Sirone.

Lian shouldered his great sword and said:

"Now, shall we get down to business?"

With no need to protect Sirone, it was as if Lian had removed the shackles from his thinking.

"Keke. Kekekeke."

Chagall laughed, his shoulders shaking.

He couldn't know their identity yet, but it was certain that these people had somehow experienced the same things as him.

"I'll kill you slowly."

Wherever Sirone fled, his sense of smell could find and slaughter him anytime.

"How about you save that bluff for after you kill me first?"

Chagall's laughter stopped abruptly.

As a serial killer who had committed murders in the four digits, his standard for distinguishing humans was only one thing.

To kill or not to kill.

And at this moment, Chagall defined the human called Lian through that single standard.

"You die."

The moment Chagall's figure disappeared, Lian gripped his great sword with both hands and launched his body.

A tremendous collision sound shook the waterway.

'Quickly! Quickly!'

Sirone, who had entered the mansion, made full use of the Ghoul Kuzene's metabolism to rapidly search the mansion.

Quite a large number of guards were on alert, but the security inside the mansion wasn't that strict.

This was probably because the man they met in the waterway was guarding the only path into the mansion.

'He really is unusual. Just who is he?'

That made him worry about Lian all the more.

'Where the hell is it?'

If he expanded his Spirit Zone, he could sense people without entering rooms, but the mansion was too large with hundreds of rooms.

Woof woof! Woof woof!

As Sirone ran down the corridor by the window, the guard dogs patrolling outside all turned and began barking at once.

'Damn it!'

While he could avoid human eyes, he couldn't avoid dogs' sense of smell.

Especially after meeting that man who sniffed like a dog in the waterway, he felt even more unsettled.

"Intruder! Find him!"

Emergency bells rang throughout the mansion and the sound of numerous security personnel running up could be heard.

After quickly circling the second floor, Sirone immediately went up to the third floor, where one guard spotted his feet.

"Third floor! Chase him!"

The Schema masters quickly closed the distance, but Sirone also detected people at the end of the corridor.

'Two people?'

They were so intertwined that if Sirone's Spirit Zone had been even slightly less sensitive, he wouldn't have noticed.

"Protect the boss!"

Guards also burst out from the opposite corridor.

Evading enemies attacking from both sides of the corridor, Sirone reached the door and just before their swords fell, he broke through the door with his body.

Unlike the corridor, bright light first filled his vision.

As Sirone, who had rolled on the floor, regained his balance, the guards stood at the door with their weapons drawn.

"What's all this commotion?"

At the sound from the bed area, Sirone turned his head to see a man in his mid-40s getting out of bed naked.

And on the bed sat a blonde beauty covering herself with a blanket.

Brooks looked back at her, then clicked his tongue in annoyance and put on a robe.

"Who are you?"

Sirone looked at the man with a short beard grown to his chin and fell into thought.

He could say he came to deliver a letter, but with subordinates watching, he couldn't readily hand it over.

"Uh, well, that is..."

"Sirone?"

The woman sitting on the bed asked with a surprised expression, making Brooks look back with a puzzled expression.

"What? Did you have another boyfriend?"

The woman didn't answer and awkwardly got out of bed while covering herself with the blanket.

"Sirone! You really are Sirone! Don't you remember me?"

After briefly examining her face, Sirone also pointed at her with a surprised expression.

"Huh? That person from back then..."

"That's right! It's Aria! Aria, whom you saved!"

Teshia Aria.

She was the woman with an open personality who had coincidentally ridden the same carriage when Sirone entered the Magic Association half a year ago.

She remained in his memory because he had personally rescued her when the Black Revolution staged a terror attack at Gold Tower.

'But why is she here?'

Even back then, he had heard she had two boyfriends, but the relationship between the young and beautiful Aria and the middle-aged Brooks seemed strange.

Brooks asked:

"How long have you known each other?"

"Oh my, you don't know Sirone? He's a really famous mage right now. Remember that terror incident before? He's the one who saved me then."

"Hmm."

Having made his decision, Brooks gestured to his subordinates to leave.

The door closed leaving only the three of them, but Sirone, who knew the letter's contents, still couldn't reveal his purpose for coming here.

"So, what brings you here? It doesn't seem like you have business with Aria."

"I came because of a Silvering Guild commission."

"A letter? Let me see it."

Even with Aria beside him, Brooks was unrestrained, and only then did Sirone hand over the letter from his chest.

After reading the contents, Brooks clicked his tongue, and Aria asked as if she already knew:

"That woman, right? The one you met in the provinces."

"She says she's pregnant. Says she'll report me if I don't come down quickly."

Aria giggled.

"Geez, so you should have been more careful. That's too bad. Your eventful bachelor life ends today too."

The letter was from Brooks' lover, containing news that she had become pregnant from their reunion a few months ago.

Aria's boldness in being able to laugh even knowing this fact was extraordinary, and Brooks was thinking the same thing.

'Aria...'

The daughter of the Kingdom of Tormia's first-class diplomat, and herself a talent who passed the diplomatic examination.

He had thought of it as the fling of a noble lady who lacked nothing, and had honestly met her with the feeling of toying with her.

But now he was rather confused.

Perhaps it wasn't Brooks who had been toying with Aria, but the opposite.

'She's a woman I don't want to lose.'

Brooks, who put the letter away, asked Sirone:

"But why all this commotion? If you had told Chagall, he would have brought you up quietly."

Sirone suddenly realized and shouted:

"Ah, that's right! Lian!"

If anyone had been in the underground waterway, they would have covered their ears and screamed at the collision sounds powerful enough to burst their eardrums.

Two shadows raced through the maze-like complex paths, intertwining like a whirlwind.

Defense and attack were almost instinctual, and as time passed, wounds increased on Lian's body.

Smile. Smile.

His unique auditory hallucination sounded and the wounds began to regenerate, but each time this happened, Lian felt discomfort with the same weight as death.

'This is strange.'

Chagall was equally aware of the discomfort.

A massive great sword and two daggers.

In close-range combat, Chagall should have had the advantage in reaction time.

But Lian's movements, which ignored inertia, were unlike any enemy Chagall had faced before.

'Then...!'

Chagall's eyes flashed as he released his hands from the daggers.

His hands went behind his back and more daggers appeared, with a total of four daggers flying toward Lian simultaneously.

'Is this even possible?'

Even in the midst of life-and-death combat, the question arose, but there was no time to find an answer, and Lian took a step toward death.

Crash crash crash crash crash bang!

As metal clashed with metal and sparks flew, their shadows flickered on the waterway walls like monsters.

And both men realized in that flash of light that there was another shadow and turned their eyes.

"Urgh!"

What appeared before their eyes were dozens of blades, which penetrated straight through the center of the gap where Lian and Chagall were retreating and crashed into the wall.

Crash!

The blade that disappeared after destroying the wall revealed that it was magic, not a real sword.

"I wondered who it was..."

The owner of the mysterious shadow approached with the sound of water.

"But there was a big shot here."

"You are..."

A pale-complexioned man with a torn scar on the right corner of his mouth.

It was Rufist, the president of the Tormia Magic Association.
