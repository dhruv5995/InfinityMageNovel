Depression (3)

When Ting from the Law Department made her meaningful remark, the eyes of the Ivory Tower residents immediately changed.

The Law Department had only 5 members, but with 17 stars total, they held the highest rank.

This was because they had two 4-star members when some departments didn't even have one.

'Truly powerful law.'

As Shirone focused his eyes and heightened his avatar's power, Ting's presence gradually began to fade.

Then Freed, Amanta, and Minerva overcame Ting's law, followed by the 4-star and 3-star members.

'Grr! This won't do!'

However, residents below 2-star rank were still suppressed by Ting's presence and couldn't exert their power.

Freed asked Ting.

"Don't tell me you're planning to side with the Unified Universe Management Department?"

"Whatever decision I make has nothing to do with you. Though I suppose even saying this is meaningless."

Ting added.

"I haven't changed my mind yet. I merely said that the illusion called Shirone is unique."

She turned her head toward Shirone.

"Why do you try to save humanity? Are you a program designed to protect other illusions?"

Shirone wanted to answer "I'm human too," but ultimately couldn't bring himself to say it.

'There's no way to change Ting's logic. But it's not delusion either. A human who has reached the highest level in law.'

Yet she says everything is an illusion.

Conversely, he thought that perhaps Ting herself might be an illusion to him.

'Everyone except me is an illusion... Humans are truly lonely beings.'

'That's what I hate.'

Today especially, he couldn't help but envy the Gaians who had achieved an integrated mental system.

"Whether it's fake or real doesn't matter. If we leave things as they are, the world will be destroyed by Hell's army. And that world includes the Ivory Tower. We must prevent that at all costs."

"Do you really think so?"

Shirone flinched.

"I don't understand, you see. Everyone here seems designed to understand the world at a fairly high level, so how do you reach such a conclusion?"

Freed agreed.

"You're lying."

Shirone's eyes sharpened intensely.

"In the Great Assembly, any opinion can be pushed through, but you must not lie. Where do you think Hell's army came from? Murderers? Rapists? Sure, there's some portion of that, but no. They simply came from us."

Freed spread both arms.

"You probably made tremendous efforts to reach Yahweh's level. But we all did the same. So what's left? Love for humanity? No, in truth, don't we know better than anyone? There was only one reason we wanted to climb to the top of the pyramid where all humanity competes."

Freed slowly turned his head.

"Because there are no humans there."

"Dreams? Achievement? No matter how you package it with words, it's the same. You don't want to get entangled with humans, don't want to be pushed around by them. The reason the top of the pyramid looked most brilliant to you was simply because no one was living in that spot."

That was why the Ivory Tower was created.

"How many trivial arguments did you have? How often were your thoughts denied and ridiculed? But if you go there, no one is around. That alone is merit enough for the summit. Being able to live without feeling human nature on your skin."

Shirone bit his lip.

"You must know it too, right? If you hadn't felt disillusionment with the world, you never would have made it this far in the first place. Save humanity? We're each just bearing our own responsibilities. To borrow Nane's words, it's called the Great Purification."

Taesung opened his mouth.

"Freed, Nane's philosophy was already defeated by Gaold..."

"Mr. Taesung."

Shirone interrupted.

"I'll continue speaking."

Feeling a chill, Taesung closed his mouth, and Minerva gulped.

'This doesn't look good...'

Shirone fixed his gaze on Freed.

"You're right. I can't say I never had such feelings either. But I've already forgiven them. Because I too am the same kind of human as they are."

"That's your business. I'm not Yahweh."

Shirone nodded readily.

"Even so... I was angry."

Only then did Freed look back at Shirone.

"Why do only I have to go through this? Why can't I be happy? I was so angry and resentful that eventually..."

Shirone pointed at his chest with his thumb.

"I created a terrible monster in here."

Even without opening his chest to look inside, Shirone's dangerous aura conveyed the magnitude of his anger.

"The reason I could endure again was because I still love this world. If I'm not happy here, it would be the same no matter where I go."

"So that's your business..."

"I'm not asking you to understand."

Shirone's eyes changed.

"I don't know why I've been given the opportunity to save everyone, but this really is the last chance. The moment I let go of Yahweh's level myself..."

It was an extremely small handful of anger lurking within Shirone's heart.

"No one will be able to be happy."

The five stars of each department frowned.

'What is this?'

Suddenly a pitch-black monster tore through Shirone's clothes and burst out, shrieking toward the stars.

Kyaaaaaaaa!

"Gasp!"

The 2-star residents jerked back in surprise.

'No, it's not a monster.'

When he came to his senses, the countless thorns that had overwhelmed with their form alone disappeared, and a single Judicial Blade vibrated.

Minerva gritted her teeth.

'The Judicial Blade activated from temperament alone. That's something I couldn't see even in my prime.'

Faced with killing intent directed at the entire world, Freed asked with an unpleasant expression.

"Are you threatening us?"

"Yes. But it's not my will."

To prevent humanity's destruction, Yahweh made his final choice.

The terrible inner monster.

'The only way he could contain that anger was...'

Extreme universal love - if not everyone could be happy, then no one could be happy.

'Just once more...'

Shirone's voice trembled.

"Can't you give us just one more chance? The fact that you came this far because you hate humans means you loved them that much. Don't you all actually want to live together?"

Ting, her lips pressed firmly together, looked at Shirone.

'All together?'

Her wounds would never heal.

'As if such a thing exists. Humans are just illusions tormenting me while acting out all sorts of emotions.'

However, there was one exception.

If Shirone wasn't an illusion - for example, if an absolute being appeared and guaranteed that he was human.

'Perhaps I might think differently...'

With all the stars' gazes focused on Freed, time passed relentlessly.

While ordinary humans couldn't endure such an atmosphere for even a minute, the stars maintained their positions for over an hour.

"I would like to make a report."

At that moment, Rampa, a 3-star resident from the System Inspection Department, raised his hand.

He was an old man over 100 years old, and a yellow-glowing bird had perched on his wrinkled hand.

'Rampa. The world's greatest information mage.'

The range of his information transmission magic Telebird encompassed virtually the entire planet.

Under the Judicial Blade's surveillance, Freed, still lost in thought, asked bluntly.

"What is it? At such a critical time."

"I thought you should know before making your decision. Just moments ago, the emperor of the Kashan Empire changed."

Shirone's head whipped around.

"The emperor changed?"

Rampa waited for Freed's instruction.

"Continue."

"The succession ceremony has just ended. The new emperor is Gando, the biological son of Theraze Mistra. Also, Kashan has withdrawn from the Holy War and appears to be siding with Gustav."

'Uorin... abandoned Kashan.'

In other words, Gustav's forces would become far stronger than before.

'What's happening?'

As Shirone turned his head, Taesung used Gaia's ability to project Kashan's territory.

"Hiya! Run! Run!"

Harvitz was racing across the vast territory of the Kashan Empire with Hell's army trailing behind him.

On the distant horizon, Kashan's defense forces protecting the capital were surging forward like a tsunami.

'They're always the ones having all the fun.'

Tormenting prisoners in occupied territories and sitting high up traveling all day was boring to death.

"I'm going!"

Smodo, startled by Harvitz's impulsive action, hurriedly mounted his horse and gave chase.

"Damn it! What the hell are you thinking!"

Though he was outside the law, he was still human in the end - if stabbed by a sword, he could only die.

Smodo shouted to Vulcan, who was riding alongside him.

"Is this okay? He'll die at this rate!"

"No."

Vulcan's lips curved upward.

"He won't die."

The 30,000-strong Kashan defense forces and Hell's army collided, forming a distinct battle line.

Harvitz's figure disappeared into the mass of weapons.

"Let me kill some too!"

Harvitz's martial prowess, as he ran around the battlefield like a child swinging his sword, was at an ordinary level.

Yet no one could kill him, and having tasted blood, he ventured even deeper.

"What? That's the emperor, isn't it?"

The archer unit's commander quickly changed direction and gave orders to his soldiers.

"Shoot! If we capture just that guy, the war is over!"

A thousand soldiers shot their arrows simultaneously.

The arrows that soared into the sky fell in parabolic arcs, and premium magic ammunition exploded.

The entire area was devastated, and massive demons rolled on the ground with their flesh torn apart.

"Is it over?"

Hope lit up in the commander's eyes.

But at that moment, Harvitz burst through the smoke, completely unharmed.

"Damn! Everyone reload... No, I'll finish him myself!"

As the commander drew his sword and charged, Harvitz also rushed forward without hesitation.

'Stupid fool. He's determined to die.'

Countless demons were fighting around them, but none stepped forward to help Satan.

'I can get him! I'll capture him! I'll become a hero!'

From just one exchange, he could tell Harvitz's swordsmanship was barely intermediate level.

'This is real! I'm going to get the emperor...'

His heart pounded wildly.

"Hyaaaaa!"

He delivered what was arguably the greatest sword strike of his entire life.

"What..."

The blade futilely slashed through empty air as Harvitz leaned back, the sword barely grazing his throat.

'Was he lucky? That can't be.'

He swung his sword repeatedly, but only managed to barely cut Harvitz's collar.

'Damn it! He doesn't even have armor! Is he actually a sword master? But these ridiculous movements...'

He didn't get the feeling that Harvitz was watching and dodging at all.

'Huh?'

The moment he saw Harvitz's face, the commander's body froze and trembled.

'His eyes... are closed?'

Vulcan smiled.

"It's not a miracle."

When all of humanity that had lived through history threw the dice, Harvitz was simply the last one remaining.

'It's probability, probability.'

Someone had to remain anyway.

'It becomes a natural thing.'

Just as being born into this world after beating billions of competitors is natural to us.

"Your Majesty! Are you enjoying yourself!"

Vulcan, who had beheaded the commander in one stroke, laughed heartily as he stopped his horse.

"So-so. But I want to see Uorin soon."

"She'll be in our hands before long."

As Smodo arrived belatedly, Vulcan looked out over Hell's army advancing toward Aganoth.

In the distance, white flags were fluttering.
