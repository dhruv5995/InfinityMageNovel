Satan's Proposal (3)

Was it just bad luck that Seriel ran into Fermi at the bookstore she frequented that day?

"You, you..."

Or was it terrible bad luck?

"How are you here?"

Seriel, who had been looking dazed for a moment, quickly hid the copy of "Primal Snare" she was reading.

'Ugh, so embarrassing.'

It was a preference she could proudly display in front of anyone, but this time was an exception.

Fermi said with a smile.

"You don't need to hide it. 'Primal Snare.' It's popular among women. Not really my taste though."

"Huh? You know about this too?"

Seriel, who had suddenly felt interested, changed her expression again and asked indifferently.

"Anyway... why are you here?"

"It's a bookstore. And our family is in the publishing business. We've probably got quite a few books in here too."

"Ah, right."

Ardino was a famous family that ranked in the top 20 of Tormia's business world.

Of course, their main income wasn't from general books, but from top-grade information like magic and alchemy.

'I'd have to be matched with this guy for it to make sense.'

Fermi continued speaking.

"I'm doing some research for my father's request, and suddenly I saw you. By the way, how is it?"

"What?"

"The sequel to 'Primal Snare.' The response among readers has been pretty good, right? I heard the roles are reversed this time."

If he already knew about it, there was no need to hide it, but more than that, the desire to share was stronger.

Seriel held out the book.

"Yes! It's totally amazing! This time the male protagonist gets caught in the female protagonist's snare. And..."

What came next was too embarrassing to say out loud, so Seriel cleared her throat.

"Ahem! Anyway, that's how it is."

Fermi's eyes curved like seagulls.

"So that's your thing. SM, I mean."

"What's it to you? And the act isn't important. What matters is who the target is. Meyton is a wonderful nobleman."

That was the male protagonist's name.

"Is that so? He was a victim of a political marriage, married to a 62-year-old woman. He was sexually exploited. Then he meets the female protagonist, who's a maid, and discovers his hidden nature."

Fermi knew the story well.

"From then on, she ties him up in all sorts of ways. The philosophy of restraint was interesting, but he's still a pervert, isn't he?"

"Hmph! Like you're any better? And you're completely leaving out why Meyton became that way. From when he was fifteen, his wife Madeline..."

Seriel stopped speaking.

'Why am I having this conversation with him?'

Fermi chuckled.

"You really like it. Well, since he resembles me, it's natural that he's popular with women."

"Huh? What did you say?"

"A cold, intellectual man who overcame childhood trauma. Most importantly, he's handsome. That's exactly me, right?"

Seriel said nothing, but a frightening murderous intent flickered in her eyes.

"Sorry. Please spare me."

"Sigh. Whatever, just go away quickly, okay? This older sister is taking a rare break."

Fermi was actually older.

"Want to go together? You seem to be just hanging around with nothing to do anyway. Let's grab some food."

"Are you crazy? Why would I eat with you?"

"Well, because it's better than eating alone? We see each other every day in the school cafeteria anyway."

Seriel smiled mischievously.

"Aha, now I get it. So right now, you're hitting on me, aren't you?"

"Well, I guess that's what it amounts to?"

'Look at this guy.'

Though it wasn't confirmed, she had heard rumors that the Golden Circle had a history with women.

"Haha! Don't tell me you're scared? That I might devour you..."

"Fine! Let's go. Let's go."

At the thought that made her skin crawl, Seriel forcibly turned Fermi's body around.

"But I'm choosing the restaurant. This worked out well actually. I had something I wanted to ask you about too."

It was an opportunity to hear directly from the leader about the Golden Circle's corruption that was rampant in the school.

'Amy, wait. I'm getting some premium information.'

When she placed the book on the counter, the bookstore owner checked the price and returned it.

"Is he your boyfriend? He's handsome."

Just as Seriel was about to wave her hands and speak, Fermi beat her to it.

"Thank you. Here's the payment for the book."

When Fermi placed silver coins on the counter, Seriel turned around with a bewildered expression.

"What? Why are you paying?"

"I'm trying to make a good impression. These little surprises are Meyton's charm point, aren't they?"

"Ha."

Even a snort barely came out.

"Don't tell me you were serious? Let me be clear, you can't become Meyton. That person may seem cold on the outside, but he has very tender sensitivity in his heart."

Seriel pointed at him and continued.

"Not a pitch-black heart like yours!"

The bookstore owner laughed.

"Are you fighting over 'Primal Snare'? Well, there are many couples like that. You seem to be fans, so why don't you go to the plaza? I heard that author came today."

Seriel's head turned quickly.

"What? Author Sirius?"

"Yes. It seems he tours Tormia doing autograph sessions every holiday. It probably started by now..."

"Thank you!"

Seriel grabbed her book and left the bookstore, with Fermi hurriedly following and asking.

"Hey! What about food?"

"Food isn't the problem right now! Just hurry up and follow me!"

When they arrived at the plaza, people were lined up under a banner hung high.

Most were women, and the age range was diverse.

"It's real? Author of 'Primal Snare,' Sirius. Autograph session commemorating sequel publication."

Seriel, who read the banner text, hugged her book to her chest and stamped her feet.

"What do I do! I'm so nervous! What kind of person will he be? He must have a cold impression. His aura must be amazing too. Sirius, doesn't even the pen name give off that kind of feeling?"

"He's over there."

At the table Fermi pointed to sat a man boasting a huge physique.

"Some hairy uncle?"

A man with a black beard who seemed far from romance was signing autographs.

Fermi said, trying to hold back laughter.

"Is he Meyton's reincarnation?"

Seriel, who had been glaring with her mouth tightly shut, took a deep breath and got in line.

"It's okay. A writer's power comes from their writing. He must have a delicate personality."

Time was delayed because Sirius continued conversing with a female reader.

"See, I was right, wasn't I?"

Seriel's shoulders were full of tension, but soon something would happen to make her look foolish.

"Next."

When a couple came for autographs, unlike before, Sirius didn't even make eye contact.

"Author, could you also write my name..."

"Next!"

The boyfriend of the woman who was snubbed asked the author with an unpleasant expression.

"How long does it take to write a name? You talked with that woman before for 5 minutes."

"So what? Do you think I'm a joke? Are you two a couple? Just because you have a girlfriend doesn't mean you can act like you own the place?"

The boyfriend was dumbfounded.

"No, what is this... Are you feeling unwell?"

"Get lost right now! My readers are only women! And only women without boyfriends! Isn't that right, everyone?"

Some booed, but cheers erupted loud enough to drown out the jeers.

Seriel gaped in bewilderment.

"What's going on here?"

"He's a novelist. As someone in the publishing business, I can say there are quite a few people like that. Think about it. You only immerse yourself in novels for 2 hours, but that person lives in novels all day long."

"It's a kind of occupational disease."

"Haha! Well, that's right. The lives of characters in novels are much more important than his own life. The only things that guy can do in reality are probably drinking, smoking, and causing trouble for couples at autograph sessions."

Seriel made a tearful face.

"I'll be okay, right? We're not a couple. What if he misunderstands?"

Seriel's wish was not granted.

After waiting for about an hour, just when their turn was finally in sight, the host said.

"Now, now! Today's autograph session is over. Please continue to love author Sirius."

Disappointed sighs followed, but Sirius left the table as is.

"Too bad. If he had just done 3 more, I could have gotten one."

Fermi said nothing.

Following Sirius with his gaze, he saw him entering a cafe in the plaza.

"Give me that book."

Fermi, who snatched "Primal Snare," ran toward the cafe Sirius had entered.

"Hey! Fermi!"

When Seriel followed, countless readers were camped in front of the cafe.

"Does Meyton really love Elgia? If he loves her, why doesn't he divorce his wife?"

While readers each asked questions, Fermi pushed through the crowd.

"Excuse me."

When he opened the cafe door, the host blocked him.

"Sorry. The autograph session is over. The author is tired, so next time..."

"He's this kind of person."

Fermi handed over a business card he received from his father.

Seeing the Ardino family seal, the host flustered and stepped aside.

"Please come this way."

Before Fermi approached, the host quickly whispered to Sirius.

"Hmph! So what?"

Seeing the reaction, Fermi had an intuition.

'Ah, this type.'

Most authors are kind to readers, but occasionally there are stubborn ones like this.

"Hello. I'm Fermi of the Ardino family."

"I know. You were in line."

Of course, the reason Sirius remembered wasn't because of Fermi, but because of Seriel.

"My friend is a fan of yours. She's not my girlfriend, of course. Could I ask for an autograph?"

"Haha! Really?"

Sirius sneered.

"What do you think I am? Do you think an author who writes erotic novels wouldn't know? You're doing this to win her favor. You can't fool my eyes."

It was true.

"Yes. But she's really not my girlfriend. Could you help with your generous understanding?"

Fermi doesn't treat customers rudely.

"I understand the situation, but there are no exceptions. You might say a guy who's not even a great writer is being too proud, but I have my own writing philosophy. Without that, I couldn't do this work."

'This type, this kind.'

It was the worst compatibility for a publisher.

"This is modest, but..."

Finally, Fermi resorted to his last resort, placing a gold coin from his pocket into his hand.

No matter how much of a hit "Primal Snare" was, it was an amount that would be difficult to refuse.

"Oh, money."

Sirius clutched the gold coin.

"Money's good. I like money too. Why wouldn't I? But businessman, aren't you mistaken about something?"

He put the gold coin into Fermi's inner pocket.

"I don't write to make money. I make money to write. Some noble offered a fortune to change the story. I refused. Do you know why? The only time I change something is..."

Sirius, gripping his iced coffee cup, threw it at Fermi's face and shouted.

"Only when I judge it's better for the readers! And that has nothing to do with money."

As coffee dripped down Fermi's face, the readers outside the window made a fuss.

"Oh my, oh my! What to do!"

Of course, most had expressions of satisfaction, but Seriel was pale and frozen.

'What kind of person is that guy...'

Anyone at Alpheas Magic School who knew Fermi would think the same.

"...I understand."

Contrary to expectations, Fermi meekly left the shop without even wiping off the coffee.

Coming outside, he discovered that coffee had splattered on the "Primal Snare" sequel.

"Ah?..."

Seriel realized for the first time that Fermi's eyes could also shake with confusion.

"Sorry. Um, you know..."

Fermi awkwardly held the book and said.

"Should I go buy a new one now? I could go alone."

Silence came.

And then.

Seriel burst into laughter, holding her stomach.

"Puhahaha! Hey, you're really funny! Puhahaha!"

"Why? What's so funny?"

Fermi probably wouldn't know.

Though it was a book Seriel loved so much, it was still just one book.

'At that time, Fermi...'

Although they didn't get the autograph, he knew what was really important.

'Honestly, he was kind of cool.'

In Seriel's eyes... he was quite a decent man.
