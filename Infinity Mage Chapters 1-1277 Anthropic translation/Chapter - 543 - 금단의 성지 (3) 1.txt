[543] The Forbidden Sanctuary (3)

"How are you here...?"

Sirone couldn't find the source of the words that had escaped his lips.

Though memories had gradually returned as he encountered countless incidents, this was the first time such strong nostalgia had been evoked.

"Lord Administrator!"

At Yolga's scream, he looked up to see her caught by the Mucus Man, buried in the wall's slime and moving somewhere into the darkness.

"Damn it!"

As Sirone rushed toward the door, he encountered three people who had belatedly followed Ryan.

They were faces that seemed somehow familiar.

"It's been a while, Sirone."

As Marsha delivered her prepared line, severe pain once again surged through Sirone's head.

"Ugh!"

Miro, Marsha, Fermi.

Whether good or bad, they were figures who had left strong impressions in reality.

'Just who are these people...?'

As their information naturally meshed with Sirone's knowledge, new memories were born.

Descendants of fairies.

Because they were descendants of the fairy race, only a few of whom were mixed into society, they could wield special abilities.

"Help me! Yolga was captured! She must have gone underground!"

No one moved.

Just as no adult would interfere in children's games, to people in an open state, the affairs of this place were meaningless.

"As expected. Let's subdue him first."

"Fermi...!"

Looking back at Fermi, Sirone recalled memories of being tormented terribly by him in fairy society and ground his teeth.

"There's no time to fight. If you won't help, I'll go rescue Yolga alone."

"Do as you please."

Just as magic was about to activate, Ryan spoke.

"Right. Let's go, Sirone."

Fermi's head whipped around.

"What are you doing?"

Ryan turned completely toward Sirone, ignoring him.

"I don't know who she is, but she must be precious to you. Let's go rescue her."

Fermi looked at Miro and Marsha.

"Are you going to leave him be?"

"We have no choice but to go. This is Sirone, after all."

The Sirone that Marsha knew wasn't someone who would ignore misfortune before his eyes, regardless of any greater cause.

Fermi placed his last hope in Miro, but she too began stretching and headed toward Marsha.

"It's a majority vote in favor."

"Aunt, but this is..."

"Let's give in just this once. You know what kind of personality Sirone has, right? And now you know Ryan's personality too."

"There's a limit to being frustrating."

Miro let out a chuckle and moved both hands, causing Guanyin's Avatar to appear like a halo.

Shortly after, giant palms struck down on the floor.

Kuuuuuung!

The impact was enough to shake the entire arboretum, but only palm-shaped impressions were left on the floor.

Noticing everyone's gaze, Miro smiled awkwardly.

"Ahaha, this building is really sturdy, isn't it?"

Sirone exploded in frustration.

"Are you laughing right now? I'd rather do it myself...!"

"Huuuuuu."

As Miro exhaled deeply, Sirone's eyes widened.

Guanyin's Avatar grew dozens of times larger than before, reaching the arboretum's ceiling.

'One Finger!'

As Miro pointed her index finger at the floor, Guanyin's giant finger consecutively pierced through the building's floors.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Marsha screamed as she fell, followed by everyone plummeting to the 10th basement level, the facility's lowest floor.

Fermi grumbled while dusting himself off.

"What a temper..."

Sirone couldn't take his eyes off Miro.

"Just who are you?"

"I think it would be better to talk while we move?"

As Miro pointed toward the corridor, slime revealing Yolga's curves was rapidly moving toward the darkness.

"Stop!"

Sirone's group quickly launched themselves forward, but the end of the corridor was blocked by a massive glass wall.

"What is this?"

Only Sirone knew the answer.

'Magnetic levitation elevator...'

When he placed his hand on the glass wall, LED lines appeared and a rectangular panel emerged.

Sirone brought his hand to the palm-shaped fingerprint scanner, and soon the fingerprint glowed before the glass door opened.

'As expected, my records are stored here.'

It was natural for people who would awaken from hibernation in the future to be able to use the facilities.

Following Sirone into the elevator, soft light descended from the ceiling.

"Where are we going?"

The moment Miro finished speaking, the elevator shot toward the darkness at tremendous speed.

But because the surroundings were dark, after passing the acceleration zone, they couldn't even feel they were moving.

"It must be where the Mucus control device is located."

Even before hibernation, he hadn't imagined such a massive facility would be hidden underground.

'There's probably more than one entrance. All major institutions likely have these installed underground.'

Finishing his thoughts, Sirone finally looked back at his companions.

"What exactly happened? What occurred to us?"

Having a sense of dissonance was a positive sign.

"Listen carefully to what I'm about to say, Sirone. It may be hard to believe, but it's reality. This world you're living in right now..."

Miro watched Sirone's reaction as she spoke.

"It's all fake. Even you."

Sirone remained silent for a long time, but unlike Malta's wife, he chose to listen first.

"I don't understand what you mean."

"Good. Then I'll start from the beginning."

When Miro revealed everything he needed to know, even Sirone couldn't help but be shocked this time.

"Fake? This entire world?"

"Yes. So whatever happens here, you don't need to worry about it. What you need to do is save the real you..."

"That can't be."

Sirone shook his head.

"I'm not being blindly faithful, I mean... it really can't be true."

Miro understood Sirone's feelings.

"You probably feel that way. But you have to believe me. Descendants of fairies? No, I'm human. Your memories and mine can't be different, right?"

"Lies!"

Finally, Sirone couldn't hold back.

"It's memory confusion from the aftereffects of artificial hibernation! The administrator said so too! He said it could happen if you're in hibernation for a long time!"

"That's also a lie. It's just an artificial memory created to naturally blend into Apocalypse's information."

"You expect me to believe that?"

Marsha spoke.

"You have to believe it, Sirone. Otherwise, the real you will die."

"Damn it!"

Sirone turned away as if he didn't want to hear it and paced anxiously around the elevator.

Ryan approached him and said.

"Sirone, it must be difficult, but..."

"I'll believe it."

Sirone turned around.

"Fine, I'll believe it. Maybe what Miro said could be true. So I'm saying I believe it."

Sirone spread both arms and looked at the four people.

"Now what? Will something change in me? Or do I need to do something more?"

"..."

This was the real problem.

Even if Sirone believed Miro's words, nothing would change.

Thinking that something might be possible and truly feeling that it is are as distant as the ends of the universe.

Whiiiiing!

The speeding elevator gradually slowed down, then suddenly dropped straight down.

"Ugh!"

Though they avoided weightlessness as the elevator's internal pressure automatically adjusted, the feeling of air churning in their stomachs was terrible.

'Just how far are we falling?'

The elevator reached its destination before long, but they couldn't even guess how far they were from the surface.

The glass door opened, revealing a passage covered with blinking panels and endlessly connected wires.

Thanks to the terror of falling, Sirone's mind was refreshed as he stepped wide-eyed toward the passage.

Whatever the truth was, rescuing Yolga came first.

Passing a place marked "Special Containment Zone," quiet mechanical sounds leaked from inside a doorless entrance.

As Sirone suddenly launched himself forward with a Photon Cannon in his hand, the group hurriedly followed.

"This is...?"

Sirone stared at the massive object in the center of the hemispherical space, forgetting even his fighting spirit.

The giant lens, reaching two meters in diameter, resembled a human eyeball, and thousands of wires were attached to its steel body, connecting to the surrounding walls.

A single word automatically escaped from Miro's lips.

"Ra?"

Digital Ra (Local Energy Circulation System Quantum Computer).

Fermi asked.

"Ra? This scrap metal machine is that?"

"No, the real Ra is a living being. But it's so similar."

Fermi tried to imagine the real Ra's appearance from Digital Ra's form, but it was meaningless.

"Didn't you say it was erased?"

Erased information cannot exist anywhere.

"Right. Therefore, it's not the real Ra."

The myth was destroyed by one boy.

"It's another god created by humans who couldn't bear the absence of God."

As the device inside Digital Ra's lens rotated, the Mucus Man landed from the ceiling while holding Yolga.

"Yolga! Are you okay?"

Though color briefly returned to Yolga's face, which had been filled with despair, the Mucus Man immediately pulled her roughly.

"Who are you? Why are you here?"

Sirone stepped forward boldly.

"What are you? The world has already ended. So why are you doing this?"

"My name is Ra. I am a humanoid model stored in quantum computer data."

Miro reached her own conclusion.

'Something like an avatar?'

"Actually, it doesn't matter what I'm called. I am a program that purifies the world based on solar energy. Ra is said to be the god of monotheism that ancient humans believed in."

"Whatever kind of computer you are, I cannot accept attacking humans."

"They are merely links in the chain of circulation anyway. Extinguishing life is no different from creating another life."

"You can say that because you have no life. Have you ever grieved someone's death?"

"Humans also rejoice at someone's death."

Sirone ground his teeth.

If artificial intelligence's way of thinking could be changed with words, the world wouldn't have ended up like this.

'I have no choice but to fight. But Yolga is captured...'

While Sirone was lost in thought, Marsha stepped toward Ra.

"Whatever the case. If you need a human, how about me instead?"

"Marsha?"

As Sirone looked back, she winked with one eye.

'If I can just stab with the Dagger of Betrayal...'

As Ra's arm stretched out to grab Marsha's neck and pull her in, Yolga shouted in bewilderment.

"Are you crazy? Volunteering to be a hostage!"

"Yeah. I guess I am."

Marsha's expression suddenly turned cold as she drew the Dagger of Betrayal from the back of her left hand.

Stabbing Ra's side, she saw black smoke spewing out and her eyes sparkled.

'It works! If this is the case...!'

Marsha frantically continued stabbing with the dagger, and Ra watched the smoke escaping from his body without any reaction.

"What is this?"

Only then did Marsha realize something was wrong and stopped attacking.

"Damn it!"

The wounds made by the irregular formula were healing by themselves.

"You're transforming information."

The quantum computer's backup capability exceeded human imagination.

"I will analyze your data."

From the wall's mucus, slime resembling a leopard-like beast burst out and attacked Marsha.

It was a model of a specific creature that Ra had digested before the world's destruction.

"It's dangerous!"

Without realizing it, Sirone launched himself forward, embracing Marsha and rolling on the floor.

"Sirone...?"

As their eyes met, Sirone's pupils shook.

It's okay to hug me.

"Graaaah!"

As the beast stretched its hind legs and flew at them, Sirone reached out with a surprised expression.

"Dangerous!"

Just as Ryan charged forward and was about to shout.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

As crashing sounds rolled in from deep within the underground facility, Ra's head quickly turned.

Crash!

A single sword broke through the iron wall and flew like a clothesline, piercing through the beast's cheek before being caught in Sirone's hand.

"...Armand."

Simultaneously, the blade opened wide like spider legs and swallowed Sirone's entire body.
