**Desperate Formation (1)**

"Death God's Dance."

The moment Natasha's voice reached him, a dull impact struck Lee An's face.

The last position he had confirmed her at was a point 40 meters away from here.

'Simultaneously with the sound...?'

She had arrived.

'No, perhaps even faster than that.'

The scenery in his vision swayed left and right, and he couldn't even comprehend where or how he had been hit.

'I need to create distance.'

Lee An kicked off the ground and retreated.

If Natasha was pursuing him, no matter what trajectory she took, she would be ahead.

"Hiyaaaah!"

As he carved deeply into the earth with his great sword, a house-sized boulder rose into the air.

'Can she break through this too?'

Lee An pressed his foot against the boulder and pushed with all his might.

"Haaap!"

Natasha, who had been charging toward Lee An, spotted the massive boulder flying toward her like a cannonball.

'Hmm.'

The moment it approached right before her eyes, the vector reversed, and as she stepped back, she threw a right jab.

Tap.

Before fragments could even scatter from the fist-sized broken rock, her left jab shot out again.

Tap tap.

Her upper body, moving at the same speed as the projectile, created afterimages as it swayed rapidly left and right.

Tap tap tap tap tap tap.

Her two arms and fists moving from her shoulders struck the boulder at speeds invisible to the eye.

Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap!

"Gnawing away" would have been an accurate description, but due to the incredible speed, the boulder was shattered in an instant.

"Damn it!"

By the time Lee An could form anything resembling a thought, Natasha was already right before his eyes.

As her fists reciprocated at the same speed she had used to destroy the boulder, heavy impacts exploded across Lee An's entire body.

Accepting the delay of consecutive strikes, Natasha swung her fist wide and twisted Lee An's jaw.

"Kugh!"

Feeling pain that resonated through his bones, Lee An slid across the ground as he retreated and regained his balance.

"Ow..."

Natasha, who had stopped in a pose with one leg raised, looked back at Lee An and shook out her fist.

"Incredibly hard. These are fists that can break rocks."

Lee An remained silent.

If not for Idea's information restoration ability, his muscles would have already ruptured and his bones would have been crushed.

'If it's just moving quickly, I can do that too.'

However, since thought also follows the speed of nerves, the scope of thinking inevitably narrows.

'What kind of woman is this?'

Natasha had no such weakness.

The reason she had removed her eyelids was because even blinking became an interference at her level of speed.

'This is what they call genius.'

Lee An lifted his chin and spoke.

"Bad luck. Among those who fight with talent, none have escaped being cut by me."

"I'm a woman, though?" Natasha pointed at Lee An.

"I know what that ability is. It's the same as Guy's, right? Your swordsmanship is remarkably similar too."

Ozent Guy.

Lee An's chest tightened again as he thought of his brother, but burying his sorrow in his heart, he said:

"Don't be mistaken."

Lee An pointed to himself.

"I am the original."

Right, brother?

"Really...?"

As if she truly hadn't known, Natasha made an interested expression and nodded her head repeatedly.

"Anyway, want to continue? You're strong, but honestly, you don't seem very good at fighting."

That was Natasha's assessment.

"Don't worry. I've heard that a lot too. This time won't disappoint."

Lee An gripped his great sword tightly.

'The cavalry isn't coming.'

If something had happened where Tess was, he needed to end the battle quickly.

'The ultimate strike.'

No matter how excellent one's combat sense, if he could cut at a speed that prevented even reaction, that would be enough.

"Huuuuu."

As Mach's energy emanated, the scenery around Lee An wavered dizzily.

"Ooh."

Above Natasha, who bent both knees, the avatar of death illuminated 10 steel cables.

"Here I come."

The moment his words fell, a single flash of light was born centered on Lee An.

As the power of Breakthrough struck the ground, the earth split with a tremendous roar for hundreds of meters.

As powerful seismic waves advanced, the horses of the distant cavalry fell into chaos.

"Oh?"

Habitz turned around.

"An interesting fellow."

The realm of Idea exists outside the laws in that it changes information itself beyond physics, but...

"That doesn't mean you can ignore the laws."

Habitz wasn't worried.

"Being able to tear the fabric of the universe a little doesn't mean you're as fast or strong as the universe."

As his torn arm muscles rapidly restored information, Lee An surveyed ahead.

Natasha was in a twisted posture, and beneath her feet, a straight crack extended endlessly.

Of the 10 steel cables connected to the death god's skull, as many as 3 were severed.

"Phew."

Natasha, having regained her senses, exhaled.

"Really fast."

Giving praise meant she was alive, and therefore Lee An's mood wasn't good.

'She dodged it, the Breakthrough Sword.'

It was a strike that even True Demon Faust couldn't avoid.

'Perhaps...'

It was a possible thought since those who could match Lee An equally could be counted on one hand in this world.

'This woman might be the strongest.' At least on this planet.

"You're Lee An, right? The Mach Swordsman." No hostility could be read in Natasha's eyes, but it had been the same when she killed countless humans anyway.

"Why do you kill humans?"

Lee An asked.

"What's your reason for waging war? That Habitz fellow does it for fun, but I don't sense any conviction from you."

"Hmm."

Natasha put her hand to her lips and thought.

"No particular reason. Actually, it's not even fun. It's just what I'm good at? Habitz said I was good at it too."

She smiled brightly.

"What I really love is dancing. But I can't do that anymore."

"Why? Your physical abilities are the strongest."

"I'm not the strongest."

Natasha's pupils moved sideways.

"I'm just a puppet."

Silence flowed.

"Can't you fight for humans?"

"You want me on your side?"

"So to speak, yes. You're human too, so it would be better to fight demons on humanity's side, right?"

As if she had never really thought about it, Natasha shook her head after long consideration.

"Sorry. I don't want to betray Habitz. I knew him before you. I don't really understand the meaning anyway."

It was certainly like she had a screw loose, but that's why Lee An felt frustrated.

'There seems to be some clue.'

It was regrettable that he wasn't skilled with words.

"Lee An!"

Tess's voice came from far away, and a group of cavalry rushed toward this place.

Habitz was riding behind Tess, but no one was aware of this fact.

Tess, confirming that Natasha was still intact, made a wide detour and arrived at Lee An.

"Are you okay?"

She tried to dismount, but Habitz was gripping her waist tightly, making it impossible.

Lee An, watching Tess endlessly pretend to dismount, turned his head.

Most of the cavalry had one arm severed, and some were missing ankles.

Though Lee An's brain recognized the sight of them bleeding profusely as natural...

'What is this?'

His stomach churned slightly.

'Am I missing something?'

The very act of suspicion was remarkable.

'I can barely stand this anxiety.' The realm of Idea?

Or a fresh sensation from encountering events that occurred in a different space for the first time?

'It must be my imagination.'

But ultimately, humans cannot abandon their brains.

"Lee An, what's wrong? Your face is pale."

As Habitz released her waist, Tess finally dismounted and approached Lee An.

"It's nothing. More importantly..."

As Habitz cut the throat of a man over Tess's shoulder, Lee An's words were cut short.

'What the hell is going on!'

Habitz smiled and looked back.

"You'd better decide quickly. If I kill them all, your girlfriend is next."

Saying this, he stabbed his sword into another soldier's back, and the blade protruded through his chest.

The blade was clearly reflected on Lee An's retina, but his brain processed it as if it weren't there.

"Let's go back. You're not in good condition right now."

As Tess confirmed Natasha's position and pulled Lee An's arm, soldiers continued dying.

"Tess..."

Lee An hesitated.

'Should I tell her? No, there's no way to explain.'

She would say he was crazy.

It was like clapping and hearing a sound, then saying that was incredibly strange.

"3 left."

Habitz, killing the cavalry, gradually approached Tess while spinning his sword.

"2."

As Lee An watched a soldier's neck snap cleanly, his shoulders trembled.

'I'm missing something important.'

Sometimes in life you get a bad feeling, and this was like that magnified tens of thousands of times.

"Last 1."

The cavalry was annihilated, and Habitz approached with his sword hanging toward Tess's back.

"...Tess."

"Yeah?"

It didn't matter if she thought he was crazy.

"Get down!"

The moment Habitz raised his sword horizontally, Lee An pressed down on Tess's shoulder.

"Hiyaaaah!"

And with all his strength, he launched a strike into the air powerful enough to sweep away everything around.

Whoooooong!

A massive shockwave containing Mach's law flew toward Habitz's nape.

0.666 seconds into that event.

"Ooooooooh!"

Twelve members of Shiok rose from underground and surrounded Habitz in a circle.

Attacks were delivered at every moment except for 0.666 seconds, and Natasha quickly moved positions.

As the sound of the world splitting vibrated their eardrums, Tess squeezed her eyes shut.

"Kugh!"

Waiting for the pain to subside, she bolted upright and shouted:

"What are you doing so suddenly?" Lee An kept his mouth firmly shut.

His gaze was fixed on the ground 2 meters away from where Tess stood.

'What is this?'

As if fires had been lit in that spot, 12 black holes formed a circle.

'They weren't there just moments ago.'

Perhaps he simply hadn't seen them. So this alone couldn't be proof that he wasn't going insane, but...

'No. Something was definitely there.' An abnormal phenomenon had existed in this place.

"Kiiiiiii!"

At that moment, a strange bird flew from the demon camp and made an eerie cry.

'Retreat signal.'

Natasha, checking the moon's position, said:

"Let's play again next time."

The moment she kicked off the ground, her body evaporated, and Habitz approached Lee An.

"Interesting. I believe it's called Idea. A fellow worth watching."

Everywhere yet felt by no one.

"Someday I will control all links. Until then, you'd better work hard at uncovering secrets."

It was Satan's whisper.

As Habitz left and released his avatar technique beyond the radius, Tess's eyes widened greatly.

"Th-this can't be...!"

Seeing the corpses of soldiers scattered everywhere, finally all the circumstances clicked together.

"Habitz was here."

He had blocked her path, killed her subordinates, and had even ridden here together on horseback.

"How, how could I not know? No, I did know. I was aware of it! Lee An!"

Lee An also swallowed hard.

"Habitz..."

The 12 holes created where Shiok had been looked like passages leading to hell.
