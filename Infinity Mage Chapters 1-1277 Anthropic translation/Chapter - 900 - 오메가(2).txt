Omega (2)

Zion.

The Antarctic continent, hit directly by Uriel's Ragnarok, continued to crack and tear apart relentlessly.

As the monks' sanctuary collapsed, Arius hurriedly escaped outside.

"Woof woof! Grrrrrr!"

Though blinded with his eyes gouged out, the presence hovering in the air was something he had experienced before.

"It's the army of heaven!"

The monks protecting Zion immediately sprang into action, but there was nothing they could do.

"That one is..."

A magnificent vibration was spreading around Uriel as he flew through the sky.

'An archangel. Of all times, now...'

With Miro and most of the executives away, there was no way to stop an archangel.

"Humans."

As the massive body landed on the ground with a thud, each monk formed hand seals.

"Hmm."

Uriel looked around.

Steam was rising from all directions as the ice melted from the tremendous heat.

"Where is Miro?"

Dharma of the Immortal Community, who had joined Zion, walked toward Uriel representing everyone.

Behind him followed Hyega, Dharma's disciple, and Skye Wigo, who had once been a candidate for the Ivory Tower.

"Dharma."

Though the hierarchy between archangel and divine citizen was vast, Uriel knew of Dharma and Hyega from the Immortal Community.

"Are you betraying us?"

"A seeker is one who moves forward in search of righteousness. Those left behind may feel betrayed, but..."

Fighting spirit arose from Dharma's body.

"That doesn't mean we can grasp a rotten rope."

Uriel, who had been listening calmly, felt the energy of laws closing in from all directions.

At the same time, Dharma thrust out his fist.

'Elegant Vajra Fist!'

As the atmosphere compressed, wind that seemed to perfectly imprint the shape of a fist struck Uriel hard.

"Now's the chance!"

With a thud, Uriel's body was pushed back dozens of meters, and all the monks maximized their laws.

"Bind him!"

Angels born from specific concepts have the weakness of being vulnerable to opposing laws.

This was why Ikael had instructed them to strike Zion first upon arriving on this planet.

"This is absurd."

Even the laws that had sealed the Spiritual Fist were woefully insufficient to block Uriel's concept.

"No, it's always been like this."

Adrias Miro.

"Wasn't it a pathetic race that survived by squeezing out one person's life?"

Though each angel thinks differently, Miro was the only human Uriel acknowledged.

"Perish."

Uriel's heavenly weapon, the Paradise Club, emerged from beyond his elbow and rotated at a terrifying speed.

Whiiiiiiing!

Just hearing the sound of air rupturing made the monks' faces turn pale.

"Heavenly Treasure Wheel."

As a pitch-black disc flew toward them, Hyega extended his one arm.

'Vajra Body!'

His body glowed transparently, and the air around him transformed into 40 meters of diamond thickness.

"Kugh!"

The moment the Heavenly Treasure Wheel crashed into it, Hyega's focus shook terrifyingly.

'I can't hold it.'

As he tilted the defensive wall diagonally, the Heavenly Treasure Wheel began scraping up the surface as it climbed.

"Uaaaah!"

Though he deflected the Heavenly Treasure Wheel, moments later the massive diamond began cracking with splitting sounds.

"This is..."

Resignation filled Hyega's eyes as he watched the crack racing toward him.

"Hyega! Get away!"

The moment Dharma's shout ended, Hyega's diamond-transformed body shattered into pieces.

"Hyega!"

Blood-shot eyes blazing, Dharma charged toward Uriel, frantically throwing punches.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

As Uriel deflected the Vajra Fist with his returned Paradise Club, Wigo attacked from the side.

'Dump!'

As the incarnation of a holy warrior in white armor simultaneously unleashed cause and effect, holy swords flew from all directions.

"Tsk..."

Uriel's displeased voice.

Hearing the ominous vibration, Wigo saw a massive judicial halo in his eyes.

'Ragnarok.'

The moment white electricity coiled around Uriel's body, thunder erupted.

Boooooom!

Even Dharma, whose sense of mission had been strengthened by Hyega's death, stopped in his tracks at this moment.

"This can't be..."

Wigo had vanished without a trace, and the ice continent had evaporated along Uriel's path.

'Is the difference this great?'

Though he wasn't ignorant about archangels, this was power on a different dimension even among archangels.

'This is Uriel.'

The rumors that his combat power rivaled that of Archangel Ikael were no exaggeration.

Dharma asked.

"What do you want?"

"Destruction."

Uriel pointed at the monks.

"Those who betray God shall face calamity."

"He is not our god."

"There is only one God."

There would be no way to persuade Uriel, who was armed with such extremely simple logic.

"We will fight."

Behind Dharma, the monks steeled their fighting spirit.

"Humans are truly strange."

It was a question that had arisen since Miro created barriers in space-time to block heaven's army.

"You would fight a battle you cannot win?"

"You wouldn't understand, but..."

Dharma bent both legs.

"In human life, there's no such thing as a winnable fight."

Uriel watched as Dharma and all the monks charged forward.

"Is that so."

The face of Miro, who had stood against heaven's army, came to mind.

"So that's why you fight."

The image of her face contorted as if resenting something, tears flowing.

"Indeed, if that's the case."

The monks let out battle cries.

"Uaaaah!"

The moment the judicial halo Ragnarok began rotating, Uriel's body moved.

"Truly pitiful."

White electricity shooting up from the ground pierced through gray clouds spanning dozens of kilometers in radius.

"There!"

Miro, riding Zulu's summoned creature Kaidra, pointed at the lightning rising from the center of the Antarctic continent.

"My God..."

Kang Nan's mouth hung open in bewilderment.

Though they hadn't even reached land yet, the towering lightning was clearly visible to both eyes.

'Judging by the size, it's already over.'

If heaven's army had occupied Zion, charging in like this would be suicide.

"Miro, let's change the strategy..."

"No!"

Miro cut off Kang Nan's words.

"Someone's alive."

If not everyone, if there was even a possibility that one survivor existed, she couldn't give up.

"I'll increase speed."

As Zulu's pupils were sucked into the abyss, Kaidra let out a strange cry.

Kiyaaaah!

Fighting against strong winds, they entered the Antarctic continent, but the continent was already torn to shreds.

'Even for an archangel, this kind of power should be impossible.'

Miro intuited.

"Uriel."

By the time they arrived at Zion, Zulu's pupils, whose whole body was drenched in sweat, rolled upward.

"Zulu!"

The moment Kang Nan supported the unconscious Zulu, Kaidra disappeared from midair.

"Kugh!"

Pulled by tremendous inertia and crashing toward the ground, Kang Nan inflated her thigh muscles and applied the brakes.

After sliding over 2 kilometers on the ice with her bottom, Kang Nan hurriedly twisted her body.

Stopping her movement with a thud, she took in the scene of destruction that had befallen Zion.

Among the blood-stained ice, the corpses of monks hung in tatters.

"You came."

"Woof! Woof woof!"

Arius, the sole survivor, was suffering with his chest trampled under Uriel's foot.

"Uriel."

"The woman who came to heaven."

Since he had been interested in the relationship between Gaold, Miro, and Kang Nan at the time, it was surprising.

"Did you reconcile or something?"

"No. It's a temporary alliance."

Miro walked past Kang Nan.

"Humans don't change that easily."

"Grr! Grrrr!"

As Arius bared his fierce teeth and struggled at his master's appearance, Uriel lifted his leg.

"Woof! Woof!"

Arius immediately turned and rubbed his cheek against Miro's leg, and she crouched down.

"I told you to guard well. What's this?"

Arius said.

"Please run away."

Even at these human words spoken after so long, Miro only smiled.

"He's not an opponent you can defeat."

Only Arius, who had uniquely explored Miro's inner self, knew this.

'The crack in my heart.'

Her feelings for Gaold had now grown beyond a crack into a massive gap that dominated her.

"It's okay."

This is what Gaold had said.

"It's just time to make a choice."

Approaching Uriel, who was only ten steps away, Miro organized her life.

Most things were easy, but one question stubbornly remained.

'The crack in my heart.'

Why did it form?

'I thought I detested that kind of man.'

If there had been no crack from the beginning, her heart wouldn't have grown this large.

"Miro, stop."

When she stopped at Kang Nan's words, Uriel was already standing before her eyes.

"I'm having trouble organizing my thoughts, so could you give me a little more time?"

One of Kang Nan's eyebrows rose.

"Organizing? In this situation..."

"That's not necessary."

Uriel cut off her words and indifferently raised his Paradise Club.

"You'll be destroyed anyway."

Once he smashed it, both his interest in Miro and her existence would be meaningless.

"Ah. That's unfortunate."

Looking up at the Paradise Club filled with killing intent, Miro felt impatience for the first time in her life.

'I want to organize just this.'

So why did the crack form?

"Get away quickly, you idiot!"

As the Paradise Club rotated, burning the air, Kang Nan shouted fiercely and kicked the ground.

Miro sighed.

"Hah."

In the end, she had no choice but to acknowledge it.

"Yeah, you were right."

Even as death approached, Miro turned toward where Gaold was.

"You..."

Before Kang Nan could finish speaking.

"Gaold."

Miro spoke with a bright smile.

"I like you, you jerk."

And now.

'Goodbye.'

As the Paradise Club fell toward Miro's crown as she closed her eyes, Kang Nan felt time slow down.

'It closes.'

The heart that had been shattered to pieces by Gaold was being cleanly regenerated.

'Ah...'

Arius could imagine without seeing.

Such a wondrous awakening.

'It erases.'

For Miro, it was pain equivalent to the entire world.

'I'm sorry, Gaold.'

To think it would be this painful.

A terrible feeling clawed at her heart, too awful to maintain sanity for even a moment.

'Don't forgive me.'

When her eyes snapped open, red tears of blood flowed down Miro's cheeks.

As the Paradise Club passed by, burning the tips of Miro's hair, and was about to complete another revolution.

'Avatar Technique.'

Thousands of arms began sprouting from behind Miro and grasped the Paradise Club.

"Hm?"

As the Paradise Club stopped without even a preparatory motion, air ruptured and spread in all directions.

'She caught the Paradise Club?'

The crack that had been carved like a hairline fracture in Miro's heart was erased as if blown away by wind.

Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara - Omnipresent Projection.

Tens of thousands of arms sprouted from Miro's sides as she turned toward Uriel.

Having gained perfect omnidirectional vision, Miro's eyes flashed, and the palms spread left and right struck Uriel in succession.

Thud thud thud thud thud thud thud!

The endless attacks slipping through split seconds vibrated Uriel before delivering one final blow.

"Kughhh!"

Uriel, sent flying sideways, corrected his posture while scraping along the ground.

'My mind...'

The sacred light body floating above his head shook greatly, unable to absorb the shock.

"Kugh!"

As Uriel knelt on one knee and raised his head, Miro approached while dusting off her hands.

"Whew. Maybe because it's been so long."

Miro, with dried tears of blood etched on her cheeks, smiled arrogantly.

"I'm having trouble finding my center."

Time would solve it anyway, though.
