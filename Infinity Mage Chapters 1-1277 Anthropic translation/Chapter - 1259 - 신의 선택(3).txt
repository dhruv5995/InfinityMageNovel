God's Choice (3)

A tearing sound came from Kitra's throat.

"Kiiiii!"

The cause of humanity that Sirone was changing was completely opposite to the direction God desired.

'Cause correction! Cause correction! Cause correction!'

Though God has no heart, perhaps at this moment alone, He would have been saddened by the fact that He cannot feel anger.

'Tachyon detection.'

Two beings who manipulate imaginary time meant there were two omnipotent gods.

And their collision, whether intentional or not, was bound to drive humanity to destruction.

'Objective achievement impossible.'

Who would win?

'Cannot eliminate the error at this rate.'

It would be the side that had no interest in humanity's destruction, and the cold God finally made a decision.

'O humanity.'

A new command was input.

Die.

Pyramid of Truth.

Glen's eyes suddenly lit up as he screamed and grabbed his own throat.

"Graaaaaah!"

Ares shouted.

"Get a hold of yourself! What the hell is happening?"

He was gripping his throat so tightly that he wouldn't last a minute at this rate.

"Damn! What kind of strength is this?"

Ares pulled at his wrists, but Glen's arms wouldn't budge.

Canis said.

"It's beyond physical strength. Probably signals being sent to the brain. Just break his wrists instead."

"Will that be okay? Won't he do something worse?"

"We have no choice."

Rukia got up.

"I'll do it."

"No. You've lost too much blood. If you strain yourself even a little, your brain will go into shock."

If it weren't for Zulu, the top utility user, she would already be dead.

"Glen wanting to live means half his heart has returned. Then my ability should work on him too."

Using God's Right Hand to directly touch Glen's heart.

"You could die."

"It's okay."

Rukia placed her hand on Glen's chest and said.

"Save yourself. Right?"

The moment God's Right Hand activated, all color completely drained from her face.

"Ugh!"

The group grew anxious, but they could see the strength gradually leaving Glen's hands around his throat.

Ares shouted.

"Just a little more!"

And the next moment, focus returned to Glen's eyes.

"Gasp!"

Like awakening from a grave, he drew in breath and looked around.

What did I just do?

"Glen!"

As Rukia collapsed with a bright smile, Glen hurriedly got up and caught her.

"Rukia! Rukia!"

Ares checked her condition.

"She's fine. Just exhausted. But what happened? Why did you suddenly grab your throat?"

Glen shook his head.

"I don't know. It's not that I wanted to die. But somehow, it felt like it wouldn't matter if I died?"

Emptiness.

"Void. A great void. This world has nothing in it. It's completely empty."

Glen jerked his head up.

"There's no time. Everyone will make the same choice as me. Then this world will end!"

Zulu asked.

"Why? The world doesn't end just because someone dies."

"No, that's not it."

Glen clutched his face.

"I... I saw it. We absolutely can't stop it. We can never beat God!"

Canis said.

"Now that you've regained your heart, you're a coward?"

"You don't understand! It's not about life and death! What God is trying to do to us..."

At that moment, the landscape opened.

"Mr. Zulu."

As Glen stared blankly, Jinseong, who had crossed the boundary of space, turned his head.

"Sirone is calling for you."

Yahweh seemed intent on fighting to the end.

"Call it user code," Lete said.

"The heart itself isn't an error. If it were, I couldn't exist either. But it's not special either. It's just a quantum signal that processes random number codes."

Taesung's figure sitting in the crater landscape looked like a broken machine.

"Humans want to live. It's slightly different from animal survival instinct. And because humans have the heart that wants to live, this world is maintained."

By quantum signals.

"That's the essence of love. But when attachment to life becomes too strong, evil amplifies and the world becomes turbid. Teraforce is the device that prevents this, but it has the limitation of standards of good and evil. What can suppress love is emptiness."

Taesung still showed no reaction.

"Human life starts with love and ends with emptiness. Between them lie countless good and evil. A world where these four directions are in harmony would be Ultima, but even God finds it difficult to balance. Anyway, this world is user-friendly."

God too was created by humans.

"The Illuminati seemed to think that a life controlled by machines was the same as being dead. They'd rather sleep forever than bother reincarnating in the multiverse. So this world is extremely dynamic. All kinds of random numbers collide, and there's a system to process them."

It was the hidden world.

"Missing Link is the core of the reincarnation system. To prevent excessive accumulation of information, the Illuminati receives oblivion codes each time they enter a new world. True immortality in a sense. But it's precisely at this point that errors occur."

When love becomes too strong.

"Some users seem to love this place more than Idea. That's exactly what God and the Illuminati define as an error - the workings of the heart."

Why is the heart dangerous?

"Even if it's an illusion, human user code is connected to Idea. If someone decides to remain in this world, it means even God cannot arbitrarily close it."

Lete walked toward Taesung.

"Of course, God's authority is tremendous. He can kill users, torment them, make them live terribly unhappy lives. But He's not emotional about it."

It was merely the calculation of law.

"But even such a God cannot access user codes. Because it would be an act of hostility toward the Illuminati. Therefore, if all users decide to remain in this world..."

If they integrate into Ultima.

"God cannot close the world by any means."

Taesung blinked once.

"The Illuminati would go crazy. They refuse to wake up from a world that's merely an illusion. Moreover, if the results here transcend God's results, reality and falsehood would be reversed, making their world the illusion. That's why the heart is... the most critical error in the entire universe."

Lete asked again.

"How do we stop it? What's certain is that the Illuminati can't directly intervene in this world either. We can tell from how Sirone couldn't contact the outside world. But if we give God the authority to destroy the master code..."

Humanity might disappear.

"Thinking about it now, the God we follow is just a machine to mediate between two universes. Because imaginary and real time are connected, the Illuminati reached infinity."

Because there are two, there is infinity.

"God is using every means to close the world. Cause manipulation, Cell Buster, waves of humanity. Now He's injecting codes of emptiness, recommending death. Making humans take their own lives to escape to the outside world."

Lete looked at the moon.

"18 minutes and 40 seconds until midnight. I wonder what will happen? Will we still exist 18 minutes and 40 seconds from now?"

It was the apocalypse God had determined.

"It won't be easy. You know a human named Cayden escaped, right? That would have made God's result values slightly wrong. Actually, even a 0.1 percent difference is a tremendous event."

God must be perfect.

Therefore, even a 0.1 percent error would be a worthwhile mistake to change everything.

'That's why it's actually 50-50.'

The odds between God and humanity.

When Taesung showed no response to the end, Lete moved his steps as if giving up.

"I'm going to fight. Farewell."

"Will..."

Taesung spoke for the first time.

"Sirone forgive me?"

After thinking for a moment, Lete slowly turned around.

"Hehe."

Underground passage of Delta headquarters.

"Haak! Haak!"

Havitz was making strange groaning sounds as he pushed through the dark passage.

The moment he was exposed to Photon Cannon Infinity, what flashed through his mind were fragmentary memories.

"Mom."

No, were they really memories?

There was no logic or evidence to distinguish what was real, but Havitz didn't care.

He could just believe it and be done with it.

"Somehow..."

Living was too easy.

"I am free."

In the liberation of feeling that anything was okay to do, Satan's chaos raced toward extremes.

"Kekeke! I'll do whatever I want."

Just as he always had.

"Heek! Heek! Heek! Hiik! Hiik! Hiik!"

Havitz's appearance as he walked, bumping his body here and there, was beyond bizarre.

"Hihi! This is fun!"

Midnight was approaching and the 'Fact and Fiction' game had one last round remaining.

The proposition he had to prove as fact was either killing Sirone or killing Uorin.

"Damn bastard!"

Having confirmed he couldn't kill Yahweh, the only remaining choice was Uorin.

'No, it's different now. I'll kill him. That bastard. I'll tell mom everything.'

Havitz laughed foolishly.

"Hehehe."

Since he'd never lost at any kind of game, this time would be the same.

'Wizard.'

He realized why he liked her.

'Vanishing.'

Vanishing activated.

Uorin's steps stopped.

"What's wrong?"

When Kido looked back, her pupils were captured by perfect terror.

"There's no path."

The golden timeline that had always determined where she should go in any situation had disappeared.

Uorin trembled.

'What am I missing?'

Though she'd etched it into her mind thousands of times while fleeing, the name Havitz wouldn't come to mind.

Kido activated Earth Binding.

"Grrrr!"

His will to bind any enemy sealed a 2-meter radius in perfect swamp.

And Havitz...

"Hihi! Hihihi!"

While bound by Earth Binding, he lifted his foot.

His ankle joint popped out first, then even muscle and skin tore as he took a step forward.

Thud!

The protruding ankle bone struck the ground, but even pain now felt unreal.

"I am free."

The moment his longsword aimed for Uorin's nape.

"Guk!"

Vanishing broke.

"...Huh?"

Uorin and Kido both came to their senses simultaneously, but still couldn't make an immediate judgment.

"Havitz?"

They shuddered at the longsword visible before their eyes, but the question that soon filled their minds was.

'Why didn't he kill me?'

Havitz's face contorted as if choking, and a strange sound leaked from his mouth.

"R-run away."

The voice was Havitz's, but the expression reminded them of someone naive.

'Gando.'

"Graaaaaah!"

Havitz screamed.

Then from his severed ankle, a reddish leg regenerated like coagulated blood.

'That is Gando's body.'

It might not be, but she was certain she would never see him again.

'Gando saved me.'

Uorin threw her body instinctively.

The instant Havitz's longsword, having activated Vanishing again, fell vertically.

'What am I missing right now?'

Two people.

'No, wasn't one of them not human?'

Uorin's calf was cut, and blood burst from Havitz's side.

"Huh?"

Havitz tilted his head.

"Something's strange?"

He couldn't recall the goblin named Kido.
