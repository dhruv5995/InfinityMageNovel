[739] Toward the Stars (3)

Minerva's words calling the Corona Kingdom the terrace of the ivory tower were no exaggeration.

The tower's size, reaching 468 floors, was a crystallization of magic, law, and engineering, equipped with perfect stealth capabilities that no living being could reach on their own.

Shirone calmly watched the scenery outside the elevator as it ascended until the sky's color darkened.

Minerva asked in a bland tone.

"You're not particularly surprised?"

Though this was the first time seeing it with his eyes, having felt the entirety from the realm of omnipotence, his emotions remained calm.

"I don't know. It's mysterious, but not particularly..."

"Whoosh."

When Minerva blew air into his ear, Shirone jumped back in surprise.

"What are you doing all of a sudden?"

"Well, your Karma was so low I thought your personality had disappeared. I wondered if you might be a psychopath."

Shirone shuddered as he brushed at his ear.

"How could that be? Besides, what does blowing air in someone's ear have to do with being a psychopath?"

"Really? I can't understand it."

The moment Shirone looked into Minerva's eyes, he felt his heart burning to ash.

'This is...'

There was no being in the world who could pressure Shirone, who had mastered the scale of the universe, with emotion alone.

'This isn't killing intent. This is slaughter.'

Just how many lives would one need to end with their own hands to convey such a feeling?

The pheromones of fear that creatures emit just before death clung to Minerva's body like an unwashable scent.

"Now you're finally looking at me."

She had tried countless times since the Corona Kingdom but couldn't make the being of super-sensation tense.

That's why this was her 100 percent.

If anyone other than Shirone had been in this place, they would have already died from shock.

"Why didn't you accept it?"

The smile disappeared from Shirone's face for the first time.

"I don't want to fight. You won't understand, but..."

When Miracle Minerva was at her peak terrorizing the world, her nickname was the Grim Reaper.

Also, though not officially recorded, she was the human who had committed the most murders in human history.

"Right. You'll never be able to understand me."

Witches have no personality, and therefore no taboos.

"For me, the best way to solve a problem is to eliminate the problem. If the conflict between Nane and Shirone is the problem, then killing both would end it. Or at least one of them."

It was a simple solution, but...

"But I couldn't do it. Even if there had been a 51 percent chance of killing you, I would have acted in Corona."

She assessed it wasn't even close to 51 percent.

"The stars have distinct personalities. While they don't want armed conflict, such things happen fairly often. Before going to Taeseong, there's one last thing I want to confirm."

Minerva's broom Sweeper trembled violently with a loud noise.

"Forgive me."

The aura of death rising from Minerva's body surged as if it would explode the elevator's interior.

'Death.'

She had never counted how many she had killed.

Calculated by population density per unit area, the number of humans she had killed was approximately 42 million.

The pheromones of 42 million people, which could only be collected from creatures facing death, struck Shirone directly.

Could he forgive?

He might vomit blood and collapse first, unable to accept the need to forgive.

"Yahweh."

Shirone embraced Minerva with warm light.

"We've arrived."

On the top floor of the ivory tower heading to the Great Earth Temple, the stars who had been chatting with Taeseong waited for the elevator.

As the elevator that had traversed dozens of floors in an instant slowly stopped before them, Tsui approached.

"Congratulations. I never thought you'd become a star."

Since she had thoroughly crushed Shirone's spirit in the Tormia Kingdom, she felt it was appropriate for her to give the welcome greeting.

"Urgh!"

The moment the elevator doors opened left and right, the color drained from Tsui's face.

As the scent of catastrophe leaked out of the elevator, groans escaped from the other stars as well.

"This is Black Death, isn't it?"

Though it was the black magic Fermi had cast during the graduation exam, this was on a completely different level of intensity.

'Who on earth could do such a thing?'

Looking into the elevator Ruber saw, Shirone and Minerva stood side by side.

"Ms. Minerva, when did you arrive?"

Minerva, who stepped out of the elevator first, had an unpleasant expression.

As she slowly looked around with cold eyes, no one could meet her gaze.

'This person called the Grim Reaper...'

Just smelling the scent emanating from her body brought waves of terror that made their knees weak.

"Wait a minute..."

Tsui, seeing Minerva for the first time, looked back at Shirone with a surprised expression.

'He rode the elevator alone with someone like that?'

Though Shirone's expression wasn't particularly good either, there was no trace of the fear she was feeling.

While the Brain's illusion watched expressionlessly, Dream Person Ruber slowly approached and asked.

"It's been a while, Ms. Minerva. But to use such murderous magic inside the ivory tower..."

"This settles it."

Minerva, cutting off Ruber's words, glanced back at Shirone standing behind her, then turned away.

"The Human Safety Enforcement Division will kill Nane."

Shirone had forgiven Minerva.

"Let's go, Brain."

Saint Brain, who could be called her direct subordinate, nodded and followed Minerva as she walked away.

"What kind of sudden..."

As Tsui muttered in bewilderment, Shirone approached with a smile.

"We meet again like this."

Through Taeseong's ability Gaia, they already knew that Shirone had reached the realm of infinity.

'But this is...'

It felt like turning your head for a moment only to find a newborn baby had suddenly become an adult.

"Are you really that same kid from back then?"

Even then, Shirone had been a promising prospect watched by the world, but he had fallen far short of Tsui's standards.

"My height was the same back then too, wasn't it?"

"Don't joke around! How did this happen? How could you reach such a realm but still not be able to stop Nane?"

This was also the reason Minerva had been puzzled.

"That's right."

Since only those who had directly faced Nane could know his strength, Shirone couldn't find a reason to explain.

"Welcome, Shirone. Do you remember me?"

At the sight of Dream Person Ruber, Shirone narrowed his eyes, but there was still no great emotional disturbance.

"You were a resident of the ivory tower."

"I work at the Integrated Space Management Department. There's no hierarchy among the stars, but a leader is necessary. It seems I'll be following your instructions from now on."

This was because Mahagaruta of the Integrated Space Management Department, who had been one of the Five Great Stars, had achieved enlightenment.

"Hello. I'm Twelve Mini."

Mini, who had been sitting on Borbor's head, stood up her small body and waved both hands.

"I'm 2-star level, and I specialize in Scale magic."

Though Mini's size alone revealed her realm, the person standing before them now had infinite scale.

To her, Shirone was someone who had reached the pinnacle of their specialty, so even though they were fellow stars, her eyes were full of personal interest.

"When Taeseong told me about it, my heart was pounding so much. If you could perhaps pass on some secrets to me..."

"Time is pressing right now."

When Ruber interrupted, Mini immediately closed her mouth.

"Within 48 hours, Nane will liberate all the altars. Before that, you need to receive the star title from Taeseong."

"If it's that urgent, wouldn't it be better to deal with Nane first?"

Despite this being the ivory tower where the world's greatest magicians gathered, and receiving a 5-star title at that, Shirone was indifferent.

As if he had expected this, Ruber smiled kindly.

"Of course, but filling the vacancy in the Five Great Stars is equally urgent. Taeseong will think so too. Follow me."

Since this was an Integrated Space Management Department event, residents from other departments dispersed immediately.

Walking alongside Ruber, Shirone looked down at sounds coming from the floor.

"Huff! Huff!"

Mini, who had jumped down from Borbor, was running at full speed following behind Shirone.

"Are you okay? You look tired."

"Oh, that's... if I release my scale, I become too big. Don't worry. I'm fast at running."

Shirone knelt on one knee and extended his palm.

"Get on here. Let's go together."

Though Ruber glared sharply, Mini couldn't suppress her burning desire.

"Then, excuse me."

As Mini settled on Shirone's palm and grinned, Ruber shook his head and walked on.

"But... I thought I could choose which department I wanted to work in."

According to Arte, whom he had met before, the ivory tower had five departments and people chose departments according to their own philosophies.

"Usually that's the case. But the Five Great Stars are an exception. It would be more accurate to say departments don't really have meaning."

Mini added.

"The Integrated Space Management Department is more like a command center among the ivory tower's departments. It coordinates opinions with Taeseong on matters brought in from the other four departments."

"Mahagaruta also worked closest to Taeseong. You don't necessarily have to do the same, but..."

Arriving at the top of the ivory tower, Ruber looked at Shirone and pointed upward.

"You should at least know how to get up there."

When Shirone looked up, all he could see was the bluish sky beyond the glass ceiling.

"Taeseong is somewhere up there?"

"A place that cannot be approached without Taeseong's permission. Only Mahagaruta had been granted arbitrary access. Now you must prove your qualifications."

Since it was space, not sky, even a magician couldn't fly there.

'I can go.'

But that wasn't the right answer either.

'Being able to enter arbitrarily means Taeseong doesn't need to open the door.'

Shirone, who had set Mini down on the floor, said.

"Then I'll go and come back."

Yahweh's light gathering in his hand meant all the world's information was in his palm.

"Open."

After the brief words, Shirone's body transformed into light and disappeared.

"Wow, this is..."

Mini's eyes widened, and Ruber also nodded as if understanding something.

"It's different from Buddha who wields righteousness. Rather, it's as if all things in the world willingly abandon truth for his sake."

That's why it's a miracle.

This universe loves Shirone so much that it would deny existing laws.

"...How is that possible?"

Ruber looked up at the sky.

"Because he gave everything first."

Great Earth Temple.

Arriving at Taeseong's sanctuary by transcending space, Shirone looked around with calm eyes.

A woman with a pristine appearance, as if holding stars in her eyes, came down the stairs with pure white clothes fluttering.

"You've come, Hexa."

Sadness filled Shirone's eyes.

"I'm sorry. For not being able to call you my child."

While all life born from stars would be Taeseong's children, Shirone was the exception.

"Is there any being in this world more pitiful than you? But think of this universe as your parent."

Taeseong's hand stroking Shirone's cheek was cold but didn't feel cold.

"So, how does it feel to become a god?"

Though it was probably a joke to lighten the mood, Shirone, who had experienced Andre's 19,000 worlds, couldn't smile.

"There's something I want to know."

A troubled expression crossed Taeseong's face.

"Am I a user?"

This was the truth beyond infinity.

"Or am I a ghost that exists only within the system?"
