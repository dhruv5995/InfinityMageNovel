Last Stand (5)

200,000.

That was the size of the human army Habitz had gathered while invading the central continent.

They had been incorporated through ideological education, but the effects of that education were minimal anyway.

'Just surviving is already a miracle...'

Being incorporated into hell's army on the verge of conquering the world was actually what they desired.

'If we win this war, we can gain tremendous wealth. No wait, we might even become kings.'

As humanity's numbers decreased, so did the competition.

'Everything that 6 billion people enjoyed will now be divided among us 200,000. By simple calculation, each person's share is...'

Roughly everything that a population of 3,000 had enjoyed.

'And that's just for a regular soldier.'

The face of the man who had been a unit commander and was now promoted to general flushed with excitement.

'My life is finally blooming.'

The reason humans don't want to go to hell is probably simply because there are no pleasures there.

'I did well joining hell's army.'

If there was money to be made, humans would even sell their souls.

When Iruki and Balkan engaged in their battle of wits, every situation was clear.

There were rules, and variables were controllable.

Between them, strategies were either perfect or lacking, and in any situation never exceeded those parameters.

But when you take your eyes off the board and look outside, this world is actually moved by countless probabilities.

Things could be good or bad, you could gain everything or lose everything.

'If it's just a matter of testing whose luck is better, I'll gladly accept that challenge.'

Iruki looked down at the map.

"The odds are fifty-fifty anyway."

His gaze fell upon the Tetra Mountains, which had remained in his mind for a very long time.

Deep in the Tetra Mountains.

A tall man dried and twisted like a skeleton, and a girl with black hair covering one eye were walking along a mountain path.

The man wore round sunglasses, had a horse-like long face with a slightly crooked nose.

The girl matched him in gloomy atmosphere, but had skin white as jade and a youthful appearance.

The man's nickname was Guitarman.

He was one of the famous Seven Sorcerers of the Black Line, and one of the world's 100 most dangerous individuals.

He was also considered one of the world's greatest mages in mental magic, alongside Sein.

He was called Guitarman because he possessed the D-grade object 〈Gitaru〉.

〈Gitaru〉, probably meaning guitar in some language, wasn't a particularly powerful combat object.

However, it was the ultimate equipment for a musician, capable of simultaneously playing the sounds of all instruments.

Silence, endless silence.

The two hadn't exchanged a single word for four years, but that silence had now become a language.

The girl suddenly stopped walking.

While Guitarman checked the time and sat down to chew on jerky, the girl entered the forest.

After casually surveying her surroundings, she pulled down her panties, squatted, and urinated.

Pssh.

When she finished her business and emerged from the forest, all of Guitarman's jerky had disappeared into his mouth.

"......"

The girl stared at him.

Then Guitarman spat what he was chewing into his palm and held it out to her.

A thoroughly mashed lump of jerky.

But the girl gladly took it and put it in her mouth, chewing it deliciously.

The two remained silent. When Guitarman picked up his guitar case and stood up, the girl followed behind him while chewing the jerky.

An endlessly stretched plain.

Coincidentally, the Valkyrie and hell's army were facing each other at a distance of 500 meters.

"Damn! To meet here of all places."

While the Valkyrie unit, which had received instructions to avoid combat if possible, found this troublesome, hell's army was eager to achieve merit as soon as possible.

"Running around like rats, and we finally get to see you. Boys, get ready to sweep them away."

Since the difference in military strength was a full four times, hell's army was full of confidence.

And at that moment, a man and girl entered the middle of the plain where the two forces were facing off.

"What's that?"

The Valkyrie commander shouted with wide eyes.

"Hey! Get out of there quickly! This is about to become a battlefield!"

They didn't even pretend to listen and continued walking, drawing mockery from hell's army.

"Hahaha! They came walking right into death! The woman's pretty decent looking, huh? Hey, if you want to live, come over here."

Even the world's greatest villain would instinctively catch someone falling off a cliff.

The Valkyrie commander, who had treated civilian deaths as trivial, found this situation strangely irritating.

"Hey, scare them off."

They were clearly people who had lost their minds in the war.

An expert marksman from the archer unit raised his bow to the sky and shot an arrow.

The arrow traced a parabola with a sharp whistling sound and landed precisely in front of the two people.

Guitarman and the girl's steps stopped. As if contemplating the meaning of the arrow, he fixed his gaze on it, then slowly sat down and opened his guitar case.

"What? That crazy bastard..."

Having finished tuning in the middle of the battlefield, Guitarman slowly stood up and plucked a string.

Jing.

Unlike a regular guitar, a thick, long sound filled with electricity resonated.

Title: First Night.

Lyrics and composition: Guitarman.

Though there was only one guitar, numerous tones were played simultaneously following a fast beat.

The girl began to sing.

*I was sold to the emperor*

For a woman, her voice was low, and her expression was like a cat that had eaten something bitter.

The Valkyrie and hell's army listened to her song in a daze for a moment.

*It's my first time but I'm not afraid*
*Because you are the king*
*It's fine to do with me as you please*

Guitarman added an extremely low chorus.

*Love me*

Simultaneously, soldiers from both armies who seemed randomly selected rolled back their eyes and died.

"Gaaah!"

The number of deaths was exactly 111, as if intentional.

*I wish what tears into my body*
*Were rather more massive*

As the girl turned her head left and danced like it was choreography, hundreds of thousands of troops mimicked her exact movements.

Even as horses reared up on their front legs in surprise, the soldiers' movements were identically controlled as if manipulated.

"Damn it! What is this! Snap out of it!"

Hell's army general shouted, but in reality, he too was dancing to the music.

'This is magic. It should be easily breakable with Schema. But why...'

Why can't I move even a fingertip?

'Could it be?'

A single person flashed through the general's mind.

"Damn it! All troops retreat! It's Guitarman!"

One of the Seven Sorcerers who had once been the world's troublemakers, the most mysterious figure among them.

Especially in crowd control techniques, he was said to be beyond world-class, with no one in history able to match him.

'Death Mark!'

It was the ability to artificially generate through sound waves the electrical brain signals humans have just before death.

The girl sang passionately.

*Morning will not come!*

"Haaaagh!"

An additional 8,888 people died.

*Love me*

The moment the chorus followed, a full 22,222 people collapsed, vomiting blood.

*Respect for the emperor's greed!*

As the girl raised her hand in salute, all soldiers placed their palms beside their eyebrows.

*Your child will not be happy*

As the girl turned her head to the right and moved while stomping in that position, soldiers kept getting trampled underfoot.

"These, these bastards...!"

The Valkyrie commander, stepping on the corpses of subordinates who were like his own limbs, gritted his teeth.

"You son of a bitch! What do you think human life is...! Gah!"

Exactly 40,000 people died, and the commander was no exception among them.

*I will drown you...*

The girl quietly finished the song.

*In my embrace*

When the 3 minute 48 second song ended, only two people remained standing on the plain.

248,247 deaths.

As the girl stood with her chin raised, Guitarman put his guitar back in its case.

And just like when they first arrived, maintaining silence, he crossed the plain with the girl.

Two hours later.

The supreme commanders of both humanity and the demon race received reports that their forces had been completely annihilated at almost the same time.

"No survivors?"

A terrified soldier reported with a trembling jaw.

"Yes. But the enemy forces are the same. It appears to be a third-world individual, and according to expert opinion..."

"According to what?"

The soldier looked up.

"There's the highest probability it was Guitarman."

Balkan blinked.

"Guitarman? Guitarman of the Seven Sorcerers?"

"Yes, that's..."

At that point, Balkan closed his ears and thought.

'He's come out into the world? No, it's more accurate to say we drew him out. Damn, to miss that.'

As hell's army swept the world, even his hiding place had disappeared.

"What should we do? Should we pursue him?"

Balkan had no answer.

'His combat power isn't at a concerning level. In personal combat, he's extremely vulnerable. That's probably why he was hiding.'

But his ability, Death Mark, couldn't be ignored.

"Never mind. No need to pursue him."

"Sir?"

"It was force majeure. Just think of it as being hit by a natural disaster like a typhoon, earthquake, or lightning strike."

When Balkan slammed the table, the soldier quickly closed his mouth that had been hanging open in bewilderment.

"Damn! What rotten luck."

No, was it really bad luck?

'I got too carried away. The fact that the Valkyrie commander didn't even respond to my handshake...'

At first, he thought it was because they couldn't respond.

"He's as crazy as I am."

The messenger entering the Valkyrie headquarters had an unusually flushed face.

"Report! At Gera Plain..."

Having exchanged 50,000 allied troops for 200,000 demon army troops could be called a victory report.

"Guitarman?"

While the commanders each shared their opinions, one turned to Iruki and asked.

"Did you know?"

"No."

It was a strategy possible precisely because he didn't know.

"If I had known, I would have prepared for it. I would have included it in the strategy. Of course, so would their commander. However..."

The reason he could guess what Balkan didn't know was actually because his forces were overwhelmingly weaker.

"To Balkan, even 10,000 soldiers aren't worth much attention, but to me, even 100 are precious. To overcome the asymmetry in military power, I must save every single person."

In the Tetra Mountains, losses of troops so minor they could be ignored frequently occurred.

"I thought there was something there. Of course, I couldn't be certain it would help us. It was a gamble."

"So, so you're saying you bet on a match without knowing which side this something would favor?"

"When plans proceeded normally, our probability of victory was less than 10 percent."

Iruki raised a finger.

"But if Balkan takes a gamble, the probability jumps to 50 percent. There's no way I couldn't take such a profitable deal."

If they had lost, everything would have been over.

"Only gods and numbers can bear responsibility for humanity. That's a famous quote from Servant Mage Veronique. I simply chose the side with higher odds."

Even so, it took tremendous nerve.

"But for Guitarman to appear... I'd say the world has really gone as far as it can go."

Iruki agreed.

"Probably non-standard. I'd guess he's extremely vulnerable in personal combat. It's likely a case where power amplifies as the number of individuals increases."

Even so, he was sufficiently powerful.

"Track Guitarman's movements secretly. A small elite force would be better."

"Yes, leave it to me."

"It's not time to relax yet. We also lost nearly 50,000 troops."

Iruki examined the map.

'But...'

Through the crack created by Balkan's mistake, countless strategies to buy time were born.

"One day."

Iruki raised his index finger.

"If the 2nd Corps can just hold them off for exactly one day."

An unprecedented bomb was being attached to humanity.
