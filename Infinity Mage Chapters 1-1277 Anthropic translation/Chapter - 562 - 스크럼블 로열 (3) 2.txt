[562] Scramble Royal (3)

"Women's... what?"

Amy asked back with a dumbfounded expression, but the boys who had already devoured the red books had nothing to say even if they had mouths.

"Ahem, anyway, I don't even know who the president of the Women's Anatomy Research Society is."

Amy recalled what she had heard in the dining hall.

"So that was the red book? Shirone, have you seen it too?"

"Huh? Uh, well... since the book exists. I have eyes too..."

It was a ridiculous excuse, but it wasn't a situation where lies would work.

Contrary to expectations, Amy didn't nag and instead turned her head away with a look of relief.

If she knew that the subjects drawn in the red book were people from the school, her reaction would probably be different, but it was a secret to take to the grave.

Having passed the crisis, Shirone asked.

"Still, there must be some candidates, right? Who do you think it might be?"

"Hmm, it's really difficult. It's so concealed that I can't even get a sense of it. But if I had to pick..."

Nade looked around the store counter.

"Surprisingly, it might be Eden, who's actually a woman."

"Ma'am, one carbonated drink please."

Shirone looked back at Eden, who had just entered the store.

Currently ranked 10th in the graduating class.

A devout believer of the Yore Order and a specialist in defensive magic.

'That's right, come to think of it, Mr. Gaold was once a Yore believer too.'

Since it was a religion that abhorred violence, it was natural for Eden to focus intensively on defensive magic, and the fact that he could still maintain his position in Class One despite this showed that his magical talent was tremendous.

"But why is Eden a candidate?"

"I heard this too, but Eden gets stronger the more he undresses."

Shirone ended up spitting the cocoa he had in his mouth back into the mug.

"What kind of ridiculous talk is that?"

"You know how it is, even if it's not an out-of-regulation method, special actions that strengthen omnipotence. Magical Actions are that kind of thing too. The Yore Order is pacifist, so they can't possess any weapons at all. In other words, because only God protects them, even clothing is unnecessary."

"Hmm, could it be true?"

Amy said.

"I know that story too. That's why during personal combat time last year's graduating class, some boys would light fire in their eyes and pour attacks on him."

The three asked in unison.

"So what happened?"

Amy looked at them as if they were pathetic and said.

"When pushed to crisis, he probably undressed up to his outer clothes. Of course, the durability of his defensive magic became even stronger."

Nade nodded.

"That's exactly it. According to sources, when Eden is completely naked, his omnipotence becomes so strong that even professional mages can't inflict a single wound."

Iruki said.

"If that's true, then he was unlucky. I mean the graduation exam last year."

Amy recalled that time.

"The first round ended instantly under Fermi's lead, and the second was a mental strength measurement, so magic wasn't particularly important. But that's the graduation exam. Since they randomly evaluate 2 out of 6 categories, you have to prepare for all evaluations. Understand? There's no time to worry about such things now."

Amy nagged while pointing at each of them, but no one was listening carefully.

"If that's the case, it's not strange for Eden to be a candidate. But the biggest characteristic of the Women's Anatomy Research Society is tremendous drawing skill, right?"

"Hmm, then Congo is also a possibility."

Nade pointed to Congo, ranked 6th in the graduating class.

Despite his huge build and orangutan-like face, he was making a shy smile while doing cat's cradle.

Befitting a steel mage who refines metal, even the string for cat's cradle was refined steel.

"He's feminine and has good manual dexterity. His appearance is a bit... but maybe that's why it suits him even more?"

Shirone shook his head.

"He has a unique personality, but he's still a good person, right?"

Congo was loyal and kind to everyone.

"I think if we're talking about being gloomy, Fiord is the best."

A student sitting in a mage's robe with a hood, breaking insect legs.

Perhaps because of this, the seats around him were completely empty.

A mage who dealt with poison, he was short and small in stature, and his face looked about sixteen years old, but that was just a side effect of drugs - his actual age was twenty-three.

Originally in Class One, he was currently ranked 11th due to his juniors' advancement.

Iruki added a vote to Shirone's judgment.

"He's the most wicked in personality. His balance isn't great, but he even took first place in a survey for the student you'd least want to meet in personal combat. If he really is the president of the Women's Anatomy Research Society, it'll be quite a difficult fight."

Nade grabbed his head and shook it.

"Argh, I don't know. If we think that way, everyone could be a candidate. Honestly, who doesn't like women's anatomy?"

Amy narrowed her eyes and said.

"Do whatever you want. I'm not going to worry about it anyway."

Iruki said.

"Anyway, we can assume these are our enemies. Plus, since they have even advanced class kids as members, they might attack during graduating class lessons. Like this morning. So Shirone, you have to defend."

Shirone had suddenly become the gatekeeper of Estas.

"Got it. I'll manage that somehow."

No matter who came attacking from the advanced class, Shirone judged he could adequately block them with his current abilities.

Amy, who checked the time, got up from her seat.

"Let's go. Oh, and Shirone, don't cast Shining Impact in Estas for a while. It might be dangerous."

"Yeah. I was thinking the same thing."

After all the students left to handle the graduating class afternoon schedule, only Shirone and the store owner remained alone in the store.

"Hmm, underground research societies."

The last drop of cocoa went down Shirone's throat.

That evening, at the Golden Wheel.

The executives were summoned to a hideout hidden in the northeastern mountain range of Alpheas Magic School.

Unusually, there was no banquet, and Fermi was lost in thought while drinking strong liquor in a cold atmosphere.

'Miro has returned.'

That meant there was nothing left to interfere with Fermi's plans.

'Perhaps this will be the last year at school.'

Finishing his thoughts, he raised his head and asked.

"Is everyone here now?"

"Yeah. Except for that guy."

The Golden Wheel had five executives including Fermi.

Those currently gathered were Hersy of Sonar, Electric Monster Lycan, and Richard of Alchemy.

"A sudden summons, what's going on?"

"Frings proposed a pact today."

"The Hide and Seek Research Society?"

Hersy, the strategist, added.

"He seems to have already proposed to other research societies. The presidents of Doll Collecting and Ant Language asked me about its authenticity."

"Then..."

As light flashed in the executives' eyes, Fermi smiled.

"That's right, it's Scramble Royal. The target is the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society. We'll drive them out and take over Estas ourselves."

"Keke, the long-awaited day has finally come."

As Richard of Alchemy raised the corners of his mouth, blue light entered both his pupils.

"In that sense, we should also send a representative. A representative to participate in Scramble Royal."

"I'll do it."

Lycan, the Golden Wheel's second-in-command and Electric Monster, raised his hand.

Currently ranked 2nd in the graduating class, he was a powerhouse that no one except Fermi could control.

"No, don't step forward this time. You and I have something else to do."

Lycan followed Fermi's opinion without suspicion.

"Then who are you planning to send?"

"Hersy will participate. Scramble Royal is just a preliminary battle to get close to Estas's secrets. Collecting as much information as possible is important."

In that sense, Hersy was the perfect candidate.

Though his graduating class rank had dropped to 13th, his information gathering skills were not inferior even to the Hide and Seek Research Society.

"So our side has Hersy, Hide and Seek will send Frings, Doll Collecting will send Anchal, and Ant Language will send Fisho. So four people will participate?"

"No, we're also having the Women's Anatomy Research Society participate."

"But that guy doesn't do activities."

"He will this time. Go tell him to participate."

Fermi was confident.

"If Shirone moves, that guy will have no choice but to step forward too."

Past midnight, Hersy, who arrived at the dormitory, stood in front of someone's door.

Tailing was impossible.

His sonic magic Sonar could collect even the sound of a heartbeat inside the body if he set his mind to it.

'No one can stop their heart.'

Just as Hersy was about to knock with a confident smile, a voice came from inside the door.

"Come in."

Opening the door and entering revealed a scene of madness.

Pictures were stuck all over the room, and the protagonist in those pictures was uniformly Maya.

"Your senses are still sharp, Cayden."

Current graduating class rank 7th, Cayden of the Cross Star.

An executive of the Golden Wheel and the leader of the underground organization Women's Anatomy Research Society.

"What's the matter?"

Hersy approached the table and watched the process of Cayden's work.

A line that moved without ever breaking was accurately depicting the real Maya.

"You know why I came, don't you?"

"I don't know."

"The underground research societies proposed Scramble Royal."

"Not interested."

"Also, Shirone is included on the opposing side."

The line that was drawing Maya's neckline suddenly went astray with a jerk.

"Do I... look like someone who would move based on petty jealousy?"

Hersy just smiled.

Befitting his honest personality and upright appearance, a cross-shaped longsword stood in one corner of the room.

Ironically, Cayden was originally a swordsman.

To be precise, a promising talent from the Cross family, the most famous swordsman family in the Kingdom of Tormia.

'Swordsmanship and magic. Definitely a monster.'

People from the Cross family, who received the energy of the Cross Star, were born with special talents through star readings from birth.

Among them, Cayden was a child born on the day of the Red Cross Star, which comes around once every 43 years, and could draw out 100 percent potential in any field.

It was a kind of pan-universal law, and he had already graduated from Kaizen Sword School as valedictorian at fourteen.

But perhaps the superstition that children of the Red Cross Star live unhappy lives was correct - Cayden actually had a field where his desire was stronger than swordsmanship.

It was art, and among that, drawing.

Of course, the law of the Red Cross granted Cayden the highest drawing skills.

But the problem was that art wasn't something that could be achieved by technique alone.

He could draw any object as he thought, but Cayden lacked something to elevate it to art.

"Magnificent. How about making the exposure a bit more daring?"

When Hersy pointed at the picture and spoke, Cayden furrowed his brow.

"Don't desecrate art."

If the power of art was to stimulate human emotions, then the female form was art in itself, regardless of gender.

For Cayden, who had no artistic expression ability, starting to draw semi-nudes might have been his only choice.

"So... you won't participate?"

Cayden silently stood up, vertically positioned his family's symbolic cross longsword, and looked at his own face reflected in the blade.

"...I'll do it."

'I knew it.'

No one could match Fermi in the ability to read and exploit human emotions.

He just needed time to rationalize himself - the fact that he used expressions like "petty jealousy" was already proof that he was jealous.

"Then everyone is gathered. The schedule will be announced later."

As Hersy left the room, Cayden looked at the huge poster-sized picture hanging on the wall.

He had abandoned his family and fled into hiding at Alpheas Magic School.

When he met a woman named Maya here, he realized why artistic sensibility hadn't been given to him.

The god of art had chosen Maya.

"Maya..."

Recalling the sacred thrill he felt when he first heard her song, Cayden prostrated himself before the picture.

"If I could be by your side, I would do anything."

It was a solitary knight's oath dedicated to the picture.
