[539] Such Problems (3)

Two women appeared on the ruined road.

They were Park Nyeo, 9th in the Ten Commandments hierarchy who had just arrived in the Apocalypse, and Shura, 7th in the Ten Commandments hierarchy.

Unlike Park Nyeo, who wore tattered rags that half-exposed her chest, was barefoot, and had her hair roughly tied with a turban, Shura was dressed neatly in a dark green dress and even wore shoes.

While Park Nyeo would seem more fitting for the Apocalypse, in reality it was Shura, the Apostle Panya, who was most suited to this world of lies.

"No one's alive. Where is Shirone?"

Park Nyeo's calm voice could be heard clearly even in the strong wind.

"Are you doubting my coder?"

"Because no one's alive."

Having said that, Park Nyeo suddenly stopped walking.

Shura, who had been looking at her strangely, heard the sound of flowing water from the ground and lowered her gaze.

Seeing urine flowing down between Park Nyeo's legs, her nose wrinkled in disgust.

"How smelly. Do you even wash yourself?"

"When it rains. Everything gets purified."

Shura's gaze turned toward the city Park Nyeo was pointing at.

As if measured with a ruler, rag-like dark clouds hung over the downtown area, and water was falling as if being squeezed from them.

Following nature's physiology was beautiful to observe from afar, but it was an ordeal when traveling alongside such a person.

"Anyway, Shirone is here. I don't need to code the language for you, right? There's no need for it anyway."

"Words convey nothing."

While this might be Park Nyeo's personal enlightenment, to Shura, whose disposition was the complete opposite, it was an insulting remark.

"Right. A beast's head could never understand. I have no idea how I ended up on the same team as you."

The vote on whether to include Shirone in the Ten Commandments had resulted in a 5-5 tie.

Those who voted in favor spoke of Shirone's powerful Avatar technique, while those who voted against focused on the fact that he was not an eternal being like Panya.

Nevertheless, the reason the Ten Commandments dispatched two executives was because they had received intelligence that Miro had moved to recover Shirone's information.

If the ancient mind Elysion could be recreated in the Apocalypse, it would be a considerable gain for the Ten Commandments, which is why Shura and Park Nyeo had been dispatched.

'Adrias Miro.'

Recalling her face, Shura said:

"Let me be clear - I was dispatched to contain Miro. If I have to fight her, even I wouldn't be able to handle anything else. So don't think about holding me back."

"But you can handle Miro?"

At Park Nyeo's casually thrown remark, a strange silence fell, and after a long while, Shura opened her mouth.

"That filthy monkey is getting uppity."

"......"

Though it was the same silence, the surrounding air rippled as if it might explode at any moment.

Park Nyeo's body spun rapidly, and the black afterimage of her sword flew through the landscape.

Shura raised her index finger in front of her neck and silently blocked the sword.

"I said no. Especially since this is my world."

"......Shall we see it through to the end?"

One of Shura's eyebrows twitched.

'Tch, I'm the idiot for talking to a beast.'

Asura Yaksha Park Nyeo.

Though she ranked 9th at the bottom of the hierarchy, once she caught fire, even the executives were reluctant to face her Axing.

"Forget it. Let's part ways here. Doing anything together with you would be truly insane. Handle things on your own."

As Shura released her aura and vanished in an instant, Park Nyeo walked toward the city as if nothing had happened.

"I'm hungry."

That was the only emotion she currently felt.

"Curia, please come to your senses!"

Malta's voice was loud enough to leak outside the engine room, but Curia looked at Malta as if she couldn't understand him.

"What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?"

"I'm not the one who's crazy! This is a false world! It's fake!"

"Humanity has perished! Just being able to live with you is enough! So please come to your senses!"

Malta, frustrated to the point of his chest exploding, exhaled roughly.

Why didn't she understand?

This place was merely a virtual world under the Under Coder.

At first, he thought if he told her the truth, she would understand.

He thought his wife would understand everything and return to her former self.

Of course, since she was a clever woman, it wasn't that she hadn't harbored suspicions.

But no matter what methods he employed, she couldn't accept the fact that this was a virtual world 100 percent.

"Malta, I love you. I don't need anything as long as I have you. So now......"

Curia embraced Malta's neck and kissed him.

His wife's scent, his wife's touch.

Malta, whose eyes closed without him realizing it, absorbed her information with his whole body.

'Information! Information! Damn information!'

Malta suddenly opened his eyes wide and pushed his wife down.

"You're not my wife! You're fake!"

"H-honey......"

Malta left the room and locked the door with a padlock to prevent Curia from coming out.

"Honey! Open it! Honey!"

Malta squeezed his eyes shut and turned away from her voice.

When he had first taken her out of the artificial hibernation device, he had discovered the possibility of restoring his wife, but as time passed, her information was becoming increasingly intertwined with the world of the Apocalypse.

'I need to isolate her. So she won't be exposed to any information.'

As always, when the knocking on the door stopped, Malta sat on the sofa.

The reason he no longer felt even guilt was because he 'knew' it wasn't real.

'Like a curse.'

He thought that perhaps he might be the one who had gone mad.

"Huh? No one's come back yet?"

The door opened and Marsha entered.

To finish their investigation as quickly as possible, the four of them had decided to search different areas.

"You're the first. Did you have any success?"

Marsha shook her head and went to the water dispenser.

"Nothing. I wonder if Ms. Miro found something?"

Malta stared intently at the nape of Marsha's neck as she drank water.

"I'm tired from walking around all day. I'll go rest in my room."

"Do that."

Even after Marsha entered her room, Malta didn't turn his gaze away, as if chasing her afterimage.

'She's real.'

A woman from the real world, like himself.

'Because this is a place without hope.'

Malta got up from his seat and opened the room door.

"......Did you know?"

Marsha was sitting on the bed, smoking a pipe.

Even while looking at Malta's lust-filled eyes, she didn't lose her smile as she exhaled smoke and said:

"I'm familiar with that kind of look."

Malta was calm.

"You know my situation. Can't you show mercy?"

"How about you try to endure it? I don't want to do bad things to my benefactor either."

That was a choice Malta's desire could not have.

"Then there's no choice."

As Malta's Spirit Zone pressed in through synesthesia, Marsha's smile slowly hardened.

'This person...... is definitely strong.'

Malta approached with large strides.

"Accept it. In reality, I was a mage who reached Public Grade 4. Except for that woman Miro, no one in our group could beat me."

That's why it was now.

"Hehe, aren't you underestimating me too much? Ms. Miro is impressive, but I was quite something back in my day too."

"Talking a lot is proof that you're nervous."

Marsha bit her pipe.

While the act of biting a pipe might evoke the act of sucking, she used that gap in reverse and threw the pipe.

'Now!'

She cast teleportation and flew to the door, but Malta was already blocking the entrance.

It would have been an impossible reaction without prior prediction.

"Not bad. But didn't you underestimate me too much?"

As Malta extended both hands, powerful Air Pressing struck Marsha.

Flying parallel to the ground, Marsha crashed into the wall and fell with another thud.

"Ugh!"

Malta looked down at the fallen Marsha and said:

"I'd prefer if you didn't resist. The person you're dealing with isn't some street thug."

'Not a street thug but doing this kind of thing?'

Marsha desperately swallowed the curses that wanted to come out.

She knew that once the fire of desire was lit in a man, no words would be of any use.

'If I've laid this much groundwork, it should be enough.'

Marsha, who sighed as if resigned, raised both hands and stood up.

"Fine. Let's end this nicely. I don't want to die either."

When Malta sent her a suspicious look, she turned around completely.

"What are you doing? Are you too scared to even try embracing me?"

Anger flickered in Malta's eyes, then he embraced Marsha from behind and kissed her nape.

"Don't be too rough."

Covering the tattoo carved on the back of her left hand with her right hand, Marsha activated the Unorthodox Formula Patricide Dagger.

The tattoo glowed, and a materialized black-bladed dagger was grasped in her right hand.

'I'll be a bit rough though.'

As Marsha quickly turned her body and swung the dagger, Malta calmly leaned back his upper body.

"I told you, I'm not a street thug."

Malta grabbed the wrist holding the dagger and pressed down on Marsha's nape with his other hand, pushing her toward the wall.

Sparks flew in Marsha's eyes as her head hit the wall.

Then, as he slammed her delicate wrist against the wall, the dagger that escaped her hand disappeared before it could touch the ground.

"I knew you were an Unorthodox Formula user. Also, being obsessed only with that means you're from the streets who couldn't even learn the 36 standard magic formulas. What happens if I get stabbed by that dagger?"

"Fine. I'll tell you. So please let me go."

"I don't really need to know. It would be fatal anyway. I'll cast sleep magic, so just get hit obediently. That would be better for you too."

Marsha gritted her teeth and scratched the tattoo on her right palm with her finger.

Another dagger materialized.

"Isn't talking a lot proof that you're nervous?"

The moment Malta's eyebrow twitched, she kicked his groin and drove the dagger into his nape with all her strength.

"Aaaaah!"

Startled, Malta grabbed Marsha's nape and threw her to the other side, and she gasped for breath as she hurriedly escaped the room.

"Damn! To be bitten by a rat!"

Malta, who first checked his wound, had his eyes shake with shock.

"What, what is this?"

Black gas was continuously spewing from the black sheath that had formed on his neck.

'It's not a physical ability.'

The dagger had disappeared and no blood was flowing, but the feeling of something continuously draining from his body was truly unpleasant.

Unorthodox Formula Patricide Dagger.

The mental model of the knife Marsha had used to kill her adoptive father, its core concept was to recognize the human body as a gas tank of desires, then create a sheath in it to drain everything out.

The amount of desire leaking from one sheath was 1 percent per minute, and arithmetically, if it lasted 100 minutes, any target would fall into a state of exhaustion - it was a powerful ability.

'Dangerous. To cancel the Unorthodox Formula, I need to find her first.'

Malta discovered that the smoke spewing from his neck was escaping the room and curving toward somewhere.

While it was an Unorthodox Formula that could exhaust even opponents of superior skill with just one stab, the gas of desire was inevitably directed toward Marsha, making it impossible not to expose her location.

'The price of the Unorthodox Formula. If it's this kind of concept, the only way to break it would be to find and kill her?'

Malta's mouth twisted wickedly.

If restraining his attack magic to have physical relations was a mistake, then it was a mistake, but from now on there was no reason to hesitate.

'Wait. I'll kill you in one second!'

Malta left the room and turned his head in the direction the smoke was flowing.

The smoke was flowing outside the engine room, and then he heard the sound of a door slamming shut.

'Using the darkness?'

In a tunnel without light, it would be much harder to find the black smoke.

Malta, who finally realized this, bared his teeth and cursed.

"That damn bitch!"
