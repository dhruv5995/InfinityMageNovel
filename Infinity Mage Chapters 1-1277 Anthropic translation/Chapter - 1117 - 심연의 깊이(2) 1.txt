Depths of the Abyss (2)

Gaold was dreaming.

Flying rapidly over an endless sea, he was clearly in an agonizing state.

His hair had turned white, and bloody tears flowed from eyes that showed only whites.

'Air Press!'

A pitch-black monster, two thousand times larger than a deep-sea whale, writhed while letting out a terrible roar.

The Demon God Leviathan.

It was the strongest, most evil creature existing in the second layer of Ymir's psyche.

KRAAAANG!

As a roar alone created a tsunami hundreds of meters high, Sein grimaced.

'Sun-Moon Halo.'

Two halos interlocked like gears, seemingly reducing the sound gradually, but...

KRAAAANG!

When another roar erupted, they couldn't withstand it and shattered completely.

"Damn it..."

As the suppressing force disappeared, Leviathan writhed like an untethered colt.

Each time it struck the sea, shockwaves erupted, and the group's figures were obscured by the pouring water.

"Hiyaaa!"

Following Miro's battle cry, an avatar of the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara appeared, cutting through the water's curtain.

Tens of thousands of palm strikes, sized to overwhelm the demon god, extended and struck its torso.

KIEEE!

How long had it been since they heard the monster's scream?

'It's wrong. It has no effect.'

But that was all - Leviathan rose again without a single wound.

Shirone gasped for breath.

'How long have we been fighting?'

They had ventured too deep and vast a place to estimate real-world time.

However, calculating by the number of exchanges with Leviathan...

'It seems like six months have passed.'

The total power was enough to devastate a real planet, but Leviathan wouldn't break.

'Because it's in a dream.'

But even so, Shirone's group had also reached beings at the limits of mental strength.

"Is this Ymir?"

They couldn't shock his psyche.

The biggest problem was that no attack could frustrate Leviathan.

Luffer flew over.

"Five Great Stars, our stamina is depleted. No, I should say mental strength. If we drag this out longer here, we have no chance of victory."

Six months with the demon god was probably the maximum power they could fight without rest.

"...I understand."

His resolve was swift.

'Whether it works or not, I have to try. If I fail this time, it's truly over.'

The only method was...

'Abilities from the outside world.'

After Luffer's object 'Zhuangzi's Butterfly' activated, Shirone's thinking changed.

'God's perspective.'

The enlightenment he had currently reached was a realm that the real-world Shirone hadn't yet attained.

'I need power that surpasses infinity.'

Yahweh's mind is infinite, but why isn't even that power infinite?

Because the world is closed.

'Cause and effect are merely logic created by time. If I set time's direction to negative...'

Effect becomes cause, and cause becomes effect again.

"Infinity circulates as infinity."

It is infinite nothingness.

As Shirone's Hand of God spread its palm wide, light particles compressed.

"Graaah!"

As cause and effect bit each other's tails and circulated, changes occurred in Shirone's body.

Luffer's eyes widened.

"That's..."

Like thread unwinding from a spool, Shirone's physical form began to decompose.

'More, more!'

The more cause and effect circulated, the more grotesque the unraveling form became, and finally his waist twisted like a pretzel.

"Aaaaah!"

"Five Great Stars! You mustn't!"

The moment Luffer shouted, black lines began wrapping around the Hand of God's light.

Above the extraordinary law where light and darkness coexisted simultaneously...

"Uh..."

The Photon Cannon born with a tremendous roar had a grotesquely mottled coloration.

Like ink splattered on a sphere of light, the distorted colors were mysteries from the outside world.

'A world where cause and effect are reversed.'

Luffer's expression hardened, then his gaze toward Shirone turned cold.

"The outside world is..."

Shirone flew toward Leviathan's tail as it headed for Kang Nan and Arius.

"Hiyaaaaa!"

The moment he swung his arm, a massive flash of light shot out and buried itself in Leviathan's flank.

"Kraa..."

Another scream erupted, but this time the sound waves were sucked into Leviathan.

From the flank sunken hundreds of meters deep, the black-and-white Photon Cannon spun wildly.

As Leviathan's massive maw opened wide, everyone made disgusted expressions.

"You damn..."

Before Gaold could finish speaking, the demon god's roar burst forth with its entire life force.

GRAAAAAAANG!

Each time the massive body writhed, the world shook, and cracks appeared in the pitch-black skin.

'It's going to explode.'

The light seeping from within the cracks was abnormal enough for anyone to feel that way.

"It worked!"

Arius shouted.

"We've delivered the concept of shock to Leviathan! Finally, the first layer where Ymir is...!"

Before he could finish speaking, the entire world was dyed in white light.

"Glug! Glug!"

Arius suddenly flailed about, drinking seawater rushing into his mouth.

'Are we falling?'

No, the sea was rising.

The explosion's radiance filling the sky also gradually shrank as water rose.

'It's okay. Now we go to Ymir.'

How long had they waited?

"Urk! Urk!"

In darkness where not a ray of light entered, Arius flailed his limbs.

'When will we arrive?'

They were sinking endlessly.

Water pressure - more precisely, Ymir's psyche was crushing them.

"Gargle..."

As air escaped from his lungs, Arius's gaping jaw grew cold and stiff.

Meanwhile, Luffer searched for Shirone.

'He's over there.'

While Yahweh could withstand Ymir's psyche, Shirone wasn't moving.

'Did it affect him after all?'

Through the process of thought reversal and repeated reversals, it was hard to imagine what state his mind was in.

'He'll die like this.'

Looking at Shirone sinking into darkness, Luffer's eyes lit up with determination.

'Dream barrier.'

It was forbidden among the forbidden, but it was an unavoidable decision to save Shirone.

As Luffer's body dissolved into the water, the sea's color began changing to deep purple.

'Please be safe!'

As his consciousness rapidly faded, Gaold searched for Miro.

'Where is she?'

Even without knowing dream theory, his body felt what state they were currently in.

"Gargle gargle!"

Human bodies can't hold oxygen indefinitely, but this was the dream world.

However, physical values converted to mental ones were destroying Gaold's psyche.

'I won't give up. Miro...'

At that moment, he felt Miro approaching him from the depths of the abyss.

"Gargle! Gargle gargle!"

Finally reaching Miro, cold hands embraced Gaold's neck.

A hallucination-like voice rang in his ears.

"Gaold."

Awakening from sleep, Gaold blinked while reviewing his recent dream.

Sunlight entered through the window, and though dusty, it was a cozy smell.

"Honey, wake up."

Slowly turning his gaze, Kang Nan was walking to the kitchen with food in a basket.

"Ah."

That's right.

'Kang Nan was my wife.'

Then... who was the woman who embraced and whispered to him in the dream?

"That dream again?"

Kang Nan asked while preparing vegetables.

"Yeah."

Kang Nan's voice was hoarse because she too had the same dream every day.

It was always like this.

Waking from dreams, taking walks with her, eating meals, sharing a bed.

'When I fall asleep again.'

The scenes of those hellish battles would approach as reality.

"Phew."

Gaold exhaled deeply.

'It's just a nightmare.'

Yes, a nightmare.

The self-reinforcing mutation that tormented him so much in dreams wasn't here.

'It doesn't hurt.'

That alone was reason enough to live in this world, Gaold thought, but...

"What... happened to us?"

He had to ask.

"There you go again."

"I don't know what's real. Don't you sometimes find it strange? This place. If this really is reality..."

"Stop it already!"

Kang Nan shouted.

"It's just a dream! I don't care who you love in dreams! But this is too much!"

The reason for their confusion was not knowing the cause.

How they came to live here, why they fell in love, what caused the nightmares.

"I'm sorry."

Gaold got out of bed and embraced Kang Nan.

"I was too sensitive. Yes, it's just a dream. Now that I'm awake, we should start a pleasant day."

"...Eat."

Kang Nan pouted and handed him soup, which Gaold took to the table.

'It's not strange.'

Having no cause - that's natural, isn't it?

'But it is strange.'

The feeling of missing something.

'Time.'

Though he'd lived in this house long, it felt like he'd lived here from today, and though he had nightmares daily, it somehow felt like this might be the first time.

"Let's go out."

His wife's food was delicious, providing comfort he could never experience in dreams.

Gaold put down his utensils.

"Let's get some fresh air. Do some shopping for once."

Had he ever earned money?

"Yes, sounds good."

Kang Nan smiled, knowing the lukewarm, uncomfortable feeling would be the same, and Gaold treasured that.

Going outside, people in refugee clothing passed between high-rise buildings exposing their steel frames.

Whoosh. Whoosh.

Wave sounds came from somewhere, but no one here knew their source.

"Come, buy here! Cheap!"

The market had stalls spread out, and most people's faces were familiar.

Gaold felt relieved.

"How much?"

Kang Nan showed interest in a necklace with wolf teeth strung on leather cord.

"200 pieces, but I'll give it for 150. Very good item."

"Honey, I want this one."

Then a large dog came running from across the market.

"Woof! Woof!"

"Arius! Wait!"

Gaold turned to see a dog with bandages over both eyes running toward them.

"Oh no..."

As Gaold pushed Kang Nan aside and blocked, the dog struck his abdomen directly.

"Damn! What the hell?"

Crushed under the dog's weight and grimacing, a wet tongue licked his chin.

"Arius! Are you okay?"

At a woman's voice, the dog turned, and Gaold angrily stood up.

"Kid! If you let a dog loose in a place like this... Huh?"

Gaold stopped speaking.

A young girl, perhaps eight years old, was hugging the dog's neck.

It was an ordinary scene you could see anywhere, but Gaold's heart raced.

"Miro?"

"Huh? How do you know my name, mister?"

Confused, Gaold looked back and forth between Kang Nan and Miro, lost in thought.

'That's definitely the name of the woman who appears in my dreams. But... she's just a child?'

Kang Nan must be feeling it too.

"Little girl."

Just as she was about to ask something with a serious expression, a tall man approached.

"What's the matter?"

Gaold realized his appearance was exactly like the man called Sein in his dreams.

"Ah, the dog came running..."

Sein assessed the chaotic scene and bowed his head.

"My daughter seems to have made a mistake. Arius can't see. He doesn't usually get excited like this."

"Woof! Woof!"

No sooner had he finished speaking than Arius began barking at Gaold.

"Geez! Why are you acting like this today?"

"Grrr! Grrr!"

Arius bit Miro's sleeve with his teeth and repeatedly turned his head, pulling.

"You really...! Huh?"

Frowning, Miro saw tears flowing from under Arius's bandages.

"Grrr! Grrr!"

As if they absolutely had to go to that man, pulling his owner with all his might...

"Arius..."

Finally sensing something, she slowly turned and looked up at Gaold.

"Who are you, mister?"

"Little girl."

Gaold asked.

"Have you... ever had strange dreams?"
