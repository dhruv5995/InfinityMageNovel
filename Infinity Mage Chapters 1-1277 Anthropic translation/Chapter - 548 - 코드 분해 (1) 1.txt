[548] Code Decomposition (1)

"Sirone!"

Rian raised his great sword with the sun at his back.

Without inflicting a shock equivalent to death, or perhaps even greater, on the mind, there was no way to restore Sirone's memories.

'Sirone, this is...'

Rian gritted his teeth and swung his great sword with all his might.

'My greatest single strike!'

As he swung the great sword at tremendous speed, black cracks were carved along the trajectory that flashed like lightning.

As the law was denied by Rian's Denai, the defensive barrier surrounding the pyramid peeled away like grape skin.

'How annoying, Denai.'

Shura muttered with a frown.

He didn't have the luxury to look back, but the terrifying power of will contained in the great sword was transmitted clearly through the code.

"......"

Sirone was simply watching calmly.

Even Armand's robe, which should have reacted as keenly as nerves, showed no defensive movement whatsoever.

As expected, when the great sword came to a complete stop right before him, Sirone spoke to Rian, who was clearly displaying his frustrated emotions.

"Rian, you cannot awaken me."

"Kugh!"

Watching Rian's hands tremble uncontrollably as they gripped the great sword, Sirone turned his gaze toward the path Rian had taken.

"Even though you came here cutting down hundreds of people..."

Sirone's eyes turned back to Rian.

"I don't feel even a trace of hostility from your sword."

As if acknowledging Sirone's words, the trembling disappeared from Rian's arms.

"Yes, you're right."

He couldn't kill him.

The Sirone that Rian knew was not such a weak human that his mind would awaken merely in the face of death.

"Rian, how much of this is true? What... what exactly are you to me?"

"I am your sword."

Rian swallowed the bitter groan that was escaping.

"My flesh, my blood, my bones! They are all yours!"

As Rian's voice became a hand of truth that gripped Sirone's heart, a single piece of information began to surge toward his mind from very distant memories.

'But... if what Rian says is true, if all of this is false. Then what am I?'

Shura shouted.

"What are you doing! Kill him quickly!"

As Baknya's sword flew toward his neck, Rian's eyes widened as he hastily twisted his great sword to block it.

"Hup!"

As Rian's body was sent flying by the tremendous power capable of destroying Denai, Baknya kicked off the stairs and leaped up.

'Truly mysterious.'

To her, Rian was an anomalous existence even within 10,000 years of time.

'What kind of law is this?'

A Yaksha's Axing distorts laws, but whether the body can withstand it is another matter entirely.

Therefore, usually the stronger the distortion becomes, the more grotesquely twisted the laws acting on the physical body become.

This was why there were no normal humans among the executives of the Ten Lords Council.

'It's not Schema.'

In contrast, Rian's Axing showed no consideration for the physical body whatsoever.

Perhaps transcendent regeneration was indeed his Axing, but even if he were a Death Knight, it was impossible to crawl back from the realm of death to the realm of life once fallen.

'Shall I confirm it?'

Baknya's body began spinning fiercely in mid-air as she exploded her Nirvana Power.

The laws mounted on the virtual inline 8-cylinder were implemented in sequence, and a terrifying 8-hit combo came crashing down as if to split Rian's body apart.

"Rian! Kugh!"

Just as Sirone tried to run toward Rian, a vast amount of information penetrated his mind.

Digital Ra, connected to Sirone through Mucus, was attempting the consciousness of Ilhwa.

Human, become one with me.

"Not yet, not yet!"

As long as the bruise of truth that Rian had carved directly into his heart was throbbing, he could not leave this world.

You and I will change the world.

"Uaaaah!"

As Digital Ra and Sirone's brains connected, the memories of the two entities began merging into one.

'Thousand-Armed Thunder Clap.'

As Thousand-Armed's palm flew toward the pyramid, Shura blocked the front and activated the law of defense.

Gestalt of Condensation.

Ten Commandments of Denial.

A giant inverted cross was born in front of Shura and blocked Thousand-Armed's palm.

"This is really driving me crazy. Let's settle this outside."

Miro ground her teeth.

For an open human to handle the laws of a confined world was similar to being able to freely create something with toy blocks.

If the pyramid in reality was the unique number 1 in terms of laws, then the pyramid here was number 2, corresponding to 'the pyramid designated by Shura.'

The boundaries of laws were disconnected like blocks, and the limits of the world were clear.

This meant that Shura's laws were executed as clearly as real-world magic.

"Let's see this through to the end."

Miro, who had been glaring at the defense-focused Shura, expanded her scale even further.

"Eek! Eek!"

Meanwhile, Marsha, who was struggling with the slime, looked back at Fermi and shouted as escape proved difficult.

"Do something! We're really going to end up finished at this rate!"

Fermi, who was captured like her, clicked his tongue while checking Sirone's condition.

'Tch, can't be helped.'

Though it wasn't sufficient yet, he could no longer delay.

'Ice Magic. Hyper Intercooler.'

As the Archmage's magic, purchased for a whopping 100 million gold, activated, cold mist rose around Fermi.

Mucus froze with crackling sounds, and instantly the ground sparkled like Arctic land.

Marsha prepared to escape while observing the Mucus freezing from below.

At the same time, the giant avatar of Thousand-Armed fell from the sky and crushed a quarter of the pyramid.

Kururururung!

As the pyramid collapsed with its law barrier gone, Shura stuck out his snake tongue and muttered venomously.

"Detestable humans...!"

Even in his own territory, deflecting Thousand-Armed's attack was all he could manage.

But it wasn't as if Miro had lived for 10,000 years either.

For a human no different from a mayfly to manipulate such enormous concepts was incomprehensible to Shura, an immortal being.

"Keuuugh!"

Sirone, disconnected from Digital Ra, couldn't withstand the pyramid's shaking and collapsed forward.

"Lord Archon!"

Just as Yo, who had been watching from the ground, tried to climb the pyramid, a series of strange sensations penetrated from behind.

"Huk!"

Turning around, he saw Marsha standing there, having repeatedly stabbed him with the Patricide Dagger.

"...What did you do to my body?"

Yo asked as he confirmed the smoke of desire escaping, but Marsha wasn't one to answer.

"Die."

Just as Yo extended his hand to shatter the fragments of the Silver Mirror, the surroundings were plunged into darkness.

"What?"

Fermi grabbed Marsha's hand and cast teleportation.

'Dark Magic, Curtain.'

As Marsha emerged from the darkness and turned her head, she saw shadows drawn from the pyramid's direction imprisoning Yo in a spherical form.

"Let's coordinate our attacks from now on."

Since they had destroyed Shura's barrier, there was no longer any need to divide their attention.

While Fermi disrupted the colony's guardians with various magic, Marsha stabbed with the Patricide Dagger as opportunities arose.

The smoke of desire revealed their positions nakedly, but Fermi's skill in blocking the guardians' approach with curtain magic and crowd control techniques was remarkable.

'They said he was Sirone's rival. This guy is certainly extraordinary too.'

The Depreciation Deal didn't exhibit unique abilities like other Regulations, but it had the advantage of completely ignoring attribute affinity.

Being able to simultaneously use light and darkness, water and fire—natural opposites—meant being able to respond to all variables that arose.

In terms of mission execution capability alone, it would be hard to find a professional mage of this caliber.

"We need to eliminate them as quickly as possible. There's no time."

As Fermi said, Mucus was discarding the frozen areas and moving new slime toward Sirone.

"Sirone!"

Rian launched himself toward the pyramid again, but now the barrier called Baknya, too much even for him, blocked his path.

'Nirvana Power!'

The endlessly accelerating cycle of laws granted abnormal activity to Baknya's body.

The pattern was simple, but as the RPM increased, both speed and power were rising.

Kwaaaaang!

As Baknya's sword struck Rian's sword head-on, a shock that twisted every bone in his body was transmitted.

"Keuuuugh!"

Two Yakshas glared at each other with beast-like distorted expressions.

Then, as Rian's regenerated left arm gripped the great sword's handle, Baknya's face turned pale.

The moment her monstrous senses intuited the massive wave of power about to unfold, Rian fed it Denai and swung his sword.

"Iyaaaah!"

Mach rushes in.

Before the wave of law that nothing could block, Baknya broke her cycle and twisted her body.

Bang! The moment the great sword struck the ground, Baknya exhaled roughly as she saw Rian's arm muscles burst.

"Haa. Haa."

The weight of a single strike that Rian wielded was truly the weight of the world.

She still didn't think she would lose, but honestly, she didn't know how she could win either.

"Move aside. I need to get to Sirone..."

Rian's steps forward came to an abrupt halt as he raised his head.

Baknya, her face distorted like a wolf, was laughing while showing the whites of her eyes.

"Will you... go all the way?"

For the first time, Rian took a step back.

"Really with me..."

Baknya's pupils returned to their place, but they were no longer those of a normal human.

"Will you go all the way?"

Axing.

Nirvana E.

Engine.

Bang! The ground shattered and Baknya's form disappeared.

What was mounted on the 8 cylinders was only acceleration, and her body spread like afterimages as if torn apart.

Rian reflexively raised his great sword.

Simultaneously, dozens of cuts appeared on all the parts he couldn't defend, and blood burst forth.

"Keuuugh!"

It was speed that should have actually torn his body apart.

But the Schema trained for 10,000 years reliably supported Baknya's body.

"Not yet, not yet."

Between Baknya's muttering voice, laughter leaked out as if she had two vocal cords.

The reason she had never experienced the limits of speed until now was because every enemy had died before that point.

'But you're different.'

Rian was different.

This man who neither avoided nor fled would surely respond even if she poured out everything she had.

"Damn it!"

All Rian could do was defend his neck with his sword.

Without even giving him time to regenerate, flesh was being torn away, making his body feel as if it were burning.

'Am I going to fail to protect my lord again?'

Rian's gaze collided with Sirone atop the pyramid.

"Rian..."

Sirone looked at Rian, who was gushing blood, with a dazed expression.

Information that had started from very distant memories crashed into his mind, and a powerful emotion surged that was strong enough to crush all the memories he had experienced here as trivial.

I am Ogent Rian.

His name was Ogent Rian.

Let's be friends. How about it?

The moment he grasped the hand extended to him, everything in life changed.

I am Sirone's sword!

He had always protected him from behind.

"Rian. How... how could I forget you."

As the information recovery rate reached 99 percent, hot tears flowed down Sirone's cheeks.

"Riaaaaan!"

Even in the strong wind created by Baknya's movements, Rian heard Sirone's voice clearly.

'Yes, it doesn't matter how much I break.'

Rian gripped the great sword's handle as if to crush it, and at the peak of acceleration, Baknya burst into a cry of ecstasy.

The moment she felt certain she could kill from anywhere, pale sword strikes revealed afterimages like vicious drills and poured down on Rian.

Rian clenched his jaw as if his teeth would shatter.

'My flesh, my blood, my bones!'

And he swung both arms with all his might.

'They are all yours!'

Buaaaang!

An iron-colored sphere enveloped Rian's body.

As the consecutive strikes of the pale sword hit the iron wall, the iron sphere flickered as if burning, and soon Baknya's afterimage bounced outward.

"This is...?"

He had fed Denai to both arms and swung his great sword to momentarily defend in all directions.

"Keuuugh!"

Rian's arms gripping the great sword had all their muscles blown away, leaving only bare bones.

"I'm coming! Sirone!"

Rian, gripping the sword's handle with the power of law, kicked off the ground and shot forward.

Puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-pung!

Rian's form disappeared, and the ground on both sides of Baknya exploded in sequence as he charged forward.

'He's moving back and forth too fast to be seen.'

Left or right?

As she moved her eyes left and right, she seemed to realize something, fixed her gaze, and trembled.

'I can't tell.'

In a situation where even her monstrous senses remained silent, goosebumps rose all over Baknya's body.
