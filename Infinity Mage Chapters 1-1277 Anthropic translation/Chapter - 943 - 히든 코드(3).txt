Hidden Code (3)

Shirone rapidly absorbed the records of Guffin speaking to the flower for 40,000 years.

As Omega's end drew near, he grew anxious, but there was no faster way to build omniscience.

'It's the entire history of the universe.'

His interest lay with Guffin, but the actual data flowing in was every event that had occurred throughout the entire world.

Even logs like the 3,241st rabbit on a remote planet mating with the 8,790th rabbit to give birth to the 17,653rd rabbit were all being transmitted.

"I've decided."

From where Shirone's consciousness was focused, Guffin's voice was conveyed through the 11th sense.

His appearance was unchanged from when he first arrived, and the flower that had become his sanctuary hadn't withered either.

"I must leave."

'So suddenly? Where are you planning to go?'

Guffin stroked the flower.

"Thank you for all this time, for listening to my long, tedious stories. I'm also sorry..."

'You mean the stories about humans. Humans are fascinating. Truly amazing. Actually... I want to become human too.'

"I lost my wife and child."

Guffin looked up at the sky.

"I wondered what meaning there was in becoming a god. Even if I live forever, if I lose someone again... I might not be able to bear it then."

'You've suffered greatly. I know.'

"It would have been better if there had been nothing from the beginning. If this world itself had never existed..."

For a moment, emptiness filled Guffin's eyes.

But the void was brief, and soon he looked down at the flower with eyes full of affection.

"Still, I'm going to try going out into the world."

'Why?'

Guffin couldn't hear the flower's voice, but coincidentally, it became an answer.

"Because it continues. Endlessly, it must continue."

Guffin rose from the flower and leaped across the wide lake in a single bound, landing on solid ground.

"I think I've told you too many stories. That means it was that painful."

Though he couldn't communicate with the flower, he didn't think a plant that had endured 40,000 years would remain unchanged.

"If you're hearing my words now, and if you understand them, it means a heart has taken root in you."

After a moment of thought, Guffin added:

"It means you're connected to the outside."

'Outside?'

Guffin smiled bitterly.

"Actually, I'm not sure. Perhaps this world should just close its doors."

A world filled with countless sufferings.

"But if it still wants to continue..."

In gratitude for maintaining 40,000 years of friendship, Guffin bowed his head.

"Please help humanity."

Humanity.

Beings who could lean toward either good or evil, emptiness or love.

The flower pondered.

And the moment Guffin turned and walked away, golden smoke rose from the petals, taking human form.

A girl emanating fresh floral fragrance slowly bowed her head in Guffin's manner.

'Farewell.'

Thus, leaving behind the birth of the Hwajok, Guffin calmly walked through the remote forest.

'How much time has passed?'

He hadn't counted the days precisely, but he estimated roughly 40,000 years had gone by.

An immense span of time for humans.

But for Guffin, who had lived through eons, it was merely like a human timing their lunch.

"40,000 years. Has it changed a little?"

When he first came to this planet, there had been primitive tribes, but they probably wouldn't have lasted long anyway.

A species' survival depends on the superiority of their systems, and building systems that respond to countless variables requires a corresponding price.

The price of failure's experience.

'Perhaps humanity has disappeared.'

Unimaginable monsters might be ruling the world, or perhaps no one was left at all.

'Then I'd be alone again.'

Despite his despairing thoughts, Guffin's steps quickened as he discovered an exit.

'Don't get your hopes up. You might end up crying from false excitement.'

As he tried to calm his heart and climbed to the end of the forest's uphill path, the world that spread before Guffin's eyes was...

"Haha...!"

Brilliant golden light reflecting off the sun.

'Of course.'

Centered around a towering castle, human civilization stretched to the horizon's edge.

At 9 o'clock of Delusion, the group that had escaped from the ability to make imagination reality stared intently at Quan.

'Could he have cut through space itself?'

They'd never heard of swordsmanship that could do such a thing.

'Nemesis.'

Sein looked at the ring on his middle finger.

'Did he cut through the delusion with his own imagination?'

If so, it was natural that everyone wearing Nemesis had been freed from the hidden code.

'This much I can understand, but... how was it possible?'

The delusion Sein had experienced wasn't at a level he could endure, even with his Cheolryunan.

'Quan has feelings for Shiina. Though not as much as before, he still has feelings for Armin too...'

Sein turned his gaze.

As expected, Armin was biting his lips with an utterly sorrowful expression.

'The most regrettable event of his life.'

What could it have been?

'Was it the moment he lost both eyes? Or was it not confessing his feelings to Shiina first?'

Armin muttered in a small voice:

"...I'm sorry."

With that, Sein thought it was likely the latter.

No, perhaps the two events weren't unrelated.

If he hadn't lost his sight in childhood, he wouldn't have had to leave Shiina.

So the meaning of his apology was:

'...That he found happiness in that delusion.'

Who could blame him?

'Only Quan has that right.'

But when he turned his gaze, Quan wasn't in a state to hear Armin's quiet words.

"Huff! Huff!"

Quan wasn't weak enough to be gasping from swinging his sword once.

'What kind of delusion was it?'

The Shiok's code that interfered with the unconscious would have led Quan to his happiest event.

'Probably an uninjured body. And meeting with the woman he loves most...'

Sein stopped his thoughts.

'I see.'

He realized why only Quan could escape from 9 o'clock of Delusion.

'A happy reality is actually misfortune for him.'

Such a contradiction.

Quan had destroyed his body to protect Shiina.

Because he loved her that much, from Quan's perspective, Shiina shouldn't love someone like him.

"You bastard."

Quan slowly stood up and glared at 9 o'clock of Delusion.

"You shouldn't have touched her."

The contradiction where the happiest ending for Quan becomes a terrible tragedy for Shiina.

Having experienced the worst ending where she smiled happily with him, Quan's eyes were like those of a ghost.

9 o'clock of Delusion, who had been unpleasant due to the broken code, relaxed his expression and smiled.

"Haha! Her? I don't even know who she is. All delusions are created by you, not me."

Even Shiok couldn't read the waves of the heart.

'That's why Satan covets that woman's ability.'

God's frequency.

"Don't think you'll die peacefully."

Quan activated Asymmetric Pole and disappeared from everyone's perception, but 4 o'clock of Sloth could also create specific conditions for things he didn't want to experience.

The situation repeated where Quan's storm-like cuts continuously grazed past the Shiok.

"You rat bastards...!"

Then a gaunt girl with dark circles spewed curses at Quan.

"Disgusting bastard! Be unhappy for life!"

It was 10 o'clock of Revenge.

'What's the hidden code?'

Unpleasant things happen.

Spit from one of the Shiok moved strangely and hit Quan's eye as he moved.

"Ugh!"

'So she makes things unhappy no matter what. This is certainly a cheat, but just spit means...'

The process of misfortune follows natural law.

'It's not particularly threatening. But when trapped in delusion, the other hours supported the 9th hour.'

Hidden codes could be combined.

'2 o'clock of Insubordination wins in all types of probability. If combined with this...'

Terrible misfortune could strike.

"Lilia! Support Quan!"

Though she didn't answer, Lilia was already supporting with all her might.

'No good. I've hit the upper limit of natural law.'

Without exceeding what she'd already experienced, she couldn't counter 4 o'clock of Sloth's cheat.

A pot-bellied man with kind smiling eyes shouted:

"Hehe! It's over now!"

11 o'clock of Climax.

"Let me make a proposal. Leave just one person and I'll guarantee the others' lives."

What they wanted was Mayray.

"However."

11 o'clock of Climax flicked his tongue.

"The one who stays will have to play with me."

Sein waited for the heart's wave.

'Hidden code.'

There are no limits to pursuing desire.

Whether sleeping or not sleeping, eating three thousand cattle without getting full, or being immersed in sexual pleasure for life without depleting stamina.

'What the hell are these things...'

Though he had no intention of accepting the Shiok's deal, hearing the hidden code made his hair stand on end.

Mayray transmitted the final wave.

'12 o'clock of Emptiness.'

A middle-aged man with deep wrinkles and stubbornly closed mouth.

'What's the hidden code?'

Resets all phenomena created by Shiok.

'It's not liberation.'

After tormenting endlessly until bored, reset and enjoy from the beginning again.

'...Now I understand.'

Having grasped all the Shiok's hidden codes, Sein was certain.

'Time 0.666 seconds that doesn't exist in natural law. The absurd phenomenon where the event itself disappears...'

All twelve cheats combined to be implemented.

'Knowing doesn't change anything, but...'

One thing was certain.

'Havitz.'

Where Sein turned his gaze, Havitz was sniffling with unfocused pupils.

"Want to cut fingers. Want to eat intestines. Want to hear screams. Want to lick eyeballs."

'So that's what it was.'

Disgust filled Sein's eyes.

'Twelve kinds of cheats. Someone living in the world with such authority, that brain, that mind...'

Could never be normal.

Havitz said:

"Shall we try once? Fingers first."

As Havitz activated Banishing, the battle finally reached its climax.

While Sein, Armin, and Mayray responded to Havitz's ability, Eden spread a defensive barrier.

'We must endure.'

As Lilia amplified natural law, Quan moved in extraordinary patterns.

5 o'clock of Prejudice shouted:

"Don't trust that swordsman! He's a lewd pervert who steals women's underwear! He probably stole yours too!"

Eden shook her head.

"Don't talk nonsense! Quan isn't that kind of person!"

3 o'clock of Obstinacy countered:

"Look at that guy's face! And look at his body condition! The conclusion is, that guy is a pervert!"

Though Lilia desperately held on, her mind was already filled with enormous suspicion.

'So that's why my underwear back then...'

Mayray gave up pursuing Havitz and transmitted Quan's heart to everyone.

"Ugh!"

When the truth was revealed, the group's faces reddened, but they had no leisure to dwell on it.

'No good. This won't work.'

Though Quan's anger was on the verge of exploding, his head grew colder.

'I can't break through the Shiok with my movements.'

He could still grasp Havitz's actions through God's frequency, but there was a serious drawback.

'If Havitz explodes with evil intentions again...'

Eden wouldn't be able to hold on.

If the barrier disappeared, the rest would just be Shiok's sacrifices.

Ultimately, Havitz would achieve what he wanted.

Mayray knew.

"Quan, a specific section of the wave is being strengthened. How about retreating for now?"

"No. I'll do it. Don't take your ears off Havitz. One chance..."

At that moment, intense evil settled in Havitz's heart as his irritation peaked from being blocked by Eden's barrier.

"Kyaaaah!"

A scream automatically burst from Eden's throat as the Absolute Barrier disappeared.

'Now!'

Quan moved.

Though Havitz's heart was truly terrible, since it was hatred toward Eden, it was at a bearable level.

'I'll kill him!'

As Quan's body rapidly charged toward the back of Havitz, who raised his sword toward Eden.

"It won't work!"

The moment 4 o'clock of Sloth activated the hidden code, Quan raised his left sword.

'Transcend.'

And the instant he aimed the blade at himself, he deeply stabbed his right eye.

Clown Pierrot

Super Tilt.

With Quan at the center, one side of the world rose greatly, and the Shiok and Havitz's perception was swept along the downhill slope.

'We missed.'

The Shiok's hearts sank.

The moment they saw Havitz's face, still unknowing as he swung his sword at Eden:

"Satan!"

The Shiok screamed until their throats seemed to tear.

All natural laws were swept away by the massive tilt, and from behind the evilly smiling Havitz...

"Die."

Quan's sword drew a horizon of flash.

"Ah..."

Dozens of gazes shaken by shock followed Havitz's head as it separated from his body and shot into the air.
