Depression (2)

'Damn bastard.'

Fierce light blazed from the two eyes beneath Fried's cross-shaped helmet.

Just because time had been rewound didn't mean the events that had occurred were erased from his mind.

But as expected of one of the Five Stars.

Suppressing his shame and analyzing the recent incident, there had definitely been something strange about it.

Meanwhile, the Stars and Satellites of the Ivory Tower looked back and forth between Fried and Shirone in speechless silence.

'Fried was hit.'

Though it was an event from a non-existent timeline, no one present was foolish enough not to understand the breaking of time.

'But was he really hit?'

The incident had rewound to the original timeline at the moment Fried allowed the attack to land.

Given that Fried's durability as both a mage and swordsman was far superior to the other Stars, questions remained.

And only Fried, who had directly received Shirone's attack, would know the answer to those questions.

'Something's strange.'

The first thing that came to Fried's mind was a sense of wrongness.

'Breaking time. I understand pulling the future into the past by vibrating the timeline, but...'

The trajectory of the Photon Cannon, all the variables when Shirone's teleportation reached right next to him.

'Why couldn't I dodge it?'

Even if it was a surprise attack, it wasn't to the degree that someone who had reached humanity's peak in both sword and magic couldn't avoid it.

'It wasn't just once.'

It felt like another time within time had vibrated.

'The event of me being hit by his attack was just one among countless events that existed.'

Just how many times had the same sequence been repeated?

'There's no need to think about unknowable things.'

What he had realized about Shirone was that he could perform calculations about future possibilities in an instant.

'A mage who searches for the route to reach the most perfect conclusion, delivering strikes that absolutely cannot be avoided.'

That was exactly what Shirone was.

'But he shoots magic, moves, and shoots again. What other variables could possibly come into play?'

The scope of change would be so extremely minute that an ordinary mage wouldn't be able to detect it.

But rather, that very subtlety made Fried feel a sense of wrongness like motion sickness.

'Surprise attacks don't matter. What's annoying is...'

Fried had never been bested by anyone in either sword or magic.

'Could there have been such a thing - a microscopic crack that could penetrate the gaps in my mastery?'

Breaking time was a secondary issue; what bothered him was Shirone's thinking that had found a way to launch a surprise attack against him.

"Interesting."

Fried grinned wickedly, emanating a sinister aura.

"This is unexpected. I never would have thought that one of the Five Stars of the Integrated Universe Management Department would strike first."

The Five Stars who had traditionally guarded the Great Star usually sat quietly like enlightened beings.

"What are you talking about?"

Shirone asked back brazenly.

"I didn't do anything."

"Kekeke."

Veins bulged at Fried's temples.

'So that's how you're going to play it.'

He had no intention of following Shirone's philosophy from the beginning, but this exchange had made it certain.

'No matter what thoughts you have, you'll absolutely never be able to carry them through.'

The atmosphere in the Great Star Hall grew tense.

The killing intent as the Stars and Satellites from each department glared at each other made even the air ripple.

Despite the Great Star watching right in front of them, the name "Great Assembly" carried that much weight.

'Shirone.'

The Great Star looked at Shirone with unfocused eyes.

Breaking time pressed upon her in a different sense than Gaold's breaking that directly struck planets.

'His mind is confused.'

From what she could sense, the number of times Shirone had vibrated time to successfully ambush Fried was approximately 40,000.

The reason he had rewound time was probably to account for Fried's counterattack after the successful strike.

'Fried isn't someone who would go down easily either.'

While taking control of the situation was typical of Shirone, his methods had been quite violent this time, unlike usual.

Minerva observed Shirone.

'No, that judgment is correct. The group that will most persistently interfere with us in this Great Assembly is the System Inspection Department. But...'

Fried wouldn't be broken by this much.

"The Integrated Universe Management Department will speak."

Shirone stood up from his seat.

"If demons were born from human evil, then now more than ever is the time we should eliminate that evil. I request the cooperation of each department of the Ivory Tower to fight against the demons."

"Why should we fight demons?" Fried said with his arms crossed.

"The strong devouring the weak is the principle of all things. If they're strong, we might as well give it to them - this world and all."

Strength entered Shirone's eyes.

"If demons conquer the world, all human nations will perish. Is that the outcome the System Inspection Department wants?"

Fried remained composed.

"You're mistaken. We're not lackeys of royalty. The current world is simply led by a national system. If demons introduce a different system, we'll just manage that instead."

He meant that as long as the system was maintained, it didn't matter who became the ruler of this world.

"Let me convey the System Inspection Department's opinion to the Great Star. We don't move for the benefit of specific nations. When demons are also viewed as a newly born nation, the current situation is just war. The kind of common war that has always existed and will never disappear."

Minerva bit her lip.

'They've really come prepared.'

Fried was annoying, but the System Inspection Department held considerable weight among the five departments.

"Mr. Fried's words do have merit."

Shirone nodded obediently.

"From a systemic perspective, there's no particular reason this world must belong to humans. But there's just one thing I don't understand that I'd like to ask about."

"Kekeke, ask away. I'll explain it in detail to our little rookie."

Shirone looked directly at Fried and said:

"You said you'd manage the demons' system, but I don't think your department has that kind of capability."

Different kinds of killing intent blazed in the eyes of the eight Stars in the System Inspection Department.

"This insolent little..."

Fried's face contorted.

"Just because you have one trick others can't do doesn't mean you can act up. There are plenty of ways to kill the likes of you."

Shirone responded calmly.

"Really? Like what?"

Fried's mouth remained closed for a long while, and after a moment, his shoulders shook roughly.

"Kekeke. Kekekeke."

The moment his body vanished from sight and the ground where he'd been sitting caved in a semicircle.

"Oh, shit...!"

The Great Star Hall shook with a thud as Fried appeared before Shirone's eyes with his sword drawn.

'Damn it! This again!'

Seeing Shirone's afterimage as he twisted his body into a counterattack stance made him feel nauseous again.

'Time has already vibrated, I have to assume.'

Though it was the second time he'd experienced it, it was an indescribably filthy feeling.

'But will he be able to find an opening this time too?'

Unlike the previous ambush, he was confident there were no gaps in his battle-ready stance.

'Go ahead and rewind as much as you want.'

After all, the only thing that would be determined was Shirone's head falling.

'If I win this time, it's 1-1. But...'

Fried's sword swung at maximum speed flowing at the limits of the law.

'My one victory means your death!'

At that moment, a wheel spun rapidly at the midpoint where sword and magic collided.

'World Wheel? Damn it!'

It wasn't strong in itself.

But no strength was needed for the task of circulating external forces to maintain absolute balance.

KWAAAAANG!

As power rotated around the World Wheel, Shirone and Fried were knocked back in opposite directions.

"Kugh!"

Where the two were glaring, Amanta stood with the World Wheel spinning between his palms.

"Stop it. This is a meaningless fight."

Fried gnashed his teeth.

"Meaningless? You heard that rookie mock me, didn't you?"

"Both of you are wrong." Amanta looked back at the Great Star and said:

"Shirone with his human-centrism, Fried with his system-centrism. The fact that we've already failed to prevent today's situation shows this is a failure. Please allow me to use the World Wheel even now."

The Great Star asked:

"To what degree can you balance things?"

"At the cost of eliminating 80 percent of humanity, I can reduce the demons' numbers to below 30 percent."

Minerva protested.

"80 percent of humanity is a joke?"

"It didn't have to be this extreme. If you had listened when I suggested turning the World Wheel, humanity would have only paid a sacrifice of 30 percent."

Shirone countered.

"30 percent is also a large number."

"Yes. But that 30 percent is already gone from this world. They're all dead."

"Do you understand what I'm saying? I tolerated your idealism and self-righteousness once, even if not willingly. But as a result, we paid an even greater sacrifice. Face reality."

"I would like to offer a word."

A voice as sharp and cold as a sword rang out from the outermost edge of the Great Star Hall.

It was Ting, one of the Five Stars of the Law Department.

Her black hair was tied tightly above her head, and her pale face was fierce but beautiful.

"Wait a minute. I haven't finished speaking yet..."

Just as Fried was about to step forward, Ting's right hand moved gently to the side.

'What, what?'

Shirone's eyes widened.

As if they had become insects, everyone except Ting felt as small as dust on the floor.

'Incredible law manipulation.'

Minerva gritted her teeth.

'Ting of the Law Department. If Fried is annoying, that woman is truly strong.'

Ting opened her mouth.

"There is no such thing as a standard in law. When I become stronger, others become weaker. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to reveal my thoughts, which have no standard."

The Great Star asked:

"What are your thoughts?"

"...I too question whether humans have value worthy of such respect."

While Fried's lips curled up, wrinkles deepened between Shirone's brows.

Minerva sighed.

'It's natural, Shirone. Every person gathered here has reached humanity's peak mastery.'

The Five Stars, those who had received the title of Star.

'Their common point is... they've all been hurt by countless humans.'

'Actually, you know too, don't you, how terrible humans can be. That's why you're going crazy.'

The fact that it didn't feel like fighting together was the cause of the depression the Five Stars suffered from.

"There is no humanity in this world. There are only humans, humans, humans."

According to Ting's philosophy, humans were beings who had fallen alone into a place someone else had created.

"Honestly, I don't know. I find it hard to believe that multiple humans live in this world. Only I am human, and all of you are probably illusions."

Everything except me is a doll.

Even if applied to everyone in the world, no human could prove a contradiction in Ting's words.

"Therefore, I am the only human existing in this universe. I fight to cultivate a world that is mine alone. I don't particularly want to care about the suffering that illusions experience."

Shirone looked disgusted.

'What kind of life must she have lived to have such thoughts?'

But that very philosophy was the driving force that allowed Ting to manipulate laws so extremely.

"So I tried to accommodate the will of the illusion called Fried that someone had created, but..."

Still towering, Ting looked down at Shirone standing on the vast floor and smiled with her eyes.

"The illusion called Shirone is also quite unique."

'What the hell is this?'

He couldn't analyze this woman called Ting.
