[622] Scout Reporting (3)

"What is that?"

Elizabeth answered Baikal's question.

"It's the Ultima System. According to the report..."

"I know what it is. The problem is how there can be multiple focal points of concentration."

Because it was the Ultima System.

It was something beyond comprehension that they simply had to accept, but from a scout's perspective who had to analyze everything, it was a perplexing situation.

"He modified the system to maximize impact force. Only number 27 could pull off something like that."

'I did it. I did it.'

Having annihilated the enemies within the time limit, Shirone collapsed to his knees with a thud.

'I need to recover my mental state.'

Just as he thought that, a shocking announcement voice was heard.

Entering Survival Ordeal Stage 6.

"What?"

Not only Shirone but all the participants who had let their guard down widened their eyes and looked around.

"Hehe, it won't be that easy."

Where the voice came from, Fermi stood gripping a werewolf by the throat.

Grrrrr...

If even one survives, it's considered annihilation failure, and you immediately advance to the next stage.

Crack!

The werewolf's neck was cleanly severed by Fermi's Air Cut.

"Fermi..."

Shirone gritted his teeth and stood up.

Was this how it felt to discover that an oasis in the desert was actually a mirage?

"Good judgment."

Baikal was pleased with Fermi's strategy.

"He understands the Survival Ordeal system well. A strategy to weaken Shirone's power while still making use of his combat ability."

"Cold personality."

Baikal's gaze pierced Elizabeth before returning.

"That's what makes a mage. If Shirone were an enemy mage, who in the Kingdom of Tormia wouldn't applaud Fermi?"

The moment he finished speaking, a magical spectacle incomparably more powerful than anything before unfolded in the colosseum.

"Finally, Tier 5 demons."

Stage 6 was the section where statistically 90 percent of cases resulted in the final selection of 15 people.

Graaaah!

As two hundred golems reaching 3 meters in height rose from underground, their vision was completely blocked.

Lamias from the Middle East writhed their serpentine lower bodies, and dragon soldiers equipped with weapons turned their eerie skulls.

Kieeee!

As griffins with eagle faces and lion bodies folded their wings and swooped down to the ground, Maria pushed Mark aside.

"Get away, Mark!"

The claws on the griffin's talons grazed Mark's back as they passed.

Maria's healing magic followed, but Mark's mental state had already hit rock bottom.

'This is... impossible.'

Watching the participants fighting in a battlefield swarming with monsters didn't feel real.

'How can they still hold on?'

If Shirone hadn't cleared out enemies with multiple Photon Cannons, they wouldn't have been able to reach Stage 6.

"Mark, let's stop now. We'll really die at this rate."

The sync rate of 2000 times was 100 percent.

Though the physical impact from creatures was converted to mental shock, in real combat they would already be dead.

"It's not over yet. No one has been eliminated!"

While passing had been their goal, even just gaining confidence in their abilities would be half a success.

'There can't be this much of a difference! I also worked desperately to get here!'

Feeling that giving up now would mean being unable to do anything in the future, Mark concentrated with all his might.

"Earth Pillar!"

A thick pillar struck the golem, but the massive body weighing over a ton instead broke through the pillar and approached.

"Graaaah!"

As the golems raised both arms to strike down, Mark twisted his waist while protecting Maria.

"Ugh!"

At that moment, the flash of teleportation descended before them and Shirone cast Photon Cannon.

The golem's body trembled, then exploded outward, decomposing into dirt as if ground by a crusher.

"Senior?"

Maria hurriedly greeted him.

"Thank you."

"For what?"

Shirone didn't look back at them.

"What? Well, for helping us..."

"I didn't help you. I saved you."

If Mark had stubbornly persisted until the last moment, both of them would have already lost their lives.

"Get out. Just give up."

Mark's eyes blazed as he shouted.

"I can't do that! At least one competitor..."

"Get out!"

Mark's shoulder flinched.

"There's no second chance. If you want to die, do it yourself. But don't drag others down."

"Senior..."

Mark watched Shirone disappear into the battlefield, then hung his head dejectedly.

'I'm sorry.'

It was the heart of a senior who couldn't bear to watch a cherished junior die.

Clang clang clang clang clang!

Dragon soldiers clashed their iron-hard jaws and charged with antique-looking swords raised.

"Mark."

At Maria's words, Mark nodded, and both simultaneously spoke the keyword for battlefield withdrawal.

"Atra."

The sight of dragon soldiers bringing down their swords instantly disappeared.

"Numbers 29 and 30 have withdrawn from the battlefield."

"Natural outcome. Inexperienced, and their skills are too immature to be considered graduation class."

Baikal hadn't been evaluating them from the start.

"Still, the final evaluation must be written in the report. Shall we make the grade F?"

"Below standard."

Baikal wouldn't budge.

"Write that."

"Yes, yes."

Lara sighed and scribbled with her pen.

With 2 participants eliminated, the 10 minutes of Survival Ordeal Stage 6 were almost over.

Even so, more than half the creatures remained alive, and the participants' faces showed clear signs of being overwhelmed.

Entering Survival Ordeal Stage 7.

When the 2000 times system's voice was heard, everyone's focus inevitably wavered.

"28 survivors. I've never seen this many enter Stage 7."

In alliance vs. hostility, when most participants choose hostility, the selection of 15 naturally becomes faster.

But occasionally when they band together and focus entirely on mission completion, advancing to Stage 7 often occurred.

"Anyway, it'll end here."

The Tier 4 lineup consisted of creatures called kings of their species - beings positioned at the very top of continent-wide food chains.

Roaaaaar!

As Basilisk, the desert king, let out a roar, the spectators' faces turned pale.

12 meters long and weighing 40 tons, its thick tail was powerful enough to annihilate an entire human squad in one strike.

Uooooo!

The forest king Ogre inflated its 4-meter frame and roared, while in the sky, the giant monster bird Wyvern covered the sky with leather wings and breathed fire down on the colosseum.

"This is... hell."

The sight of 87 Tier 4 creatures mixed with hundreds of monsters that survived Stage 6 was a scene that could never be seen in the mortal world.

"Tch! That Shirone bastard, what the hell is he thinking?"

As the wyvern's flames swept the ground in a charge, Canis raised Shadow Wall in defense.

"Kekeke! Humans have created something interesting."

Muttering thus, Harvest pulled out a dragon soldier's skull and transmitted his voice through mental channel.

What are you going to do? Now's the chance if you want to make your mark.

I'm not sure yet. Let me watch Shirone.

Dark magic's specialty is defense, so holding out isn't bad either. It looks like 15 will be selected here anyway.

"Canis! Are you okay?"

The golems blocking Canis's path crumbled flat with a thud.

As Canis withdrew Shadow Wall, three ogres standing tall entered his view.

"Arin?"

Arin ran through between the ogres' legs.

"I caught the ones with simpler minds. This should last 3 minutes."

Her judgment was also defensive.

"Ho? Mind control?"

Baikal's eyes lit up with interest.

"Her mental activity levels are beyond human range. Controlling three Tier 4 ogres is remarkable."

The sight of three ogres protecting Arin's surroundings, frantically destroying enemies, was visible.

"Tremendous mental fluidity."

"Personal opinion, but I'd like the kingdom to recruit her. She's talent I don't want to lose to other nations."

"A."

If everyone were as clear-cut as Arin, there would be no conflicts of opinion between scouts.

'In contrast to that...'

Baikal's gaze followed Shirone.

Though still fighting with high numbers, he no longer showed the intense magical acceleration from before.

"Is this pathetic display what you wanted?"

Shirone's face was pale as if drained of blood, and his eyes were gradually losing focus.

'I need rest...'

These weren't creatures he could defeat with scattered concentration, and his power diminished as time passed.

'If I could just... rest a little...'

Photon Cannon still extended roughly outward, but the enemies' encirclement was actually tightening.

"Iruki, Shirone looks very tired."

Nade flew over to Iruki.

"...So?"

"Let's help him. We need to let him rest a bit."

Though the fact that they were a team remained unchanged, Iruki's thoughts differed from Nade's.

"It's Shirone's decision. We don't need to intervene until he asks for help."

"But at this rate he'll really be eliminated!"

"Even so, it can't be helped. If you have the mental capacity to worry about others, how about taking care of yourself first?"

Watching Iruki teleport away, Nade ground his teeth.

'Damn it! This guy and that guy...'

Friends who had been laughing and chatting just yesterday felt colder than strangers in the graduation exam.

"Hah, hah."

The Photon Cannon that had been dazzling Shirone's eyes cut off abruptly like a dried-up faucet.

Unable to respond even while watching the basilisk approach, pushing through golems, Nade flew over.

"Shirone! Rest a bit! I'll protect you!"

Shirone's eyebrows twitched.

"Nade, get away..."

"You can't be eliminated like this! You pushed too hard from the start. Recover here and then..."

"I said get away!"

Nade looked back with a startled expression.

"Nade, I'm going to become a mage. No one can stop my dream. So get away."

'This is bad. He's not in his right mind.'

Shirone's eyes were lifeless.

Having poured out magic with maximum concentration for nearly an hour, it was natural.

"If you don't get away... I'll have no choice but to fight you. If you want to defeat me and become the best, come at me."

For a moment, Nade's face showed tears.

"...Hang in there, Shirone."

Only after Nade teleported away did words continue from Shirone's mouth.

"After this ends... let's eat together."

Baikal analyzed the situation.

"That number 21 is a complete mess."

"West Nade. His skills don't seem lacking, but his behavior patterns are strange. He doesn't step forward when it's safe, but makes good judgments when it's truly dangerous."

"That's what you call a complete mess. F grade. Number 27 is the same. He seems to have reached his limit."

"Magical power levels are maintained consistently, but they're no longer rising. Efficiency has dropped extremely low - the power of photon magic isn't even half of what it was initially."

"Disappointing. I had some expectations when Flu actively recommended him."

Shirone cast Photon Cannon again toward the monsters draped like a curtain.

'Now it really begins!'

As he drew a massive halo through time division, Ataraxia's information began accumulating.

"There it is. Archangel's magical amplification entry."

"Hmm, instead of stopping acceleration, he was operating surplus mental power elsewhere."

At the rare praise, Elizabeth chimed in.

"It's improvisation in a situation with no recovery time. Then the decreased efficiency of Photon Cannon makes sense too."

"Even so, nothing will change. If he passes Stage 7, there's Stage 8. He's not even considering the second exam."

"It's Ataraxia! Everyone get away!"

The participants who discovered Shirone's magic circle predicted the direction of the flash rush and evacuated.

"Tch, so he's really doing it?"

From advanced class to graduation class, they already knew Ataraxia's power.

"A last desperate struggle?"

Fermi, already at a safe distance, watched Shirone's finale with an eye-smile.

'You did well, Shirone.'

His strategy of using Shirone to raise the stages and distinguish himself in higher stages had worked perfectly.

"I absolutely won't stop."

Toward Ataraxia's brilliant multicolored light, Shirone kicked off the ground and charged with wide-open eyes.

"What?"

While not only participants but even scouts watched in bewilderment, only a hooded woman clenched her fist.

"Go, Shirone."

A technique that even Archangel Ikael never attempted due to the extremely dangerous shockwave that would follow.

It was Ataraxia Close Combat.
