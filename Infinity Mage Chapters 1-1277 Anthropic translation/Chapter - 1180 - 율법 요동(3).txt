Law Fluctuation (3)

Shirone's group arrived at the sun.

Though the distance was still great, they could approach no further due to the attacks of solar flares and corona.

Ashur spoke.

"Nothing can withstand solar energy. Only mental bodies can remain unharmed."

The cosmic sailing ship swayed in the solar wind.

"Ikael-nim will be fine, and Amy can handle the Idea of Fire, so she'll be okay too. However, Shirone-nim..." Everyone turned to look at Shirone.

"The systems will clash. Of course, half the world is quantum, but the sun we must endure now is the concept with the strongest power in terms of law."

Amy said.

"Will you be okay? If it seems like you can't handle it, there's also the option of just Ikael-san and me going. With simultaneous events, if one thing goes wrong, everything becomes dangerous."

Shirone looked at the sun.

'Can I do it?'

Even with light transmission reduced to near zero levels, everything visible outside the window was pure white light.

"I'm fine. I'll do my best to endure."

"Then I'll eliminate the sailing ship now. The moment it disappears, you'll be exposed to tremendous energy."

The group swallowed nervously.

"Please... stay safe."

As the cosmic sailing ship broke apart into panels and disappeared, the sun covered them at the speed of light.

"Huk...!"

Amy's body burned and even Ikael found it difficult to maintain his existence.

Before the sun's massive signal, no concept could be enforced.

Shirone gritted his teeth.

'It's still just law.'

Miracle Stream began wrapping around his body and pushing back the solar energy.

The space Shirone managed to secure was merely a sphere with a diameter of 7 meters at most.

"Phew."

Amy, transformed into the Idea of Fire, and Ikael, whose body had melted, turned around.

"You did it."

Though it was only a 7-meter radius in the entire universe, Ikael trembled at the fact that a human could endure it.

Another solar wind struck.

"It must be Satiel. The law of this world changes from the sun's core."

Amy asked.

"Even if something changes in the core, wouldn't it take time to reach the surface?"

"Time isn't important. When something happens, the result is already decided. Thinking that we experience cause and effect in order is human delusion."

Shirone added.

"The moment the cause changes, the result has already changed. That's why Omega's record is in thousandths. You can't calculate percentages without the end being determined. The ancient Gaians, no, Ankera knew the ending."

Amy felt bitter.

"It's Omega year 999 now, right?"

"Yeah. Probably close to 100 percent - 99.9 percent. We're right before entering the outside world."

There wasn't much left.

"So that's how it ends. Human life, this universe too, the moment we open the outside world..."

"It's just law's judgment."

Shirone said.

"It's nothing more than program calculations. What determines this world is ultimately humans."

Though God wouldn't acknowledge it.

Ikael also believed in the heart through Guffin, but as God's creation, conflict arose.

'Human hearts might also be programs. No one can know yet.'

Until going to the outside world.

'Anyway, humanity has finally come this far. Truly to the threshold of the outside world.'

Yahweh's appearance.

Even looking through an infinite number of multiverses, it would be an extremely rare event.

Shirone glared at the sun.

'The universe had to spend truly much time to get here. But if we look at this place from the outside world, where imaginary time flows...'

All these events are just momentary errors. Therefore, God has just discovered Shirone's journey of billions of years.

'Yahweh and such, he'll just think of it as an error. One of the countless worlds he's eliminated so far.'

Is that really so?

Mclaine Guffin, the only signal sent from outside the photon system by a god with a heart.

'Hexa.'

He will enforce humans, the heart.

Through Elikia's light, the Holy See realized that Havitz had killed Smodo.

That meant a one-hour grace period.

Meanwhile, officials from various countries confirmed whether Paras's King Kitra was dead.

Under the notarization of the International Court's Mito Shirano, the Paras side opened the coffin.

"Please check directly."

Kitra lay with his eyes peacefully closed, and a venomous snake coiled around his neck flicked its tongue.

"Wh-what's this snake?"

"It was an animal the king cherished in life. According to national law, we plan to bury it with him."

They had no intention of interfering with another country's customs, but the problem was they couldn't touch the corpse.

'Is he really dead?'

At least from what they could see, his face was pale and there was no sign of his lungs moving.

Shirano approached.

"I'll check. I have to notarize anyway."

Without a moment's hesitation, she reached out her hand, and the venomous snake bit her hand with its fangs.

"Hiiik!"

The officials stepped back, but Shirano pressed the carotid artery without any change in expression.

'His heart isn't beating.'

The snake bit her hand several times.

Kiik! Kiik!

True to her nickname as the Swamp-colored Witch, the viper's poison had no effect on her.

After licking her hand with her tongue, she announced:

"Death confirmed. Anyone suspicious can check directly. Don't complain later."

"Hmm."

When no one stepped forward, the Paras official closed the coffin lid and said:

"An acting authority will be decided soon. We'll receive voting rights then, so please process it."

"Of course. It would be best to do it as quickly as possible. I heard there's an emergency Holy See meeting in an hour."

It was because of Havitz.

"Understood. It won't take long."

Shirano watched with distaste as the workers carried the coffin back to the sector.

'Died from being hit by an arrow?'

Excluding the elderly King of Keisha, it wasn't shocking enough to instantly kill Vulcan or Jingang.

'Well, I've confirmed it.'

At least officially, Kitra was dead.

Keisha Sector.

Fermi, who had brought Seriel to his room, held out an organized file folder.

"Here, the Angel manufacturing method."

Seriel, who silently received it, pretended to check the contents while flipping through the documents.

'I didn't come here for this.'

Fermi's expression that morning, and the news of the king's death that she heard later.

"Are you okay?"

When Seriel looked up again, Fermi was sitting powerlessly in his chair.

"What do you mean?"

"Too many things are happening. In just a few hours, people dying, terrorism occurring."

"Ah, terrorism."

He had thought that far.

"I don't understand at all what's going on. I'm just confused."

"Don't think about it complicatedly," Fermi said.

"There's only one reason humans move. Desire. Someone wants money, someone wants power, someone wants pleasure."

"What about humanity?"

Seriel asked.

"The world turning into hell? The countless people suffering within it?"

"We weren't born to think about such things in the first place. We just live. If you assign meaning to humans, nothing becomes predictable."

"That's not true. Even now, countless people are angry. Demonstrating in front of the Holy See..."

"Of course. That's what politicians want."

"What?"

"The basic strategy of fund circulation. There are two cases when citizens spend money freely. First, when they have a lot of money. Second, when they're so angry their lid blows off."

"Politicians aren't the main actors of the economy. They parasitically suck money from businesses. But businesses need to gather money from citizens. So what should politicians do? They need to make citizens as angry as possible."

Fermi tapped below his Adam's apple.

"Making life tough right up to the point where you can barely breathe. If they cross the line, it becomes riots, but if they just don't cross the line, it's much more effective than releasing funds. If you worsen the overall quality of life, unnecessary consumption increases."

He sighed at Seriel's sad expression.

"Don't worry about it. You just do what you need to do. Make medicine, save patients. Whatever you do, don't get involved with politicians. As long as you think humans are special, you can't beat those beasts."

"What about you?"

Seriel asked.

"Do you also think there's nothing special about humans? Animals moving according to desires, is that all?"

'Master.'

Being competent means being able to endure and endure until you get the results you want.

Fermi remained silent.

Meanwhile, Seriel, who thought she had already heard the answer, turned away with a disappointed expression.

"I'm leaving. Take care."

She probably came to comfort him.

Fermi, who had been watching her retreating figure, impulsively rose from his chair.

"Wait."

When he embraced her from behind, Seriel's shoulders flinched.

"Wh-what?"

"Just... stay a little longer before you go."

Of course, she had come with the intention of comforting Fermi, but she hadn't prepared herself for this.

"Don't do this."

Seriel said, clenching her fists.

"Once is a mistake, but twice can't be undone. You're a smart guy. You'll ruin everything."

"...You can always be stupid, but you can't always be smart. As you know, I feel like an idiot right now."

Like that time in school.

"I don't want to. I'm not in that mood, and I don't think I can handle you. Let me go."

"Then go. You can just go. Pull away my hands and leave this room. You're smart too."

Seriel bit her lip.

Though tremendous inner conflict swept through her like a storm, she eventually lowered her head.

'I don't know anymore either.'

When Seriel turned around and kissed him, Fermi held her and they fell to the floor.

Their reunion was brief, but the faces of the two lying side by side were flushed.

Seriel said, catching her breath.

"Crazy... bastard."

"Was it that good?"

She bolted upright and glared at Fermi.

"This isn't time for jokes! Do you think we're still young enough to make mistakes? This kind of playing with fire...!"

"It's not playing with fire."

Fermi said.

"It's not. Not now, and not back then either."

Feeling his sincerity, Seriel softened her expression and asked.

"Then tell me. What exactly are you thinking? What do you want?"

"Can't you tell me either? I'll help you. I'll never betray you."

"I..."

The moment he was about to open his mouth due to hot emotions, a chilling reality pierced through Fermi's mind.

'I can't.'

He would lose control of the situation.

"It's time to go."

Seriel got up and adjusted her clothes.

"I'm not giving up though, so let's meet later. I'll definitely make you spill everything."

'Right. That's the kind of woman you are.'

Someone who respects others' emotions as much as her own.

Humans probably aren't just animals chasing desires, Fermi thought.

"Seriel."

As she turned around, Fermi said.

"The reason I failed Amy in the graduation exam was because she wasn't at a level you needed to worry about."

"Hmph."

Seriel held up her middle finger toward Fermi, smiled slightly, and left the room.

Alone again in the space, Fermi looked at the ceiling and fell into thought.

'Mother.'

Yolga, who had the broadest perspective.

'How did you endure it? Seeing places others couldn't see, how did you bear it?'

A path no one acknowledges.

"Let's begin."

Fermi's eyes came alive as he bolted upright.

"Because I'm Yolga's son."
