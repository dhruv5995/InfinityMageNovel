Fanaticism (1)

"Damn it!"

The faces of the demons charging toward the Information Castle that Dante had created twisted viciously.

'A siege battle out of nowhere.'

And it wasn't some makeshift fortification either, but a completed structure with every building specialized for defense.

"Attack for now!"

Just as the army of hell reached that conclusion, all kinds of magic shot out from 3,000 gun ports.

Though it was basic Pure-attribute magic, the firepower of 9,000 rounds per second was beyond what they could handle.

"Gwaak!"

The demons at the front collapsed, and the second line that had been running over their corpses soon fell as well.

The piling corpses began to reveal a certain boundary line in the power struggle between firepower and army.

'Is something like this even possible?'

The culmination of magic.

Too complex for one human to handle, but for Dante, it was both his major and his profession.

"Charge! Push through with numbers!"

To capture an emotionless castle, the demons had no choice but to accept casualties.

"Go! Go!"

As they threw themselves in prepared to die, the line of power began to be pushed back toward the Information Castle.

"Got it! Just a little more!"

When the lead demons approached within 40 meters, Dante put both feet up on the table and bit down on a cigarette.

"Activate Automaton."

As he tilted his head and lit it with his finger, the castle rose more than a meter into the air.

Kukukukukukuku!

The blood-soaked demons at the front couldn't believe what was happening and opened their eyes wide.

"What, what is that?"

No, they didn't want to believe it.

"The castle is moving."

Though slow, the sight of an enormous castle moving in its entirety was spectacular.

But the demons watching it were annoyed enough to want to kill anyone nearby.

Dante exhaled a long stream of cigarette smoke, leaned back in his chair, and looked at the multi-vision screen.

"It would be perfect if only it were faster."

The Automaton simultaneously moved the coordinates of all magic circles within the Information Castle.

Precise like clockwork gears, but the speed depended entirely on Pascal's calculation speed.

'If I'd had just 10 more years, no, even 5 years.'

He felt regret that he could have created a perfect, impregnable system.

'Let's not make excuses.'

Dante smiled bitterly and stubbed out his cigarette.

"There are those who manage to pull it off anyway."

Thinking of Shirone, who had now widened the gap between them, Dante began operating the castle in earnest.

The eyes of the demons following the retreating Information Castle were filled with murderous intent.

"The demons must be going crazy!"

No matter how slow, considering the number of demons that had to die to advance just one meter, it was definitely a strong advantage.

The demon formation that had been dominating the horizon could be seen concentrating on the Information Castle.

Lufist, who was watching from the Tormia camp, muttered with an incredulous expression.

"Moving a castle?"

Of course, the demon army numbered over a hundred million, and it wasn't enough to completely twist the direction of flow.

"Not bad."

But if it was a twist created by just one person, the efficiency could be said to exceed roughly 10,000 times.

"Tormia has many talented individuals."

Garcia, the 2nd Corps Commander of the Holy War and Amy's teacher, had approached at some point.

Lufist, who paid his respects formally, said:

"He was once evaluated as talent representing the kingdom. There's still no disagreement about that, but..."

"You're talking about Shirone. An enviable situation."

There wasn't a mage in the world who didn't know that Yahweh was from the Kingdom of Tormia.

"I don't particularly feel pride. In a sense, that child doesn't belong to the kingdom."

He was already an existence beyond the system.

"There's no need to cling to something you can't control. What I'm concerned about is that."

Lufist pointed to the Information Castle.

"The 3rd Division will support the defense. Whatever happens, make sure to bring Dante back."

"Yes!"

The division commander, who knew Dante's strategic value, moved his forces according to orders.

Dante, who confirmed them through the multi-vision showing the rear, lowered stairs on the castle wall.

"Let's start around here. Deactivate Automaton."

Stopping the calculations needed for movement allowed various systems to operate.

Firepower naturally soared as well, and the demons were crushed miserably in front of the castle walls.

"Kraaaah! Kraaaah!"

As the demons' screams came through the speakers, the screen flashed with red light.

It meant enemies had entered the blind spot.

At that point, Dante operated the device.

"Got it! I'll destroy you!"

Just as a demon reaching the castle gate raised a huge hammer, a voice came from the door.

"Please enter the password."

"Huh? Password?"

Looking closely, there was a panel with numbers and symbols installed near the door handle.

The moment a demon who had been watching with his mouth half-open reached out to press a number keyâ€”

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Cannons fired in parabolic arcs from the inner castle fell in front of the castle walls, striking the demons hard.

"You stupid fool! Just break it down and get in!"

When the front line was annihilated, a second-line demon wielding a huge scythe headed for the castle gate again.

"I'll cut you down!"

Then Dante grabbed the microphone and spoke.

"The password is 1111."

The demon, who had stopped both arms mid-swing, showed serious internal conflict in his eyes, but eventually lowered his scythe and extended his finger.

"Ah, damn!"

When he pressed the number 1 four times but the door didn't change, the demon looked up and shouted.

"What! It's not opening!"

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

As the second barrage fired and the second line was annihilated, Dante's voice was heard.

"...You have to press enter."

The demons' eyes became bloodshot.

"Is this bastard playing with us?"

From then on it was pure destructive madness, and all kinds of weapons struck the castle gate.

"Damn thing's solid!"

Though the durability was much stronger than expected, they couldn't stop the enormous mass pressing from behind.

"We broke through!"

The castle gate opened, and Dante, hearing the warning voice echoing from the control room ceiling, stood up.

"Activate combat system."

The demons pouring into the castle gate like vomit were surprised to see the interior scenery.

"It's a real castle?"

There were stone paths running vertically through grassy areas, and fountains and statues were visible.

The 3rd Tormia Division was positioned atop the inner castle surrounded by a moat.

"Anyway, there's something to kill! Let's go!"

The moment the demons headed for the inner castle, landmines buried in the grass exploded and gun barrels protruded from the statues.

Fire ignited in the fountain circulating combustible liquid, and fireballs shot out in all directions.

"Run! Run!"

It was one mountain after another.

The moment they entered the drawbridge to cross the moat, a hologram of a beautiful woman appeared.

"Hello! Welcome to Dante's castle!"

"Shut up!"

Even knowing it was fake, as they swung their claws, the ground beneath their feet felt eerily hollow.

As the drawbridge disappeared and they fell into the moat, powerful toxins corroded their skin.

"Kraaaaaaah!"

The green liquid bubbled and boiled, and snakes emerged above the surface, spraying acid in all directions.

'What the hell is this place?'

The demon who wondered how many more traps they'd have to go through to meet the castle lord...

"Damn it."

Just before death, he felt a chilling shiver.

The reason the Information Castle was great was that it twisted the demons' movement by at least 0.1 degrees.

'0.1 degrees.'

A level difficult to distinguish with the eye, but Lufist was satisfied with that.

'The important thing is that it's twisted.'

Though the starting point of the straight line might look the same, the difference would become starkly apparent as the distance increased.

'Iron Wave!'

The iron tide pushed back the earth, and Garcia burned enemies with Inferno's flames.

In the air, Flu's Phoenix was breathing fire according to its algorithm.

"Kahaha! Humans! It's humans!"

Though the battlefield resembled hell, that was precisely the most comfortable place for demons.

'This is the problem. It's hard to break their morale.'

Apart from physical abilities, the demons' belligerence was a temperament that couldn't be found in humans.

Enox, the Fairy King, who confirmed the allied forces' retreat, raised his arm.

"The enemy of humans is the enemy of elves."

Lufist had requested to turn the army of hell toward Baschuka. Even with a simple comparison, that would require twisting their movement by more than 30 degrees.

"Open the flower garden!"

The ground rumbled, and over 300 massive structures spread their steel petals wide.

Shadows spanning several kilometers in radius fell, and enormous energy blazed above the petals as if about to explode.

"What is that now..."

Enox lowered his arm.

"Annihilate!"

As a flash with the power of a map weapon burned the earth, 3,000 demons were instantly obliterated.

"Scatter! Breakthrough while avoiding the flash!"

Well-ordered?

No, the formation scattered in almost chaotic form, and from the attacker's perspective, the difficulty had increased.

If the pilot of the Bio-machine had been human.

"This much is no problem."

Plarino, connected to the Bio-machine through Small World Creation, quickly changed targeting points.

Since control was possible at the speed of nerves, for her it was no different from stepping on ants at her feet.

All sounds were buried in the roar, and demons burned from just being grazed by the flash.

Lufist, who had retreated to the flower garden, carefully observed the war situation even while fighting.

'We're doing better than expected.'

The rate at which demons were decreasing due to the Fire Tribe's strikes far exceeded the standard.

'Should I be happy?'

The number of demons killed in 30 minutes was roughly calculated to exceed 150,000.

In other words, it was firepower that could annihilate the entire army of a small kingdom in 30 minutes.

The problem was that even that huge number didn't amount to even 0.1 percent of the total forces of hell's army.

'Meanwhile, the allied forces' casualties are roughly 4 percent.'

Though the asymmetry of power would accelerate as time passed, even that wasn't a big problem.

'They'll keep pushing in.'

Because there's no end no matter how many you kill, soldiers come to perceive the enemy as infinite.

When standing under a waterfall, you don't think about when the stream will stop.

'That's what hundreds of millions means.'

And this was precisely why Iruki had staked everything on the Elemental Bomb project.

Vulcan, positioned in the middle of the army, rested his chin on his hand.

"Hmm."

Through Crowd Technique, all situations unfolding in the flower garden were read as a massive flow.

'They're definitely luring us. And those Bio-machines.'

Watching the flashes being fired in rapid succession intently, he nodded.

"Judging by the reaction speed relative to scale, it's not at the level of machines. Humans would be even slower."

The conclusion was reached.

"It's the Fire Tribe."

Nothing but Small World Creation could explain it.

Though Vulcan called out, Smodo was captivated by the Information Castle at the edge of the horizon.

"What are you staring at so intently? Want to go?"

Belatedly coming to his senses, he turned to look at Vulcan.

"No, I'm the type who hits all the hot places when I travel."

Vulcan raised the corner of his mouth.

"I'd like to send you, but not right now. Focus on the ancient weapons. Where's the weakest point?"

Smodo, who had mysophobia, found the most agitated movements among the 300 Bio-machines.

"Northwest. The 23rd, 47th, and 88th. Those three are different from the others. They seem scared."

Vulcan nodded.

"Capture them. If we capture even one, we should be able to destroy all the Bio-machines in the vicinity. Go with Zetaro."

"Okay."

As Smodo and Zetaro took the lead, elite demons quickly followed.

Natasha pointed to herself and asked.

"Vulcan, what about me?"

Though Vulcan pondered carefully, there was only one thing Natasha could do anyway.

"Kill him."

The Knight of Mach.

At those welcome words, Natasha turned her head toward the flower garden and her eyes lit up.

"Perfect."

Lian's fighting spirit rising from the center of the flower garden was drawing her in.
