[745] Age of Turbulence (1)

"Foolish beings."

Anger swirled in Nane's eyes as she looked up at the sky from deep within the forest.

"Do you truly believe there is hope in this world?"

Though one's heart may be greater than the universe, aren't humans the very beings who betray even that heart as easily as flipping one's palm?

It's natural for living beings to be selfish?

"That too is merely an illusion born from being trapped within the existence called 'self.'"

"Lord Nane, how about striking the South Pole?"

Sura spoke up.

"...Eventually, that must be done."

If it were a law that could be eliminated right now, the Spiritual Realm wouldn't have shrunk so drastically.

The terrifying obsession of life forms with survival.

'Beron, Sirone, Miro...'

The Kar figure exceeding 99 percent was sucking in the remaining truth in the world like a black hole.

But since it could never be perfect, she absolutely had to know what had been missed regarding humans.

"Great chaos is coming to the world. The law will inevitably pass to me anyway."

Everyone would learn just how cruel humans are, and why this world must be closed.

"Just a little more!"

Even as blood vessels burst and bloody tears flowed, Miro's gaze remained fixed squarely on the world's law.

The Spiritual Realm's radius: 4.4 kilometers.

'I need to reduce it by even 100 more meters! No, even 10 meters!'

The number of humans who could survive per meter of radius was estimated at roughly 300.

Ooooooooo.

The monks of the Middle Heaven Order supported the law with the lowest bass notes humans could produce.

Miro's eyes widened.

'No! This is the limit!'

If she pushed any further, Zion's law would be destroyed and all their efforts would come to nothing.

"Execute it!"

The totems consumed by flames formed 700 pillars of fire ascending to the sky.

"It's done."

The 700 pillars of fire that would burn eternally unless Zion was destroyed would block the expansion of the Spiritual Realm.

"We did it. We actually did it."

While the law practitioners looked up at the sky with expressions of disbelief, Miro's eyes remained sharp.

"How irritating..."

The final radius of the Spiritual Realm: 1.43 kilometers.

Being 430 meters wider than the original target meant roughly 100,000 additional deaths.

"To achieve this much against Nane is remarkable. You should take pride in it."

Armin consoled her.

'Honestly, I didn't think we'd get this far.'

It wasn't a result achieved through depth of mastery alone.

It clearly showed the experience gained from blocking all of Heaven's armies with dimensional barriers.

"It's fine. We haven't accomplished anything yet."

Miro declared to the world.

"The fight starts now."

Project Zion.

This was the name of humanity's final legal line of defense against Nane's attack.

As the Spiritual Realm contracted, armies from various nations under the Holy See's orders pushed back the demons from the guidelines.

"Fire! Fire!"

While sealing the altar was impossible, they needed to buy time to at least set up barricades outside the Spiritual Realm.

Even using the ultra-high-speed barrier construction method developed by the world's greatest architect would take 36 hours.

The method the Holy See chose to temporarily bind the demons to the passages of the Other World was extremely simple.

"No need to conserve! Pour everything out and go!"

The spectacle of thousands of archers simultaneously firing magic bullets in a 360-degree radius around the Spiritual Realm was magnificent.

All supplies were provided by the Holy See, and approximately 9 million tons of magic bullets would be supplied to each nation over 36 hours.

'What kind of money-burning is this!'

When converted to monetary value, it amounted to 1.3 trillion gold, and the soldiers simply had to keep pulling bowstrings day and night toward the bombarded areas.

The commander lifted his telescope to examine the altar area.

'This is a strategy only the Holy See could execute. And it's certainly effective.'

Though discussions were likely taking place among the demons of the Other World, they didn't dare emerge at the moment.

The commander slowly lowered his telescope.

'But there are inevitable limits to quantity.'

Where the sunset glowed, hideous steel frames were rising at a terrifying speed.

'Everyone is fighting.'

Sirone observed everything happening on the planet from Taeseong's perspective.

Taeseong's expression was also grave.

"Miro finally did it."

"Yes, it's disappointing. If we had pushed just a little more..."

"Zion would have been destroyed instead."

Sirone knew this too.

Still, what left him with regrets was the pitifully small number of those with good will compared to the population.

'I have to do it.'

Sirone turned to Taeseong and said:

"I can't just watch like this. I'll go down to the surface. I'll seal the altars."

"Of course. But the time for Sirone to act is after the barricades are completed."

He wanted to leave immediately.

"Sirone, a star must not serve the interests of specific nations or individuals. If Sirone seals any nation's altar prematurely, human conflicts will only intensify."

Sirone pressed his lips tightly together.

"Sirone must always act transnationally, from outside human life. You cannot kill someone out of desire to save someone else. Causing discord only helps Nane's purpose."

What made his heart break was having people he desperately wanted to see.

"...I understand."

Family, friends, lovers.

Taeseong looked with pity at Sirone, who bore such an enormous burden beyond personal constraints.

"Take this."

As Taeseong raised both hands, a five-pointed star pendant appeared and floated toward Sirone.

"What is this?"

"The key to Planet Hexa. It's merely symbolic for Sirone, but you shouldn't get lost."

Using Material, he could disassemble Hexa's key at the atomic level to obtain blueprints.

"Thank you. I'll treasure it. Though I don't think I'll need to find Hexa anytime soon."

Taeseong understood Sirone's heart.

No matter how much he had entered the realm of infinity, having returned to this world, he couldn't be without feelings.

Rather, with only feelings remaining, he would miss his loved ones all the more.

"Go ahead and descend. Louver and Mini are waiting. They'll show you where to live."

Sirone manifested Yahweh's light in his palm and said:

"Yes. I'll see you when I depart."

Taeseong didn't forbid the stars from visiting.

It was simply because there was no way to meet, but Sirone could come to her anytime.

'Going down.'

Just as when he had arrived at the Great Earth Temple, the law opened a path and Sirone's body instantly disappeared.

Since Louver would be preparing a gift for Sirone, a smile crossed Taeseong's lips.

"Though this is all I can do for you who sacrificed for humanity..."

It was a sad smile.

"May it be a pleasant dream..."

Below the Great Earth Temple, at the top of the physically highest ivory tower, Louver and Mini were waiting.

"Did your conversation go well?"

"She was a wonderful person."

Taeseong had been as warm as a mother.

"Indeed. Let me guide you to your lodgings."

Taking the elevator to the 400th floor, they could see a small village with rice fields, farms, mountains, and streams beyond the door.

"Stars don't necessarily live in independent spaces. We simply move into vacant houses."

"Yes. I like it."

While civilization is originally built within nature, the ivory tower contained nature within civilization.

'Just how large is this building?'

Since he had entered through a magic circle, he regretted not being able to see the ivory tower from outside.

Sirone's house was a two-story wooden building with a red roof and an antique atmosphere.

Mini asked:

"Will you leave as soon as the barricades are completed?"

Since only Sirone could seal the altars, she was thinking of providing support elsewhere.

"Then I'll go to the southern hemisphere to investigate traces of Beron. We might find some clues."

Louver nodded.

"I'll instruct the other stars in our department to help with demon suppression operations."

It was simple to convey through dreams.

"The residents of the Other World are strong. Many people will die or suffer going forward."

"If there's someone you want to protect, protect them."

Sirone turned at Mini's words.

"I know what Taeseong told you. That's a star's fate. But you've already saved everyone. You have more than enough right to save at least those you love."

Sirone shook his head.

"The moment I become obsessed, Kar will rise and I'll lose Yahweh's light. The balance of law will be broken."

"You can't endure it. You have enough power to protect them - would you really be okay if someone you love dies?"

"I wouldn't be okay."

Nane had said this:

The person in the most pain is you.

The terrible contradiction of saving humanity through universal love while being unable to protect any single person he loved.

'I must not become human. I must check Nane purely as a concept.'

This was Hexa's reason for existence.

"Let's focus on the altars for now. Once the barricades are installed, I'll start with the closest one."

Tormia was far from the ivory tower, so it wasn't a human decision, though his heart bled.

Louver said:

"I agree. Only decisions to save humanity are possible in this situation."

Mini turned at the unexpectedly cold words, but Louver was smiling kindly.

"But... anyone can dream."

Sirone blinked at the incomprehensible words.

Kingdom of Tormia.

At Amy's family home in Creas City, 200 armed soldiers had formed an impenetrable formation.

Amy's father Shacora returned home with cold eyes after visiting the Creas branch of the Magic Association.

"Honey! How did it go?"

As the Spiritual Realm expanded to the noble district, demon corpses were scattered along the streets.

"There was major damage in the mountain regions. Seven thousand deaths nationwide. But we managed to hold them off for now."

"What will happen to Tormia going forward?"

Before humanity's worst disaster in history, even a first-class noble's wife was just another human.

"The firepower demonstration only temporarily bound the demons' feet - the barricades won't last long either."

Isis, who would have become demon food if Amy hadn't been home, trembled.

"They say Sirone entered the ivory tower."

Amy, who had been hanging her head in combat fatigue, looked at Isis for the first time.

"It's not certain. But he seems to have played a key role in stopping this crisis."

That was all the information Shacora had received.

"They say where Sirone is, it's safe from demons..."

The ivory tower and Zion were the only places untouched by the terrible disaster.

"If our family could somehow go there..."

"Mom!"

Amy shot up.

"What are you saying right now! How can you think about just us surviving!"

"Amy, what are you doing to your mother?"

Shacora's nerves were also on edge after returning home from seeing the horrible corpses.

"You'll become a soldier, but not everyone is a soldier. It's natural for a mother who can't fight to be afraid."

"But it doesn't make sense."

Isis spoke in frustration:

"Why doesn't it make sense? Setting aside going to the ivory tower, shouldn't there at least be some word when the kingdom is in this state? You two aren't just ordinary friends..."

Amy couldn't argue back.

"That's..."

Between all of humanity stood Sirone and Nane.

It was difficult for humans, mere thinking reeds, to understand two people who had realized opposing extremes.

But now, with the world on the brink of destruction, they were also the ones who had found the answer closest to truth.

"Sorry. I'm tired, so I'm going to my room to sleep first."

"Amy..."

Realizing her daughter felt the most betrayed, Isis tried to speak, but Amy went into her room.

"I guess I misspoke."

"Leave her be. She won't be hurt by something like this. After a good night's sleep, her mind will clear."

That night, Louver appeared in Amy's dream.
