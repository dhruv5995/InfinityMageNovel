The World They Live In (2)

At the border between Kashan and Zaib.

In the middle of the desert under the blazing sun, a man in priest's robes stood reading a book.

Beneath his black fedora, curly black hair hung like curtains, covering his face.

Sitting on a rock with his crane-like long legs bent at right angles, he looked up at the sun and exhaled.

"Haah."

Dry vapor puffed out in clouds.

"Coming again?"

As he lowered his gaze toward the horizon, an old man with a black umbrella approached through the heat haze.

"Still won't put down that Bible?"

As if placed there by God himself, the old man had somehow appeared right in front of him.

"A life without mercy is like an endless desert."

"But you abandoned God, didn't you?"

The old man added.

"To become God."

The Bible closed with a snap.

"What brings you here?"

"The Lord seeks you."

The priest's name was Nike, a vampire called the strongest Almas in history.

"Fine weather."

Despite being completely unlike typical vampire characteristics, his bronze-skinned figure looked up at the sun.

"...Are you alright?"

Vampires are weak to ultraviolet rays, but can endure for some time thanks to their powerful regenerative abilities.

An Almas-class vampire could typically endure about 4 hours on average, though their activity would be reduced.

"Haaaaah."

As Nike's brown skin burned and he exhaled hot vapor, his skin immediately regenerated.

'What a monster of a man.'

His regenerative ability was more than 10 times stronger than other Almas, approaching that of a Lord.

"Just because you can endure it doesn't mean it's not painful."

As Nike's lips split wide and he entered biting state, his gums around his fangs lifted upward.

"Without pain, there is no eternal life."

Biting an opponent is called "biting," and in that state one can perform suction and injection.

Suction is drawing blood, and injection is the ability to inject prions to make the target submit.

"What's the mission this time? Hunting half-breeds?"

One-tenth of all half-demons spread across the world had been captured by Nike's hands and subjected to cruel experiments.

"The True Demon has arrived."

Nike's gaze turned toward the old man for the first time.

"He says he will eliminate all vampire weaknesses and take over this world. Currently, he's collecting blood to awaken two Lords."

"I see. What's my job?"

"Come to Zaib. We will find you."

Having said this, the old man's face transformed into that of a hideous bat, then instantly burrowed into the ground.

Nike looked toward where Zaib lay.

"The promised land?"

When Rian arrived at the Security Headquarters, Benof had been waiting for him desperately.

"What happened last night? You don't look well."

"You don't look so good yourself, Captain. I assume you heard about the blood bank incident?"

"Don't even mention it. The Sacred Guard completely fooled us. Even the Security Chief didn't hear about it."

"I was at that scene."

"You were?"

Rian recounted what had happened the night before.

"What? You met hunters?"

"Yes. They have someone with the ability to distinguish vampires. That's why they were always faster than us."

"Where are they?"

Rian shook his head.

"Well, they are engaging in unauthorized activities. So what are you thinking? Are you going to join them too?"

"I'm an outsider. I don't want to get involved in royal affairs. And personally..."

It was an opportunity to learn Smile's secrets.

"If that's what you've decided, I can't stop you. But let's exchange information occasionally."

He was surprisingly agreeable.

"What are you thinking?"

"Actually... I understand your feelings. It seems there's likely an inside spy in the royal court."

Benof made a secret proposal.

"Soon the royal court will hire hunters from around the world. To catch hiding rats, you need to release cats."

"The ones I know won't participate. They are..."

"No, that's not what I mean. The hunter you know - you said they can definitely locate vampires, right?"

Rian caught on too.

"If the conditions are right."

"There's going to be a hunter hiring interview at the royal court. High-ranking officials will be observing too. It's a perfect opportunity to expose the inside spy. If you help with this, I'll overlook your hunter friends' activities."

It was good for both parties, and Rian knew Genia would surely agree.

"I'll discuss it. But you must guarantee their safety. They won't step forward directly at the scene."

"I understand. I just need to know who the spy is. Since only you and I know about this, there's no chance of it leaking."

After parting with Benof, Rian carefully watched for tails as he arrived at Genocide's hideout.

As people who had slept in the morning began waking up one by one, Rian gathered everyone.

"...This proposal came in."

Grain stroked his chin and said,

"An inside spy. Certainly, if vampires are attached to the royal court, it makes our work difficult."

Pacet said,

"It's unpleasant how they seem to be looking down on us. But it's connected to our work anyway, isn't it?"

Most seemed to agree, but ultimately the decision belonged to Silver herself, Genia.

"I don't trust anyone."

Her colleagues, knowing her personality, fell silent.

"Want me to be honest? The fact that Rian revealed our work pisses me off."

Katein defended him.

"They already knew about hunters anyway. Silver too. He just said he met them."

"He told them Silver is here!"

Powler said,

"He didn't say where exactly. Genia, that's unreasonable. We've been wandering around unable to find the vampire hideout too. The royal court said they're publicly hiring hunters. Maybe we can find a breakthrough through this incident."

Genia wouldn't budge.

"I know it's a good proposal for us. So this is my problem. An emotional problem."

Rian said,

"If it upset you, I apologize. I'm not forcing anything. If you want, I'll cut contact with them."

"Don't treat me like a child! I said it's a good proposal! It's just, I..."

"Right, you're scared."

Genia was neither human nor vampire.

"What?"

"You're afraid of joining hands with people you don't trust. But we don't need to join hands."

"Hmph, easy to say. What if they try to use me? What if I end up fighting as humans' dog from now on?"

"Then I'll cut them down."

Everyone looked at Rian.

"Whether it's the King of Zaib, the Sacred Guard, or the Security Force - if they break their promise, I'll fight for you instead."

Genia couldn't understand Rian.

"How can you say that so easily? You're human too, aren't you? You'd kill humans for me?"

"If you think after drawing your sword, it's too late. Your thinking must always be finished beforehand."

That was Rian's philosophy.

"What you can do while holding sharp metal isn't love or sacrifice. It's taking responsibility for every death I create. I've already made that decision."

"What are you really..."

Living as a vampire hunter, Genia too must have created countless deaths.

Deaths she might have turned away from.

But Rian said he would take responsibility.

"You said there's someone you really want to protect, right? What about that person? What will you do if you become a lifelong fugitive? Will you still fight for me then?"

"Don't make me say it twice."

Hadn't he already said he'd made that decision?

"That is my conviction."

The feeling was so overwhelming that Genia could no longer find reason to be stubborn.

"I don't trust humans."

"Genia."

Just as Pacet was about to step forward, Genia raised her head.

"But since you said you'd take responsibility, I'll help just this once. You must stay by my side."

"Alright."

As Rian nodded, Genia turned away with a sulky expression.

"I'm hungry. Let's eat."

The corner of Grain's mouth lifted slightly.

'You've met a good person, Genia.'

Everyone has painful memories, but her suffering of having to live as a half-demon was longer than others.

'Maybe Rian can take responsibility for her cursed life too.'

No, it was possible only because it was Rian.

The Genocide team wandered Rodenin Street every night searching for vampire hideouts.

They captured several Vesica-class vampires, but even they had no information about their superiors.

"Damn! They're avoiding us like rats!"

In the medical room, Grain's cruel experiments were conducted to learn everything about vampires.

"Kraaaah! I'll kill you all!"

Genia's expression was indifferent as she inhaled Blood Q, but her companions watched her reactions.

'Did Genia also...'

Scream like that, they wondered.

"It's no use after all."

As if she hadn't been thinking about that, Genia stood up and said,

"We have no choice but to join hands with the humans."

"Were you still worrying about it? We already decided to do it. The hunter interview is tomorrow."

"Being ordered to do something and doing it voluntarily are different. Rian, the preparations are definitely ready, right?"

Rian handed her a hood.

"You'll go in wearing this. There won't be an identity check, and we'll watch from the highest point."

It was the limit of what Benof's authority could arrange, but since Rian would be nearby, she had no choice but to trust him.

Pacet saw them off.

"Be careful. There's no mission today, so you can eat something delicious when you're done."

"Think we're going on a date?"

"Still, it's just you two. Have a nice intimate time."

At Pacet's whisper, Genia didn't seem to dislike it either as she delayed her answer and turned away.

"Hehe, she's cute anyway."

On the way to the royal court's hunter interview venue, Rian asked the hooded Genia,

"Are you okay?"

"I think I can manage. The sun isn't too strong today either."

Even so, at points where others' attention disappeared, she took out Blood Q and inhaled it faithfully.

"They're here."

She felt it the moment they arrived at the royal court.

"Vampires."

"How many?"

Genia's eyes darted around.

"Not that many. Three to four. But they're all Almas. Will you be okay? With these numbers, even you won't be able to handle it."

"Who says I can't handle it?"

Though Rian had done his best in every battle since entering Rodenin, that was still by human standards.

His essence was Yaksha.

If he intended to devastate the area, he could protect Genia even against Almas-class opponents.

After receiving a formal inspection from Benof, the two entered the Colosseum carrying weapons.

Their position was where the guard units were stationed, while royal court officials sat in seats across from them.

"Can you see them?"

"Yeah, two of them."

Genia inhaled Blood Q again.

"There, the young secretary. He's a vampire. And that old man sitting in the VIP section. He's a vampire too."

They naturally positioned themselves in the shadows.

"His Majesty enters!"

King Meyer of Zaib stepped onto the platform.

The royal guard 'Sacred Guard' positioned themselves behind in their characteristic pose - legs together, waist bent 45 degrees back.

'All of them are strong fighters.'

Meyer proclaimed,

"As demonic hordes swarm the capital of our kingdom, we have come to summon capable hunters from various regions. We hope you will fully demonstrate your abilities and contribute to Zaib's peace."

The iron gate rose and nearly 100 hunters entered the center of the Colosseum.

As Rian watched their faces, he heard rough breathing and turned to Genia.

"What's wrong?"

The face hidden under the hood was filled with shock.

'That bastard.'

The one who caught her attention was a priest with hawk-like features and black hair flowing to his shoulders.

He had two iron rods rolled into circles hanging from his shoulders, and a cross tattoo carved under his chin.

"Nike..."

Genia's teeth made a grinding sound.

He was the enemy who killed her parents and the very person who drove her into the laboratory.
