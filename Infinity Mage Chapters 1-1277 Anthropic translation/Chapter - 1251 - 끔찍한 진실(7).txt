The Terrible Truth (7)

"Tae, Taesung..."

There was no killing intent, no hostility.

No, even if there had been, Sirone probably wouldn't have been able to respond.

That was the magnitude of it.

"Why me..."

The size of the heart that Sirone had relied on Taesung in the lonely fight for humanity.

Taesung pulled out her hand with a swift motion.

"Gasp!"

Sirone collapsed to the floor, and she stared at her own blood-stained hand for a moment.

Zing's gaze dropped downward.

"Sirone."

A clean fatal blow.

Faint convulsions were all that Sirone could manage.

"See?"

Taesung said, shaking off the blood.

"Why do such pointless things?"

Zing, feeling a chill as if her very soul was freezing, asked with trembling shoulders.

"Did you deceive us?"

"What are you talking about."

The reason even Zing, who hadn't trusted Taesung, asked such a question was probably because she had forgotten one thing.

The fact that she wasn't human.

"I am an administrator. I cannot let those who have infiltrated the outside world live."

When Taesung flipped Sirone's body over with her foot, a grimacing face was revealed.

"Grr! Must!"

"I've stopped her heart. Recovery is impossible. I would prefer if you didn't struggle anymore."

Sirone gritted her teeth.

'I'm dying.'

She tried to move her heart with Miracle Stream, but it wouldn't budge as if it had turned to steel.

'Legal code has entered. Recovery is...'

Sirone's eyes rolled back and her vision narrowed like a pinhole at the edge of consciousness.

What came to mind in the last moment was.

Save yourself from the terrible truth.

'How frustrating.'

Even the faint breathing disappeared, and Sirone lay motionless with her eyes showing only whites.

It was death.

"Ah..."

Zing stared in a daze.

She had witnessed Sirone's death right before her eyes, but her mind still couldn't process it.

Only anger was moving.

"I'm going to kill you."

Looking indifferently at the killing intent in Zing's eyes, Taesung moved her steps.

"You're still saying frustrating things. I have no life. And now humanity is finished too."

She stopped in front of Argones and said.

"Let's begin."

"Hmm."

Administrators govern independent domains, but ultimately they are programs that operate under God's calculation device.

Zing didn't know how much they knew about each other, but...

"Cell Buster."

Argones' expression was not pleasant.

As his body divided into countless anti-cells, Zing, who came to her senses too late, reached out her hand.

"No!"

But from the moment Taesung regained her freedom, there was nothing that could stop them.

"Grr!"

Taesung blocked Zing's law, and Argones transformed into countless cells and flew up to the sky.

'It's over.'

Because her will was stronger than anyone's, the moment such a thought occurred, even her fighting spirit disappeared.

"Sob!"

Zing knelt down on the spot and burst into tears.

Taesung approached.

"I didn't want to go this far. If possible, I wanted to live with the children I created."

"Sob. How, how could this..."

Since Zing probably couldn't hear anything now, Taesung turned around.

"I hope in the next reincarnation..."

She too flew up to the sky, and only a cold voice remained in the ivory tower.

"You won't make such a mistake."

What remained were the crying Zing, the stunned Eumji and Yangji, and "Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!" Sirone's corpse.

Ymir's Mind.

Sirone's group, who had exited the gate installed on the first level of the depths, turned around with surprised expressions.

"Mr. Lufar."

Lufar, holding Ultima in his hand, still remained in Ymir's mind.

"I'm sorry."

Sein, Miro, Gaold, and Kang Nan didn't know what he was trying to say.

"Great Star of the Five."

Mong-ah made a pitiful expression.

"You made a big mistake."

And at that moment, the incident of Taesung stopping Sirone's heart occurred in the ivory tower.

"Gasp!"

Though they learned of all the circumstances belatedly, before they could do anything, Sirone had collapsed.

"You..."

Miro charged first, and just as Gaold, Sein, and Kang Nan followed.

"The outside world."

Lufar said.

"No one should approach it."

The gate closed simultaneously as the incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara delivered a hand strike.

"1 second."

Graaaah!

Ymir's superego's fist had reached within arm's length of them.

Boooooom!

A powerful shockwave pushed out all the atmosphere of the first level of the depths and exploded in a flash of light.

In the place where everything had been swept away, Lufar looked at the giant's fist that had stopped right in front of his nose.

"Take it."

Lufar offered Ultima, but the giant's fist didn't even twitch.

The incarnation, Ymir, asked.

"Is this a deal?"

"No. Is there anything left to remain anyway?"

Sirone's group had returned to reality, and all that remained in reality was humanity's destruction.

"How annoying."

Of course, if Ultima had been extracted, Ymir's future would have been uncertain too.

But if he had feared such trivial problems, he wouldn't have yielded a blow to Guffin either.

Therefore.

"Graaaah!"

Ymir was enraged.

The roar delivered by the incarnation was violent enough to stop a living being's heart, but...

Lufar calmly held his ground.

"Take it."

As the giant's index finger and thumb picked up Ultima, it instantly absorbed and a black hole was born again in the sky.

"I hate being in debt. Tell me if you want anything."

"Will you go to the human world?"

"What if I do?"

It was the hottest battlefield in the entire multiverse.

"Destroy it, thoroughly. If you're the last one remaining, then I'll acknowledge you as the strongest."

Lufar and Mong-ah disappeared.

"Hmph."

He had no particular complaints about the proposal, but it was unpleasant that the so-called God seemed to place him below.

'Wait. You're next.'

Anyway, since they had made a deal, what Ymir had to do was clear.

"Keke! Shall we play properly?"

The annihilation of all humanity.

Zing's heart fell endlessly.

"I couldn't do it."

Soon anti-cells would cover the world, and humanity would return to nothingness through the first cell.

"If I, if I had been a little stronger. If I had pushed through a little more..."

"Great Star of the Five."

Eumji and Yangji stood where Zing turned her head.

"Thank you for everything."

"You two."

She realized what they were trying to do.

"We don't know how long we can hold out, but we should be able to buy at least enough time for humanity to react."

It was a strategy to use the power of Taegeuk to delay Cell Buster's law, even if briefly.

"No. I still need your power. Yahweh is dead too. If you leave as well..."

Yangji shook her head.

"You know it. Human thinking cannot reach perfect Taegeuk. We're prepared."

Rumbleeee!

The sound of thunder echoed from the sky, and silver anti-cells began to divide.

"There's no time. Please let us do this."

Zing gritted her teeth.

Even if they temporarily blocked Cell Buster, what meaning would that have?

'The reason to fight until the end.'

Taking responsibility.

"I'm counting on you."

As Zing's decision fell, Eumji and Yangji smiled and nodded simultaneously.

"Farewell..."

The bodies of the two women who had opened Immortal Function shone brightly, and their minds scattered into the world.

And shortly after.

Rumble! Rumble!

The anti-cells that had covered about one-tenth of the field of vision began to gather again into a single point.

What was born was a massive aggregate of cells gathered round like the moon.

Feeling the vibrations that seemed ready to explode at any moment with her body, Zing hugged herself.

"I need to think."

During the brief time the two had bought, humanity had to find a way somehow.

"Please..."

In the blood-drying anxiety, her gaze turned toward Sirone, who had grown cold.

"Ahhhhh!"

Kang Nan screamed as she woke from sleep.

From dream to dream, then from dream to dream again, after passing through countless dreams within dreams, where she arrived was...

"Gasp! Gasp!"

A temple that was unfamiliar yet somehow familiar.

'It was a terrible nightmare.'

That thought was brief, as she realized this place was Galliant Island, not far from Tormia.

"Sirone!"

It wasn't just a dream, and where she turned her head, all the companions were awake.

No, not all of them.

Miro approached Arius, who lay peacefully on a blood-stained bed.

"Rest in peace."

With her hand on his forehead, she looked around the temple prepared by the Kergo people.

"No one came in."

Though it was an enclosed space, a stillness deeper than silence created an ominous feeling.

And another person who hadn't woken up yet.

"Sirone! Get it together, Sirone!"

Kang Nan shook his shoulders, but Sirone, with his eyes closed, lay motionless as if dead.

"What's going on?"

As Gaold approached, Sein said.

"It must be the aftermath of the simultaneous event. He definitely suffered a fatal shock in another space."

"But it's strange. Simultaneous events are incarnation techniques. If it were truly a fatal injury, it couldn't be maintained."

After a brief silence, Miro spoke.

"He's dead."

Everyone looked at Miro.

"Dead?"

"He suffered a fatal injury but his mind is awake. In other words, his heart is dead but his brain is alive."

Kang Nan spread her arms.

"Does that make any sense? If the heart stopped, that means he's dead."

"How do you know?"

Kang Nan closed her mouth.

"You've never had your heart stop, have you?"

"That, that's..."

"Of course it would be a special case. But because such a special thing happened, this situation occurred. In other words, Sirone is currently in a dead state but..."

Miro raised her index finger.

"He's alive."

Thump...

'Please! Please!'

Sirone desperately squeezed his heart.

'Beat!'

Thump! Thump!

As his stopped heart finally began to beat, tremendous shock struck his body.

"Gaaaasp!"

The moment he bolted upright, it was actually Zing who was surprised.

"What, what?"

Watching with a bewildered expression, she crawled over seeing Sirone in pain.

"Sirone! Sirone!"

"Grrrr!"

His body burned hot as if on fire, craving blood, and the wound on his back remained.

"Stop the bleeding first...!"

As blood poured out, Zing concentrated her law.

When Miracle Stream's recovery power was added on top, the bleeding was quickly stopped.

"What happened? Weren't you dead?"

"I was dead."

Since his heart had stopped, that would naturally be the case, but his brain function hadn't been paralyzed yet.

"Sorry, Zing. Because of me..."

"No."

Zing shook her head.

"It wasn't decided by someone else's words. I followed because I was convinced. You persuaded me."

He was grateful she said that.

"Cell Buster has been activated. We need to find a way to stop it."

"Where is Taesung?"

This time Zing was angry too.

"Still don't get it? We were deceived. The administrators are just God's minions anyway!"

Of course Sirone thought so too. But...

"Why didn't she aim for the head?"

"Huh?"

"Why the heart? No, she could have burst the heart. Why did she make it stop?"

"Are you crazy? Taesung tried to kill you!"

"I know. But I don't understand. Could God, the perfect calculation device, make such a mistake?"

"That's..."

Zing couldn't answer.

"This is an important issue. I must confirm it."

"What?"

"Perhaps Taesung is..."

Just like the Jet they met in Apocalypse was different from countless other Jets.

"Maybe there's an error?"

In other words, a heart.
