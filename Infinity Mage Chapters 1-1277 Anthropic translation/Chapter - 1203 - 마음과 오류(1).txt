Heart and Error (1)

In Melkidu's Corcorath, Shirone, who had taken control of the Johann Cartel, made contact with the organization of darkness under the guidance of the boss Aria.

When a ship suddenly appeared in a place where all sections were separated, the party couldn't help but be surprised.

'It's the system.'

The fact that the bribery program was one of the standard methods to reach the core gave him a bit more confidence.

Of course, the process leading up to meeting this ship hadn't been smooth.

Desperado and Red Union gangs had attacked them, but before Shirone's party's force, no weapon was of any use.

At the ceasefire talks, the leaders of each organization accepted Shirone's proposal.

"You're leaving?"

Unless Shirone was going to take control of Corcorath, the best strategy was to give him what he wanted and send him away quickly.

"Fine, I'll concede this time. But if you set foot here again, one of us will disappear - you or me."

Of course, it would be the gang that disappeared, but their belligerence had already been proven through the Johann Cartel.

"This way."

The ship was lined with firearms that couldn't be obtained in reality.

"120 million points."

When the captain proposed this, Aria easily agreed.

Shirone figured that if she put her mind to it, she could gather the 10 billion points needed to enter the core.

'Aria's reason for protecting Corcorath must be for the Johann Cartel that exists in reality. To make it easy for real-world criminals to hide here.'

Even without creating unsolved cases, they could just hide in Corcorath.

'Evil seeps into every place.' For Shirone, who bore the mission of saving humanity, this was something he couldn't overlook.

"Transfer it."

As the gang began moving weapons at Aria's instruction, the captain pointed at Shirone's party.

"What are those small fry? Haven't seen those faces before."

Aria spoke reluctantly.

"They know about the bribery program. Said they wanted to meet you."

"Oh?"

Even if they had gotten hints from the internal track, they needed approval from the three major gangs to make contact with the organization of darkness.

"Impressive. You have enough points, right?" The captain was a manager anyway. Nothing but points and dice could sway him.

"Yes. My friend is imprisoned in Parme capital's prison. They said I'd have a chance if I met with you."

The captain lit his pipe.

"...I can arrange the connection. But Parme is a bit tricky. The security chief there is no ordinary person."

When Shirone remained silent, the captain pointed to the cargo hold.

"You can't get in normally. There are plenty of empty boxes, so hide in there. Stowaway fee is 10 million points."

'10 million?'

It was much more expensive than royal capital entry items.

If it were another user, they might be willing to pay since there'd be no need for 'persuasion,' but for Shirone there wasn't much merit.

'Mr. Curtis said at least 50 million. Since I haven't fully investigated the bribery program, I expected additional costs, but if it keeps going like this, I might run short on points.'

The amount Shirone's party currently possessed was about 100 million points, twice the minimum requirement.

"That's quite expensive."

As Shirone said this and turned his head, Aria sighed and spoke.

"I'll pay for it."

After the points were deducted, the captain headed to the bridge saying:

"We'll depart right after unloading. Get in the boxes now. They need to be sealed."

Before going to the cargo hold, Shirone looked back at Aria.

"Thank you."

"Hmph! I'm giving this so you never come back. With this, my job is done."

It meant not to come looking for her even if things went wrong later.

'This was getting off cheap.'

Thanks to easily obtaining 120 million worth of supplies, 10 million points was worth paying.

"See you again sometime."

At Shirone's farewell, Aria, who was getting off the ship, gritted her teeth.

'Damn bastard. I thought he was a sucker, but he was sharp.'

It was the type of play she hated most.

As Shirone's party hid in the boxes, the crew covered them and nailed them shut.

"Departure in 10 minutes."

After the crew member left, Pena complained.

"This is stuffy. Do we really have to do this? Royal capital entry would be enough."

Iruki said:

"This might also be part of the bribery program. Anyway, the captain needs to be nearby to meet the organization of darkness."

A buzzer sounded and they felt the ship rock briefly on the waves.

The next moment, brilliant multicolored lights began racing before Shirone's party's eyes.

'Spatial movement.'

When the light disappeared, Shirone knew they had reached their destination and asked his companions:

"Everyone alive?"

"Yeah. But do we have to stay like this? Can't we break out?"

"I don't know. But since they said it's stowaway..."

Then the door opened and workers began unloading cargo.

"Stay quiet. If we're caught, it's over." Unlike in Corcorath, the crew members' voices were clearly tense.

After unloading all the cargo, the workers separately loaded the box where Shirone's party was hiding onto a cart and moved it to a secluded part of the harbor. The worker who removed the nails knocked on the box twice.

"Tomorrow morning."

After leaving these cryptic words, they departed, and Shirone's party slowly opened the lid.

Nade grumbled:

"Ugh, it stinks of fish. Was there fish in here or something?"

While everyone shared their brief travel experiences, only Pena remained silent.

"What's wrong?"

"This is... Parme?"

Except for rookies, the capital was the place most players visiting Melkidu frequented, and she had often stayed there for various reasons, but this was her first time at the harbor.

"No, I didn't even know there was a harbor. I've never heard of it from other players either. Are we really in the right place?"

"Probably."

Shirone, who had gotten out of the box, said:

"It's probably a zone that can only be reached by stowaway. In other words, this is the managers' world. So Pena, how far have you been in Parme?"

"Everywhere. I know the capital's geography inside and out."

Something occurred to her as she looked at Shirone.

"All spaces in Melkidu are blocked by sections. You know? Invisible walls. But there's just one place that's different. The castle walls. I thought they were just background scenery, but..."

"There could be a harbor behind the castle."

Shirone looked around. Darkness lay thick over the sea, and lights were on in several moored ships.

"This must be the system's intermediate layer." Shirone concluded.

"All kinds of materials needed for Melkidu move through this intermediate layer. Thinking about it that way, stowaway might allow access to any section."

Iruki said:

"Hmm, so the external and internal tracks weren't separate spaces after all. The government buildings in towns - the space inside those doors was the internal track. Not space, but layers of authority, you could say?"

Eden said:

"If Mr. Curtis had been imprisoned in another city's prison instead of the castle, we would have arrived inside government offices too. Managers' quarters, or warehouses where items are stored."

Nade said:

"That's really dangerous, isn't it? Plus, this is the capital with the most material supply. We could steal items, and there are probably high-ranking managers here too." Shirone said:

"Right. In Melkidu where any crime becomes innocent, we've committed another crime."

"We're finished the moment we're caught."

It wouldn't end with just being imprisoned.

Nade's eyes crinkled with amusement.

"But we have some time until morning, right?"

"No, what are you..."

While Pena looked dazed, Iruki chuckled.

"Looking around wouldn't be bad. There might be unreleased items or things that were scrapped due to censorship. How about it, Shirone?"

Since it seemed like more crime points than expected would be needed, it seemed worth the risk, but actually his curiosity about examining the system's intermediate layer was stronger.

"Alright. Let's try it just until morning."

As the three got up to leave, Pena was terrified.

"Hey, are you really going through with this? What if we get caught?"

"It's no use. They've been famous since school days."

Eden followed behind, shaking her head.

"Once they're hooked on something, they see it through to the end." The five stowaways disappeared into the harbor's darkness.

In dreams, time is determined by the quality and quantity of information, and during Miro and Ymir's battle, Shirone also absorbed the massive data of the War God's Dream.

"Gasp!"

Armand, who had entered the river to save Yorahan, swam with all her might.

Though the Microcosm Manipulation told her Yorahan's exact location, the strong current had already carried him quite far.

'Humans can't hold their breath for long.'

Moreover, the shock of falling into the water would have consumed most of his oxygen, so time was running short.

'River, give him to me.'

The center of the river reversed its flow, and Yorahan's body came into Armand's arms.

She quickly rose to the surface and pulled Yorahan out while gasping for breath.

"Ugh!"

The moment she connected through Microcosm Manipulation, Armand grimaced at the pain of oxygen deprivation.

'He's dying.' Thinking of words she hadn't yet said to him, Armand attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Since synchronizing with inanimate objects was much easier for her, it was actually fortunate that Yorahan was unconscious.

His lungs pumped regardless of their owner's will, expelling large amounts of water.

And the moment she pressed her lips to his again:

"Cough! Cough!"

Yorahan coughed and his upper body convulsed.

"Ah?..."

As his vision gradually cleared, he saw Armand's face.

'She's beautiful.'

*Smack* - a sound came from his forehead and stars flashed before his eyes.

"Ow! Why did you hit me!"

As he shouted despite lacking the strength to get up, Armand's eyes blazed.

"Honestly, humans! I saved you from death and that's the first thing you think?"

"No, well..."

What could he do about having such thoughts?

"Anyway, if you're alive, get up quickly. We need to get back before it gets dark."

It wasn't that she feared darkness particularly, but she had an instinctive feeling that spending the night with Yorahan would be problematic.

"Ugh!"

Yorahan, who had been trying to sit up halfway, collapsed again.

"Sorry. I can't manage it right now. I don't even have the strength to stand."

Understanding Yorahan's condition, Armand sighed in resignation.

Since she had manipulated his internal organs while he was unconscious, he probably felt like he'd been beaten with a hammer.

"Ugh, really."

Two hours later, a campfire blazed beside the river where the sun had completely set.

Yorahan had cleaned the fish Armand caught and skewered them on branches.

"There, done."

Since their wet clothes were drying, Armand sat in a corner with just a blanket covering her body.

"I hate fire."

That was natural for a fire tribe member.

'Right, even though they're carnivorous, they ate raw food.'

On the other hand, since Yorahan was human, there was no reason to refuse grilling the fish.

"Still, come a bit closer. You need to warm your body."

When Armand gave him a suspicious look, Yorahan got scared.

"No, I'm worried you'll catch cold. Sorry." They were two people who had briefly shared each other's hearts through Microcosm Manipulation.

'This awkwardness is killing me.'

Having had his feelings exposed, he couldn't deny them.

The fish browning nicely was the only place he could rest his gaze.

"Hmm?"

At the sound of footsteps, he looked up to see Armand walking over, clutching her blanket.

"Looks delicious. Let's eat." The moment he saw her figure illuminated by the campfire, Yorahan realized:

'It's this person.'

Flowers were blooming in his heart too.
