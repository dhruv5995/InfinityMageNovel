Iron Extreme (3)

"Veron."

Shirone knows.

The history of how a toad that gained enlightenment just before being eaten by a snake came to possess a human incarnation.

The question he harbored in the final moment of eternal life was...

"Can the future be changed through human will?"

The Veron Problem.

If the iron core of thought is embedded, one might be able to find the home of the heart in infinite universes.

"Thank you."

Shirone said.

"But I can't do it. No, it's impossible. I'm no longer Yahweh."

Tachyon is the inverse concept of Hexa.

"Yes. After Amy died, I lost my universal love. But now it's not just Amy who's dead. They say 99 percent of humanity has disappeared. Our parents too."

The reason he hadn't mentioned it was because everyone here had lost someone they loved.

"If it's the same universe, that is, if the space is the same, I could meet the Amy I love. But even so, nothing would change. I wouldn't be able to come to this place."

Adam said.

"Because the time periods are different."

"That's right. From the moment I save Amy, the universe will split again and go to a different world. Then the result of humanity's destruction in this time and space won't change. That means I can't have universal love either, and consequently..."

Shirone said gloomily.

"Because I'm not Yahweh, I can't even reverse causality in the first place."

Silence flowed.

"You guys are mistaken about something. The multiverse is a phase coordinate with infinite space and infinite time. Countless versions of me making countless choices at the same time period live in different universes, and there are countless versions of me connected from past to future in the same space. Veron's Iron Extreme only solves the space problem. Even if I go back to the past and save Amy, the present won't change."

Though Shirone, who was speaking, must be in the most pain, surprisingly the group didn't have serious expressions.

When Shirone blinked, Nade grinned.

"I knew you'd say that. Did you think we hadn't considered the time paradox? We know that going back to the past can't change the future of the same universe."

"What?"

Fermi said.

"First, we fix the spatial coordinates with Iron Extreme."

Shirone's head slowly turned.

"Then the remaining problem is the countless time periods in the same space. If the past can't change the future, then we just need to merge all the past and future into the present."

"Wait, how is that..." Shirone stopped speaking.

"Ah."

"Right. Time Explosion."

Fermi said.

"From the point when you save Amy to our current point in time, we'll blow up all the time barriers in between. Then you and us won't exist in past and future, but as one present existing in the same time period."

The time paradox would be solved.

"But..."

Shirone's words became urgent.

"Time Explosion was integrated into the 11th sense, wasn't it? No, even if we somehow manage it, without Tachyon we can't avoid God's law. We can't handle two realms simultaneously."

"Depreciation transaction contract."

Fermi held out a document.

"The reason I like this ability is because I can adjust the contract conditions. This is sometimes much more important than deciding which magic to lease. Anyway, your signature agreeing to transfer Time Vibration is written here very accurately. You can check if you want."

Shirone had no memory of it.

"Depreciation transactions can only lease magic with profits gained from abilities. I thought I was going to die trying to match the amount. I'll leave the transaction cost to your imagination."

The joke didn't register.

"Anyway, it can be exchanged for chips anytime. More precisely, it means I can bring you to the present."

"Fermi..."

"It was a hypothesis at first."

He hated overly sweet atmospheres.

"Actually, I didn't think you'd be persuaded by me either. Without a concrete plan like now, it was all just a concept about how to deceive God. Amy could have truly died. In an irreversible state."

"Then why?"

Why had he agreed to the transaction?

"You said you'd trust me. You did."

"Honestly, I didn't expect you to say that. Even after wrestling with you for days, we couldn't find a solution. Whether you were that desperate, or whether you really thought highly of me, I don't know, but..."

Fermi smiled bitterly.

"I was so burdened that my blood ran dry. For the first time in my life, I made a losing deal."

"You..."

Feeling Shirone's voice tremble, Fermi clapped his hands to change the mood.

"Now, so it's my turn to answer. If you save Amy in the same space, I'll pull you into the same time. Then what happens?"

Fermi made a snapping sound with his hand and mimicked what Shirone had said earlier.

"Poof, and Amy appears."

It's reality.

"Huh..."

A sob leaked out.

"Then you'll be Yahweh again, and you'll see civilization that was scattered as dust rise up like magic. The 99 percent of humanity that was sacrificed will also come alive in our reality, riding the sudden flow of time waves. How's that, is this enough?"

My most demanding customer in the world.

"Really..."

Tears poured from Shirone's eyes.

"Can I save Amy? Can I... can I really meet Amy again?"

Nade smiled.

"We're changing the future, Shirone. Let's give a blow to the God who looked down on us."

After bowing his head and sobbing for a moment, light burst from Shirone's body.

Hexa.

Miracle Stream.

When he raised his head again, there was no trace of defeat in Shirone's eyes.

"I'll do it. I'll definitely save Amy."

A fight solely for himself.

But ultimately, Shirone's victory would save all of humanity, so Fermi was right.

Nade smiled wryly.

'Just how far ahead does he see?'

Remembering their school days, he was still annoying, but he could understand Seriel's feelings.

'But I really had no idea those two were in that kind of relationship. I'll have to ask Amy about it later.'

Fermi said.

"Then shall we start the briefing?"

Iruki sat across the table from Ranstin and Linn, sipping tea.

'Surprisingly not arrogant.'

Rather, he was just looking down with a somewhat withdrawn posture.

'Indifference.'

A signal saying he'd gladly lose any power struggle, so please don't interfere with his life.

'This won't be easy.'

To Iruki, artists were like strange neighbors living in the same building.

You think you know about that person, but actually know nothing.

He decided to start from there.

"I heard you parted with your daughter long ago."

Killing intent.

An aura rivaling Gaold's swirled, but he had succeeded in opening the door anyway.

"It was a cold."

Ranstin spoke for the first time.

"A trivial illness. She was originally a bit sick. Well, it was probably because of me. All the bad things are because of me."

"Couldn't you go to the hospital?"

"...I was in the workshop. Probably playing guitar. She liked playing guitar."

He put thorns in his last words.

As if he would desperately defend that alone from being broken by anyone.

'Does he really not remember?'

According to reports, at the time he had been beaten by loan sharks while trying to borrow money.

"I won't do it."

Ranstin continued.

"For saving me, I should say thank you. But it doesn't matter. I won't do anything."

"Mr. Ranstin."

"I'm not an assassin for hire. I do kill people, but I've never been paid for it. I don't know. I don't want to think about it. Just let me go back."

"We're not asking you to kill people."

Linn raised his head.

He had assumed the leader of humanity would ask him to eliminate someone anyway.

"It's something much more difficult than that. Only you can do it. If you can't accomplish it, everyone dies."

Ranstin didn't seem displeased.

Whether it was because everyone would die, or because only he could do it, was unclear.

"Do I just need to play guitar?"

"Your ability,死文 (Death Scripture). It changes bio-waves to cause death. I understand its power increases the more subjects there are."

"So?"

"In 8 hours, a disaster called Cell Buster will occur in the Arctic. A species called Anti-Cell will bond with humans, reducing cells until they reach zero."

Linn's eyes widened.

"Wow."

Iruki said.

"Please postpone that disaster for 7 days."

"Postpone?"

Not destroy it?

"You probably can't stop it with Death Scripture. It's an unsolvable code. Kill one and it becomes two, destroy two and it multiplies to four again."

Just like that... 7 days.

"You call me here just to tell me to die?"

"It's humanity's last chance. The lifeline of this planet is in your hands."

"That's not important."

Ranstin continued.

"What's important is being the last guitarist. Whether the world ends or not doesn't matter."

"That's not necessarily true either. If you save all of humanity, wouldn't your daughter be happy too?"

"Heh."

The first smile he showed was like a sneer, so Iruki said no more.

'I don't understand.'

He was indeed a strange neighbor after all.

Fermi said.

"Even though we've solved the time paradox, it's actually more complicated because of that. Events that happen in the past will affect the future. If you touch any event other than Amy, everything in the present could change."

"That's pretty tricky."

He had no right to complain, but his opponent in the fight over causality was none other than God.

"History must be maintained. To solve this problem, we need three things. First, a blueprint containing the entire history of humanity. Second, the ability to calculate that history. Third, an execution team to enforce the calculated history."

It wasn't just tricky.

"And."

Fermi said.

"We have all three of these things."

Shirone was listening.

"First, a blueprint containing the entire history of humanity. Uorin has this. Second, the ability to calculate that history. This is possible through the combination of Richard and the Holy Brain. And third, the 12 Apostles will handle maintaining existing history regardless of your actions."

"Messiah."

The 12 Apostles emerged from the darkness.

"You guys..." Shirone asked.

"What have you been doing hiding there all this time?"

Asriker approached.

"The Messiah we serve is the Yahweh of the era. There was no reason to speak to one who had lost his realm."

When Shirone's eyes filled with sadness, Asriker looked back at his companions in confusion.

"It's, it's a joke."

Poison Dragon Poine said.

"Anyway, since you've regained your realm, congratulations. Fight to your heart's content. We'll protect history."

'Right, these are...'

The Apostles of Time.

They were the ones who had perfectly protected humanity's history against Ankera's three resets.
