[774] Gong's Doubt (4)

"Uuuugh."

How much time had passed?

Starting with the groaning of Arius, blood flowing from his ears, his senses began to return.

"Huu."

His entire body ached as if he'd been beaten.

'What about Miro?'

But there was no time to check his condition. As soon as Sein regained his sight, he immediately surveyed the battlefield.

As if revealing the form of the impact, dozens of peaks that had been around them were carved away in a circular shape.

"Buddha!"

As the reverse cross that had been assembled into a sphere came undone, Shura was the first to kick off and dash out.

"We're going too."

Though Arius couldn't hear, he realized Sein was leaving and immediately followed.

Shura had stopped at a peak 400 meters away from the battlefield, checking the ground.

Sein felt anxious.

'Why?'

When he arrived beside Shura, his anxiety became reality.

'Truly... is he a god?'

Nane stood before Miro, who was kneeling in a state of deep meditation.

"If I didn't have the great undertaking as my long-cherished wish..."

Blood flowed from his torn lips, but there seemed to be no shock in his calm expression.

"I would have offered you praise."

"......"

Miro couldn't hear.

Looking at her with shoulders drooped and head bowed, Nane extended his hand.

"Sermon, Shout."

A blue sword shot out, soaring into the sky before becoming a bolt of lightning that struck the crown of her head.

Miro, who had trembled briefly, slowly opened her eyes.

"Kill me."

It wasn't words of resignation, but she was truly exhausted to the point where she couldn't move a finger.

"It was a hair's breadth difference."

At the supreme level, the smallest cause could split results to opposite extremes.

"Perhaps you might have achieved your goal."

Miro sneered.

"Are you pitying me? You're not a god either."

"That's right. But I'm a little further from human."

It was an undeniable defeat.

"An impurity smaller than a speck. Why didn't you discard it? What keeps you bound to humanity?"

Nane wanted to hear.

"Kill me."

But Miro simply closed her eyes quietly and waited for death, as if she had no intention of speaking.

"...Sermon, Kill."

Twelve red swords shot out from behind Nane, curving like claws toward Miro.

"There will be no pain."

The killing intent that seemed ready to pierce through Miro's body reached even Sein, 400 meters away.

"No. We have to rescue her now..."

"It's already too late."

Shura didn't smile before the destruction of Avalokitesvara.

"The one closest to Buddha has knelt. No one can surpass Buddha's time."

The moment Sein launched his body was the moment Nane's sermon would pierce Miro's body.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

In the end, he couldn't move even a step, only able to delay Miro's death by the slightest bit.

Nane didn't wait.

"It's over."

The twelve swords shot toward Miro.

Just as Sein and Arius's hearts crouched, preparing for one powerful beat.

"Fosmetery."

A brilliantly shining giant bird wrapped around Miro and soared into the sky.

As Miro disappeared to another dimension, Nane's sermon couldn't contain its killing intent and exploded itself.

"Zulu's summon?"

Sein, who hastily looked around, found Miro moved to a spot dozens of meters away from Nane.

"In the end... you followed?"

Zulu and Gangnan were sitting on Kaydra, and on the ground, Gaold stood holding Miro.

"Now!"

As Sein and Arius cast spatial movement toward Kaydra, Shura also clicked his tongue and flew toward Nane.

Miro opened her eyes to a strange sensation.

'What?'

Information that she was still breathing and that she was being held in someone's arms entered simultaneously.

"......"

The moment she confirmed Gaold's face, her mind reeled and curses spilled out.

"Damn it."

Gaold smiled bitterly.

"It's been a while."

That was the end of their reunion greeting, and Gaold turned his head back toward Nane.

"Is that Buddha? He certainly gave you trouble."

Miro gritted her teeth.

"Put me down. Why did you come here? This has nothing to do with you anymore."

The exhausted Miro could barely move on her own, so Sein approached and supported her.

"Gaold, you..."

"Later. Let's do this later."

At the different atmosphere, Sein closed his mouth.

'Well, I suppose it's natural? He's experienced that terrible hell twice and returned.'

As Gaold was absorbed in examining Nane, only then did Miro sneak a glance at his face.

'You've gotten so thin.'

All the muscles that had been trained through endless battles were gone, leaving only scars.

'This is really the worst reunion.'

Though she had resolved there wouldn't be a second time, once again she found herself indebted to Gaold for her life.

'Lady Miro.'

Arius crouched beside Miro's legs, rejoicing at his master's safe return, and bowed his head.

'I can feel your heart beating fast.'

The diver who had penetrated Miro's mind.

Arius knew the only trauma carved into her nearly perfect psyche.

'Mikea Gaold.'

A name she couldn't bear to abandon.

"Let's go back. We've stopped the journey to heaven for now, so at Zion we can plan our next..."

Gaold asked.

"Why is Buddha trying to kill Miro?"

Sein furrowed his brow.

"What exactly do you know? There's no time for detailed explanations. Just cooperate in getting Miro to safety."

"Fine. I'll just ask directly."

Gaold walked toward Nane.

"You idiot! You don't understand the current situation...!"

Since getting angry wouldn't solve the situation, Sein swallowed his anger and spoke to Gangnan.

"Go quickly and bring him back. At this rate, that guy will really die."

Zulu answered.

"If we could stop him, we wouldn't have come this far."

"Then he'll die."

Zulu watched Gaold's retreating back.

"For Gaold, reality is terrible pain. But he broke through hell twice and returned."

The atmosphere became solemn.

"We don't know what pain Gaold suffered. So we have no right to stop him."

"Buy me time."

Miro moved away from Sein as she spoke.

"If you wait a little, my mind will recover. I'll take him and run. Just protect Gaold until then."

It was their last resort.

Sein clicked his tongue and turned toward Nane.

"Tch, troublesome to the end..."

Nane's eyes lit up as he watched Gaold.

"Shura."

"Yes."

"Stay back. As far as possible."

"What?"

Though he asked back, no answer came.

"Understood."

Even after Shura left, Nane calmly waited for Gaold to approach.

'It's like seeing my former self.'

Nane had become Buddha by experiencing all the world's pain and offering his body in hell.

"An ascetic?"

Gaold thought it wasn't worth answering.

"What's your reason for trying to kill Miro?"

"To close this world."

"Why this world? Did it do something wrong to you?"

"Pain."

Nane pointed his index finger at Gaold.

"And you are the one who understands this world. How about joining me now to break the chains of worldly desires?"

"I understand this world?"

Gaold stepped forward, twisted his waist, and struck Nane's face with a full swing.

"How would I know that, you bastard!"

Sein's eyes widened in disbelief.

"That crazy fool...!"

When Nane turned his head back, Gaold was approaching with eyes rolled back, stomping heavily.

"Did you learn some Buddhism somewhere? Buddha or not, what do you know about me to be babbling?"

'It's Gaold!'

At the sight of his old temperament showing exactly as before, Sein looked back at his companions.

"It's starting! Everyone prepare!"

Miro shouted.

"Wait!"

As Gaold's Air Press crushed the atmosphere, the ground shook up and down like a rubber sheet.

"Uaaahhhhh!"

Blood flowed from both eyes of Gaold as he bent his ten fingers and let out a beast-like cry.

"Th-that..."

At the sight of Nane unable to move, crushed by atmospheric pressure, Gangnan's face turned pale.

'Just how painful is it?'

Pain sensitivity increased by 1 trillion times.

The threshold of Gaold, who had returned from hell for the second time, was much higher than before.

'This kind of pain?'

Wonder filled Nane's eyes.

'But why doesn't he die?'

Zulu said.

"He should have died already normally. But Gaold didn't die. Once something like that happens..."

It just happened.

"So now he can't even die."

Gaold, whose hair had turned completely white, approached Nane with bloody tears.

"Should I tell you what real pain is?"

He wasn't in his right mind.

"You can't endure it. You just suffer through it."

"Sermon, Break."

The sword of light born above Nane's head vibrated, shaking the atmosphere that had become hard as steel.

"No! Quickly get Gaold...!"

Just as Miro was shouting.

"Trapped in a narrow body, pathetically screaming - that's all there is. And yet someone like you..."

Unable to bear the pain, Gaold let out a beast-like cry and stomped the ground with both feet.

"Speaks of pain!"

Pain sensitivity 10 trillion times.

"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"

Pain sensitivity 100 trillion times.

"Foolish sentient being!"

Nane raised the power of his sermon to its limit.

"I shall erase your pain!"

"Uaaahhhhh! Uaaahhhhh!"

His consciousness had already fled, and only the thought of pain remained in his head.

'Pain sensitivity quadrillion times! Quintillion times! Sextillion times! Damn it!'

Where in the world does such a thing exist?

'No matter how much you scream and rage from pain...'

How could someone else feel it?

The greatest pain in the world is the suffering one experiences oneself, so the weight of pain is the same for everyone.

'Still, we live on.'

Knowing it will never change, yet hoping that tomorrow might be a better day than today.

'Gritting our teeth!'

The desire to live to the end - that's life.

"Just because you've done some petty asceticism..."

These were words only Gaold could utter.

"You dare speak of others' pain!"

Pain sensitivity 1 quintillion times.

First, dozens of high peaks around them collapsed as if pouring down, crushed to the horizon.

'Ah, I see.'

In that fleeting moment when astronomical friction was at work, Nane realized.

'That's why you couldn't cry.'

In the time when heat that could melt any substance expanded the atmosphere, tears flowed down Nane's cheeks.

KWAAAAANG!

Jungcheon-dong exploded.

"Kyaaahhhhh!"

Taeseong's scream echoed through Daeji Temple.

'Another one has transcended ten thousand.'

Even with her eyes wide from shock, countless thoughts crossed her mind.

'What breaks the world's balance...'

Is ultimately human.

The monks' holy land disappeared from the map.

"Good heavens..."

The Jungcheon-dong that Shura looked down upon was in a state where only a crater remained, as if a god had scooped out the earth with a spoon.

Gangnan, who had absorbed the heat, coughed.

"Cough! Cough!"

If Miro hadn't poured out all her mental power to fly up, they would have all melted.

"Are they even alive?"

Zulu pointed to the center of the crater.

"They're there."

The faces of those examining the ground turned deathly pale.

"N-Nane is..."

At Gaold's feet as he looked down, Nane lay sprawled out, repeatedly spitting blood.

"He collapsed?"

While they couldn't properly grasp reality even seeing it with their eyes, only Miro faced the truth.

'Gaold, you...'

Had broken Buddha.
