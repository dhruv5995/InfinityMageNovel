The Five Great Systems (3)

When Rian's greatsword unleashed a thunderous roar, the Satan Cult's assembly hall was reduced to ashes.

Shiok couldn't believe it.

"Why isn't the hidden code working?"

Ten copies of Shiok activated their abilities simultaneously, but Rian's movements showed no hesitation.

"No, it did work."

The evidence was clear—he was shedding bloody tears with his face contorted like a demon. To him now, Shirone was the enemy who had slaughtered his family, the villain who had tortured everyone he loved.

"It worked, but it doesn't matter."

Rian's gaze was fixed solely on Shiok.

"I am Shirone's sword."

No matter how Shirone might change, keeping the oath he had made to himself was what it meant to be a knight.

The 3 o'clock of Obsession spoke.

"...Are you an idiot?"

When the greatsword struck the ground, a shockwave rushed forward at an unreactable speed.

The 1 o'clock of Pride reversed the choice to change Shiok's position, but the chills remained.

'If even an idiot has that much talent... This will mess up our plans. I'd rather have Yahweh—'

She glanced to the side.

Even as Rian fought desperately, Shirone still held his position.

Lete and the other Company executives surrounded him with murderous intent.

Shirone asked coldly.

"You want to fight?"

"As I said, our first principle is negotiation. But we cannot lose Shiok."

Of course, what she truly wanted lay much deeper.

'I need to buy time until the ancient civilization opens. There isn't much left now.'

The moment they connected to the outside world, the administrator's authority would become even stronger.

'Satan will handle it. If we suppress Yahweh in reality, nothing can stop the OOPArts.'

The OOPArts referred to Kitra, the King of Paras.

Benistoff said:

"Make your decision now. If you comply with our conditions, neither of us will need to scowl."

Shirone looked around at the Company's board of directors.

'These are administrators.'

Unlike demons, Agape's heart would deliver no shock to them.

'Force against force.'

Hexa's performance, stripped of Agape's emotions, blazed around Shirone like flames.

Lete's eyes turned cold.

"So you truly cannot compromise? How foolish. Is fighting demons all that Yahweh amounts to?"

"The foolish one is you."

Strength entered Shirone's eyes.

"Release Jinseong."

"I told you that's impossible. She cannot become like Shiok. You understood that yourself."

"You can purify the Six Brains. Isn't that right?"

For the first time, Lete's eyes wavered.

"Of course, Limbo would have no karma. But that also means they could purify themselves at any time."

The agents' faces twisted frightfully.

"What prevents that is their obsession with life. If the true nature of the Six Brains is the resentment of falling into hell without even experiencing the joy of birth, then we just need to resolve that resentment."

"...How?"

Lete asked.

"You know, don't you? Logic doesn't work on Limbo. Persuasion is impossible by any method. They don't even know what resentment is. There's only a massive obsession that cannot be explained in words. I haven't lied to you."

"That's right. But you haven't told the truth either."

This was the identity of the lukewarm, unsettling feeling that had remained in Shirone's mind.

"You know the method to purify the Six Brains, don't you?"

"I don't know."

Lete's lips trembled violently.

"Tell me."

She couldn't reveal it.

If the Six Brains—the central processing unit—were purified, all karma in the Other World would be reset.

'Demons cannot survive in such a world.'

In real-world terms, it would be like the sun, the source of all life, suddenly disappearing.

"I'm telling you clearly, there is no such method. But if you absolutely must hear it..."

Hellfire blazed in Lete's hands.

"I'll tell your corpse."

As purple flames entered the agents' eyes, a thunderous roar erupted from the 12th floor.

It was the sound of Rian pursuing Shiok.

Perfume containing Shagal's memories spread thickly through the Karma Management Department's sealed room.

Ethella, connected by chains of Taiji, traced through memories as if she were Shagal.

'Why Archbishop Raphael?'

Ethella had met him when she was about seven years old, when she was suffering from overflow.

She had no specific memories.

Only the image of falling into deep darkness, and a somewhat cynical child came to mind.

Raphael in the memory asked:

"Your name is...?"

"It's Shagal. Unless it's a special case, orphans are named after the place where they're found."

"I see."

Raphael, receiving the child, carefully examined Shagal, who was staring blankly with open eyes.

"This child... his eyes?"

"Yes, there's almost no light response. His vision was probably damaged by sunlight. He shows slight reactions, but the doctor said he'll eventually go completely blind."

Ethella looked back at Shagal.

'What?'

Blind?

Shagal, who also seemed unaware, looked confused as he fell into thought.

'I can't see? That can't be. Then what have I been seeing all this time?'

He knew Tia, but couldn't clearly picture what she looked like.

Perhaps Ethella's face too.

'I was...?'

Had he been seeing scents?

The answer to his question came through Raphael's mouth in the perfume of events.

When Shagal was about four years old, he could walk around regardless of any obstacles.

With a schema even clearer than normal people, the child could perform impossible acrobatics.

"Remarkable."

Raphael, who was his dedicated priest at the time, also couldn't close his mouth after realizing Shagal's secret.

'Instead of being able to see the world, he looked deeper into his own body. Of course, he has natural talent too. His parents probably had considerable physical abilities.'

The only minor issue was that unlike ordinary people, he sniffed constantly when walking.

'Should I tell him?'

The fact that he couldn't see.

'I don't know. That child thinks he sees just like everyone else. He even focuses his eyes correctly.'

It was the power of sensory schema.

'Truly an amazing sense of smell. He can extract information from particles of matter.'

Raphael made his decision.

'Not now.'

Someday he would have to reveal the truth, but he didn't want to wound the child's heart at such a young age.

Besides, no one at Karcis Monastery knew that Shagal was blind.

Raphael smiled.

"Shagal, let's go inside. You need to eat."

"Yes!"

Shagal's face as he ran to his father-like teacher was as bright as any child's.

Those were happy times.

And the perfume containing vast amounts of time stirred seven-year-old memories in Shagal.

"Hello. I'm Romy Ethella."

A expressionless child wearing large glasses bowed to the priests.

The real Ethella inhaled more of the scent.

'That child... is me.'

At seven years old, she had fallen into overflow and received help from the Karcis Order.

The priests welcomed her with kind smiles.

"So you're Ethella. We've heard a lot about you. Don't worry too much. You have natural talent. You'll be able to become an excellent mage."

Shagal, who was hiding behind a pillar in the hall and peeking, made his lips round.

'Oh, a mage.'

Though interesting to young Shagal, what drew his attention more was Ethella.

'Pretty.'

That must have been her scent.

A few days later, Raphael called the two of them.

"The Yin-Yang Wave Fist is a powerful weapon that can fight the world's evil. The proper training age is ten, but Shagal could start now. And Ethella..."

Raphael looked at Ethella.

"Won't you learn too? You're the same age as Shagal, and physical training will help you overcome overflow."

'Learn martial arts?'

Though her goal was to become a mage, she wasn't in a position to be picky if it could help overcome overflow.

"Yes. I'll work hard."

Class began.

"First, hold each other's hand and pull and push. You can treat it as fun at first. What's important is learning how to use force."

Unlike Shagal, whose heart was pounding, Ethella showed no particular interest.

'He's not an adult, just another seven-year-old. There's no difference in muscle strength. I can easily win.'

Her competitors had always been adults.

"Huh?"

The moment Shagal moved, strength seemed to drain from her body.

It felt like she had lost control of her body.

'It feels like my strength is being sucked away. How is this possible? I shouldn't lose in terms of senses.'

That was her mistake.

'He far surpasses my senses.'

When her competitive spirit activated and she defended with all her might, the training continued for over ten minutes.

'Excellent talents.'

Raphael was pleased.

'Shagal's physical abilities are truly superhuman. But Ethella also has the balance of mind, energy, and body.'

The moment Ethella gritted her teeth and thrust her body forward, Shagal also sensed the conclusion.

'Here I'll reverse the force—'

At that moment, seeing Ethella's face approaching, Shagal was entranced.

'This is Ethella.'

Sniff. Sniff.

The moment he put his nose to her neck and smelled, Ethella startled and pushed him away.

"What are you doing!"

Shagal fell on his bottom with a thud, and she shouted, unable to contain her anger.

"You absolute scoundrel! Doing such things in a sacred training ground! Do you call yourself a monk?"

"I, I was just looking because you were so pretty..."

"Who in the world does such things just because someone's pretty? Even if you don't have parents..."

"Ethella!"

At Raphael's shout, Ethella flinched, but her irritation didn't easily subside.

"I'm leaving."

As she left, Raphael approached the crying Shagal.

"Are you alright?"

"I hate Ethella. She has parents and lives well. She doesn't want to be friends with me."

"You must understand. Ethella is going through a confusing time. An adult mind has entered a child's body."

"No. Ethella doesn't know. What it means to be an orphan. I would never act like that."

"Shagal, all humans make mistakes. Countless mistakes they don't even know about. Yet the reason you can think that way..."

Raphael said kindly.

"Isn't it because someone has already forgiven you?"

Shagal trembled.

'Why?'

Why was Archbishop Raphael saying the exact same thing as Raiden, the leader of the Grass Leaf Circus?

Ethella looked at Shagal.

'I said such things? That can't be. I don't even remember Shagal.'

No, perhaps...

'I might have truly forgotten.'

We all live within countless acts of forgiveness that we don't even know about.

"Ethella, I'm sorry."

Shagal kept apologizing in front of the door.

"Please stop being angry. Let's train together again like before. Okay? I won't look at you like that anymore."

No answer came, and Shagal sadly lowered his head and turned around.

And that was the last time.

The Great Purification.

A new universe began, and it became the day after Shagal and Ethella's fight.

Of course, Shagal wasn't there.

Ethella, who was training the Yin-Yang Wave Fist, asked Raphael, who was looking up at the sky.

"Master, what's wrong? You look troubled."

"I don't know."

His chest ached for no reason.

"It feels like something very precious has left our side. But... I don't know what it was."

The perfume of underlying events, powerful déjà vu.

'What am I missing? Someone should definitely be by my side...'

How had the world changed?
