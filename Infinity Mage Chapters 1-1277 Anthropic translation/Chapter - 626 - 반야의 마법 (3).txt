[626] Wisdom's Magic (3)

White radiance swallowed the coliseum's landscape, leaving the audience unable to see anything.

Only the analysts connected to the main system could observe the battlefield through code.

"That's Ataraxia."

It was Shirone's signature wide-area projectile magic, so iconic it had even been featured in Spirit Magazine.

"Impact force?"

"Approximately 18 million crashes."

Though this was seven times higher than Ataraxia's photon cannon from the physical department, the situation was beyond being surprised by numbers anymore.

The flash disappeared and the audience's eyes moved busily, scanning the vast coliseum battlefield.

"It's ambiguous."

Most participants had gathered at the edges of the coliseum, with only Eden standing in the center, deploying Absolute Barrier.

"Haaah!"

Though she had blocked Ataraxia's photon cannon in Scramble Royale before, the 2000th exam had no pushback judgment.

"It hit her straight on."

She had succeeded in splitting the high-output mass wave using her own body as a blade, but the impact was beyond what she could withstand.

"Check the parameters."

"Mental strength has dropped to 2 percent. That was close. Unfortunately for Shirone."

"No. She seemed to know."

As Baikal finished speaking, Shirone advanced and cast photon cannon.

'None of them are weak.'

Without obsessing over fighting everyone, she put all her effort into defeating only the enemy before her.

'I'll eliminate Eden first!'

Stepping up steadily like that was the only path to the pyramid's summit.

"Hup!"

Eden deployed a localized barrier and tilted the angle, causing the photon cannon's flash to deflect diagonally.

"Good choice. Lowering the angle has the same effect as increasing the barrier's thickness."

'Then...!'

Looking at the participants charging from behind Eden, Shirone compressed a photon cannon in her right hand.

"Hyaaaah!"

The sphere of light, shaking beyond the realm of vibration, stretched out through magical action.

"Projectile speed 400 meters per second!"

The photon cannon flying at supersonic speed crashed into the barrier again, making Eden's head ring.

"Kugh!"

At this speed of collision, no matter how much the slope is angled, the impact force concentrates at a point rather than dispersing.

"Eden! Attack!"

As Shirone teleported and dove into close range to cast photon cannon, Eden spread both arms.

"I lost, Shirone."

A powerful shock struck her brain, and Eden's bracelet lit up red as her Spirit Zone disappeared.

Participant number 25. Eliminated from the 2000th system.

As Eden collapsed, leaning all her weight on Shirone's shoulder, she heard Shirone's voice in her ear.

"Good work."

Her eyes slowly closed.

"Thank you."

Eden, a devout believer of the Yor religion, would be recorded as never using violence until the very end.

"Finish her now! There won't be a second chance!"

If Shirone opened Ataraxia again, this time there would be mass eliminations.

Toward the participants running from the coliseum's edge, Shirone kicked off the ground and charged forward.

As unconscious Eden collapsed to the floor, a single flash of light reached the center of the 26 remaining participants.

"You're going to fight to the end!"

As Boyle cast summoning, Gauss appeared with blue skin crackling with bluish electricity.

"Oh?"

Countless spines protruded along its backbone, and inside its jaw was a cannon-like hole instead of a tube-like tongue.

"There's a functional change visible. It's dream manipulation."

Dream manipulation, which transformed a creature's form to change its function, boasted extremely high difficulty even among summoning magic.

"First time seeing this in graduation exams."

Boyle's choice to train in dream manipulation instead of raising tiers was solely for passing the graduation exam.

"Go! Gauss!"

Kraaaah!

As Gauss spewing blue electricity swung its claws, Shirone teleported to create distance.

"Now!"

Closer's Eruption exploded in that spot and Sabina's Wind Cutter flew in.

Following that, Fire Strike, ice wave, and all 36 types of regulation magic enhanced by Suabi's buffs poured down entirely.

'Spacetime Distortion!'

The moment she escaped the radius by warping spacetime, Screamer's back kick, riding on a flash of light, struck her abdomen.

"Kugh!"

Air exploded with a bang as Shirone's body flew away.

"Got her good!"

Since Screamer's specialty was physical attacks rather than magic, once it connected, it could instantly kill any mage.

"Atmospheric pressure increase detected. It's Air Shield."

Though she avoided death by compressing air around her abdomen, she was cornered enough to use magic outside her specialty.

"Damn! So close!"

As Screamer vented his frustration, Kongger rushed forward, pulling dozens of steel wires from between her palms.

'Shirone. You're quite cute.'

Despite her feminine appearance unlike her looks, Kongger's magic was the epitome of brutality, befitting the Steel Mage.

"Fence of Death."

As she spread both arms left and right, steel wires shot out like water streams, striking toward Shirone.

If caught by steel wires with sharp barbs every 10 centimeters, she'd be shredded without a chance to resist.

"Hup!"

Shirone pulled back her waist as the steel wires curved past, grazing her abdomen.

"She dodged...!"

'You can't escape my love that easily.'

The steel wires curved like hair burning in heat, cutting past Shirone's arms and legs.

As mental shock struck her brain, Arin cast Shadow Capture to restrain Shirone's body.

"Canis! Now!"

'Authority of Darkness.'

Saw-blade-shaped darkness extending from Canis's shadow flew toward Shirone's neck.

"Graaah!"

Shirone broke Arin's magic with Diamond Armed's mental strength and cast Photon Cannon without time to dodge.

Pop pop pop pop pop BANG!

The Authority of Darkness scattered like burning paper, but Canis's lips curved in mockery instead.

"I expected as much."

Scripture of Light and Darkness

Incarnation Reversal.

The shadow outside the light barrier swelled like a balloon, then instantly penetrated through the photon cannon.

'It pierced through light?'

Shirone's body, struck by the Authority of Darkness, was pushed to the coliseum's edge while buried in shadow.

'It would be troubling if you're surprised by just this much. This is a technique I prepared solely to defeat you.'

"Is it really impossible after all..."

As Shirone was pushed back repeatedly, disappointed sighs began leaking from the audience one by one.

"Who can we blame? She brought this on herself."

Though his emotions matched the audience's, Baikal as a scout maintained cold judgment.

"It was probably her only choice. I acknowledge that. But now she'll have to acknowledge it's impossible too."

Elizabeth reported.

"Percentage has dropped to 7 percent. If she's not given time to recover, she'll be eliminated like this."

"Let's gooooo!"

Kaeden took the lead with his synthesized Cross Sword, and other participants followed, equipping their magic.

"What will you do now, number 27? If you can't show something more here, your graduation exam ends."

"Hoooo!"

As Shirone exhaled and expanded her Spirit Zone, the charging participants' eyes widened simultaneously.

"What?"

Elizabeth read the main system's changes.

"It's Slow magic."

Magic that slowed time using light acceleration was certainly marvelous, but photonization was basic among basics for mages.

"Hmph! In the end, all that's left are petty tricks!"

Without anyone taking the lead, they equipped photonization batteries, instantly returning the slowed time to normal.

'Shirone, Slow isn't used in situations like this.'

Unless striking weak points with instant magic circles like Dante, it was a tactic that would only work on ignorant bandit gangs.

"Huh?"

Suddenly the Slow was released.

As participants felt puzzled, analysts in the VIP seats felt headaches and frowned.

"Ugh!"

Hearing Elizabeth's groan, Baikal said,

"Seems you can't adapt."

The errors caused by Spacetime Distortion were delivering direct hits to the analysts' brains.

"That's part of it, but this time is different."

"Different?"

"It's not time."

Elizabeth couldn't find words to explain for a while.

"Spaces are existing simultaneously."

Spacetime Distortion

Force Dimension (4-dimensional combat space).

"What the hell is this now?"

Participants charging toward Shirone lost their minds at the phenomenon unfolding before them and hastily stopped.

Twelve Shiriones stood in different poses, each floating photon cannons above their hands.

"Illusion magic?"

Starting with the first Shirone firing a flash, photon cannons flew from all directions.

"Damn!"

As everyone threw themselves aside, Kaeden deflected light with his Cross Sword and Dante's instant magic circle collided with tremendous power.

"Kugh!"

Just from the expressions of those who defended, participants could guess what was happening here.

"They're not illusions."

All twelve Shiriones were real.

"Is such a thing possible?"

To Baikal's question, Elizabeth couldn't answer.

"This isn't a matter for a mere analyst to offer opinions on. However, numerically speaking, it appears number 27's time distortion ability has been implemented through spatial coordinates."

The only person who could provide a clear answer was Miro, who had first detected Spacetime Distortion's ability.

'Time and space are originally one system.'

When Spacetime Distortion activates, countless possibilities including past futures are manifested as golden threads.

'In that state, if another dimension is added using Slow magic's temporality...'

Things that existed only as possibilities appear overlapped on reality's coordinates.

In other words, dominating 4-dimensional space - the same mechanism Guffin used when creating Estas's upper levels.

While Slow magic's temporal energy was consumed maintaining Force Dimension, time flowed normally, but now the problem was space.

"Damn! How is this even possible!"

The intimidation of 26 people cornering 1 Shirone completely vanished before the reality of facing 12 Shiriones.

'Now I can fight more.'

Force Dimension's efficiency depended on Slow magic's level, and currently the 4-dimensional combat space Shirone dominated reached a sphere 20 meters in diameter.

Neither large nor small, but at least everyone knew fighting within this area was suicide.

"Everyone get out of here!"

As all participants retreated toward Force Dimension's perimeter, the 12 Shiriones' eyes flashed, seeking targets.

"The tide has turned!"

Having victory in sight only to retreat, even Baikal was speechless this time.

"Incarnation techniques aren't a measure of strength but of realm. So they don't show immediate effects, but..."

Miro said, following Shirone's movements.

"They have the advantage of being applicable to all magic."

'Now!'

Shirone gritted her teeth and cast photon cannon.

4-dimensional Combat Formula

Quantum Superposition.

Then the 12 Shiriones overlapped as reality in space simultaneously fired flashes toward Boyle.

"Gah!"

As concentrated impacts from all directions struck his back, tremendous shock flooded in and Boyle's body sprawled on the ground.

Participant number 17. Eliminated from the 2000th system.

Participants who barely escaped Force Dimension stared blankly at fallen Boyle.

Even in this situation, the 12 Shiriones glared at all participants from the 4-dimensional combat space.

'Damn it! How the hell are we supposed to beat something like that?'

In terms of headaches, this was worse than Infernus, who had simply poured out attacks brutishly in the first evaluation.

"All techniques mastered through countless situations integrate into the single incarnation called Spacetime Distortion."

Miro rested her chin on her hand with a pleased smile.

"Wisdom's magic begins from that point."
