[403] Final Decision (3)

After finishing the omniscience implementation evaluation, Shirone headed to the dining hall with his friends.

Although he had received a perfect score, his mind was troubled and there had been quite a few anxious moments during the test.

His friends seemed to have already noticed, as the atmosphere at the table was more subdued than usual.

Shirone wasn't in the right state of mind to worry about other people's moods.

When would Gaold contact him? No, even if contact came, what choice could he make?

Everything felt uncertain.

"Shirone, do you have some kind of worry lately? You look really bad. Are you sick or something?"

Amy put down her utensils and asked.

Even if it wasn't just Shirone, all the students were dejected, but today his face was pale to an unbearable degree.

"I'm fine. I'm just feeling a bit under the weather."

"Sometimes there are kids who can't regulate their condition before the mid-term period. I was like that last year too. Still, try to hang in there a little longer. Vacation is coming soon."

Shirone forced a smile.

Having already experienced her graduation year, Amy was probably worried seeing him waver before the 15th week milestone.

"Shirone, here's some water."

Maya personally poured water and handed it to Shirone.

She felt sorry watching him unable to eat properly, just picking at his food with his fork.

"Yeah, thanks."

Shirone readily accepted Maya's kindness.

Since he was someone who measured the distance of relationships before emotions when dealing with others, his attitude toward Maya could be considered exceptional.

Amy pouted her lower lip and watched Shirone and Maya exchange words.

Maya was a kind and bright child. So there wouldn't be anything wrong with her becoming close to Shirone.

But on the other hand, she felt strangely anxious.

It was like feeling as if her own place, which even she hadn't been aware of, was being taken away.

Shirone looked at Maya's tray and asked.

"Huh? Maya, why aren't you eating?"

"I already finished. These days I don't eat as much as I used to."

Since the end of the hill occupation evaluation, Maya had reduced her food intake.

To be precise, she had returned to the amount of food her body originally required.

Having realized she had no talent for vocal music, Maya planned to strengthen her sound magic with her original voice, following Iruki's advice.

She needed to become a mage first to have any future.

But more important than her career path was the desire that had risen in her heart.

She wanted to be loved by Shirone. She wanted to stand before him in a more beautiful form.

Just by not overeating, Maya's appearance had become noticeably prettier.

As the fat left her face, her eyes became larger and deeper, and her nose bridge came alive with freshness.

Her previously plump figure had also slimmed down, making her clothes loose, and her shoulder line had dropped down to below her arms.

Even the graduating class students couldn't openly ignore Maya like before.

In some ways it was bitter, but the human tendency to grant power to beauty seemed unavoidable.

Nade and Iruki were also glancing at Maya's changing appearance day by day with curiosity.

'She's definitely changed a lot. The face from the picture book is gradually emerging.'

The strange tension had grown stronger accordingly.

While Amy was naturally sharp-tongued, Maya was poor at hiding her emotions, so everyone knew she had fallen for Shirone.

Amy suddenly raised her voice.

"Can you even taste your food right now? Just look at today's omniscience evaluation. You almost got one problem wrong. Class Two is the stage where you compete with Class One. If you make mistakes in the first half, it becomes even harder in the second half when your stamina relatively drops. Get your head straight and focus."

Having already experienced failure in graduation exams once, Amy knew this was the most important time.

Even if all the students were dejected due to the Magic Association incident, they needed to approach it with firm goal consciousness.

Missing one meal wouldn't kill anyone.

If they didn't pull themselves together now, they would miss the biggest part of their lives.

Amy hoped Shirone wouldn't have regrets.

"Shirone, try eating this too."

Maya cut up the meat parts that Shirone liked into bite-sized pieces and placed them for him.

It was an action that seemed to block out the nagging, and there was indeed an emotional aspect to it.

As they had become close as a team, the question that arose was whether Amy truly loved Shirone.

Of course, Maya also wanted Shirone to become an excellent mage, but she thought what someone stressed enough to have nightmares needed was comfort, not advice.

'That's too much, Amy. If I were you, I'd be crazy with happiness. I could do anything Shirone asked for, yet you treat him so carelessly.'

Shirone picked up the meat Maya had served him and put it in his mouth.

She had chosen it because it was in the most edible state, but he actually didn't even know who had placed it there.

All sorts of thoughts were tangled up and his head felt like it would explode.

Had Gaold met with Alpheas?

If by any chance the National Intelligence Service got involved, continuing the evaluations like this could be dangerous.

Just as the navigation system didn't guarantee student safety, it would be foolish to entrust one's life to someone else and be optimistic.

Shirone put down his utensils with a clatter.

Since Amy and Maya's war of nerves was currently ongoing, Nade and Iruki flinched and turned around.

"Sorry. I'll head back to the dormitory first. I'm really not feeling well."

Maya immediately stood up, but Shirone left the dining hall without making eye contact with anyone.

Amy felt frustrated.

She also knew that Shirone had gone to the Association. That's why she had hoped he would tell her first.

Like when he went to heaven, like when he went to Kazura, like when he went to the old castle ruins, she had hoped he would come to her first.

'What's the reason? Why won't he tell me anything this time?'

Maya watched the door until Shirone left, then bit her upper lip and turned to look at Amy.

There was no reason to hate Amy. What made her angry was the current situation where even her own emotions seemed to require Amy's permission.

Feeling Maya's gaze, Amy looked up. Then she hurriedly turned her head away.

Sensing a more resolute will than ever in Maya's eyes, she thought what was bound to come had finally arrived.

"Amy, can you talk with me for a moment?"

Amy's heart sank.

She had thought it couldn't be, but no, she had known somewhere in her heart that this time would surely come, but when it actually arrived, her thought was 'just a little later.'

"C-can't we do it next time? I have something urgent today..."

"One minute is enough. I'll wait outside."

As Maya walked away with her tray, Amy's mind went blank. But eventually, with the sliver of reason that the future comes regardless, she stood up from her seat.

Watching Amy follow Maya as if entranced, Nade and Iruki shrugged their shoulders.

The book titled 'Seeing Darkness' inserted in the headmaster's office bookshelf automatically slid into the bookcase while tilted at a 45-degree angle.

With the sound of gears turning, a lock clicked shut from inside the closed study.

A secret place that Alpheas had designed long ago to store memories of Erina.

But now all her belongings had been moved to the annex, and the room on the 3.5th floor was empty.

Alpheas and Olivia walked down the stairs side by side.

While Alpheas wore a bitter smile, Olivia's expression was fierce beyond measure. Perhaps she even looked nervous.

"Hehe, it's been a while, old man."

Gaold, sitting cross-legged on the bare floor, raised the hand that had been supporting his chin in greeting. Flu was standing guard beside him.

"Hello. I'm Flu, a certified 8th-class mage."

"It's been a while, Flu."

At Olivia's greeting, Flu lowered his gaze.

Though he had no shame before heaven, socially he had appeared as a traitor, so he had no face to show his teacher.

'He was such a bright child, but why did he go to someone like Gaold...'

She had kept an eye on him since her days as headmaster of the Royal Magic School.

But his bright future was now blocked. No, he was a fugitive whose very survival wasn't guaranteed.

All of this was because of Gaold.

How many people was this one madman troubling and how much chaos was he bringing to society?

Gaold looked around with an interested expression.

"So this is the panic room that was only rumors. I didn't think it really existed, but anyway, the old man is quite cunning."

Alpheas skipped the small talk.

"Why have you come to see me?"

"My... A student visiting his alma mater and getting the cold shoulder. Isn't that too heartless?"

"The school has been turned upside down because of you alone. Agents have come every single day to ransack the school. If you had come just a few days earlier, everyone would have suffered."

"Hehe, even the great Alpheas has gotten old. The little ones attending here probably don't even know agents came and went, and if agents were still here, you wouldn't have let me in either."

"You know well. So I ask again. What's your reason for coming to see me?"

Gaold let out a hmm and exhaled.

If he was in a position to make a difficult request, he should lower his posture, but this damn school just didn't feel right to him.

"I'm thinking of entering Estas."

"In the end... you're going to meet Miro?"

"Hehe, well, did you think I came to retrieve something I left behind?"

"Gaold, your arbitrary actions are disturbing the world. Miro also no longer wants to meet you. She accepted everything and entered on her own."

"How do you know that, old man?"

Gaold's eyes widened.

Sensing the extreme heat, Flu squinted one eye, but Gaold only changed his facial expression menacingly without releasing killing intent.

"You know how many bastards approaching Estas I've sent to their graves. Including myself, I haven't let a single person in for 20 years. So how do you know Miro's thoughts?"

"Gaold, Miro is..."

"Enough. I'll enter Estas myself. We made it anyway. Actually, I have one more favor besides that - let me stay here for a while."

Alpheas asked in a resigned voice.

"Yes, what kind of favor are you talking about?"

"As you know, all my limbs have been cut off. The Association caught them all. Of course, the core figures are still intact, but you can't do anything with just the head. Lend me some people. Capable ones."

No matter how outstanding Gaold was, carrying out all operations alone was impossible.

While he needed someone with a powerful single strike, he also needed someone to devise tactics, someone to execute them, someone to support them - he needed to form at least a minimal party.

"The one at this school, the Bishop of the Karsis Order."

Olivia stepped forward indignantly.

"You think I'd send precious school personnel to their deaths? And what you're trying to do goes against humanity's survival. Not content with treason, now you want to disturb the world?"

"You shut up."

For the first time since entering the room, Gaold faced Olivia directly.

Though his extreme heat didn't explode, an aura that seemed capable of boring holes through bodies with just his gaze was emanating.

"Do you know why I've kept you alive until now? Huh? No? Answer me."

Olivia kept her mouth firmly shut and glared fiercely.

"Because you're not even worth killing."

The sound of Gaold grinding his teeth could be heard.

"Abstention? A person who's the inspector of the faculty council, when a student of the kingdom is about to be dragged into the dimension of fear, what, abstention? Do you know what people like you are called? Hypocrite. You don't like this and you don't like that, and though you held one of the twenty cards that could determine humanity's survival, your choice was mere abstention?"

Olivia's lips trembled. Her gaze that had been glaring at Gaold slowly lowered.

"I-it couldn't be helped."

Whatever she chose wouldn't have been the result Olivia wanted. No, actually even that thought was an excuse.

She was simply scared. She had been so terrified that she couldn't choose anything.

Transparent tears formed in Olivia's eyes as the helplessness of that time came back vividly.

Gaold turned away with a disgusted expression.

Though recognized by the world as a 2nd-class archmage, she ultimately couldn't shed the shell of being a woman. That's why she was merely a 2nd-class archmage.

'This is why I didn't want to come to this school.'

This place was full of nothing but the past.

The past that wouldn't be erased no matter how much he tried to erase it.

Though Gaold couldn't remember even what happened an hour ago, he could clearly recall even the antennae of bugs on leaves from the scene that met his eyes on the Day of Twenty Judges.

"Hah."

Gaold turned back to look at Alpheas.

It was probably an extremely human expression that everyone who knew him was seeing for the first time.

"Please, help me. Master."

"......"

There was a day called the Day of Twenty Judges.

The day when twenty people representing the world and able to speak for Miro's position gathered to decide humanity's future.

The result was 16 votes in favor, 1 vote against, 3 abstentions.

The only person who valued one person's life more than the lives of all humanity was Mirhi Alpheas alone.

He was the only one who stood on Gaold's side, willingly inscribing opposition on his card.

"You know. I don't trust anyone except you, Master. Help me. I have to find Miro. She's not dead. She's living there perfectly fine right now, so why the hell won't you look for her?"

Alpheas was lost in anguish.

Perhaps Olivia's choice in the Twenty Judges was the most rational decision good could make.

But he knew the feeling of watching someone more precious than anything in the world disappear before your eyes.

It wasn't a choice made for the world. Alpheas was also an unavoidable madman.

"I'll ask... Ethella."

Ethella would probably give permission.

The Bishop of the Karsis Order and the previous successor of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist.

If she hadn't lowered her body and mind with the conviction of one thought, three thousand, she wouldn't be in just her current position with that talent.

She was sufficient material for Gaold to use.

"Stay here for the time being. Olivia and I will handle the agents. Let's prepare to open Estas."

As Alpheas turned around with a drained face, Gaold finally regained his smile.

Then, as if suddenly remembering, he raised his hand.

"Ah, wait a moment."

Alpheas turned around at the stairs.

"Since I'm already asking favors, recruit just one more person for me."
