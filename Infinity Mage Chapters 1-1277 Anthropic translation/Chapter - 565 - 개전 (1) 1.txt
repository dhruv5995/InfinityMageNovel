[565] The Battle Begins (1)

Around the time the moon rose, a man and woman met behind the senior class building.

Dorothy had arrived first and was waiting, and Iruki only appeared five minutes later.

"You're late. By five minutes."

Dorothy scolded in her characteristic tone, but Iruki's mind never forgot time.

"You arrived five minutes early."

"That's right. My watch is five minutes fast."

Dorothy turned her head away shyly.

"But I always forget that."

Iruki couldn't analyze what this conversation meant to Dorothy.

"Well then, let me get straight to the point."

When Dorothy nodded, an explanation about the Scramble Royale followed.

No other words interrupted until the explanation was finished.

"The Scramble Royale runs from noon to midnight every day. You'll be able to attend morning evaluations, and if urgent, you can participate in afternoon evaluations too. Since you can drag down multiple people ranked above you, it's not a bad proposal, right?"

"Anything else?"

That was Dorothy's only question.

"Anything else?"

"Is that why you called me? Not because you had something else to say?"

After thinking it over, Iruki spoke.

"There is. Honestly, if you participate in the Scramble Royale, you'll have to give up afternoon evaluations. Of course, I'm not imposing restrictions, but realistically that's how it'll be."

"......"

Dorothy stared at Iruki for a long time, then gently placed her hand on his cheek.

"Slap."

She made the sound effect with her mouth, but Iruki's expression remained unchanged.

"Alright. I'll do it."

"Thank you. On behalf of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Club."

"It wasn't a bad proposal like you said. Should I come to the research club on the weekend?"

Before Iruki could answer, Dorothy immediately turned around and headed toward the dormitory.

After the sixth day of evaluations ended, the day to discuss the Scramble Royale was just one day away.

Nade's sunken eyes were shadowed with death when he arrived at the research club.

'I couldn't recruit anyone. I'm dead now.'

Despite his big talk, most of the students he'd proposed to hadn't even shown interest.

The risk of interference with evaluations during the participation period was probably greater than expected.

"No, that's not it."

Iruki, who had already recruited Dorothy, wiggled his finger with the only relaxed expression.

"In addition to the risk, they calculated the benefits of not participating."

Shirone nodded gloomily.

"While we're participating in the Scramble Royale, they can earn more points than their competitors."

"Ugh! Is that the problem? If we just win, we can crush the Class One kids!"

Unlike the excited Nade, Iruki was cold.

"Low risk, low return. It's not a bad choice. Besides, with that kind of resolve, they wouldn't be helpful anyway. It's time to seriously consider realistic alternatives."

Since the realistic alternative was ultimately Sabina, the deflated Nade shut his mouth.

Honestly, at this point he'd welcome anyone's help, but his desire to avoid getting involved with her specifically was just as strong.

"Fine. I'll go and at least try talking to her."

"Go quickly. Go now. We really don't have time anymore. I'll go try Amy again too."

When Shirone left the research club first with a gloomy expression, Nade, who was following behind, looked back at Iruki.

"I'm in trouble too, but what about Shirone? Honestly, it is an unreasonable schedule. Both the person asking and the person refusing must feel bad about it. Won't things get awkward again?"

"Amy will join. Don't worry and just do your part."

"Huh? What are you talking about?"

As if he hadn't heard, Iruki looked at the wall and muttered.

"Now that it's come to this, I have no choice but to play my final card."

"Hah, this is really driving me crazy."

Nade, who ended up turning away from his path to Sabina, sat on a park bench and sighed deeply enough to sink the ground.

'I know. I know too.'

As the club president, he should take responsibility for decisions, but some problems were worse than death.

"What are you doing here?"

"Don't make me talk. My head is complicated right now... Huh?"

Nade quickly turned his head when he realized it was Sabina's voice.

"How did you get here?"

"Iruki told me to come check. Said you were looking for me."

The slyly smiling face of Iruki came to mind.

"What, not even asking me to sit? Weren't you looking for me? Should I just leave?"

"No, you can't leave, so..."

Sabina spoke while trying to hide her bubbling expression.

"Hey, do you hate me that much?"

"Who said I hate you? Don't say things like that..."

Nade, realizing he was being cautious, suddenly changed his expression and shouted.

"You're the one who keeps paying attention to me! I don't understand your intentions. It's definitely not like you actually like me or anything like that, right?"

"Why do you think that?"

"Huh?"

Sabina sat on the bench.

"Yeah, honestly I admit it's strange. Ever since I saw you that day."

Nade didn't move.

It was an immobility as if frozen in time, and Sabina got goosebumps from the absolute killing intent she'd never felt in her life.

'Ugh, really scary...'

After last year's two-thousand-match competition ended, she'd been beaten up by Nade.

Since then, she'd been tormented daily by nightmares of Nade strangling her.

'How did it come to this?'

Perhaps when fear is too intense, you surrender your body to that fear - Sabina might have also unlocked her heart's safety mechanism for Nade.

"I was so scared. Honestly, I still am. So please... could you stop doing that?"

"Ah, sorry."

Nade grabbed his face.

'Damn, another mistake.'

'That' face that showed itself without him knowing.

The face that resembled his mother and was therefore even more disgusting - he wanted to smash it right then and there.

"But it's not because I'm scared that I'm doing this. I kept watching you. Laughing and chatting with friends - it was a little different from the Dante team I belong to. It looked really fun."

Nade, who had sat on the bench, spoke in a cold voice.

"It's all fake. That's not my real self."

It was the first time he'd confessed honestly to anyone other than Iruki.

"What is a real self?"

Nade looked at Sabina.

"Whether you're a scary person or acting nice, that's still you. There's no such thing as fake about your appearance."

Sabina smiled kindly and said.

"Nade desperately trying to hide his scary side. That alone is you, and that's the Nade I've seen."

Nade kept his mouth firmly shut.

If his facial muscles relaxed even a little, tears seemed ready to pour out.

"I just want to know you a little better. So don't worry. Of course, if my skills are lacking, I won't be of help."

When Nade still said nothing, Sabina got up from her seat with a resigned expression.

"If you change your mind..."

"Scramble Royale."

"Huh?"

Nade looked up with determination.

"Want to do it together? If you help me, I think I can really give it a proper try."

Sabina smiled with her eyes.

Finally, the day of negotiation arrived.

Nade had become remarkably healthy overnight, but now it was Shirone who looked like a corpse.

Even his friends were seeing Shirone trembling like this for the first time.

"What should I do? I couldn't convince Amy in the end."

"Geez, her stubbornness is really something."

Nade clicked his tongue and said.

"Since it's come to this, there's nothing we can do. We'll have to lead the negotiations well and balance things out."

"But even that means giving up one negotiation card. I'm sorry! Because of me..."

When Shirone was about to cry, Nade patted his shoulder.

"What kind of talk is that? If you can't convince her, nobody can. It can't be helped."

"Ahhh! It's all my fault."

After confirming that Shirone was covering his face with both hands, Iruki got up from his seat.

"I'll be back in a bit. Get ready to receive guests first."

"Where are you going? There are only a few hours left."

"I have a prior appointment."

Saying that, Iruki left the Estas and headed straight to the store.

It was quiet because it was a holiday, and Amy was waiting while drinking coffee, raising her hand when she saw him.

"How's Shirone doing?"

"He'll die soon. There's no saving him."

Amy asked with an apologetic expression.

"Is there really no other solution?"

"There is. You just need to participate."

"That again? I said no. This is my second graduation exam. I can't afford mistakes."

Iruki nodded.

"I know. So I'll stop asking now."

"Then why did you want to meet?"

"To threaten you."

Amy raised one eyebrow.

"How are you going to threaten me?"

"You know Cayden, right? President of the Female Anatomy Research Club."

"Ho, I didn't see that coming."

Amy consciously tried not to show interest.

"You probably heard roughly from Shirone, but Scramble Royale has many similarities to non-regulation matches. When rules are set, they manifest."

"So?"

"Cayden has liked Maya for a long time. And Maya likes Shirone."

"So?"

She was starting to think she shouldn't hear any more.

"Cayden holds a grudge against Shirone. He'll probably propose conditions like this: if you lose, you can never date Amy."

"So... what?"

"Just saying."

Amy slammed the table.

"Are you kidding? What kind of threat is that? What am I to Shirone? We're nothing to each other. We already talked about that when I returned."

"I don't know about all that. I just thought I should tell you since this might be the last chance to turn things around."

Iruki got up and said.

"So Shirone was probably desperate too. Don't be too disappointed that he didn't understand your situation. We're also cheering for your graduation more than anyone."

Watching Iruki leave the store, Amy sucked down the rest of her coffee in one gulp.

"No way! Absolutely not!"

Returning to the dormitory, Amy confirmed it was almost time for the Scramble Royale negotiation table to open.

If they lose, there's no future with Shirone.

"Ha! Who's dating whom? Men are really funny. They get the wrong idea with just a little attention."

Participating in Scramble Royale would cause massive losses in graduation evaluations.

"Even if there's that possibility, so what? What kind of stupid thing would it be to just date without even graduating?"

Amy sat at her desk and opened a book.

'Right, let's forget it! I'm studying! There are other men besides Shirone, and I don't need to worry enough to ruin my life. Besides... Shirone's team might win anyway, right?'

The pages of the thermodynamics theory book flipped quickly.

'Cayden.'

Amy slammed the book shut with a bang and jumped up from her chair.

"No, but this bastard really...!"

The hour hand pointed to noon.

As the Estas activated, the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Club came down to the first floor, and at the appointed time, six alliance team members entered.

Hersy first checked the numbers.

'Five people.'

The expectation that Amy would be included was wrong, but it was actually favorable.

'The Estas is ours.'

With both sides seated facing each other, negotiations proceeded.

"Let's set the negotiation deadline until midnight today."

"Good. Twelve hours is tight, so let's establish the big framework first. Game rules, rewards and costs, taboos..."

Then the door opened roughly.

"Hey! Cayden!"

Where everyone turned their gaze, Amy was standing.

"Amy?"

The most surprised person was Shirone, but she didn't even look at him and walked straight toward Cayden.

"Do you want to die? Who gave you permission to interfere in other people's marriage affairs—no, love affairs?"

Cayden closed his eyes dismissively.

"I don't know what you're talking about. Nothing's been decided yet."

"Huh?"

Only then did Amy come to her senses and turn her head.

The Scramble Royale participants were staring at her with blank expressions.
