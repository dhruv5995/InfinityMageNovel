[793] Beta Fish (3)

"Work! We have work!"

When Justin burst through the guild doors, her subordinates were sleeping on the floor of the crumbling building.

"Everyone get up, you lazy bums!"

Six men and one woman sat up with disheveled expressions they couldn't quite shake off.

"Ugh, my stomach hurts. Why are you being so loud this early in the morning?"

One-Eye wrinkled his face as he caught a whiff of last night's vomit and turned to look at Justin.

"What? Early in the morning?"

Justin loaded a magic bullet into her gun.

"Is that what someone who earns their keep in my guild should be saying?"

The moment they saw the gun barrel aimed at them, the dazed faces snapped awake and bodies went flying.

"Run! We're dead!"

Those who scattered in all directions squeezed their eyes shut, expecting the explosive sound of the magic bullet.

"It's work. Please."

Justin sighed and lowered her gun.

The entire Justin Mercenary Company sat around a round table inside the guild that was roughly blocked from the wind with wooden planks.

"So, we're going to be bodyguards for the most beautiful ladies in the world?"

One-Eye asked incredulously.

"That's right. Of course, only I can enter the waiting room. You six will handle external security."

With the threat-maker still uncaught, the Arachne government was putting all their effort into security.

They had to use whatever forces they could scrape together, and the fact that Justin was a woman worked in their favor.

The woman at the counter asked.

"How much are they paying us?"

"It's performance-based. But the contract fee alone is enough to cover the guild's repair costs. Plus, if we succeed with this job, our mercenary company's reputation will rise."

One-Eye's single eye gleamed.

"You mean... we're finally going back out into the world?"

The revival of the Justin Mercenary Company.

"That's right. It was decided on short notice, but we can make it in time for the rehearsal. Briefing at the vacant lot in 10 minutes."

At the World Beauty Contest venue, there were separate waiting rooms designated for contestants and event staff.

"Huff. Huff."

Maya, who was just about to make her debut, sat in the guest singer waiting room, breathing heavily.

'Why am I like this? My heart is beating too fast.'

Agency president Palmers entered the waiting room and handed Maya a sedative.

"Still feeling that way?"

"Yes. But... I'll be okay."

She couldn't show weakness when so many people had worked hard for this day.

"Stay calm. You worked hard. You didn't make a single mistake during rehearsal either. You can do well."

'I should have made a mistake instead.'

The fact that it had concluded so smoothly made her even more anxious because this was her first professional stage.

'Shirone...'

Maya opened the sheet music titled "Light Rain."

'Someday you'll listen to my song.'

It meant light pouring down from the sky like a shower, a song expressing the feelings of love she had felt for Shirone.

Seeing Maya visibly calm down as she read the lyrics, Palmers smacked his lips.

'Whoever it is, they're blessed.'

When he first read the lyrics she submitted, everyone involved could tell they weren't just words written for a song.

'That's right, this is just the beginning. Let go of greed, and you just need to be able to pour out your heart.'

Palmers quietly stepped away.

Contestants' waiting room.

The room where beauties representing 32 countries were gathered was a silent battlefield.

The female security guards all had the same thought.

'This won't be easy to control.'

Miss Biden, sitting with her legs spread wide in her underwear, said irritably.

"Ugh, so boring."

There was no response, and she, who loved socializing with people, felt suffocated.

'I'd have no other wish if I could smoke just one cigarette.'

With competitors' surveillance networks spread across everyone, she couldn't even sneak out for a smoke.

After yawning languidly with her armpit exposed, she turned to look at Miss Tormia sitting next to her.

She was a woman with platinum blonde hair cascading down on both sides, revealing a broad forehead, and beautiful golden eyebrows.

"Hey, isn't it stuffy wearing a dress when we still have a long way to go before starting? We'll have to change anyway."

Alfred Pony closed her book and said.

"Royal dignity knows no time or place."

"Oh my, you're royalty?"

She had disappointingly failed Tormia Magic School's graduation exam due to Maya's irregular performance and had taken a leave of absence.

'This is the best choice I can make.'

Failing the exam was shocking, but she had learned about the world through her family's unreasonable demands toward Shirone.

'If I win, I can also join the establishment.'

In any country, beauty contest winners receive preferential treatment from the government, and that would directly connect to the royal family's political power.

"Hey, are you really royalty? Then do handsome people bow and scrape to you?"

Pony, feeling the question wasn't worth answering, was about to open her book again when a hand suddenly appeared in front of her.

Looking up, she saw Miss Arachne approaching with a bright smile.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Barho Rangi."

The Arachne Kingdom had traditionally produced many world contest winners, and Rangi was also a strong candidate for victory.

"I'm Alfred Pony. Though I can't say it's nice to meet you."

"Hehe, how direct. You're definitely like a mage."

Probably all the contestants had obtained everyone's profiles, but for Pony, it was a painful past.

"I'm not a mage. I didn't graduate."

Stating facts meant her way of thinking still hadn't escaped that of a mage.

"I know. But I still think it's cool."

She was a woman with a talent for putting people at ease.

"Hmm."

When Pony showed signs of favor, Rangi brought over a chair and sat in front of her.

"You said you attended Alpheus Magic School, right? Then... you must also know someone named Shirone?"

For the first time, emotion showed on Pony's cold face.

"How do you know Shirone?"

"Hehe, of course I know. Who in the world doesn't know the star of the Ivory Tower?"

"Well..."

Though the Ivory Tower was an unfamiliar organization to magic outsiders, Pony felt a sense of kinship with her.

"What kind of person is Shirone?"

"What kind of person?"

As she rested her chin and recalled her school days, her eyes sank into deep sadness.

"Actually, we weren't very close. We'd exchange a few words in the cafeteria occasionally. We fought more often than not."

"Wow, you fought with that Shirone?"

Somehow that felt good.

"We were competitors at the time. But what really drove us apart happened after the graduation exam ended. Shirone is from a commoner background."

Pony added.

"Of course, status doesn't matter in magic. It's a world where you assert yourself purely through skill."

Her once fierce gaze settled again.

"Our family, meaning the royal family, made a mistake. For such a trivial reason, they pressured to fail Shirone, who was valedictorian, and pass me instead."

'Politicians are all the same anyway...'

Is there some machine somewhere that stamps them out identically?

"I was ashamed. So I didn't go anywhere. The situation got even worse. Eventually I..."

Pony said bitterly.

"I decided to kill myself."

Rangi's eyes widened, and Miss Biden, who had been listening nearby, whispered urgently.

"Hey, how can you say such things? Do you know how many ears are listening here?"

If such secrets leaked out, it would be a decisive blow, but Pony continued without wavering.

"I tied a rope to the ceiling and put it around my neck."

None of the contestants reacted, but all conversation had completely stopped.

"I kicked the chair away and entrusted my body to gravity. But the moment I dropped down, I stopped."

Rangi gulped.

"It was strange, so I slowly opened my eyes and looked down, and Shirone was holding onto my legs. That guy put me down and looked straight at me, saying this."

Pony's words were extremely calm.

"It's not your fault, Pony."

Now everyone was looking at her.

"Those weren't words meant to comfort me. It was because it really wasn't my fault. He was about to lose not just valedictorian status but his mage certification, yet he said that."

Pony still couldn't believe it.

"What kind of person is Shirone? Simple. A mage. And the greatest mage of this era."

"You still love magic."

"I wanted to see it through to the end. But I want to believe in myself a little more. I think that's the proper order."

Endless battles and competition, a cold boundary world where no one appeals to emotion.

But looking back, wasn't that the most comforting time in Pony's life?

"I miss it. School..."

When a smile appeared on Pony's lips for the first time, the competitors who had been listening turned their heads away.

'Tch, can't use that against her.'

If it were a secret, they'd spread it, but with that kind of drama, it would only enhance Pony's appeal.

'The Archmage who defeats dragons.'

Rangi still had the novel Shirone had left at the hotel.

"He sounds like a wonderful person, Shirone."

Pony giggled.

"Yeah, when he's being a mage... honestly, I can't deny it either. But if you saw him in person, you'd be shocked. Normally he's just a country boy."

Though they understood different situations, Rangi felt she knew what she meant.

'When he's being a mage. I wonder what he looks like then?'

As Rangi was lost in imagination, the security team that had been investigating the surrounding area returned.

The security captain introduced Justin.

"This is a sniper specialist we've deployed on emergency basis. With this, your safety will be further strengthened, so please participate in the contest with peace of mind."

Only a few in the royal castle knew about the terrorist threat.

"What sniper specialist? Honestly, who's going to shoot us from far away? Kidnapping would make more sense."

Justin said.

"There aren't only male villains in the world. This is a precautionary measure, so please follow the controls."

"Ah, I don't know, I don't know! You control what we eat, drink, even how we breathe, and now what other controls?"

Since maintaining secrecy was the priority, persuasion was impossible.

"Now begins the festival for people worldwide! The main event of the World Beauty Contest!"

The host exited to the audience's applause and was followed by the opening ceremony celebration performance.

"Maya, nervousness is poison, but letting your guard down too much is also bad. Trust me. You can do it."

It was Maya's turn.

"Let me introduce! The owner of outstanding vocal ability from Tormia, Maya!"

Taking a deep breath and standing alone where she could see the entire audience made her feel dizzy.

'Stay calm. You've done harder things than this.'

She deliberately recalled her magic school days.

'That's right, I'm not alone.'

The musicians setting up their instruments felt like Shirone's team she had fought alongside during the conquest of the highlands.

'Bomb drums, Iruki.'

As she positioned majors and instruments, a smile formed.

'Red-eyed keyboards Amy. Nade would be perfect on electric guitar. And bass is...'

Shirone, who always held the team's center.

'Someday... could we perform together?'

The prelude to "Light Rain," which she had written lyrics for, began flowing, and she could feel a thousand gazes focusing on her.

"Phew! Thank goodness. I'm not late."

The moment Shirone, who had arrived late, sat down, Maya slowly stepped to match the beat.

"You're really amazing, Maya. You achieved your dream."

Though Shirone's voice couldn't be heard, Maya's movement as she swayed left and right suddenly stopped.

"What, what? Why is she doing that?"

Palmers, watching from backstage, immediately realized this wasn't a normal situation.

"Shirone."

At first she thought she was seeing an illusion, but the person sitting in the front row was definitely Shirone.

'Shirone really came.'

She couldn't hear the music, the audience's cheers, or even her heartbeat.
