The Unknown Side of Humanity (2)

Maya stared blankly at Caden's strange behavior.

Caden slowly lifted his head, witnessed his right hand's misconduct once again, and hastily yanked his arm back.

"Damn it! This is driving me crazy."

"Caden, are you okay?"

"Oh, well..."

There was nothing he could say.

"What's wrong?"

The other performers who used the same corridor came out, and Reina, the troupe leader, entered the room.

"What's going on? What?"

The murmuring crowd's attention focused on Caden, who had covered his lower body with a blanket.

While Maya couldn't figure out how to explain, Caden's face turned red as if it might explode.

"Hmm."

Reina, who had grown up with male siblings, roughly understood the situation.

"I thought something serious had happened. Maya, don't worry about it. It's just because he's healthy. Still, Mr. Caden, please keep the noise down in the early morning hours."

'No, it's not like that.'

He tried to salvage the situation somehow, but his tongue wouldn't move in front of so many people's stares.

Reina pulled Maya's shoulder toward the door.

"Let's go, Maya."

Then she whispered softly.

"I know you're old school friends, but be careful. I've been watching him, and his behavior seems creepy and kind of perverted."

"Oh, yes."

Maya wanted to say he wasn't that kind of person, but honestly, she couldn't be sure.

"Alright, everyone! Go back to your rooms. We'll have roll call in the morning, so get some good sleep."

Reina dispersed the performers, and in the empty corridor, Maya looked back at Caden's door.

Meanwhile, Caden, who had hastily pulled up his pants, was on the verge of tears.

'Damn it. You idiot.'

It would have been better to run around downtown Zive naked.

If only Maya weren't there.

'Let's go back to Tormia. What kind of knight am I? Staying here will only cause trouble for people.'

He was just a man suited to spending all day drawing the face of the woman he loved in a gloomy room.

A knock followed by Maya's voice could be heard.

"Can I come in for a moment?"

Caden's heart sank.

'Not now. How can I face her?'

Just as he was about to refuse, Maya continued.

"I really need to talk to you. It's important."

When Caden opened the door, Maya entered the room with a gentle smile.

She slowly looked around the room, then turned her head.

"Is your hand okay?"

"Huh? Oh..."

Caden, who had been staring resentfully at his right hand, sighed and confessed honestly.

"I'm sorry. It's exactly what you're thinking. I made a fool of myself. I don't know how to apologize..."

"It's okay. It's not the first time."

She knew that Caden's right hand was out of control.

What she didn't know was...

"Which one is your true feelings?"

"Huh?"

"You're always kind to me, but on the other hand, your right hand always tries to do naughty things. I honestly can't tell what you want."

"Absolutely not! Naughty thoughts! I would never even dream of such things!"

Caden waved both hands.

But only his left hand moved; his right hand was making an okay sign with his thumb and index finger.

When Maya's expression went blank, his right hand gave a thumbs up.

"Oh, stop it already!"

Caden shouted angrily and hit his right arm.

Once again, a battle between his left and right hands unfolded as Maya spoke.

"Caden, I've been thinking a lot since you confessed. But I still... I don't think I can forget Shirone yet."

His right arm slowly lowered.

Whenever Shirone's name came up, Caden's right arm would always fall asleep.

"Y-yeah. I wasn't really expecting anything special either..."

"But."

Maya continued.

"I am trying to forget him. Shirone has Amy, after all. I can't keep holding onto Shirone forever."

Caden's heart beat rapidly.

"I still can't promise anything. But... could you give me a little time? Would it be rude of me to ask this?"

"No, no. I can wait. For a lifetime, no, forever."

It was an absurd answer, but Maya could smile.

"I'm grateful that you always worry about me. Good night."

"Oh, yeah. You too..."

Long after Maya left, Caden remained frozen in place before collapsing onto his bed.

"She's just pitying me."

How pathetic and pitiful must he have seemed.

"Ugh."

His eyes reddened.

"But she didn't say no."

What he desperately wanted was the fate of the unattainable Red Cross constellation.

For Caden, who had lived crushed under that immense cosmic law, this was the first hope that had ever approached him.

"She said I could wait."

He was breaking free from the framework God had created.

'Maybe I can do this.'

His right hand approached his moist eyes and gently covered them.

The incident at the performers' quarters was a minor happening, but Guard Captain Rai's nerves were on edge.

'Forget about sleeping tonight.'

He hadn't planned to sleep anyway.

As he passed through the performers' area toward the teachers' quarters, he saw someone approaching in the distance.

Just from the limping gait, he could tell.

'Parka Kuan.'

When Rai brought his legs together in salute, Kuan also nodded briefly.

"Where are you returning from?"

Kuan didn't stop walking as he spoke.

"Just taking a walk because I felt stuffy."

Kuan's formal speech made Rai uncomfortable.

"You don't need to speak so formally. It makes me uncomfortable."

In terms of position, Rai was higher, but Kuan was a great swordsman watched by the world.

Neither affirming nor denying, Kuan passed by him when Rai asked.

"Why did you refuse the position of Guard Captain?"

Kuan's steps stopped.

"It might be presumptuous of me to meddle, but I heard you have someone you care about. Even without that reason, I think you're more suitable than I am."

'Shiina.'

He hadn't met her once since arriving at the Holy Temple.

One eye, one arm, one good leg.

'Keke.'

What dreams were these people with all their limbs intact telling him to have?

"Work hard."

Kuan resumed walking and muttered.

"A one-armed man cannot fight while protecting someone."

When Rai turned around, Kuan had already disappeared from sight.

"Heretic!"

When Vanessa, caught in the Miracle Stream, shouted, her jaw dangled loosely.

Shirone swung the cigarette of light with full force, and Vanessa crashed into the wall with a thud.

'Oh no!'

If she were an ordinary human, every bone in her body would have been shattered.

"Huuuuu..."

Vanessa stood up in her broken state.

'A Dine.'

Trapped in the prison of flesh, he had transcended death.

The difference from Lian was that his information could not be regenerated.

"Stop it."

Shirone spoke with sincerity.

"Not dying doesn't mean you're alive. If you damage your body any more here, you'll just become a lump of meat."

Like the flesh gods of the other world.

"You fool."

Madness flashed in Vanessa's eyes.

"Nothing will change."

Shirone wrapped the form that charged again—no longer resembling a human—in the cigarette of light.

"Kraaaah!"

Black ash scattered where the light touched.

'Still can't be purified.'

It was just burning away to nothing.

If he continued to let Agape's light flow like this... would there be anything left of him?

"Give up. You became a demon in a human body. For demons, purification means only extinction."

"Kraaaaaaak!"

All of Vanessa's ribs protruded outside his body, and except for one broken one, they stretched out like spider legs.

"Body, mind, heart, emotions—all exist only for God's glory!"

The bone spears, sharp as spears, flew toward Shirone's nape.

"Damn it!"

Agape's light exploded, sending Vanessa flying into the corridor's darkness.

"Whew."

Wiping the sweat from under his chin as he advanced, he saw a body burned like charcoal.

Groaning sounds leaked through the missing jaw.

"Ahhhh..."

Something still remained, it seemed.

"Where is... this?"

"Prison."

Vanessa pondered Shirone's words, then stared at the ceiling with unfocused eyes.

"Then can I leave now?"

Shirone couldn't answer.

"I guess I can't leave after all. God doesn't seem to forgive me."

This was the third undead person Shirone had met.

'Why can't they die?'

Lian, Gaold, and Vanessa.

"I can see, Yahweh."

A hoarse voice leaked out.

"God has determined your outcome. You can never win. Shedding tears of blood... kekeke."

With a crumbling sound, the facial muscles turned to charcoal broke apart.

"Gurgle. Gurgle."

Looking at the body that could no longer convey any information, Shirone slowly turned around.

Woooooo!

Screaming echoed.

From 4:30 AM, lights began turning on one by one in the windows of Delta headquarters.

From 5 AM, people moved around busily, and delegations from various departments of the Holy Temple arrived at Delta.

"Ugh, uncomfortable."

Seriel from the World Health Organization stretched when she saw a familiar face in the distance.

"Huh?"

It was Amira, a classmate who graduated from magic school with her and worked at the World Climate Organization.

"Wow! Amira!"

"Oh my, Seriel! It's been so long. I heard the news."

While they were catching up, Dorothy and Liz, who had arrived early, approached.

"Hello, nice to meet you."

Dorothy attended as Iruki's representative, and Liz attended as a director of the Nade Group.

"But is Iruki really not coming? There'll be talk at the public speech."

Dorothy shook her head.

"I don't know. We've completely lost contact. Since Shirone isn't saying anything special, it's probably fine, but..."

Liz patted her shoulder.

"Don't worry. He's probably goofing off somewhere strange. That's how those guys are."

While chatting continued, Seriel looked around.

'Didn't Amy come?'

Then her brow furrowed.

"Well, well, familiar faces!"

Fermi approached, sipping coffee.

Since no one had avoided being bullied by him during school days, the women's expressions were naturally unpleasant.

But the emotion Seriel felt was separate from that.

'I didn't want to run into him.'

Liz said.

"Long time no see. Looking well? You were always playing politics in school, and now you've finally made it to the political arena."

Fermi shrugged.

"Haha! If it helps the world, shouldn't I gladly sacrifice myself?"

Having responded thus, he winked at Seriel.

"I read your paper well. Your analysis of emotional diseases was excellent."

"...What are you doing right now?"

"What?"

"Why are you talking to me? Don't you know what you did? You turned countless people into drug addicts."

"That's exactly why I'm talking to you. How about it? I have a good idea..."

The moment Fermi placed his hand on her shoulder, Seriel slapped his arm away.

"Don't touch my body."

While Fermi clicked his tongue, a Zive staff member approached.

"The official Holy Temple ceremony will begin shortly. Please gather in the main conference hall, meeting participants."

The women returned to their respective departments one by one, and as Seriel passed Fermi, she gritted her teeth and said.

"You and I need to talk later."

Watching her retreating figure, Fermi smiled with his eyes.

"Still as cold as ever."

Just like back in school days.
