[577] Monster of Omnipotence (4)

Scramble Royale, Day 5.

The moment the first Scramble was summoned, Iruki cast spatial movement to the nearest coordinates.

Fortunately, the Scramble wasn't too far away, and he teleported into Training Ground 2000.

It should have been empty during lunch break, but one person was waiting for him.

"Eden."

She hadn't shown herself at all yesterday.

He'd thought she was scheming something, but he couldn't find anything particularly different about her.

Except for the fierce faith burning in her eyes.

"Did you wait here on purpose?"

The natural enemy of defensive magic wasn't just cancellation—it was because Iruki's magic had attributes extremely biased toward offensive power.

But if they'd met from the first round, it was right to think she had a special purpose.

"I needed to confirm something before meeting Shirone."

'So I'm a test subject.'

With Hersy's abilities, finding locations would be easy.

"So... you're going to take it?"

Iruki pointed at the Scramble.

"Probably... yes?"

"Kekeke!"

Overdrive lightning sparked in Iruki's eyes.

'There's a limit to how much you can provoke my pride.'

Cancellation!

Having made it to Day 5, there was nothing to hide, and tremendous data pierced through Iruki's mind.

'Try whatever you want.'

There was no need to understand the mechanism of magic.

Simply analyzing the omnipotence entirely and reversing the vector quantity—that was something only Servant Syndrome could accomplish.

"I believe that You exist."

Eden began removing her clothes.

"That God's love dwells within me."

Even as she walked toward him naked, Iruki didn't stop his analysis.

"That this love dwells in the world again."

'Got it!'

The moment analysis was complete, the Cancellation magic was cast.

"Therefore, transcending faith..."

Eden spread her arms wide.

"I know that You exist."

Proof of God's Existence.

Absolute Barrier.

With no visible effects—just the sight of a naked girl—Iruki was shocked.

"...Impossible."

"What are you doing? If you can do something, try it. That's why I came looking for you."

Cancellation wasn't working.

'The vectors won't move.'

Immobility and stillness were completely different concepts.

Even the slightest movement would make canceling the magic a matter of time, but now change itself was impossible.

'It's not a problem with omnipotence.'

Absolute omnipotence.

The extreme cognition of feeling God beyond faith had strengthened Eden's omnipotence.

Her Spirit Zone clung to her body as if vacuum-sealed, but that was enough to protect herself.

"Then, I'll take it."

'I have to stop her.'

Glaring at Eden walking toward the Scramble, Iruki activated the double Spirit Zone characteristic of Servants.

'I have no choice.'

The power of nuclear fusion detonation would be beyond imagination, but if he couldn't stop Eden here, the match would be completely tilted.

'Time for her to walk to the Scramble is approximately 11.73 seconds.'

Iruki designed a 10-second detonation formula and left his position. Finally, Eden approached the Scramble and reached out her hand.

'Nuclear Fusion!'

Intense light gathered where Eden's hand extended, then instantly expanded and obliterated the landscape.

BOOOOOOM!

At the explosive sound from the mountain, all the students turned to look, and Shiina rubbed her temples.

"What? An accident?"

Even from a distance, it was a massive explosion that visibly changed the mountain's shape.

'It's magic I created, but it really is incredible.'

Landing on a tree branch, Iruki confirmed that Training Ground 2000 had vanished without a trace.

The financial loss would be enormous, but dealing with the aftermath was a problem for later.

"Anyway... huh?"

Iruki's eyes widened as he checked where the Scramble had been.

Eden stood there with not a single hair damaged, holding a card in her hand.

It was a white card.

"One more now."

She looked back at the distant Iruki and said,

"Infinity will be completed today."

"Do you... have any idea how much Training Ground 2000 costs?"

Though Iruki was the one who destroyed it, he felt wronged enough to say such a thing.

"I don't know."

Eden neither got angry nor argued logically.

As long as God protected her, even if the universe were destroyed, it couldn't harm her.

"I believe that You exist. That Your love, God's love, dwells within me..."

Iruki muttered helplessly as he watched Eden's retreating figure, reciting her prayer.

"We're going to lose this, aren't we?"

Dorothy trembled behind a tree.

Even though she'd already given up the Scramble, Frings was persistently following her.

"Dorothy, where are you? Are you hiding here?"

As Frings searched through the bushes, Dorothy's shoulders flinched from a distant spot.

"Not here? Then are you over here?"

His sickeningly cloying tone.

'He's looking down on me!'

That's what she thought, but her body still couldn't move an inch.

'Pervert.'

Dorothy anticipated what would happen if Frings caught her.

She would tell him everything.

Her intimate secrets, terrible secrets she wouldn't share even with family—secrets so horrible she hated even thinking about them would be dug up.

"Aha, so you were there?"

Dorothy's heart sank.

"Just kidding. Don't be nervous."

Her weakened legs trembled.

"Scared to death, right? That's what makes hide-and-seek fun. Enjoy it, Dorothy. I'm thrilled right now too."

'He knows. He knows where I am.'

It was a conviction both felt even without entering their Spirit Zones.

"I can smell it. Dorothy's distinctive scent of sexual frustration."

At the voice heard just one meter behind her, Dorothy's mind grew distantly faint.

"Now then, let's meet our princess..."

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Just then, Hersy's assembly signal burst in the air.

Looking up at the sky, Frings spoke to the tree where Dorothy was hiding with predatory eyes.

"Hersy's calling. You're saved, Dorothy. How does it feel? Are you going crazy with relief? Huh? Hey? Huh?"

"......"

"If you beg me to leave, I'll go. Try pleading. While crying your eyes out."

'Huuuu...'

Dorothy desperately clenched her trembling jaw.

"...See you again next time, miss."

The moment the roar of spatial movement erupted, Dorothy collapsed forward.

"Huff! Huff!"

The feeling of relief was brief, and unbearable wretchedness flooded through her entire body.

"What... am I doing here?"

Hickory watched the tears streaming down her face.

'Religion (○○).'

Eden had already collected three cards.

'One per round, for sure. Well, there's no way to stop it.'

Iruki fell into thought.

So how would he stop her?

First, with such an overwhelming difference in omnipotence, there was no need to consider Cancellation.

'Even getting through 0.1 percent would be enough.'

Since there was no point worrying about what he didn't have, he sought a second alternative.

'External force, in the end?'

If he extended Nuclear Fusion's detonation formula to about a minute, it might work.

'Would she wait that long? No, even if I strategically lure her, if that goes off, the aftermath would be no joke.'

It was a problem of a different dimension from Training Ground 2000 being destroyed—there could be casualties.

"I need to gather opinions first. The assembly signal..."

Just then, Dorothy appeared through the bushes.

"Dorothy? What's wrong?"

There was no reason for her, whose role was collecting allied Scrambles, to come looking for Iruki.

"Sorry. I want to quit."

"What happened?"

"I'll pay the price myself. I'll repay everything somehow. So please let me stop."

As Dorothy shed tears, Iruki stood up, sensing the gravity of the situation.

"Tell me what happened first. I need to know what's going on to make a decision."

"I'm scared of Frings."

Sitting down under the tree, Dorothy confessed what she'd endured from Frings for two days.

"...So that happened. But there are ways to strategize so you won't encounter him."

"It's not that kind of problem."

For the first time, Dorothy opened up about herself.

"I'm a pathetic kid. While my friends were busy with diplomacy and politics classes, I was under my blankets having weird fantasies. Does God exist? Is there an afterlife? Where on earth did we come from? I collected materials, even tried making games by myself..."

A sad smile formed on Dorothy's lips.

"When you're little, everyone says it's interesting. But do you know what I hear most when I talk about such things now?"

Iruki waited for her answer.

"What are you going to do with your life?"

As if possessed by them, Dorothy poured out her words.

"Will you become a wizard? Isn't certification difficult? Have you thought about how much you can earn per year? If you're really going to try it, shouldn't you not be like this?"

Anger rose in Dorothy's eyes.

"What do I care! About that stuff!"

Fantasy was the only reality where she could be happy.

"These thoughts are important to us too. Someone should be able to live thinking such thoughts. So why does everyone look at me like I'm pathetic!"

Iruki realized why he had chosen her.

"Of course. Because they're afraid of you."

"Me?"

"I was the same. Because they're afraid of remaining children, everyone becomes adults. And then they realize."

Iruki raised his index finger.

"Adults are completely worthless."

"......"

"There are no adults in the world. Only children, and children pretending to be adults. They endure by doing that because they're equally afraid."

Iruki patted Hickory's shoulder.

"But you made this. With a tin doll filled with all sorts of crazy fantasies, you're fighting on equal terms with graduating class students. Only the final obstacle remains. When you become a wizard..."

Iruki helped Dorothy stand up.

"When you become a wizard, you won't have to fear anything."

"A wizard..."

"Right. Let's win Scramble Royale."

Beyond rewards and costs, this was a match he absolutely wanted to win.

"But Frings is too vicious."

"Just avoid dirty things. Everyone has secrets they want to hide. I do too."

"What is it?"

"Huh?"

Iruki, who had been looking at Dorothy, shook his head.

"It's a secret I want to hide because I don't want to tell."

"But I told you. You should tell me too to be fair."

"Well..."

Iruki pursed his lips and said,

"You appeared in my dream last time."

Dorothy blinked, then covered her mouth and laughed.

"Ahaha! What's that supposed to be?"

As half of Day 5 passed, darkness began to fall.

Neid, who had infiltrated the advanced class girls' dormitory with his face covered, squeezed his eyes shut and entered the laundry room.

"Kyaaaa!"

The expected scream erupted, but he had no intention of stopping his infiltration.

'Of all places, there...!'

Light from a Scramble was emanating from a basket containing underwear.

"Move! Move!"

Neid pushed past the underclassmen and rummaged through the basket like a starving demon.

"He's a pervert!"

"Who's a pervert!"

When he collected the Scramble and left the laundry room, female students were already sprawled in the hallway.

"Catch him! He's an underwear thief!"

His face burning, Neid shouted,

"I'm Fermi! Fermi from the graduating class!"

"Shut up, Neid!"

Though Neid was now officially in the graduating class, there was no title to give to an underwear thief.

"Damn! I'll remember all of you!"

After hurling that meaningless threat and leaving the dormitory, he tucked the random card into his chest and exhaled roughly.

"Phew, somehow I got one though."

With Fisho scraping up Scrambles with insect magic and Eden destroying Scrambles with absolute defense, every card was precious at this point.

"I should hurry and get praised. Huh?"

Just as he was about to fly toward his friends, Shining magic erupted repeatedly in the sky.

Checking the number and tempo of flashes, Neid muttered,

"A distress signal?"
