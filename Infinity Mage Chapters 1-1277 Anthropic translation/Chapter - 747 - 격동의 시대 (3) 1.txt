[747] Turbulent Times (3)

The Kingdom of Tormia.

A month had passed since the Great Purification began.

Martial law had already been declared nationwide, and even nobles couldn't enter the noble district of Creass City without proper identification.

The demons that had appeared when the Spirit Zone expanded had been almost completely annihilated.

However, a few remnants—like the ogres—still lurked in shadowy places, targeting women and children.

"These ogre bastards are really getting on my nerves."

Mages from the Creass branch of the Magic Association and royal special investigators were patrolling the streets.

"What they eat isn't flesh, you see. They devour the act of eating itself. If there's food in front of them, they'll stuff it in their mouths even if their stomachs burst."

The corpse of a noble lady discovered three days ago had been horribly mutilated.

"In any realm, stronger entities absorb weaker ones. In other words, the act of eating is proof of superiority."

Humans eat almost everything.

"Heavy stars absorb lighter stars. The problem is that in the biological realm, it's based on pleasure. That's probably why ogres mutilate corpses."

Nations around the world had already assessed the demons' numbers, combat strength, and persons of interest.

The investigator's cold analysis was part of that effort, but the accompanying mage didn't like it.

"Humans are no different."

The investigator smiled with his eyes.

"You're surprisingly sentimental. I heard mages were cold."

"Well, seeing the world in this state, I don't think maintaining coldness is always the answer."

Everything humanity had achieved was collapsing.

Perhaps the answer lay in the heart—this insight briefly flashed through his mind.

"Of course, I know demons are humanity's dark side. They say they're laws created by powerful desires. But demons are ultimately demons. Most humans don't rape passing women or steal from the wealthy."

The investigator added quietly.

"...Though who knows what they think inside."

Why do demons exist?

As he pondered this while turning the corner of an alley, the mage suddenly stopped and raised his arm.

"Halt."

The following mages immediately entered Spirit Zone, and the investigator narrowed his eyes as he slowly stepped back.

"Who goes there? Identify yourself."

The figure walking through the darkness gave no answer, but the heavy footsteps alone conveyed an intimidating presence.

"Shining."

As the mages behind simultaneously cast their magic, the surroundings brightened, revealing a swordsman drenched in blood.

"Good lord..."

Judging by the caked blood, he seemed to have gone unwashed for at least a week, but his eyes gleamed eerily as if newly born.

Rian, who had crossed the Akard Desert to reach Creass, grimaced.

Dried blood scabs fell off with a rustle.

"What are you guys?"

While the capital and national strongholds were well-prepared against altars, countless demons had emerged from altars set up in the desert that was larger than any great kingdom.

Having swept through all of them on his way home, Rian's mind was sharp enough to cut with just a touch.

"A demon?"

The investigator's words didn't sound like a joke given the fierce killing intent, and the mage showed hostility as he spoke.

"I'm a mage from the Creass branch of the Magic Association. I'm on territorial patrol. You can't enter without identification."

"Territorial patrol?"

Rian looked up at the night sky's stars.

"Hard work. I'm Rian Ogent. I'm on my way home, so could you step aside?"

"O-Ogent Rian?"

The Ogent family was famous in Creass.

But the mage was surprised not by the family's prestige, but by the name Rian.

"The Knight of Maha. Are you really Shirone's sword?"

Few people knew Shirone's face, but the world knew the names of Shirone, the 5-star resident of the Ivory Tower, and his sword Rian.

As the tired Rian, who didn't want to respond, slowly began walking, the mages raised their magical weapons.

"Stop! You can't pass without identifying yourself."

"If I'm Rian, there's no way I'd have such a thing. Follow me to the main house and my family will vouch for me."

It seemed reasonable, but most spies used this approach, which was why identification was issued.

"Then wait here. We'll go to the Ogent main house to verify. Not just demons, but times aren't good."

Rian casually entered the Spirit Zone that five mages were simultaneously deploying.

"I cut down thousands of demons crossing the desert."

All the desert tribes swept by demons had perished, and their end was too horrible to speak of.

"But after cutting, cutting, and cutting more, you know what? Rather than demons, humans became disgusting."

The mage's heart raced faster as Rian approached.

"I don't want to waste time."

'I can't win.'

The moment he tried to do something, his head would fall.

"So please, as quickly as possible."

The mages' tension vanished like a lie.

The young man with a large sword on his back, simply looking up at the sky indifferently, might not have shown any killing intent from the beginning.

'I was the only one mistaken. He never even thought of fighting us, but...'

Because he was so strong, they had been frightened.

"Stand aside."

At the mage's instruction, his subordinates opened the way, and the investigator also made a sound and leaned against the wall.

"Thank you for fighting for humanity."

As the mage politely bowed, Rian also nodded and passed between them.

'Is home safe?'

Though the blood was gone, the ogres' claw marks that had mercilessly scratched every wall weighed heavy on his heart.

"Rian! You're safe!"

When he arrived at the main house guided by assistant butler Temuran, Reina ran out barefoot.

Though Rian's embraced body reeked of blood, Reina was relieved since it was someone else's blood.

"I thought something happened and was worried! How thoughtless of you. How could you not send even one letter?"

Rian was the puzzled one.

"Why are you at the main house, sister?"

Whether or not it was combat, she had mountains of work to do as a royal court musician.

"I brought her."

Ogent Klump came down the stairs.

"Grandfather."

"What happened? I heard Shirone passed the Ivory Tower test, but..."

Reina interrupted.

"First, go wash up. I'll prepare dinner right away. Head butler, please hurry with the remaining ingredients."

"Understood."

Head butler Lewis bowed with his right arm, severed below the elbow, wrapped in bandages.

It was a wound from a demon.

Rian showed no particular emotion and asked Klump.

"What about big brother?"

The family's eldest son, Ogent Gai.

He had passed the civil service exam early and held an important position in the Kingdom of Tormia, but had become a spy out of thorough patriotism.

"I don't know. No contact for three years. He's either still active in foreign countries or dead."

In the Ogent family, Gai was a painful name.

"I see..."

Klump, who had been staring at Rian heading to the bathroom, asked.

"Are you planning to wander the world again? This hell?"

"I have to."

Though he was proud of his grandson, Klump also wished Rian would stay in Tormia to protect his sister.

"Parting with Shirone is unusual. Weren't you two inseparable?"

"...That's why I left."

Though he didn't know what enlightenment was, he understood that he couldn't take Shirone's pain for him.

"If I stay by his side, it becomes harder for him. I'll find my own way to help Shirone."

Klump realized he couldn't hold Rian back.

"Follow me to the training ground."

Though Rian and Reina looked puzzled, Klump strode out of the mansion showing his broad back.

Rian's personal training ground.

With Reina watching anxiously, Rian and Klump faced each other with a 10-meter gap between them.

'It's been a long time.'

The place where he had been beaten to death by sword instructor Kite and ran a hundred laps every day.

It was also where he had lost in a real sword duel to Shirone, who had now become his reason for living.

'Grandfather's reason for choosing this place specifically is...'

It must be to tell his grandson, who was throwing himself toward an irreversible future, to look back one last time.

"Are you ready?"

Klump said, emanating fighting spirit.

"Yes."

Though Rian had faced numerous swordsmen through his knight's journey, this was his first time facing a 3rd-grade certified swordsman.

In military terms, he was a general equivalent to a division commander, with only two corps commanders and one field marshal above him.

"Why are the men in this family always dueling?"

Though she should be used to it by now, even Reina couldn't keep her legs still this time.

'Grandfather is serious.'

Even in the dim surroundings where torches barely allowed them to distinguish what was ahead, she felt she could see the shimmer of fighting spirit Klump was emanating.

"You've crossed many battlefields too. Considering my grandson's reputation, I'll do my best to kill you."

Rian's expression remained unchanged, and he took his stance so slowly it would make observers drowsy.

"..."

Klump, who had been glaring at Rian with tiger-like eyes, suddenly lowered his sword and extended his hand.

"Hand it over."

"Hand what over?"

"<Idea>. It's originally mine, so I'll fight with it."

Rian narrowed his steps and said with an incredulous face.

"Why is this grandfather's sword? You gave it to me, so it's mine."

"But we're fighting each other now, aren't we? Then naturally I should use it, why should you use it?"

"Ah, really, just grab anything! Does someone who's a general want to steal his grandson's weapon?"

"Hey, forget it! I won't do it! If you don't give me that, I absolutely won't do it!"

Not only Reina, but even Lewis and Temuran watching nearby stood with their mouths agape.

"Then don't do it! You call a tired person and make unreasonable demands!"

As Rian sheathed his sword and walked toward the mansion entrance, Klump's eyes became gentle.

"You've become strong, Rian. Really strong."

Not being obsessed with victory even when facing a general meant he had already transcended the bonds of winning and losing.

"Those who realize what they possess don't peek at what others have."

"I don't know difficult words. Anyway, I'm glad everyone's safe. I'll eat and leave right away."

Reina was shocked.

"Tonight? Without even sleeping?"

"I'll sleep in the carriage. Leaving right now won't change the world, but..."

It was the secret of time that Shirone had taught him.

"The enemies are also moving without rest. If it's a race running the same time, even one minute is significant."

When Rian sleeps, enemies also sleep, and when Rian fights, enemies are also fighting.

Then the side that saves one minute wins.

'Shirone.'

According to rumors he heard returning to Tormia, Shirone was still traveling the world without rest, eliminating Spirit Zones.

'Probably to save one completely unrelated person.'

Though he couldn't stay by his side, this was the only way to lighten Shirone's burden.

'Sigh, you really don't change.'

He could no longer even guess how heavy the burden on Rian's shoulders was as he returned to the mansion.

'A few years ago, he was no match for me.'

His youngest brother who had no discernible talent, was dense in personality, and selfish.

'But he had one thing.'

Even if a being called Buddha were to destroy the world, Rian would never give up until the very end.

'Go, my brother.'

Reina watched her brother's back walking far away and extended her palm.
