[680] The Five Senses Emerge (4)

Although Chagall only had one dagger left, his attacks on Etela were simultaneous and relentless.

Dozens of cuts appeared on Etela's limbs as she maintained a defensive posture while protecting her vital organs.

Her superhumanly trained muscles refused to allow even a drop of blood to flow, but even that was reaching its limit now.

As her schema function rapidly declined and her consciousness faded, Chagall irritably delivered a kick.

Instead of the sharp attacks that had been cutting into her flesh, he pushed her entire torso away, sending Etela tumbling backward.

"Why?"

Though Chagall ranked among the world's top hundred in cruelty, he wasn't a born psychopath, so his insides churned with frustration.

"Why won't you fight back?"

The Grassleaf Circus had never existed in this world.

The reason he couldn't cry out in denial, despite having his clear memories perceived through his five senses rejected, was because deep in his subconscious lay the thought that perhaps it could be true.

'Only the scent remains vivid.'

Though he possessed superhuman olfactory abilities that humans lacked, the perfume of events didn't convey visual information to him.

Only the memory of remembering vividly existed—when he delved deeper, even Tia's face wouldn't come to mind.

"Archbishop Raphael didn't kill you."

Chagall, awakening from his thoughts, glared down at the fallen Etela.

"If that was my master's dying wish, then I will honor it."

"Dying wish? He didn't kill me?"

Chagall strode forward and pressed his dagger to Etela's throat.

"Does talking like that raise your master's honor even a little? I killed him. What reason would he have to spare me, the world's greatest assassin?"

Etela recalled Archbishop Raphael's teachings.

"Having the power to destroy evil doesn't make one good. Isn't that the same for you?"

Since her limbs had no strength left, Etela could only turn her head to meet Chagall's eyes.

"Sacrifice. The courage to burn oneself for good and even embrace evil. My master said that was the true value of goodness."

"Stop spouting nonsense."

There had been times when he lived by forgiveness.

Because he believed someone else would forgive him too.

But it was always evil that committed wrongs.

The only way to purify the world was to eliminate all possibilities of evil.

"Can you tell me what words your master left just before he died?"

"I don't remember."

Chagall shook his head as if his neck had stiffened.

"It doesn't matter. I realized it the moment I saw you."

"Realized what? What could someone like you know about me?"

He felt he needed to kill this woman as quickly as possible.

"If you kill all the evil in the world, will a world of good come?"

Chagall pressed the dagger against Etela's throat and exhaled roughly through his nose.

"The battle between good and evil isn't that simple. Peace will only come when all evil has turned to good. My master wanted to convey that grand aspiration."

Chagall's voice squeezed out like it was being wrung from him.

"No. What do you know..."

If one day all humans suddenly turned to good hearts, the world's suffering would disappear as if by magic.

It was clearly possible.

And such an easy thing to accomplish—yet why couldn't humanity reach that point, and why did they even consider it impossible?

"What pain I've suffered—someone like you couldn't know!"

Chagall grabbed Etela's throat and gripped the dagger in reverse, bringing it down toward her forehead.

Forgive him.

The blade stopped just before Etela's eyes.

'Leader.'

Why had Raiden said such words just before dying?

'What? What am I supposed to forgive?'

Chagall raised his arm again.

"Aaaaah!"

You must forgive! Chagall!

"Gak! Gak!"

As if someone had grabbed his wrist, his arm wouldn't come down, and Chagall cried out while shedding tears.

'Why did you kill them? Why!'

Had Raiden discovered that everything was fake?

Was that why he had cruelly erased even Tia, whom his student had loved so dearly, from the world?

'It's too late! There's no going back now!'

Though he had lied to Etela, he hadn't forgotten for even a moment since killing Raphael.

The path back lies behind you.

"What am I supposed to do!"

After losing everyone he loved, he had killed countless humans.

Since anyone could choose evil, he had destroyed all possibilities regardless of good or evil.

"But fake? Tia didn't exist? My entire life was an illusion?"

That was unacceptable.

"No! Tia was real! My life was real! I'm a murderer! The worst of evil!"

Chagall threw down his dagger and straddled Etela, shaking her shoulders.

"You're Tia! Tell me the truth! You're Tia!"

If those words came from her mouth, he felt he could laugh even while falling into hell right now.

"No. I don't know you."

"Shut up! You're Tia!"

Chagall showered Etela with kisses as he had with Tia.

'Yes, it has to be Tia.'

The familiar scent of saliva, sweat, flesh.

"Damn it! Why can't I remember!"

There was only scent.

'La Enemy.'

As she accepted Chagall's kisses in her defenseless state, Etela recalled La's chilling will.

'I don't know what you're trying to accomplish by going this far, but things won't go according to your plan.'

"Tia! Tia!"

Nemesis appeared on Etela's hand, and imagination became reality.

"Ti..."

Chagall lifted his torso with a surprised expression and looked around.

Chagall! Clean up quickly! The show starts in 2 hours!

Wow, your trapeze skills have really improved!

Events from the Grassleaf Circus flashed by rapidly.

Chagall, you're the ace from now on.

The troupe members who had been precious as family, Tia, even the audience—nothing had human form, all dissolved into writhing black smoke.

"Uh... uh... uh..."

Chagall's mouth slowly opened and his eyes rolled upward.

"My master was like a father to me."

At Etela's voice, Chagall caught his consciousness and looked down at her.

Tears flowed from her eyes behind her glasses.

"I hate you enough to die. But... I will love you as much as I feel that hatred."

The moment one is consumed by anger, good loses to evil.

"So come back. Come back and set everything right."

Chagall staggered to his feet, his soul shaken.

'Come back?'

He wasn't afraid of dying.

Just as Etela could endure any pain for good, Chagall too was one who had let go of everything at evil's extreme.

'That's impossible.'

There was something he absolutely had to do before paying the price.

'I'll kill him.'

He would drag La Enemy, who had thoroughly toyed with his life, before him and stab him.

'Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!'

Just imagining it amplified his rage and made his hands tremble.

'Kill! Kill! I'll kill him!'

"Teacher Etela!"

Shirone fired photon cannons in rapid succession.

The power was strong enough to cave in walls, but Chagall had already launched himself onto the building's roof.

After checking on Etela, Shirone's eyes blazed with intensity.

"You! What did you do to the teacher!"

Etela sat up and said:

"I'm fine, Shirone."

"Teacher!"

"Let him go. I have a plan."

Having heard that much, Chagall turned his head slightly from the railing.

"...What's your name?"

"Romy Etela."

"Etela."

Tia had never existed in this world.

"Don't wait. I'm not going back."

As soon as he finished speaking, Chagall vanished.

Shirone, who had been glaring fiercely at the rooftop, softened his expression and ran to Etela.

"Teacher, are you alright?"

Though she was holding on with her schema abilities, her wounds were too deep for immediate recovery.

'For Teacher Etela to be beaten like this...'

Come to think of it, everyone was dead.

Not just the goblins, Pidu, and Tubo, but even his own mercenary members.

'All these numbers, by himself?'

As Etela leaned against the building wall, Shirone emerged from his thoughts and asked:

"Teacher, why did you just let him go?"

"He's unforgivable. He'll continue committing countless murders."

"Then all the more reason..."

"You must realize it now too, Shirone."

Shirone closed his mouth.

"Everything that's happened so far isn't coincidence. It's the design of someone who remains outside causality."

"La Enemy."

Etela nodded.

"My master already knew. That humanity are already La Enemy's puppets, and that we can't distinguish what's real from what's fake. Three of the Five Senses have already gathered in Radum. Considering Mayray's case, he's capable of manipulating events on a cosmic scale."

Was it really coincidence that Mayray had awakened from her dream during the oracle?

Humans make puppets dance, but the puppets think they're dancing on their own.

"Honestly, I don't know myself. Whether sending Chagall away was my pure will or part of La Enemy's design. If I had taken revenge on Chagall, would that have been an event outside La Enemy's design?"

In the end, nothing could be known.

"La Enemy has strength completely different from any enemy we've fought before. If he had wanted to kill you, Shirone, it would have been far too easy."

"Probably so."

He would have died.

Whether Miro killed him, Gaold killed him, or the entire world came after Shirone—La Enemy had the ability to create such events.

"I don't understand his intentions—that's my honest assessment. That's probably why my master didn't kill Chagall either. He decided to die first to find out exactly what La Enemy was after."

It was a judgment befitting someone who had reached the extremes of detachment.

"I plan to follow my master's will too. If any choice we make can't escape La's snare, we have no choice but to watch and wait for an opportunity. When all Five Senses—humanity's sum total of perceived reality—gather, there will surely be a chance."

"Can we win?"

Could humanity break free from La Enemy's bonds?

"It's not a matter of choice. We need a compass. Someone who can judge and act by absolute standards, beyond emotions, beliefs, events, or variables."

That was none other than Carr.

"It will be a difficult battle. But it's not without hope."

Etela looked back at Shirone.

"Go to Jinhwa. Even if we're under his design, what we can do is meet La Enemy."

Shirone looked toward Jinhwa.

Considering why La Enemy hadn't killed those who excelled in specific senses, ultimately those who would come would come and those who would die would die.

'I can't accept it.'

Humans are not puppets.

"I'll go and come back, Teacher."

Though she was injured, Etela should be able to protect herself.

"You must never break."

Shirone smiled, offered a brief moment of silence for the dead mercenaries, and flew up into the sky.

As Shirone disappeared, Etela's expression filled with sadness again.

'Master, I'm sorry.'

She had ended up saying she hated him.

Because it was genuine feeling that broke through her will, she was afraid, and lacked confidence to fight the great evil that would come.

'You shouldn't have left like that. It's too great a burden for me. Can I do it?'

Could she truly forgive Chagall?

Raindrops began to fall on Etela's face as she looked up at the gray sky.
