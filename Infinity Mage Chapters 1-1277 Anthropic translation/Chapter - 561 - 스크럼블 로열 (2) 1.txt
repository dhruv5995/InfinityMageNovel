[561] Scramble Royal (2)

While Maya was filling her tray with food, the men's gazes steadily followed her.

Her beautiful appearance was one thing, but the extent of her transformation was so remarkable it was almost mystifying.

"She really has become beautiful. Those drawings in the red book weren't lies after all."

Amy turned to Nade and asked.

"Red book? What's that?"

"Huh? Ahaha! It's nothing."

This was something he could never tell Amy about.

"But anyway, what's the occasion? Is it because of Shirone?"

Even to Amy's thinking, that seemed like the only reason.

Shirone had left for heaven, but Maya had never shown her face even once despite being at the school.

She looked lonelier than before, and Amy felt uncomfortable knowing that Shirone had contributed to the current situation.

As if reading her thoughts, Amy sighed and said.

"Let's ask her to eat with us."

"But..."

While Amy had forgiven him, Nade wasn't dense enough not to realize it had been his last chance.

"It's really okay. We still have 15 weeks left - we can't keep going like this, can we?"

Judging Amy's words to be reasonable, Nade called out as if trying to ease Shirone's burden.

"Maya, come over here! Let's eat together!"

Maya, who had been picking at her food, put down her utensils and walked over to Shirone's group, though she didn't bring her tray with her.

"It's been a while, everyone."

Maya's smile was as kind as ever, but perhaps because her appearance had changed, the atmosphere was completely different from before.

"Yeah, it really has been a while. How have you been?"

Maya just shook her head and said to Amy.

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. But I felt like I should meet you and say hello at least once."

"What's with the formal greetings between us? Don't be like that and come sit down. We always used to eat together before."

"No, today is the last time. I won't have any reason to come to the cafeteria from now on."

All the graduating students were paying attention to Maya's words.

"You won't come? Why?"

"You know why, Amy."

Amy's brow furrowed slightly.

"That's a bit unreasonable, isn't it? You're an adult too. That kind of statement just burdens us. If there's something bothering you, how about confronting it and resolving it?"

At Amy's unchanged demeanor even after meeting for the first time in so long, Maya smiled bitterly.

"I envy you, Amy."

"What? What's that supposed to mean, all of a sudden?"

"I'm sorry. But I'm not as strong as you. Yes, even if I'm burdening you all, this is all I can do. Because I know all too well that I can't endure it."

Maya added in a small voice.

"So please bear with it. I know it's selfish, but I'm determined to graduate this time no matter what."

They could feel what kind of resolve had brought her here.

"And Shirone."

"Yeah?"

"Honestly, it was really hard. It hurt so much."

"Uh, that's..."

"It's okay. I can endure it now. But that doesn't mean I've completely forgotten you."

The cafeteria buzzed with murmurs, and amid that noise, someone clenched their fist with angry emotions.

'As expected, she still has feelings for Shirone...'

"So if you ever change your mind, you can come find me anytime. I'll be waiting."

"Whew."

A whistle sound passed by.

"But if that's not the case..."

Maya hesitated, then put strength in her eyes and said.

"I hope we never encounter each other until the graduation exam. You can understand my feelings, can't you?"

Shirone pushed aside his complicated emotions and nodded.

"Yeah, I understand."

While he felt sorry for Maya, his heart didn't flutter as much as when Amy had given him her ultimatum.

Then suddenly he had this thought.

Perhaps the tears he had shed last night weren't only because of sadness over Peope.

Maya's eyes filled with sadness, having expected a more desperate reaction.

'What was I expecting?'

Had she thought that by cornering herself like this, Shirone would shed tears and hold onto her?

Maya shook her head inwardly.

She had thought she had endured it, but seeing Shirone's face made her heart pound and threatened to crumble the resolve she had built over months like a sandcastle.

"Then... take care."

After giving her farewell greeting, Maya returned to her seat, handed her barely touched tray to the kitchen, and left the cafeteria.

While countless gazes followed her, Amy's gaze was particularly different.

'What's this? You're actually the strong one...'

Looking at Shirone chewing bread with a bitter expression, a sigh escaped from deep within her chest.

Until classes started, Shirone's group spent time at the school store.

Shirone confided about what had happened in the research society, and Amy, who had heard the whole story the night before, had no trouble understanding.

However, the underground research societies were news to her.

"Hide and Seek Research Society? There was such a research society at school?"

Nade answered.

"There are several others too. As long as they have enough members, they don't need to hold presentation meetings like us, so most people wouldn't know about them."

Indeed, the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society had become known largely due to the influence of their presentation meetings.

"But about those underclassmen - I sent them away for now, but why on earth were they tailing me?"

Iruki said.

"They're probably thinking similar thoughts to me. With graduation approaching, they're starting to move. To uncover the secrets of Estas."

"But they were quiet last year, weren't they?"

Nade stroked his chin and said.

"When you gave up on the evaluation, rumors spread around the school. Access to Estas was prohibited for a while. That included even us research society members."

"Ah..."

It was during the period when the National Intelligence Service had been infiltrating the school to find Gaold.

"Those guys have incredibly sharp instincts, so their switch got flipped. There's definitely something in Estas. What we caught today was the Hide and Seek Research Society, but there's a high possibility other research societies have already approached as well."

Shirone spread his arms in frustration.

"Just who is the president of the Hide and Seek Research Society anyway? You must know, right?"

"Yeah, I have a rough idea. The Hide and Seek Research Society operates the school's black market. I've also made and sold a few inventions there. The most likely candidate is probably..."

"Me."

At the suddenly heard voice, they turned to see Frings, currently ranked 3rd in the advanced class, standing there.

"As expected... it was you?"

Nade asked back with a displeased expression.

A face with long, thin eyelashes like petals and a thin mustache.

A typical genius with incredibly fast thinking speed, but with a perverted and sinister personality, he had never gotten along with Shirone's group.

Shirone glared with wide eyes.

"Why were you tailing me? And to instruct underclassmen to use attack magic - are you in your right mind?"

"Hehe, what's this about? The top star of the graduating class getting worked up over some underclassmen showing off a little."

His voice was as sleazy as his appearance.

"This is just the beginning. The Hide and Seek Research Society is hidden everywhere. For example, we also know that Amy entered your room yesterday for a secret meeting."

Shirone's eyebrows twitched.

While he wasn't inexperienced enough to be spied on, there was no way to hide Amy coming to his room.

'It's fine. They couldn't have gotten close.'

Unlike the relieved Shirone, Amy was indignant at the strange misunderstanding.

"Secret meeting, my foot. How is everything you think so vulgar?"

"Hehe, Amy. You still smell wonderful - no perfume could create the scent that comes from your body."

Frings sucked in air until his nostrils nearly touched, his eyelids fluttering before showing the whites of his eyes.

'Disgusting...'

Voyeurism, an obsession with scent to the point of madness, and a sleazy way of speaking.

He was a man who made you want to flee outside the world rather than live under the same sky.

"Anyway, you better look forward to it. 15 weeks until graduation. Most of the underground research societies are lying in wait."

Nade responded with a snort.

"Sure. You'll need to scrape together as many as possible. We're a small elite group."

Frings pointed at Shirone's group with his index finger under his nose.

"The mediocre Class One member, the graduating class's last place, and the runaway - quite a combination. I don't see any elite members ranked higher than me though?"

"This bastard!"

As Nade jumped up, Shirone grabbed his arm to stop him.

"Hold back. If we're confident, it doesn't matter."

Watching Frings walk away, Nade trembled with both fists.

"Something about that bastard just makes me want to beat him up like crazy. He's more infuriating than Iruki used to be!"

Iruki ignored the last comment.

"Anyway, war will start soon. From now on, we need to make full preparations too."

Amy raised her hand.

"Wait. Why are we getting involved in that? Let me be clear - I have no intention of getting involved in your 'stupid whatever' research society."

"Supernatural Psychic Science."

"Whatever it is, I'm not doing it. If it were about Shirone's portrait problem that would be different, but graduation is my top priority."

Shirone brought up the main point.

"Then let's organize this first. How many research societies total are targeting Estas?"

"Hmm, probably all the underground research societies are targeting it. Among them, the organization we need to be most wary of would be Fermi's Golden Ring."

It was the core hub driving the underground economy and the strongest research society with as many as 5 graduating class powerhouses as members.

"First there's Fermi as president, and his right-hand man Electric Monster Licon. For strategy there's Sona's Hercy, and for action there's Alchemy's Richard. And the other member is..."

Iruki pointed to the store window and said.

"There. Cayden."

Cayden of the Cross Star.

A handsome man with neatly combed reddish-brown hair and an honest-looking face.

Since it was the famous Golden Ring, Nade knew even the executives' positions, but he knew little about Cayden.

"Right, that makes 5 members forming a team. Their rankings are scattered now, but until the middle of the first half, they monopolized ranks 1 through 5."

Shirone asked.

"What rank is Cayden now?"

"Currently 7th."

"Wow, he's still Class One though."

When Cayden suddenly turned his head, Nade startled and ducked his head.

"Ugh! He's looking. Be careful. His sixth sense is incredible. If Dorothy has intuition, that guy has a sixth sense."

When Cayden, looking displeased as he glared at Shirone's group, left his seat, Nade pretended to wipe sweat.

"Phew, that was close."

Iruki asked.

"Why are you so nervous? That's not like you."

"That guy deserves some nervousness."

"Oh?"

It was something rarely heard from Nade.

"Actually, I'm not sure. Even within Golden Ring, there aren't many cases of Cayden being active. Honestly, his personality is on the straightforward side, so I don't understand why he gets along with Fermi."

"In other words, the feeling is strange."

Translated into Nade's language, it meant dangerous.

"Well, actually all of Golden Ring's members are persons of interest. Plus Fermi made a huge amount of money this time."

'Right, that's true.'

Shirone recalled the story he'd heard from Miro.

In exchange for forging signatures in Under Coder, Fermi had earned 190 billion gold.

Even with installment payments, over 10 billion gold was coming in, so the level of magic he wielded would be on a completely different dimension from before.

"Good, Golden Ring is noted. And next?"

Nade held up his index and middle fingers.

"The second strongest force is definitely the Hide and Seek Research Society. They operate their own market and Frings' abilities aren't inferior to Golden Ring either. You know about Fisho's Ant Language Research Society without me saying, and the Doll Collecting Research Society isn't a level to ignore either. The president is none other than Anchal."

"Anchal? That was an underground research society?"

Shirone looked back at the straight-haired woman drinking coffee and reading a book on the terrace side.

She wore an eyepatch over her left eye, but she wasn't one-eyed.

From what he'd heard, she wore the eyepatch to seal the energy of the Demon Eye accumulated by her family for generations, and there had been an interview where a scout said that if she had released the seal during last year's graduation exam, she would have been the valedictorian.

"What rank is Anchal now?"

"9th."

'She's Class One too.'

Most surprising was that she occupied a high class without even using her secret weapon.

"Golden Ring, Hide and Seek, Ant Language, Doll Collecting. Are you saying all the members of these places are enemies?"

Iruki waved his finger.

"No, there's still one more left. When discussing underground research societies, it would be disappointing to leave this research society out."

"Huh? What did we leave out?"

Nade made a serious expression and said.

"The Female Anatomy Research Society."
