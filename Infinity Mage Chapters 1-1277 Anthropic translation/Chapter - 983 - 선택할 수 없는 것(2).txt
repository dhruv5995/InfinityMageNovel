What Cannot Be Chosen (2)

It was hasty to judge someone solely by their missing arm, but Shiina knew in her heart.

"Kuan?"

The man who had sheathed his sword slowly turned around.

Except for his closed right eye, he looked exactly like the Kuan that Shiina remembered.

"Are you alright?"

Shiina ran toward Kuan.

She couldn't tell whether she wanted to embrace him or give him a refreshing slap across the face.

'You bastard.'

It would be a slap.

'I won't just take it lying down either.'

The moment she put strength into her shoulders and accelerated her steps, Kuan's face came into view.

A sword scar carved into his right eye.

The short diagonal wound was clearly not just a cut to the skin, but had pierced the eye itself.

'You're really a bastard.'

Her arm swung with all her might, but before that, her face was buried in Kuan's chest.

"Why..."

Hot tears soaked Kuan's chest.

"Why are you so foolish..."

The demon race's power that she had experienced was on a completely different level from the enemies they had fought before.

But Kuan's swordsmanship had reached a realm that far transcended even them.

That was the kind of wound it was.

Kuan wrapped his one arm around her back and spoke, trying his best to exclude emotion.

"I'm fine."

Hadn't he protected her because of it?

If he could protect her in exchange for losing one eye, it would be getting off cheap, but...

'This much isn't enough.'

Knowing the strength of the enemies, Kuan was prepared to pay much more.

"Let's go. Where are the others?"

Shiina's eyes turned fierce as she pushed against Kuan's chest.

"That's it? You leave without a word, then suddenly come back and that's all you have to say?"

"That's right."

He was so calm it was rather absurd.

"Then why did you come? Why did you come down to such a remote place? You should have plenty of places to fight."

He didn't know.

When Sirone told him to do what his heart wanted to do, the first thing that came to mind was Shiina.

'What was I expecting?'

He still maintained a form that could be called human, but how long could he really keep it up?

In Kuan's mind, he could see his future self - limbs severed, reduced to a lump of meat.

"It's part of strategy. I have nothing left. You should give up too, Miss Shiina."

"Uh..."

She opened and closed her lips trying to speak, then closed her mouth and made a cold expression.

At that moment, demons who had come running after hearing the explosions from the strike team filled the front area black.

"Kekeke. What's this, you?"

They were ogres about 3 meters tall, with muscular bodies without skin and dozens of mouths attached.

Even with a talisman covering their faces vertically, the disgusting feeling couldn't be suppressed.

Brigade Commander Kereru.

One way to rank ogres was by the number of mouths, and Kereru had as many as 237 mouths.

"Stand back."

Kuan blocked the front with a serious expression.

'A high-ranking ogre.'

An ordinary ogre had the energy efficiency to digest a loaf of bread in 2 seconds.

'That's why they're always hungry, but...'

Once an ogre's belly was full, it was one of the most troublesome demons to deal with.

Kuan drew his sword.

"I'll lure them as far away as possible, so get out of here."

"No. I'll fight too."

"They're stronger than the turtle monsters. Your current skill level can't handle them."

"That doesn't matter to you, does it?"

At her cold tone with lingering resentment, Kuan frowned and looked back at her.

"I only have one arm."

The bitter emotion was conveyed directly.

"I can't fight while holding you."

Just as Shiina's eyebrows formed a sad expression, Kereru burst into laughter.

"Puhehehe!"

The sight of tongues shooting out like rainbows from mouths all over his body made her feel nauseous.

"So that's how it is. Even if you die, that woman... Hm? But what to do? I'm definitely going to eat that woman first. Puhehehe!"

A subordinate frowned.

"Stop laughing. You're making us hungry too."

Kereru became serious.

"Right, let's hurry."

As demonic aura rose from the pack of carnivorous killer ogres, Shiina's shoulders trembled.

The first demon.

The desire to feed that had existed since the moment life was born made her mind hazy.

'I need to run.'

Just before spatial movement's omniscience and omnipotence combined, Kereru had charged right up to her.

The demon's face was reflected in Shiina's retina, but the signal hadn't reached her brain yet.

'Huh?'

When she came to her senses, she was no longer there, and all the events that had occurred in that instant came flooding back.

'Kuan.'

She could feel his one arm - the only one he could swing - wrapped around her waist.

Shiina bit her lip and said.

"Because of me..."

"Get it together. This is just the beginning."

At those words, Shiina raised her head and saw demons moving at tremendous speed.

'They're chasing this?'

Even an ordinary ogre's energy metabolism was 30 times that of a human, and carnivorous killer ogres were 240 times.

"Over there! Over there!"

Even though the voices sounded distant, they had the strange feeling of being close by in an instant, when Kuan said.

"You might lose consciousness."

"What..."

The moment Shiina opened her mouth.

Clown Pierrot.

Super Tilt.

The landscape tilted more than 70 degrees, and flat ground transformed into a cliff as vast as the world.

"Heuup!"

Gravity shook her stomach, and the shock of all the blood in her body flowing backward due to acceleration hit her.

"Heuuuu!"

The world rotated.

In that landscape, afterimages of demons were passing across her retina at tremendous speed.

'Where is this?'

Having lost her sense of direction, Shiina was semi-forcibly taking in the scenery.

Sky and earth meshed vertically, then began tilting sharply to one side.

'We're falling.'

That was the only way to think about this gravity.

"Ahhhhh!"

But the landscape waiting beneath her feet was sky covered with white clouds.

She was falling into the sky.

'And this is...'

The world that the person called Kuan lived in.

'So twisted.'

Confessing love or holding hands and taking a leisurely stroll were things she couldn't even dream of.

Shiina's eyes grew hot.

'But still...'

The sea of sky they were looking at together was so beautiful that she simply couldn't give up.

"Mr. Kuan, I..."

Just as she was about to voice her resolve, Shiina's stomach convulsed.

"Ugh!"

Her cheeks puffed up from the urge to vomit, but she couldn't bring herself to throw up on Kuan.

"Miss Shiina."

The landscape made half a turn, and finally the feeling of standing on solid ground spread through her whole body.

Probably they hadn't gone up very far, but in any case, enduring it was what mattered.

"Urk! Urk!"

Kuan patted her back.

"Throw up if you want to. The gravitational acceleration kept changing, so it's natural."

She endured it and whispered fiercely.

"Is that the problem right now? The demons are—"

When she stopped talking, they could hear enemies shouting as they searched for Kuan and Shiina from all directions.

"Come out! Where are you!"

"Cowardly bastard! Come out quickly! Do you think we'd be this hungry?"

They were in the midst of scattered demons, and none of the enemies could find Kuan's location.

'This really is like a circus.'

Kuan said.

"They rapidly consumed energy, so they won't be able to fight like before. Now we just need to clean them up."

They were all just shouting loudly, but their shoulders were drooping, and finally even their voices gave out.

"I'll do it."

Since she wasn't the type to steal the spotlight, Kuan frowned even more with his closed eyes.

"I need to get used to it from now on."

Smiling as she spoke, she focused her eyes and unleashed ice magic in all directions.

Thick icicles struck precisely into the gaping mouths of the carnivorous killer ogres, and screams erupted.

When the view cleared, Kereru, who had still been looking around, finally spotted Kuan.

"How dare you mock me!"

His stance for kicking off the ground was good, but he was incomparably slower than before.

"Kreuuuu!"

From Kereru's stomach came a rumbling of hunger so intense it could be mistaken for thunder.

"Wait! I'll chew you up!"

Grabbing a surviving subordinate, he embraced him with both arms as mouths all over his body began moving.

"Kraaa! Kraaa!"

"Endure it. I'll get revenge for you."

As hundreds of mouths sucked at the flesh with slurping sounds, Shiina made a disgusted expression again.

"Now I can live a little."

Kereru threw the withered subordinate to the ground and glared at Kuan.

"I won't just kill you..."

Kuan's form disappeared.

At the same time, the ground tilted in Kereru's vision, finally flipping completely 180 degrees.

"What the hell?!"

Even as he fell toward the sky, flailing his arms and waving his hands, he didn't realize.

He didn't realize that his head, severed by Kuan, had separated from his body and was rising toward the sky.

As his face spun round and round, the world spun, and unbearable motion sickness welled up.

"Uaaaah!"

The head fell with a thud and rolled on the ground.

Shiina stared blankly at Kereru's body still flailing its arms.

"Let's go."

When Kuan returned after sheathing his sword, she snapped back to her senses and quickly turned her head.

"Right!"

Sade seemed to have escaped safely, but demons were still gathered in the central building.

"The principal is still there. He's surrounded by demons—"

At that moment, an explosion erupted from the central building.

"My goodness..."

Where Shiina turned her head, a giant mushroom cloud was rising into the sky.

'Keke. Kekeke.'

Alpheas, crushed under building debris, burst into laughter.

"Alpheas! Are you okay? Hey!"

Forgetting that blood was flowing from her head, Olivia crawled over and shook his body.

"Don't worry. I won't die from something like this."

When she examined him with light magic, a huge pillar had crushed both his knees.

"...Why did you do that?"

When the demons entered the building, Olivia had tried to cast self-destruction magic.

But Alpheas had been faster.

"A bomb?"

He had pressed the detonation switch for bombs stored underground while protecting Olivia with magic.

"Why? Are you going to sue me?"

Storing explosive materials in a school was strictly illegal, but Olivia chuckled.

"So this was what you were confident about? And you call yourself a mage."

"It doesn't matter, whether it's magic or bombs."

"...That's so like you."

Like the young Alpheas who used to think that whether it was light particles or waves, beauty was all that mattered.

"Wait. Let me get your legs out first."

As Olivia tried to lift the pillar with magic, Alpheas grimaced.

"Stop. It's probably buried 10 meters underground. If you mess with it wrong here, we'll die from being crushed."

"It's the same either way. A secondary collapse will happen soon. We have no choice but to try, whether it works or not."

"Don't."

At Alpheas's voice, different from usual, Olivia gently looked back at him.

"Could you... stay with me a little longer?"

He already knew.

There was no way for two people whose strength was exhausted to escape from underground.

"Alright."

Olivia squeezed into the narrow space and lay down next to Alpheas.

It was quiet.

"What are you thinking about? Your wife?"

"I'm not that shameless. I already said goodbye to her. Before the demons came."

"Then?"

"I was wondering if this too was pathetic..."

Alpheas turned his head.

"It wasn't that I had no feelings. When you confessed, I thought I could live a new life. I'm sorry. I didn't have the courage."

Olivia's eyes welled up with tears.

"You're telling me this now? Idiot."

"Keke, at least you heard it while alive, right?"

She nodded with a grin and gently stroked Alpheas's cheek.

Just as she turned off the light magic and slowly brought her lips closer, a stream of light flowed in from outside.

"Hm?"

The next moment, the entire building debris began to slowly rise, pulled by some force.

"Principal! Are you alright?"

Sirone's face appeared above the pit, and above him, a giant hand of light was gripping the debris.
