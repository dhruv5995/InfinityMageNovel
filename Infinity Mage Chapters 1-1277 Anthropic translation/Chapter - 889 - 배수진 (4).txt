**Back to the Wall (4)**

The Valkyrie 2nd Corps, positioned across various locations, rapidly marched toward the Kanian Plateau.

Morale was at its worst.

"Tch! Is this what I get after dedicating my whole life to training? Becoming meat shields for the demons?"

"Didn't you hear the general? It's war anyway. We're not being dragged there with our hands tied - we're going to fight."

"Bullshit. Those who are meant to live will live. You heard about it too, the magic corps lieutenant colonel."

Personnel transfers were common in the military, but in situations requiring noble sacrifice like now, they were potent poison.

"I heard she knows people at the top brass. Must be nice. Fight when you want to fight, bail when you want to bail."

"She's a woman, right? Well, that's obvious. How many guys did she have to do it with to save her one life..."

Someone cut him off.

"Hey, infantry."

The members of the Magic Corps 6th Battalion walking beside them were radiating killing intent.

"Watch your mouth. Keep that up and you'll get your face torn apart."

The infantry soldiers checked the insignia on their uniforms and shut their mouths with displeased expressions.

'Damn annoying mages.'

Even with the same rank, the treatment infantry and mages received in the army was worlds apart.

"Did I say anything wrong?"

Normally it would have ended there, but with the stress of death, the infantry soldiers were also extremely sensitive.

"Just because you can cast some magic, you get all high and mighty. If your superior ran away, you should be ashamed. Or what? Did you guys also get some scraps from that woman?"

"What? That woman?"

Berick from the magic corps broke military law and left formation to grab the infantry soldier by the throat.

"Say that again. That woman?"

"Ugh! Let go!"

If they were in close quarters, the infantry soldier had ways to respond, but he didn't want to get dragged into the same mess.

"Back off, you idiot. If you want to die, die alone. Don't drag me into it."

"Why? You were all excited to talk when insulting the lieutenant colonel, but looks like you don't want to die either?"

The company commander's voice fell like thunder.

"What's going on!"

Berick's comrades from the magic corps held him back, and the infantry soldiers' faces turned pale.

The infantry company commander confirmed that a magic corps soldier had left formation.

"Have you lost your minds! Is war a joke! You two, out of line! I'll have you executed under military law!"

Since military discipline was all the Valkyrie could rely on currently, the company commander showed no mercy.

"That's enough."

Since all commanders would think the same way, the company commander couldn't hide his anger as he turned his head.

"Ah...?"

Corps Commander Garcia was sitting on horseback.

"Attention!"

It wasn't by chance that he had come out to patrol the troops along the long column and stopped by the 6th Battalion.

'So this is how it happens.'

This was why even with the authority of the Valkyrie's supreme commander, saving just one person was all he could manage.

'It would have been better if there were no exceptions, but...'

What he had realized through countless battles with demons was that the supreme commander's strategy transcended human understanding.

'There must be a reason.'

Whether personal feelings or a larger strategic picture, he had no complaints about his decisions.

"What's your position?"

Garcia asked Berick.

"Corporal Berick! 6th Battalion, 3rd Squad Leader! My role is flame magic long-range support and area extermination!"

"Your action to defend your superior's honor is right. But you cannot achieve what you want by breaking military law."

"I'm sorry!"

Since soldiers couldn't speak at length, they were bound to put all their emotions into one shout.

Garcia confirmed Berick's eyes that said he would gladly accept any punishment.

"Return to formation. If the same thing happens again, I'll execute you immediately."

"Yes!"

As Berick quickly ran back to join formation, his watching comrades let out sighs.

"Hey, are you crazy? What were you trying to do? Don't you know the unit's atmosphere is really bad right now?"

"I acted without thinking. Don't worry. I won't make this mistake again."

"You... you really liked the battalion commander, didn't you?"

He had felt it since Amy took away the resolution, but he didn't know it was this serious.

"Forget it. It's all in the past."

Berick's expression, lost in thought, returned to that of a soldier.

"It's actually better this way. She's not someone I could protect anyway, and with one of the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower as her lover..."

He just had to think that their world was separate.

"Contact!"

A sound came from the front.

"Contact! Contact!"

Reports were transmitted from the front of the column, and all soldiers simultaneously took combat positions.

"What, suddenly?"

They were moving while avoiding demon forces as much as possible.

"Right flank, 45 degrees!"

The moment soldiers turned their heads at the transmitted instructions, a loud explosion burst forth.

"Kiiaaaa!"

Demons burst out from the forest on the high hill and began charging down the slope.

"Magic corps! To positions!"

The demons numbered only a few hundred at most and were annihilated by the army's artillery.

"Stragglers? But there shouldn't be any battles?"

While numerous eyes watched the forest, wary of additional forces, grass rustled.

"They're coming! Prepare!"

Just as the company commander was about to give the order to fire, branches parted and Amy appeared.

"Phew, found you."

Though it was a place where thousands of lungs were breathing, surprisingly not a single breath could be heard.

"Battalion commander..."

The first to realize were the 6th Battalion, her direct subordinates, and words came from other units too.

"Who is that? The uniform is Valkyrie."

"Make way."

As Garcia rode his horse with high-ranking commanders, the troops parted like water.

Though Garcia was also glad to see her, his expression was rather cold.

"Lieutenant Colonel, why are you here?"

Amy pulled out an official document from her chest, then lowered it and saluted.

"Reporting! Lieutenant Colonel Karmis Amy! As of this time, I have been ordered to return to the Magic Corps 6th Battalion!"

"Huh?"

The 6th Battalion soldiers looked at each other, then raised both arms and cheered.

"Waaaaaah!"

It felt like they had won the war.

The excited Berick pointed at the infantry soldier he had grabbed by the collar earlier and shouted.

"See that! This is the magic corps! This is us!"

The infantry soldier who had been watching Berick also smirked and shrugged his shoulders.

In a situation where morale was visibly rising, Garcia also regained his smile.

"Ten minutes' rest."

It was the maximum consideration he could give in an urgent situation, and the division commander raised his hand and shouted.

"With this, there are no stragglers in the 2nd Corps! We will fight together, die together, and win together! We are one!"

"We are one!"

Though unintended, Amy's return breathed life into the unit shrouded in despair.

As Amy slid down the hill and joined the column, her subordinates gathered around.

"Battalion commander! What happened? Have you really returned?"

Amy raised her fist.

"Of course. I said I'd be back soon. Don't tell me you guys... didn't believe me?"

"Haha! How could that be? We firmly believed that only you could command the strongest 6th Battalion."

"You guys always with the words..."

Amy approached Berick, who was standing with a sullen expression, and poked his ribs.

"Hey, did you miss me? Huh? Did you miss me?"

"Ah, stop it!"

When he responded more prickly than expected, Amy blinked her big eyes and asked.

"Why is this one acting like this? Do you have complaints about me?"

"Haha! He's like that because he's too happy. Actually, this guy just had it out with those infantry soldiers over there..."

"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"

Berick frantically screamed to cut him off, then made a fierce expression and said.

"If you're coming, just come. Don't make a fuss. Let's not be embarrassing."

Amy laughed.

"What. You're making more of a fuss. Anyway, brace yourselves from now on. I won't let it slide if you fall behind."

As Amy took the lead, a comrade approached Berick and spoke quietly.

"Why are you acting like this? I thought you'd be jumping around with joy."

"Who said I didn't like it?"

Amy's back could be seen moving away.

"...Why?"

Why did she come back?

'We're going to die anyway. A brilliant life different from ours awaits you...'

Though he didn't know the reason, Berick felt victorious in a different sense from the other soldiers.

Hell's army of 200 million was gathering toward Tormia.

Victory reports from everywhere.

The army's morale soared, but Balkan's expression as he studied the map was quite serious.

"Truly impressive."

Even Balkan, who read military situations, only realized it after four days since deciding on total war.

"How can they extend it by ten days?"

If he were in the same position... he wouldn't have been able to pull it off.

"What? Are we in danger?"

At Smodo's question, Balkan shook his head.

"No. It's a war of attrition anyway. We with superior numbers are overwhelmingly advantageous. The important thing is the reason for buying time."

"What's the reason?"

"I don't know. It doesn't show up in military intelligence either. Must be covert work. But strategies requiring this level of security can't have great destructive power."

That had been conventional war wisdom.

"Right. Espionage usually strikes vital points."

"Hmm. But we have no vital points. This is getting on my nerves. This little strategist."

As Balkan stared intently at the power distribution map, countless military situations appeared before his eyes.

"Shall we take it head-on?"

He moved all the human armies gathered so far to one location.

"This way, from ten days to eight."

He could almost see the invisible brain of the Valkyrie clutching its head and screaming.

"Kukuku. How's that, kid."

Balkan's eyes gleamed wickedly.

"War is fun, isn't it?"

Iruki slammed the table with a bang.

Empty bottles rolled to the floor, and a roar of anger burst from his throat.

"Aaaaah!"

No one thought he was drunk.

"Hah! Hah!"

Gray hair had already passed halfway, and Iruki's hair had turned white.

'Why?'

It was an unexpected move.

'Why drag it into chaos? What's the reason for doing this while reducing tactical perfection?'

A war waged with all humanity's lives seemed like just a card game to him.

'Betting without even looking at your hand?'

In chess, it would be like placing pieces with your eyes closed.

But precisely because of that, it struck at one blind spot hidden in infinite probabilities.

'It's impossible.'

The probability of engagement had increased dramatically, but there was no way to recover the lost two days.

'There must be a way. No, there has to be. If I can't pull it off, the 2nd Corps will be annihilated.'

"Huuuuu..."

Commanders approached upon noticing Iruki's hair gradually turning white.

"S-Supreme Commander, you should rest a little..."

Iruki's face crumpled.

'There isn't any. There's nothing.'

The conclusion was reached.

"It's over. Strategy always requires an opponent. When rules are broken, there's no way to respond."

A commander offered comfort.

"Don't blame yourself, Supreme Commander..."

"However."

Iruki cut him off.

"What's ended is my strategy, not the war."

"What do you mean..."

Iruki's eyes gleamed fiercely.

'Variables will definitely arise.'

If it wasn't about numbers but probability, it was now a gamble for Iruki too.
