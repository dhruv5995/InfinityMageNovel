[696] Chapter of Reunion (5)

While descending the mountain to avoid the border guards, Shirone was able to assess Kazura's current situation.

Although the number of soldiers had been reinforced, their mental fortitude had actually weakened, with some soldiers even seen dozing off sporadically.

Their self-esteem was crawling along the ground due to the decline of royal authority.

"That's the village over there."

It was a village of roughly 40 households, with all buildings being wooden structures except for the government office.

Looking down at the village scenery lit by torches, Kido spoke.

"I think I'd better stay in the mountains."

Cities were one thing, but to the residents of remote mountain areas, goblins were nothing more than monsters.

"Will you be okay? It might take about two days if we're late."

"Kukuku, what are you talking about? Goblins aren't as weak as humans."

Though Shirone and Rian were superhumans who had undergone rigorous training, most people couldn't match a goblin's physical abilities.

"The mountains are more comfortable. It's easier to find food too."

Human cooking wasn't bad, but he desperately craved the taste of bloody raw meat.

"Sorry. I'll send a signal when someone comes from the royal castle."

"I told you it's fine."

Kido's body spun to the side as he whirled his spear, then disappeared from sight in an instant.

'With Kido's skills, there's no way the guards will catch him.'

As Shirone finished his thoughts and was about to enter the village, Emma spoke with an anxious expression.

"Um, priest, what should I tell my husband?"

Bringing home two strange men, young men at that, would make him furious.

"Please introduce us as merchants. We can store our weapons in rings. And we'll compensate you as well."

Seeing the pouch of gold coins, Emma let out a sigh of relief.

Though money wasn't her concern right now, her husband Adox was the type who would sell his own family for money.

As they crossed the wooden fence, chickens fluttered about and dogs barked upon smelling the strangers.

Arriving at the thirteenth house on the east side of the village, Emma unlocked the door with a key and turned to Shirone's group.

"Please come in."

The 14-pyeong space didn't separate the kitchen from the bedroom, and stairs leading to the second floor were visible in the corner.

Adox, who was sitting at the dining table, snapped at her.

"Where the hell have you been wandering around!"

Emma's shoulders flinched as her husband, who usually spent nights out as if it were routine, happened to be home today.

"Honey, are you done already?"

Adox was a man in his mid-thirties with roughly grown facial hair.

"The sun set ages ago, what nonsense are you spouting? Do you think I'm some worthless drunk who just guzzles alcohol every day?"

Adox, whose stomach was churning from yesterday's hangover, frowned and asked Shirone and Rian.

"Who are you guys? I've never seen your faces before."

"We're merchants. Could we stay here for about two days?"

"What kind of traders come to a remote place like this? Are you... heretics by any chance? Be honest."

Recently, there had been reports of the Terraforce cult approaching and extorting money from residents of nearby villages.

"Haha, that's impossible. We're from a new trading company looking for places to deliver goods. We'll just do market research for about a day and then leave."

Such things weren't unheard of.

"What trading company?"

"That's a bit difficult to reveal. This industry is quite sensitive to rumors..."

"Are you kidding me?"

Shirone hastily added.

"It's the Nade Trading Company. Please keep it secret. I heard from Emma that you have influence in this area..."

When he pulled out gold coins, Adox's eyes wavered.

'With that amount of money...'

Misa, the bar girl, would be absolutely delighted.

'He wants me to look after him favorably, hmm.'

But since he was still a soldier, accepting money outright could cause problems later.

"The hardware store across the street also does lodging. Why don't you go there instead? Of course, it's just a converted attic, so it's pretty much the same as here."

Shirone realized Adox's psychology.

"Hehe, staying at a shop would draw attention from other trading companies. You know how this industry is, right? Please do us this favor."

"Still, this amount seems a bit excessive?"

"Since we're causing trouble, shouldn't the lodging fee be higher? Please think of it as a merchant's sincerity."

"Well, I suppose that makes sense."

Receiving the gold coins from Shirone, Adox confirmed they were international standard currency made by Red Line Currency Services.

"Fine. Treat them well, make sure the guests aren't uncomfortable. I'll sleep outside tonight too."

Though Emma could guess Adox's destination, in today's situation she had no choice but to let him go.

"Yes, come home early."

Despite her gentle voice, from the moment Adox left, Emma ground her teeth audibly.

"That bastard. He's going to that whore again. He'll throw around gold coins and show off all kinds of pretenses."

There was nothing to say to that.

"Let's eat first. There should be some alcohol too."

Perhaps unable to endure with a clear mind, Emma drained the remaining half of a large bottle of liquor.

"Honestly, the only thing that whore Misa has over me is the number of men she's dealt with! My husband is stupid, but that woman is worse!"

Shirone listened to Emma's complaints without showing any sign of displeasure, playing along appropriately.

"Ah, if only my husband were half as good as you, priest."

When she drunkenly collapsed her head onto the table, completely intoxicated, Rian lifted her and moved her to the bed.

"Is this okay, Shirone? I'm wondering if it wouldn't have been better to wait at an inn."

The fact that Emma's husband was a centurion in the border guard was concerning.

"Adox is fine. You can't file international lawsuits based on mere speculation. What we really need to be wary of is Emma."

"Right. If Emma talks, things will get out of hand. So that's why you told the Chief Justice we'd be staying at this house."

Because they couldn't bring themselves to kill Emma.

"Yeah. Until someone comes from Kazura's royal castle, we absolutely cannot take our eyes off her. If there's even the slightest sign she might talk..."

"If there is?"

Shirone's gaze turned cold.

"Then I'll ask you to handle it."

Mages are cold-hearted people.

"...Alright."

Shirone thought they should eliminate her before things got out of control, but it was also Shirone who couldn't turn away from Emma in the cave.

If possible, he wanted to find a path that would be good for everyone.

'Walking a tightrope between ideals and reality. Is that what being a mage means?'

Just like Jane, who had to walk while clutching his own heart to save Aria.

'They really live difficult lives.'

Rian thought he could never become a mage, even if he were reborn.

The next morning.

Adox went to work while rubbing his stomach.

"Adjutant! Migelan!"

Migelan opened the door and entered.

"Did you call for me?"

Completely unaware that he was his wife's lover, Adox made a drinking gesture and said.

"Got any honey left? Bring it with plenty mixed in."

"Don't tell me you drank again?"

Yesterday, Adox had sworn he absolutely wouldn't drink and left work early.

After downing the honey water, Adox stroked his beard and said.

"Ahh, now I feel like I might live."

"You went to Misa's."

"Kuku, don't even mention it. I had a windfall yesterday. It was an absolutely fantastic night."

As Adox reminisced about the previous night, he straightened his expression and said.

"Oh, and you, go to my house for a bit."

"What's the matter?"

"It's strange. Some merchants came yesterday, but I think they might have other intentions."

"Could they be heretics?"

"Hey, have you ever seen heretics spending money? Oh, wait."

Adox hastily shook his head.

"Anyway, take a good look. I was out yesterday. Check what happened with Emma."

'What a piece of trash.'

He spent the night carousing with a bar girl, then tells his adjutant to spy on his wife.

"Understood."

Since it meant he could see Emma, Migelan immediately ran to Adox's house.

'That man has reason to be suspicious.'

The merchants Adox mentioned had such noble bearing that they could pass for aristocrats, and they were even handsome.

"Migelan? What's wrong?"

Emma opened the door with a surprised expression, but Migelan answered without showing his feelings.

"I'm here on the centurion's errand. He has something urgent to tell you."

He wanted to say he loved her.

"You have guests. I'm sorry to ask, but could you step away for a moment?"

"Then I'll be upstairs."

As Shirone and Rian went up the stairs, Migelan embraced Emma as if he couldn't hold back any longer.

"I missed you, Emma."

"Why did you come at this hour? What if we get caught?"

"Your husband sent me. That piece of trash. He spent last night with Misa again. The plan we talked about before - let's put it into action."

It was a plan to poison Adox.

"I can't do it. If we get caught, we'll..."

"Don't worry. In a remote mountain village like this, no one cares if someone dies."

Emma was terrified at the thought that God was listening.

"Just trust me. We'll see it through to the end."

Finding her even more lovable, Migelan was about to kiss her when the door suddenly opened and Adox entered.

"Emma! The merchants who were here...! Huh?"

Though Migelan and Emma hastily separated, what had already been seen couldn't be helped.

"What? Why are you holding my wife's shoulder?"

"C-Centurion, why are you home?"

The problem was the gold coins he'd received from Shirone.

While merchants traveling the world mostly used international standard currency, Kazura's borders had been closed for over a year.

'Maybe they really are heretics.'

Though he'd come with such thoughts, currently Adox's head was filled with nothing but rage toward Migelan.

"How dare someone like you touch my wife!"

Seeing his superior draw his sword, Migelan raised his hands.

"Centurion! It's a misunderstanding!"

"Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding? Was there honey on my wife's shoulder or something?"

"Th-that is...!"

Migelan's mind raced.

"The merchants! The merchants tried to assault your wife."

"What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Why would I lie? I was just trying to calm your terrified wife."

Rolling his eyes, Adox asked with murderous intent.

"...Where are those bastards now?"

"I'm keeping them contained on the second floor. I've blocked the exit so they're trapped."

Migelan planned to escape with Emma once Adox ran upstairs, but the situation didn't go as planned.

"You damn brats! Get down here now! I'll slice you up alive and eat you!"

At the sound that shook the entire house, Shirone and Rian calmly descended the stairs.

Unlike yesterday, Rian had a massive greatsword equipped on his back, and Adox's face hardened upon seeing it.

"Wh-what are you guys?"

Rian gripped the handle of his great sword and asked.

"Shirone, is it time?"

"..."

If Emma revealed the secret, they'd have to kill Adox and Migelan too.

'Is there no other way?'

Just then, someone knocked loudly on the door.

"Is anyone there? I'm looking for someone."

"I'm busy right now! Get lost!"

Despite the clear dismissal, the door opened refreshingly and a large elderly man strode in.

"This bastard ignores what I say... Huh?"

The moment Adox saw the insignia engraved on the old man's armor, not only he but Migelan turned pale.

"R-Royal Castle Direct Forces?"

Sensing the tense atmosphere of the chaotic scene, the old man looked around and fixed his gaze on Shirone.

"It's been a long time, Arian Shirone."

Given the nature of the situation, he thought they'd take a swift route, but it was much faster than expected.

'So this person is coming after all.'

Shirone withdrew his killing intent and smiled at someone who was welcome, if anyone could be.

"Yes. It's been a long time."

It was Lytney Walker, the security chief of Kazura's royal castle.
