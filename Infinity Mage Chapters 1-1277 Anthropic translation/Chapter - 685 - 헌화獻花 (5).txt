[685]献花 (5)

The power of the high-speed armor-piercing round was tremendous enough to penetrate the iron plates of ancient weapons with kinetic energy alone, but Rufist felt uneasy.

The Biohwa had to be handed over to the kingdom in perfect condition.

'No response.'

He couldn't sense anything from inside the iron barrier that was riddled with holes like a honeycomb.

'He escaped by opening the floor.'

Just as Rufist expected, an iron plate in a completely different location opened and Plarino revealed himself again.

"I'll show you exactly what consequences your arrogance has brought."

The floor Rufist was standing on rippled like waves, then formed into a giant sphere that trapped him.

"Are you kidding me?"

A steel prison for a steel mage?

Just as he was about to smash it, he felt the inertia of falling with a force stronger than gravity.

'So this is the strategy.'

It was the power of the Microcosm Creation, which controlled not only Biohwa's systems but even matter itself.

The steel sphere fell endlessly through the hole that had melted open like heat, finally crashing into the ground with a thud.

"Get out of the way!"

As the sphere suddenly fell through the opened ceiling, Sirone embraced Meiray and threw himself aside.

Kido, who was already far away, blinked as he watched, and the sphere exploded with a bang as Rufist emerged.

'It's blocked.'

He clicked his tongue after checking the ceiling.

"This is getting annoying."

And that annoyance turned toward Sirone, who was still wandering around the lower level.

"What are you doing? I told you to take control of the main system! Where's Jane?"

"This is the control room."

Sirone, who had already arrived, pointed toward the device with sad eyes.

"When we got here, it was already..."

Rufist frowned, not understanding Sirone's words, then turned his head and finally discovered Jane, who was lying dead with a smile on her face.

Though he usually showed no emotion, now he seemed completely devoid of any humanity.

"Jane."

Her abdomen was split open and both wrist muscles were completely ruptured.

There was no need to confirm her death, but Rufist approached her.

Sirone followed behind, speaking in a sad voice.

"It looks like she forced her heart to beat while in cardiac arrest. That's why her wrist muscles..."

"I know."

Rufist knelt on one knee and examined Jane's hands.

"When did you arrive?"

Armand relayed the information to Sirone.

"1 minute and 32 seconds ago."

"Nemesis was taken."

It wouldn't have been stored in a Kubrick.

Since they cut off the finger with it.

Sirone suddenly realized.

"Could it be, Chagall?"

If he was a figure corresponding to the aftermath of the Great Purification, he would have infiltrated Biohwa according to La Enemy's design.

"It was good that you extended your life through mental transcendence, but the final handling was disappointing. You should have destroyed it somehow."

Sirone frowned.

"Is that something to say in this situation? Jane did her best."

"So what? Should I pat the corpse on the head and say 'well done'?"

"Guild Master."

Anger was contained in Sirone's voice, but Rufist coldly turned away from Jane.

"I'll process it as a line-of-duty death, but if she were alive, I would have slapped her. Even as one of Spectrum's Three Ministers, she's not a woman who would die easily. In the end, that damn sentimentality was the problem. This is why women are no good."

"Don't speak carelessly when you don't even know what situation she was in."

"I know."

He knew her better than her parents did.

"Go. Head to the seed chamber on the upper level and steal Biohwa's seeds. Plarino currently has control, but the Ultima System should handle it fine."

"But..."

"There's no time."

Since Rufist's words were true, Sirone gave up arguing and turned around.

"Let's go, Meiray, Kido."

As they left the control room, Sirone burst out in frustration.

"He's cold-blooded. It's like he has no blood or tears."

Kido, who had run up beside Sirone, said:

"That's not true, Sirone."

"They worked together for over 10 years. But he disparages her like that? I could never do that."

"Didn't you notice?"

Sirone looked back at Kido with puzzled eyes.

"Huh? Notice what?"

"That guild master saw the woman's corpse, right?"

Kido had been watching Rufist.

"He hasn't blinked once since then."

"His eyes?"

Kido made a gesture of poking his own eyes.

"That's not naturally possible. Of course, I don't know what he's thinking either. But it doesn't seem like he's unaware of it."

As Sirone ran while looking at the floor, Meiray said:

"Anyway, we should be on guard too. Not only did Jane die, but the fact that La Enemy is staying silent bothers me."

Kido wrinkled his nose.

"He's hiding. He's not even making breathing sounds. We need a sense of smell. Nothing beats that for searching."

"But the one with the sense of smell is someone called Chagall. Can we persuade him?"

"No need to persuade him."

Sirone said.

"The fact that he took Nemesis means that's how it will turn out."

"..."

It felt like being a puppet caught on the threads of fate.

Meanwhile, Rufist left the control room in the opposite direction from Sirone's group.

As the automatic door opened and he entered the corridor, Plarino was standing by the stairs.

"How does it feel to lose someone precious?"

Rufist sensed an alien energy pressing from behind.

Shortly after, black smoke rose and the pure-blood vampire Rycka blocked his escape route.

"Input the primitive code to reclaim Biohwa. The method was good. The attempt was good too. But I guess you didn't expect your abilities to fall short."

Rufist's eyes, as he finally turned around, were bloodshot without closing.

As if this pleased him even more, Rycka smiled and raised his hand.

"I finished her off with this hand. I didn't quite finish the job properly, but seeing how things turned out, I think it worked out better. She must have died in the most agonizing way."

Rufist wasn't displeased.

That wasn't what displeased him.

"If she feared pain, she wouldn't have done such a stupid thing."

"Haha, so you're human after all. You say that, but your voice is trembling, isn't it? Was she someone precious?"

Plarino said:

"You failed. Control of Biohwa has returned to me, and the royal castle will soon be destroyed."

Rufist sighed.

"No. None of that matters anymore."

Knowing how meticulous the Magic Guild Master of Tormia was, two of the Three Ministers looked puzzled.

"You seem angry? So you're human after all."

It wasn't a sympathetic remark.

What Plarino wanted was for Rufist to taste the same feelings as him and be equally frustrated.

"Don't misunderstand. That woman meant nothing to me. She was an aide, a chief secretary. She had some quirky aspects, but now that she's dead, there's no need to think about it."

As the air felt as heavy as if it had turned to heavy metal, Rycka and Plarino's faces hardened.

"She was competent."

She was a woman skilled enough to make the single-minded Rufist into a Magic Guild Master.

"That's the only reason I'm annoyed. That competent woman, that talent that would be nearly impossible to recover no matter how much I invested in education, was consumed because of the lives of some sub-human vermin - that fact makes me furious."

Beyond feeling, iron actually began to permeate the air.

"How will you compensate? All the countless problems that woman should have solved while alive. Even if trash like you died a hundred times, it wouldn't be enough."

"How dare you look down on vampires!"

Rycka, dissolved into smoke, charged forward, and Plarino also moved iron walls from all sides to apply pressure.

"...Steel Armor Wave."

The moment the words fell, the air rippled around Rufist and iron barriers began to spread.

"Graaaah!"

Rycka penetrated the iron wall with his half-body, half-soul ability, but second and third iron walls were born, pushing back the territory.

"Huuuugh!"

Plarino, who was synchronized with Biohwa, crouched and screamed.

"You'll break it? Isn't that a precious flower to you too?"

"Of course it is."

The value of the ancient weapon was tremendous enough to account for more than half of the kingdom's national power.

"You should have caused trouble in moderation."

The iron wall's waves became more intense and began to extend toward the outer wall of the massive Biohwa.

"You'll regret this! You!"

A chilling smile appeared on Rufist's lips.

"What wouldn't I regret?"

KUUUUUUUUNG!

As Biohwa's vibration toward the sun became incomparably more violent than before, Sirone's group stopped walking.

"What's this?"

Kido grabbed the wall and shouted.

"It's tilting! Are they interfering with us?"

"No, it's not at that level."

The angle of inclination was exceeding 20 degrees.

Considering Biohwa's height and weight, recovery was nearly impossible.

There's no time.

Sirone suddenly realized, remembering Rufist's words.

"I see."

It wasn't something he said with the capital strike in mind.

"He's going to break it."

"Break it? We haven't even gotten the seeds yet. Wasn't that important to humans?"

"You were right, Kido."

Since when was it?

Probably since he discovered Jane's corpse.

"Rufist had already lost his reason."

The 47th Steel Armor Wave crushed the internal equipment and extended to more than half the diameter of the stem.

The durability of the ancient weapon was higher than steel, so the iron wave that couldn't overcome the resistance disappeared, but the 48th, 49th, and 50th waves kept coming endlessly.

"Insignificant humaaaaan!"

Rycka, who had penetrated 87 iron walls, grabbed Rufist's shoulder and bared his teeth.

'Just one bite!'

He could make the Magic Guild Master his servant.

"A mere bat."

For the first time in his life, Rufist drew up magic power to a level that the system of his society would not approve.

Steel Magic:

Diamond Tsunami.

Before the steel waves that rippled and extended 10 times per second, the half-body, half-soul flesh was swept away.

"Kyaaaaaaah!"

"Stop it! Do you know how carefully this flower was cultivated? Are you insane?"

Plarino transmitted through all of Biohwa's speakers.

'Lost reason? Not a chance.'

That wasn't our style.

'Right, Jane?'

The strategic value obtainable when Biohwa was properly handed over to the kingdom, the astronomical price of the seeds Biohwa would produce, and the countless potential profits derived from that.

'I'll handle it all myself.'

He would become incomparably stronger than any ancient weapon and reverse all those losses.

'I'll fight for your share too.'

Rufist never closed his eyes.

'So rest in peace, Jane.'

Finally, the 362nd iron wall reached Biohwa's outer wall, and Rufist released the strongest power of his life.

'This is...'

The Steel Armor Wave burst through the outer wall and shot out, completely separating Biohwa's base.

'The flower I offer at your grave.'

"Kyaaaaaaah!"

Plarino's scream seemed to perfectly represent the pain of the mouthless Biohwa.

"It's falling! He really did it!"

Kido ran around stepping on the tilting walls of Biohwa, while Sirone and Meiray floated in the air as if in zero gravity, searching for an exit.

"Let's escape that way! If we get caught up in this, it's over!"

It would be the impact of crashing from space.

"I can't fly!"

"I'll catch you! Just jump!"

After Sirone and Meiray escaped, Kido made a tearful face and leaped.

"What a crazy species!"

KUUUUUUUUUUU!

Feeling the ground vibrate, Etela looked up with her rain-soaked face.

The world's most expensive flower, 600 meters tall, was falling toward the south of Radum.

"Humans are... human."

Beings who pursue human happiness from a human perspective.

A broken flower will wither, but that flower will be placed before someone's grave to mourn death...

And we will call even that beautiful.
