**The Satanist Stronghold.**

The fact that the first Yora was Armand's original owner came as a shock to Shirone.

'Armand. A peculiar carnivorous species even among the Fire Tribe. It willingly accepted countless living beings.'

Before entering Ymir's dream, Luver had mentioned this in Drimo's central shared consciousness.

'He said there was exactly one time when an object was brought out by his own will. That was Armand.'

Most strange of all was that there was no record of the first Yora and Armand in Omega's archives.

'It's not erasure. But it's not an OOPArt either.'

Therefore, it was Luver's will.

'Using the dream engine, the non-physical engine, reality's logic can be collapsed. If they follow dream logic, it wouldn't be strange that I don't know about it, but...'

The problem was: why?

'Why did Mr. Luver break even the administrator's rules to bring Armand into reality?'

Shirone asked.

"How are the Yora traditions passed down? If it's about Armand, that would be from very long ago."

"Through dreams."

Eden said.

"Not everyone has such dreams, but I've heard that some Yora occasionally have strange dreams. When their information is cross-referenced, it forms one clear story, and that's presumably the original tradition."

"Hmm."

Shirone became more convinced.

"It doesn't seem to be a dream you have just from deep cultivation. We call this a 'tradition dream,' but the cause of its manifestation hasn't been discovered. I've never had one myself. That's why I said it wasn't certain."

"I see. The cause of manifestation..."

Since the simultaneous events in Ymir's dream were blocked, there was no immediate way to verify this.

Nade said.

"Now that we know the Vatican's secrets, let's go back. If Miss Seina testifies, we can gain credibility. We'll announce it to the whole world through Vatican-published newspapers."

It would certainly affect the Holy War as well.

Seina kept her mouth shut.

'They want me to expose the Vatican?'

Of course, she was also critical of Lamicalism, but whistleblowing would be a betrayal of her colleagues.

Shirone said.

"I know it's difficult. But if you don't do it, Miss Seina, no one else can."

They wouldn't believe Yahweh's words.

"Many people are falling to Satan's temptations. Excellent clergy are becoming corrupt."

Remembering the lewd ritual of Archpriest Maximus, whom she had respected, she squeezed her eyes shut.

"Alright. I'll do it."

Eden stood up.

"Good. Then take Miss Seina back."

"What about you?"

"I can't just leave the Satanist stronghold and return. I'm going to make the demons repent."

There was no fear to be found in Eden's eyes as he surveyed the enemy territory alone.

Moreover, that was the absolute faith that Seina desperately wanted to possess.

'It's not about hostility or war.' It's life.

A life where one completely dedicates their heart cannot be shaken.

Iruki said.

"Then let's do it together. The Satanist executives are Catacomb. They're all said to be demon tribe at the division commander level."

"You guys have things to do. If Miss Seina stays here long, it'll become dangerous."

She was the only person who could expose the Vatican's corruption.

"It's already too late."

At the sound from the rooftop, Shirone's group took combat positions and retreated.

"Keke, you little rats."

A demon with red skin and pointed ears was crouched on the railing.

Gultan, King of Darkness.

A member of Catacomb, the Yahweh assassination organization, he was a demon who wielded an ability called Mental Crafting.

"I heard from Amy."

Not only his physical characteristics, but the burn scar covering half his face was almost definitive.

"She said you'd be dead."

"Ah, that woman."

The moment he recalled Amy's Complete Combustion, his wound throbbed madly.

"Kekeke, look forward to it. After I kill you, I'll cut off your head and take it to that woman."

Seina stepped back hesitantly.

'This is tremendous evil.'

Though not as much as Sheol, she felt a terrible demonic energy that couldn't be seen in the present world.

"Catacomb."

Eden said.

"Hell's army division commanders selected from those who achieved 6.8 times or greater efficiency in the Great War against Yahweh. Currently, the succubus Miyo seems to have been annihilated, but..."

Hearing the explanation, Seina swallowed.

'6.8 times?'

Gultan raised the corners of his mouth.

"Mr. Giorgi was right. He said that if Satanism grew large, Yahweh would come directly."

"Where is Giorgi?" Shirone's demon.

"Keke, who knows?"

Gultan's tongue stretched out long.

"Maybe in front of your grave?"

Blue lightning fell from the sky and the spot where he had been exploded with a bang.

Nade clicked his tongue.

"Damn! He's fast at running away." Having moved 30 meters through his wall-phasing ability, Gultan raised both his middle fingers.

"I said no."

An elderly man with a beard, a middle-aged woman, and a young boy gathered around him.

"They're Catacomb members."

Then Elka, a Satanist evangelist, appeared leading all the townspeople.

"Hohoho! Caught you, Yahweh. This is our territory. You'll never get out alive."

The townspeople, covered in blood, were all naked with vacant eyes.

"Heh... hehehe..." Seina recognized the face of someone drooling beside Elka.

"Lord Maximus."

Though he was third in Vatican hierarchy, he had now become the dog of the demon Elka.

"Good boy, our puppy."

As Elka's hand rubbed against his body, Maximus trembled all over and stuck out his tongue.

"Huff! Huff!"

Of course, he was also looking at Seina.

"Good boy. Good boy."

Tears streamed down Maximus's eyes as he surrendered his body to pleasure.

"Archpriest..."

It would probably be mortifyingly shameful, but he absolutely couldn't refuse. Because it felt too good.

"Kekeke! Look at their faces. Don't be too envious. You'll all be like this soon."

"Do not mock human weakness, demon."

Eden said.

"Let's go, Shirone."

Miracle Stream changed to Hand of God, and Shirone charged forward.

Nade and Iruki followed, with Eden deploying a defensive barrier at the rear as they advanced.

"Hmm."

Elka whispered something in Maximus's ear.

"Ah, ahhh."

Maximus, feeling ecstasy from imagination alone, suddenly screamed and charged forward.

"For Satan!"

The powerful divine power of the third-ranked priest had now become extreme emotion, rising as demonic energy.

'This is serious. They were all once clergy.'

Their massive demonic energies combined and were absorbed by Marit, a Catacomb member.

"Haaaaah."

Marit, Deacon of Satanism.

"Emblem (Symbol of Demons)."

While Evangelist Elka led people to Satanism, she absorbed the believers' demonic energy.

That absorbed demonic energy surged up as red aura and transformed into a strange form.

Even the cool-headed Iruki's expression wasn't good.

"What is that thing?"

Though he couldn't tell what it was, his instincts sensed that it was an extremely sexual form.

Nade was also mentally confused.

'It's incredibly lewd.'

Large, slippery, disgusting yet absolutely impossible to look away from.

'Demon.'

Shirone's eyes focused with intensity.

'Why is it sexual?'

The reason why a form that was merely a biological organ came to have symbolic meaning representing demons.

'Good and evil separated from Ultima.'

It would be the original sin given to humans after Mitochondrial Eve crossed the forbidden line.

'I'll destroy it.'

The giant fist of Hand of God rushed toward the Emblem floating in the sky.

The bearded old man moved.

"Keukeukeuk."

Euphrapus, Elder of Satanism, converted the demonic energy collected by Marit into power.

"Authority of Evil."

Red energy erupted from the Emblem in the form of a fist, colliding with Hand of God.

"Krgh!"

The power, much stronger than expected, was a level that couldn't be created by fallen clergy alone.

"The whole world."

Marit spread both arms and laughed.

"Satanists of the whole world." The Emblem grew stronger, and its male-female form was enough to drive human minds insane.

"Mica."

The moment Shirone uttered this, electricity flowed.

Yes.

'How many Satanist believers are there?'

The Akashic Records transmitted information transcending space-time.

Zibe Kingdom: 1,232,211. Tormia Kingdom: 573,433. Iron Kingdom: 2,030,000...

'Just tell me the total.'

32,987,753 people.

Words immediately followed.

7 more added. 32,987,760 people.

If 7 people were added worldwide in just 1 second, it was an incredible rate.

Of course, since the total population was fixed, the initial rising curve wouldn't continue indefinitely, but...

'This time might be different.'

Emotional disease.

If they couldn't respond to this unprecedented disease, humanity might miss the golden time.

Eden shouted.

"Repent, evil!"

As Eden's divine power spread as a defensive barrier, the Satanist believers began to suffer.

"Ahh! Uaaaah!"

Because they were priests, their demonic energy was powerful, but by the same token, the possibility of repentance could be said to be high.

"Hrgh! I, I...!"

Some believers who came to their senses charged at Catacomb with anger at being used.

"You evil things!"

"Tsk tsk, this is why it won't work. When did you enjoy yourselves so much?"

Amidal, a Catacomb member, shaped the small hand of a boy into a gun and aimed.

"Bang!"

Nothing came out, but a hole appeared in the forehead of the priest leading the charge.

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"

As people fell, Amidal aimed all ten fingers.

Demon ability: Fantasist.

"Rat-a-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat!"

Though it was child's play, the phenomena he imagined were happening exactly in reality.

"Ohhh! God Cria!"

But the anger of priests humiliated by demons couldn't be extinguished even by death.

"Huh?"

As those purified by Eden swarmed like bees, Amidal drew a dagger.

Grasping the sheath and handle with both hands.

"Hundred Slashes!"

He half-drew it then closed it again, and sharp sword energy whirled around like a storm.

"Uaaaah!"

Those with severed limbs fell to the ground, and Amidal spread his palm toward them.

"Haha! Cannon fire!"

Cancellation.

As the Fantasist ability was released, Amidal turned his head with a surprised expression.

White smoke rose before his eyes.

'Explosion?'

Bang!

He hurriedly turned his head, but half his face was shredded by the explosion's impact.

"Kiiiiiii!"

His pupils turned black as he bared his fangs and scanned the crowd, where Iruki stood.

"Stop fooling around. I'm in a bad mood right now."

'What is this now?'

Canceling a demon's ability was impossible by human logic.

"No need to be surprised. If Sheol was a math problem, you were at most arithmetic level."

Iruki's thinking was equivalent to the ancient weapon Ex Machina.

"Damn it...!"

Blood vessels stood out on Amidal's face.

Meanwhile, Gultan was watching Shirone, who was battling the Emblem, from underground.

'I just need to get in once.'

Mental Crafting.

Able to directly touch human hearts, he planned to twist Shirone's emotions.

'Even a slight distortion will destroy Yahweh's境地.'

The moment Hand of God and Authority of Evil collided again, he shot up from the ground.

"Now!"

Gultan, having seized his back, thrust his hand forward, quickly penetrating Shirone's body.

"Got it! I touched...!"

The fingers that returned through quantization were all crushed, as seen with his eyes.

It was like trying to sculpt steel with bare hands.

'What the hell...?'

Shirone's voice was heard.

"Bugs, get lost."

Struck by Hand of God's backhand, Gultan's body flew through the air as if bouncing.

"Kraak!"

Though he activated quantization, more than half the impact entered his body directly.

"Krrrgh..."

As he groaned, holding his crushed hand to his chest, Maximus's voice was heard.

"Seina. I, I..."

Having passed through Eden's holy barrier, he extended his hand with tears streaming.

"Archpriest."

Seina cried as well.
