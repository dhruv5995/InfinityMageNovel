The Meaning of the Incident (2)

When Shirone's group reached the sun's convection layer, flames gathered and a phoenix was born.

While planetary phoenixes were powerful, being located on the sun made it an entirely different dimensional existence.

"So you've finally come."

The stellar energy emitted by the immortal bird reduced Miracle Stream's diameter by a full meter.

"I've been waiting, Ikael." The group received the phoenix's language through Ultima, Idea, and their mental bodies.

Ikael spoke.

"We've come to meet Satiel."

"I suppose so. But it's a foolish act. Nothing can oppose the discipline of the whole."

"We won't know unless we try. Even if this universe perishes, the heart will remain."

She wanted to believe that.

"...Do as you wish. It is your resting place. But humans cannot go to the core. No, it's questionable how they can even be here in the first place." The phoenix, looking back at the man wrapped in light and the naked woman, exploded with flames.

"Leave!"

Even with Miracle Stream forming a barrier, Shirone felt dizzy.

'Tremendous energy.'

Knowing time was pressing, Amy stepped outside the barrier.

Blinding light shot forth, and her body burst into flames again.

The phoenix's eyes narrowed.

"Mother of Light. How can a human reach the source of signals? It's impossible."

"Go ahead, Ikael."

Amy said as she slowly rose.

"I'll handle this place."

After a moment of conflict, Ikael seemed to steel her resolve and left Miracle Stream's barrier.

"Gasp!"

Her body extinguished like a candle flame, and her mental body revealed itself within the sun's fire.

"I'm sorry, Holy Mother of the Sun. I cannot let Satiel perish like this. That is my heart."

Glaring at Amy, the phoenix spoke.

"It's useless. You cannot persuade God. No being can do such a thing." Answering with silence, Ikael bent her waist and penetrated into the sun's core.

"Yes, human who possesses the Idea of fire."

The phoenix straightened its upper body.

"I acknowledge you have the qualifications to come to Ra. But in the end, you cannot surpass me."

"Is that so?"

Amy's flames changed to the brightest white light as if about to explode at any moment.

Shirone bit his lip.

'Six meters in diameter.'

The range of Hexagon he could deploy in the sun's harsh environment would be close to hand-to-hand combat.

'Right now I can only look for opportunities.'

Then the phoenix, having enormously increased its size, charged at Amy like an arrow.

"Perish!"

The collision was so intense it caused form to collapse, and simultaneously a powerful shockwave struck Shirone.

Meanwhile, Satiel and Rayel, who had penetrated the sun's core, were exerting all their strength.

"Graaaah!"

Every time they tried to reverse the universe's progression, it felt like their mental bodies were burning up.

"Why..."

Satiel cried out in anguish.

"Why do you deny us! Why! Why!"

The reality of God represented by Ankh Ra never once showed itself to them.

"For what do we exist?" For God's authority.

The moment humans reach God, causality reverses, and the positions of creator and created are switched.

'Even so...'

What authority is there in changing all standards of the universe because of one error called Yahweh?

'What are we, whom you created? What happens to the noble concept of archangels? Don't you have even a bit of responsibility for the world you created, the rules you established, your creation?'

God has no heart.

From the imaginary number's standpoint, it's a cold existence that eliminates errors according to programming.

Ikael penetrated through the photosphere and entered.

"Satiel."

Since she had penetrated as a mental body, there was no way to hide emotions.

"Stop now. Become human. You too, and me too, we'll become human."

"What about the other angels!"

Venom filled Satiel's eyes.

"You always only think of yourself! What about the other angels who have no hearts? They'll just be used by humans!"

"Satiel, that's..."

"Stop her!"

When Rayel's mental body struck Ikael, countless signals intersected in complex ways.

"I'm sorry, Lady Ikael. We have no choice. We cannot become human like this."

"Like this, we'll be crushed in the wheels of law. We cannot endure without Yahweh."

"Haha! That's right!"

Venom filled Satiel's eyes.

"You who did filthy things with that lowly human Guffin! Don't lump us together with you!"

"Satiel, your actions aren't for the angels either. You're just trying to gain power to take revenge on me..."

"So what if I aaaaam!"

When Satiel screamed like a shriek, the sun's core shook unstably.

"Yes! I too have developed a heart. What you received from Guffin was probably hope and passion, peace, love and such things, but..."

Satiel cried out in anguish.

"What I received was hatred and resentment, anger and betrayal, frustration and shame! That's my heart!"

Rayel's mental body trembled like waves.

"Satiel..."

Since facts cannot be hidden in mental body state, Ikael realized his heart.

'That's what it is.'

The heart of not wanting to see her suffer.

'How truly beautiful.'

Ikael was grateful that she could recall the precious time spent with Guffin.

"Satiel is right."

Ikael said.

"Hope, peace, and love live in my heart. But for Satiel, only the most painful emotions like hatred, resentment, and betrayal would remain."

Though they were two very different types.

"In the end, it's the heart." Rayel's mental body wavered in conflict.

"The law separated me and Satiel into the chosen and the unchosen. But the heart doesn't do that. I too have pain. I too have resentment."

The pain of losing the one she loved most.

"We can turn it back. It's possible if it's here. Please let me go to Satiel."

"No! Rayel, absolutely not!" What was she afraid of? Satiel shook her head frantically, half-mad.

"Satiel won't bend her stubbornness."

"She'll prevent the law from changing. I'll help. I can't lose Satiel like this."

Rayel, who couldn't be denied by any means, seemed to give up and released her binding force.

"No! Don't come! I'd rather perish now than share one mind with you!"

Though Satiel resisted with all her might, Ikael eventually assimilated with her mind.

With the three archangels sharing one mind, Ataraxia was activated.

"Huk!"

As the concepts of decomposition and light were tremendously amplified, the sun's core shook greatly.

"Ah, aah."

Satiel, unable to refuse the approaching stability, had no choice but to accept it.

'Yes, I know.'

Only Ikael has the qualifications to be the archangel.

'I know. Guffin wasn't stolen from me. From the beginning, Guffin loved Ikael. But... what am I? There's nothing left now. There's not even a target left to resent.'

"I'm sorry."

Ikael said.

"I monopolized it. Everything you wanted, I took it all."

"You..."

The moment Satiel tried to push away Ikael's mind, a shocking signal rushed in.

"Guffin..."

Since lies were impossible.

"He was always grateful to you. And he was sorry. For not being able to love you. For hurting you."

Satiel shed tears.

"Huuk..."

It hadn't disappeared.

"Guffin didn't resent you. If it weren't for you, our love couldn't have been fulfilled either. Rather, he was always worried about you."

Uncontrollable tears burst forth.

'I, I am...'

Even without a body, even having left the photon world, Guffin was still alive here.

"Now, focus, Satiel."

Though the mind has no form, Satiel felt as if Ikael was embracing her from behind.

"We'll make it happen."

"Huk!"

Though the hatred hadn't disappeared yet, she had no intention of shaking off her hand.

'Let's go.'

The three massive concepts of amplification, light, and decomposition shook the sun's interior.

Delta Headquarters' Zodiac.

With only one small black hole remaining, Kitra immediately sensed the change in progression.

"Interfering until the very end."

The displeasure grew at this point when little remained until God's law was completed.

Of course, it was merely a matter of emotion - archangels could not overturn God's decision.

"They call it physics." The creatures made countless formulas for the world that simply existed in such a way.

"Answer me, creatures. Is there ever a case where 1 plus 1 doesn't equal 2? No. Because God determined it so. Therefore, whatever you do..."

Kitra spread both arms.

"I am omnipotent, omniscient, and absolute."

The black hole doubled in size and pyramids around the world began emitting light.

The radius where events overlapped began to expand.

Shirone, who had been blown away by the shockwave from Amy's phoenix, felt an eerie sensation.

'The sun's law changed drastically.' That kind of feeling.

As information about simultaneous events rushed in transcending spacetime, he realized the full situation.

'Kitra.'

With magnetic fields expanding centered on the pyramids, human desires were growing even stronger.

'The more that happens, the stronger Mara becomes. At this rate, humanity will really meet its end.'

Even Yahweh, who had reached the ultimate of heart, and the sun's law were of comparable status.

'How should I stop it?'

Thinking of what he could do, Shirone weighed the possibilities.

'50-50.'

Actually... he wasn't confident.

'I've never tried it before. No, it will probably affect even simultaneous events.'

Though it was such a dangerous and massive undertaking, humanity now had nowhere to retreat.

'Please hold on just a little longer, Mother.' Cheering for Ikael in his heart, Shirone distanced himself from the sun at the fastest speed.

Meanwhile, Amy and the phoenix also stopped fighting due to the powerful solar wind generated from the sun.

"You've incurred God's wrath."

The phoenix said.

"Give up, human. Changing the law God established is impossible. No matter how..."

The immortal bird's neck turned toward space as if it might break.

"Huh?"

The identity of the tremendous mass and powerful law was at a distance that couldn't be confirmed visually.

Amy muttered.

"Shirone?"

"Im, impossible. How can a human create such a massive law... This is impossible."

What the source of signals felt at this moment was clearly a photon signal, not quantum.

Shirone's eyes widened.

"Hoooooo!"

The mental power gained from distancing himself from the sun concentrated between his two palms facing each other.

'Material.'

Stopping God's law with law.

.........

All kinds of materials poured out between his open palms and began combining at tremendous speed.

Mechanical devices equivalent to the size of a planetary nation assembled endlessly.

"Uuuuugh! Uuuuugh!"

Connecting at near-light speed, they began to encircle the sun's equator like a massive belt.

The phoenix shouted.

"You're trying to completely encase the sun! How dare a mere human!"

Of course, even with the intellectual capability of the 5th Dimensional Archive, he couldn't match the technology of the outer world.

"Uaaaaaaah!" If he could implement stellar-scale magnitude, he could manipulate laws even with current technology.

"My word..."

Even Amy was speechless as the unprecedented construction project took its first step.

"Mica."

■Construction progress is 0.00002 percent.

The blueprint in the Tesseract was a super-massive artificial structure that controlled 100 percent of stellar energy.

'Good, let's see who wins until the very end.'

It was called the Shirone Sphere.
