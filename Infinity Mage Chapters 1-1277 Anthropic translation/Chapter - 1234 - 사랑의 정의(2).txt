The Definition of Love (2)

"Your Majesty."

Areon's corpse arrived in the Kingdom of Micas.

Prince's right-hand man Fisk was nowhere to be seen, and all that returned was his son's cold dead body.

"Wh-what...?"

King Delkido of Micas rose from his throne, forcing his weakened legs to move.

"What...?"

When Areon's pale face was revealed, the retainers collapsed to their knees, and the sound of a maid's weeping could be heard.

His brothers remained composed.

'He was always so arrogant. So this is how it ends.'

Though their inner thoughts were unknowable, the father who witnessed his eldest son's death felt differently.

"Wh-what, what..."

Finally forgetting his royal dignity, Delkido fell to his knees, embraced Areon's corpse, and raised his head.

"OOOOH!"

Was it a cry of bitter grief?

"OOOOH!"

Or was it extreme rage toward whoever had struck at the Kingdom of Micas' vital point?

"Capture them."

Delkido's face twisted like a demon's.

"Capture them all."

Everyone in the Grand Hall bowed their heads in unison and shouted with one voice.

"Yes!"

The kingdom began to move.

Even while dreaming Yorahan's dream, Shirone instinctively understood in his unconsciousness.

What he wanted to convey through one human's lifetime was for this very moment.

'The first Yora.'

One who realized love within the original sins of consumption and reproduction.

And the end of the person who became the god of Yore religion in a human body through that one definition...

'I must watch.'

This is a story.

"Armang!"

A story of the tragic love between one man and one woman that had no choice but to be erased from Omega's records.

"Yorahan!"

As armed forces charged through the burning forest, the two reached out their hands toward each other.

"Hiya! Hiya!"

But as the Micas cavalry split in two, their gazes gradually grew distant from each other.

'Damn it!'

King Delkido deployed all of Micas' military forces to capture his son's killer.

Whether he loved his son dearly enough to abandon even wars of conquest was unknown.

Probably so, but in his fanatic obsession with revenge, one could glimpse the wounded pride of an emperor.

Bound and thrown into a mobile prison, Yorahan crawled on his chest to peer outside.

The Fire Tribe's base, which they had moved several times already, was once again turning to ash.

'Why...'

Why are humans so persistent?

The King of Micas inflicted every imaginable pain upon Yorahan and the Fire Tribe group.

Yorahan was confined to solitary.

With all the tendons in his limbs severed, he had to listen to screams echoing from outside every day.

"Why...?"

Tears flowed.

'How can they be so cruel? How can they commit such terrible acts against other beings?'

Of course, pulling out another's fingernails wouldn't make one's own nails hurt...

But couldn't one imagine it?

'One cannot know another's truth. Therefore, humans are trapped only in the existence called "I"...'

They can only scheme for themselves alone.

While imprisoned, Yorahan thought about the selfishness inherent in the existence called "I."

'I. Love that transcends "I"...'

He had given up the idea of changing the world, and now he probably couldn't change it anyway, but this was the only thing he could do with his tendons severed.

Then one day, the solitary cell door opened and the King of Micas showed himself after a long time.

"Stubborn bastard."

In Delkido's gaunt, withered eyes, a turbid madness gleamed.

"Haven't you gone mad yet, even hearing the Fire Tribe's suffering? Well, that's fine by me anyway."

He pulled the whip taut.

"Do you know why I, who severed your limbs, left your eyes, ears, and mouth intact? It's so you'd cry out miserably in the despair of being unable to save anyone. Feel even one ten-thousandth of my feelings."

A scream burst from the corridor.

There was no longer any expectation that everyone would be safe; he only hoped they could die comfortably.

"Isn't this enough for one human's revenge? Your son killed Fire Tribe members too."

"AAAHHH!"

Delkido swung his whip.

"How dare scum like you evaluate my son? He was a prince of a nation! Not comparable to Fire Tribe lives!"

Though he couldn't block or dodge, Yorahan looked straight into his eyes.

"There is no hierarchy among lives. Your heart that lost family - the Fire Tribe feel the same. Why don't you consider their hearts?"

"Why should I!"

Delkido threw down the whip and kicked Yorahan.

"My son is dead! What use is that! My son is dead! My son!"

Me, me, me.

In the end, can humans not escape from that?

When Yorahan showed no reaction, Delkido breathed heavily and glared for a moment.

"Hmph."

If only he could plunge this detestable bastard into despair, he could do anything.

"You'll remain calm to the end, I see. The couple are alike. Fine, I'll show you directly."

At Delkido's command, a cart carrying a large flowerpot entered the solitary cell.

"Uh..."

Yorahan's expression went blank.

What was planted in the flowerpot wasn't a flower but a Fire Tribe member - Armang, whom he loved most.

"How is it? Do you like it? Bonsai, was it? I cut this and that, stiffened the joints so she can't move. The most beautiful flower in the world."

To treat a person like a plant.

"Yorahan."

Seeing her husband's face, a welcoming smile formed on Armang's lips, but her eyes soon became sad.

'His body is so damaged.'

Even without using Small World Creation, they could understand each other's hearts just through their gazes.

Yorahan asked.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes."

Armang nodded bravely.

Actively seeking death was the only way to defeat Delkido.

"But I'm getting bored now."

Delkido took out huge pruning shears placed beside the cart.

"I should change things up."

Before Yorahan could speak, Delkido applied the shears to human flesh.

"How is it? Doesn't it look nice?"

Unable to do anything, Yorahan felt a fundamental question arise.

'Where did it go wrong?'

If he hadn't killed Areon, would this tragedy not have befallen the Fire Tribe?

'That's not it. I protected my family. That was unavoidable at the time.'

Again... me?

'The fate of being unable to abandon even myself. But nothing will change this way. This endless cycle of passing pain around - to break that cycle...'

At that moment, Yorahan's thoughts expanded at light speed, transcending himself to encompass all humanity.

"Ah."

Tears flowed down Yorahan's cheeks.

'I see.'

Love is...

"Huk! Huuuk!"

Hearing Yorahan's crying, Delkido turned with a vile smile.

"Haha! How is it? Do you finally feel even a little of my heart..."

The king froze.

Because while Yorahan was crying with his whole face scrunched up, the corners of his mouth were turned upward.

"Has he gone mad?"

"Armang."

Yorahan spoke.

"Let's forgive."

Armang's eyes widened in surprise, and Delkido asked again, doubting his ears.

"What?"

"Let's forgive everything, this world. Let's end it here. We... will end it."

After contemplating Yorahan's words briefly, Armang smiled sadly and said.

"I see."

Finally, they were ready.

"What crazy talk!"

Displeased, Delkido swung his whip, but his jaw was trembling.

'What am I afraid of? Me?'

Because Yorahan's expression, his evil instincts, foretold something that was about to come.

"Haha."

Yorahan laughed.

"Hahaha! Hahaha!"

The laughter was too refreshing and exhilarating to call madness, so Delkido stepped back.

"What are you? What are you trying to do?"

"This is..."

Yorahan, stopping his laughter, spoke calmly.

"Would this be too pretentious?"

Delkido shouted.

"Kill him! Kill this bastard!"

"So..."

Yorahan gently closed his eyes.

'Really.'

With blind sincerity containing not a trace of falsehood or gap.

"Let's truly forgive."

When he opened his eyes again, Yorahan's expression had changed to the extreme of joy that no human could make.

"Kahahahahaha!"

To burst out the happiest laughter, his facial muscles were completely twisted - that form was truly...

"St-stop."

The materialization of the concept called love.

"Kahahahahaha!"

"AAAHHH!"

Not knowing what he feared, Delkido covered both ears and prostrated on the ground, screaming.

"Please! I'm sorry! I was wrong! Pl-please..."

At that moment, as if shocked, Delkido's back straightened and flashes of light burst from his eyes, nose, and mouth.

"OOOOH!"

Starting with him, light also burst from the eyes, nose, and mouth of the guards in the solitary cell.

"Aaahhh! No, it can't be!"

They were being purified.

Extreme emotions become demons, but supreme elation transcends into Drimo and becomes ideal.

"Kahahahahaha!"

Blood tears flowed from Yorahan's eyes as he laughed with a happy expression.

'What is love?'

His organs twisted, blood poured from every hole in his body, and his intestines snapped apart.

'This is...'

Love.

Embracing everything while enduring it - high-intensity self-sacrifice and transcendent madness.

"Yorahan."

Unlike those struggling in terror, Armang waited with a sad smile.

"Goodbye."

And then through Drimo, Yorahan's emotions flooded into her as well.

The heart that forgives everything.

That heart flowed into all the Fire Tribe, and finally into the people of the Kingdom of Micas as well.

"OOOOH!"

When concentric circles of light growing larger from the prison center swallowed the entire kingdom.

"Luber-nim!"

The Drimo system was paralyzed.

"This is terrible! We can't process this dream. At this rate, all humanity will..."

Be unified through love.

"Hmm."

Luber was watching too.

The chaotic dream world made of all sorts of thoughts being swept away by a massive flash.

A choice had to be made.

"Follow me. There's no time."

Luber and Menga cut through the waves of light and entered Yorahan's mind.

Beside his laughing avatar, Armang was there.

'Small World Creation.'

Arriving at the place where two dreams merged into one, Luber approached Yorahan.

"You've done something humans cannot do."

To truly forgive.

"But stop now. At this rate, everyone will dream your dream."

Armang said.

"Only one thing remains in Yorahan. He can't even hear my words."

"But you can do it, can't you? You are Yorahan, and Yorahan is you."

"...Why should I? If you're a god-like being, answer our question. Yorahan has forgiven the world. Now everyone will live in Yorahan's dream. Without pain or despair. Isn't that enough?"

"But it's not everyone's life. It's Yorahan's life. Would Yorahan truly want that?"

Armang struggled to hold back tears.

"Why must Yorahan always sacrifice? Please leave this person alone now. All this time..."

"I understand."

At Yorahan's voice, Armang turned her head.

"You..."

Yorahan's face, returned to a calm expression, emanated holy light.

"You're right. I cannot block everyone's dreams with my dream. I'll step back now."

Armang shook her head.

"No! You finally achieved your dream. If you give up even that, I... I..."

In reality, her husband would already be dead.

"But I have a condition."

Yorahan spoke.

"If someone..."

After thinking briefly, he smiled.

"If there's someone with the same thoughts as me, please convey my life to them."

This was the beginning of the Transmission Dream.
