[648] The Way They Live (1)

After leaving the city of Creas, Shirone and Rian tied their horses on a mountain path and ate a late lunch.

"It's delicious."

Unlike Amy's carefully prepared rice ball lunch boxes, the meal Tess had packed was closer to military rations, but both were satisfied with their meal.

"By the way, where are we going now?"

Though it was quite a late question, Rian was prepared to follow Shirone anywhere, so their destination was of little concern to him.

The advantage over serving as a knight's attendant was that Shirone used his brain, and as expected, the words flowed smoothly.

"Honestly, finding Ra on our own seems impossible."

Shirone spread out the world map he had taken from the Augent family.

There were 70 countries by name alone, and including tribal territories and other species' domains, it would take more than a lifetime to travel the entire world.

"Jinseongeum, wasn't that woman royalty? She'd have it easier than us when it comes to searching."

"Yeah. But we're not without connections either."

Though incomparable to royalty, Shirone had built considerable connections traveling between school and heaven.

"First, there's Miro. Actually, Miro might have already met Ra."

"But the important thing is we don't know where Miro is, right? What about that person called Terazera? At least we could meet them if we went there."

Kashan's intelligence network wouldn't fall behind Jincheon's.

"Yeah. We might need their help depending on the situation. But it's too far to do anything immediately."

Rian examined the map.

The world could be broadly classified into four lands.

The North Pole where the Ivory Tower stood, the continent where kingdoms gathered, the East across the Atlantic, and the South spanning the equator below the East.

The largest territory was naturally the continent, shaped like a sigma (Î£) embracing the Atlantic and South Pacific.

The continent was further divided into the Northern Continent, Central Continent, Southern Continent, and Middle East. Shirone's homeland Tormia was one of the 21 kingdoms in the Central Continent, located toward the South Pacific.

"Since Kashan is in the Northern Continent..."

The Northern Continent was entirely imperial territory, with Kashan and Gustav sharing borders.

"Even continuing north from Bashka, we'd have to pass through roughly the kingdoms of Yakma, Kazra, Peris, Biden, and Zaib to arrive."

It was a dizzying journey just to think about.

Though the test had no time limit, considering the competitors' abilities, they'd need to find Ra within at least a year to pass.

Shirone said, "Finding Ra immediately is too vague. So I think we should first try to find the magic school Ra graduated from."

"Ah."

At the school, they could at least confirm basic personal information.

"But we don't know which school Ra graduated from."

"That's why we're going to the capital. There's someone who knows exactly."

"Who?"

"Scout Baikal."

Thinking he could ask Flu for help, Shirone dusted himself off and stood up.

"Let's go. We need to stay overnight in Kentra and reach the capital by tomorrow."

After riding for four hours, Shirone and Rian arrived in Kentra, left their horses at the stable, and entered the city.

True to its reputation as a livestock city, cowboys could be seen everywhere, and unlike Creas with its refined ladies, tomboyish women were giggling and wandering about.

'Teacher Siena said she met Quan here.'

Recalling the now dreamlike memories of heaven, the place they found was the mages' guild.

"Silvering Guild."

Reading the sign, Shirone turned to Rian and explained.

"Since I have an unofficial mage certificate, I should be able to use the guild now."

"But can we find information about Ra here?"

There was no possibility that a mere guild would know about someone even the Ivory Tower couldn't find.

"Probably difficult. But it won't hurt to gain experience. It seems like they offer lodging too, so let's stay here tonight."

Since it was winter and the sun set early with cold weather, Rian followed Shirone's words without complaint.

Opening the door, they entered a cozy space with torches hanging on all sides.

Mages at tables were reading books or playing chess, and some were already drunk and sleeping face-down.

Stairs leading to the second floor were visible, and there was a counter on the way there.

"Welcome. This is the mages' sanctuary, Silvering Guild."

A woman sitting at the counter stood up and gave a business greeting.

"Oh?"

Seeing two people younger than expected enter, the woman looked at them with interest.

"Are you two mages?"

"No. Only I'm a mage. This is my friend."

Rian added, "I'm a swordsman."

Confirming the great sword strapped to his back, she nodded.

"Right. I'm Estera, manager of Silvering Guild. What can I help you with?"

"We were wondering if we could get lodging."

"Huh? Is this your first time at a guild?"

Shirone honestly nodded.

"Yes, it's my first time."

"I thought so. Lodging is provided free to guild members, so you can't use it. How about joining Silvering Guild while you're here? If you're a mage, there would be many conveniences."

Since even holding an unofficial certificate allowed one to make a living and gather information, guild membership was practically essential for unofficial mages.

"Hmm."

As could be seen from the Parrot Mercenary Group's story, kingdoms dominated by magic associations didn't have world-famous mage guilds.

However, according to Shirone's research, Silvering Guild was one of the three major national guilds representing Tormia, along with War Chariot and Blood Rose.

Since they opened branches in various regions handling diverse tasks, it wasn't a bad proposal, but for Shirone who planned to leave Tormia Kingdom anyway, there were no particular benefits.

"I'm not thinking of joining a guild yet."

"Hehe, does it feel burdensome? Don't worry. Silvering Guild allows free entry and withdrawal."

A guild's primary goal was undoubtedly expansion, and the competition between national guilds was fierce accordingly.

The free entry and withdrawal system was also Silvering Guild's unique business strategy to maintain the largest possible workforce.

'Free membership, huh.'

The ability to use lodging facilities for free was appealing, but his judgment remained cautious.

"Let me think about it a bit more."

The moment Shirone's words fell, Rian's eyes changed.

He felt fierce hostility from the mages in the hall.

They were all likely members of Silvering Guild, and it couldn't feel good to have their guild ignored by a boy who had just entered society.

Estera felt the same way inside, but being skilled, her expression didn't change at all.

"Alright, if that's comfortable for you. Silvering Guild's doors are always open."

Though they ended up having to find lodging elsewhere, since they were already at the guild, Shirone asked.

"I heard you can obtain various information at guilds."

Estera's business-minded eyes sparkled.

"Of course. Though it costs money. What information are you looking for?"

After glancing at Rian once, Shirone asked.

"Do you have information about someone named Ra Enemy?"

There wasn't much else to ask about.

"Ra Enemy?"

Estera tilted her head, then raised the corner of her mouth as if having a good idea and held up her index finger.

"One gold."

"What?"

Shirone blinked in bewilderment.

"You just asked if there's information about someone named Ra Enemy. To hear the answer to that, you need to pay one gold."

"You want money just to know whether information exists or not?"

Though beyond common sense, this was the guild's nature.

"All information exchanged in the guild is money. Guild members might be different, but we don't tell outsiders anything for free."

Laughter came from the hall.

"Naive brats who don't know how the world works. If you want freebies, go ask your mommy."

Rian simply crossed his arms and squinted one eye.

'What will you do, Shirone?'

The philosophy that swords don't judge was effective here too.

'Hmm, so current funds are 300 gold.'

Though a large amount in face value, it wasn't much considering the journey ahead.

Most importantly, there was no way to know if this type of question actually required money, or if it was Estera's cunning revenge for hesitating about membership.

"I'll pay one gold."

Therefore, Shirone paid the money.

If he didn't clarify things when he had the chance, he'd make mistakes when it really mattered.

Readily paying one gold was unexpected even for Estera, but her hand collecting the gold coin that clinked down was unhesitating.

"Now please tell me. Do you have information about Ra Enemy?"

Estera flicked the coin and answered briefly.

"Yes."

"You do?"

Shirone's eyes widened in confusion.

"You really have it?"

"You know what happens if you commit fraud in this business, right? Wait at the table. I'll organize it and bring it to you."

Shirone stared blankly at Estera entering the records room, then finally looked around the hall.

Unlike association people, fierce-looking mages were staring this way.

A mage with an eyepatch over one eye, a mage missing his entire right arm, a mage with burn scars on his face - their appearances alone suggested the lives they had lived.

When Shirone and Rian sat at a table, a guild member serving brought them tea.

Even while sipping the mind-clearing tea, Shirone couldn't understand.

How could a mage guild in a regional area, not even the capital, have information about Ra Enemy?

"Hey, kid."

The one-eyed mage called out.

"You're a magic school graduate, right?"

"Yes, but why?"

"Heh heh. I knew it. It's written on your face. What could you possibly gain from such a lowly guild? But you know what, this business isn't as easy as you think. If you're a magic school graduate, you must be nobility or something, but with that attitude, you won't accomplish anything."

Shirone listened silently.

If there really was information about Ra Enemy here, it meant he had been making a tremendous miscalculation that would require completely revising his established strategy.

After waiting about an hour while receiving scorn from the mages, Estera called him to the counter.

"Did you find the information?"

Estera took out twenty-seven cards with Silvering Guild's mark on the back.

"These are information cards. The marks differ, but most guilds trade information with these."

Since information loses value the moment it's confirmed, a special format was needed for monetary transactions.

"All these cards are information about Ra Enemy?"

It was much more than expected.

"Yeah. I brought all information that included the keyword Ra Enemy even once. One hundred percent accuracy."

"How much?"

When he asked without hesitation, Estera raised the corner of her mouth.

"Two gold each."

To purchase all twenty-seven cards would cost a whopping 54 gold.

"Isn't that too expensive?"

"No, you're actually lucky. All 27 pieces of information are in 'pure' condition."

Estera explained.

"All the information here was purchased with money from someone. And when you mention a keyword like you did, we sell information included in that keyword."

This method certainly allowed trading intangible information like store merchandise.

"Think of the one gold you paid as the keyword fee. And pure condition means information no one has accessed yet."

Since different people valued the same information differently, using access frequency as a standard was reasonable.

"But how can I trust that?"

"Of course there's no way to prove it. That's why the price difference isn't huge. Information never accessed is two gold. Information accessed even once is one gold fifty silver. Information accessed too much with no security value is sold for one gold."

After thinking briefly, Shirone placed two gold coins down.

"Then I'll buy just one card for now."

"Good. Which one should I give you?"

"The very last one."

Since they would have read the information while copying it onto cards, there was a chance they placed what they considered most important last.

"Good judgment. Be careful not to let others see."

Shirone quickly snatched the card and even after checking the front, still couldn't take his eyes off it.

'So this is how the world works...'

Below the information provider's name was a single sentence.

Ra Enemy is "presumed" to be male.
