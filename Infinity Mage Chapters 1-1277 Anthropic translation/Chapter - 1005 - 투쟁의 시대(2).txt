Age of Struggle (2)

Seina's face flushed with shame.

The paladins of the Oracle Management Division held the most noble mission in the Lamie Church within their hearts.

For such a person to succumb to evil, swayed by mere human emotions, she couldn't find the courage to face Shirone.

'I have no right to reproach him.'

If not for Shirone's salvation, she too would have pierced her own throat and ended her life.

"Prepare to depart." Seina gave orders to her holy knights, then turned to look at Shirone with a resentful expression.

"I owe you a debt. But this is not all the Lamie Church has to offer. The highest-ranking paladins of the Vatican are..."

"I don't care about that."

Shirone said.

"The Pandemonium is deceiving people. This should be an issue the Lamie Church cannot ignore either."

It was the most human form of evil.

"We will go to the Vatican. We must report the full details of this incident and receive new divine guidance."

Seina examined Rabika, whose body lay twisted and broken.

'What a pity. If he were alive, he could have testified. We should at least take other survivors with us.'

With that thought, she turned her gaze, but not a single person approached the holy knights.

'Foolish creatures.'

She was angry at them for judging based only on the results before their eyes, but today was her defeat.

"We'll leave the villagers behind." Seina mounted her horse.

"That doesn't mean I acknowledge you. Soon, an inquisitor from the Heresy Management Division will come looking for you. You'd better conduct yourself properly."

The most secretive department within the Lamie Church.

'And also the most dangerous place.'

If the Oracle Management Division moved with faith, the Heresy Management Division was composed of those who moved with hatred.

In a way, merely mentioning the existence of such a department was already showing favor.

"Let's go."

Shirone didn't turn his gaze away until Seina left the village with her holy knights.

'We fight evil, but our convictions are different.' The more Shirone's universal love spread throughout the world, the more frequent their clashes would become.

Nade asked.

"Shirone, what about the survivors? We can't take them all on our journey."

Shirone checked on Iruki's condition.

He was no longer bleeding, but the aftereffects of using Overdrive wouldn't have subsided yet.

"Let's camp at the foot of the mountain today. I've spoken to Mr. Rampa, so he'll find a suitable city for them to settle in."

Wiping the blood from his face, Iruki thought.

'Arnold Rampa. If he's the Ivory Tower's greatest information mage, he should be able to find something suitable. More importantly...'

What mattered was that the survivors who had experienced Shirone's miracle would spread word in the cities.

'If we plant seeds like this, they'll eventually bear fruit. Perhaps...'

He thought that a direct confrontation with the Lamie Church might come much sooner than expected.

Gaspa, a southern city of Tormia. Using the capital Bashka as their base, the demons spread out in all directions, endlessly moving south.

Though the royal castle's swift response prevented total annihilation, the aftermath of the emotional sickness was even more terrifying.

The streets overflowed with vagrants who had abandoned their homes, and with public order barely maintained, crimes occurred daily without end.

"This is serious."

In the eyes of people who had destroyed their precious things one by one, there was killing intent beyond mere poison.

Shirone said.

"The World Health Organization has established behavioral guidelines for dealing with emotional sickness based on collected cases. It's divided into 17 major categories, and by placing life-threatening items later in the sequence, they control the threshold of emotional sickness."

"The Cross family received it too. I didn't read it though. What's the maximum duration one can endure by following the behavioral guidelines exactly?"

"At most two months. The goal is to find a cure within that time, but there's been no progress yet."

Shirone's gaze turned to a vagrant.

"Abandoning one's residence corresponds to Category 8. This is a behavioral guideline for at least 4 weeks later, but people are already abandoning their homes in droves."

"Well, there's no rule that can satisfy everyone."

Having not left his house for a long time, Kaiden felt moved seeing the world firsthand.

'Everyone carries the same pain. Perhaps compared to them, my worries might be trivial, but...'

Shirone asked.

"Kaiden, how did you solve it though, the emotional sickness?"

"I'm no different from others. My father endured by giving up precious things one by one. Family heirlooms, wealth, distant relatives... The Cross family fell to the point where it couldn't recover."

Kaiden turned his head.

"But my case seems a bit different. The fate of the Red Cross draws out 100 percent of all talents except what I truly want. As long as I don't give up Maya, emotional sickness isn't a problem."

Amy asked in bewilderment.

"You don't get emotionally sensitive?"

"Right. I don't know the exact reason either. Anyway, if emotional sickness is also a type of illness, I've hardly ever been sick."

Shirone asked.

"'Hardly' means... there have been times?"

"When I was very young. I heard about the plague from my grandmother and was scared. I prayed not to get sick, but the very next day I caught a cold."

What one truly wants never comes to pass.

"I stayed sick for about a year after that. I wanted to get better, you see. My grandmother cried and apologized, but it was futile."

Kaiden shrugged.

"Of course, I grew up hearing about the Red Cross fate from birth. If I had thought it didn't matter even if I got sick, I probably would have recovered from being sick..."

Shirone understood.

"The heart isn't something you can easily change."

"Right. Especially when you're young. Anyway, it wasn't serious. I worked hard at swordsmanship and became healthy. Gradually, my heart began to grow stronger too."

Shirone newly realized how cruel a law the Red Cross fate was.

'If you've experienced such bizarre things your whole life, you can't help but fear desperately wanting something.'

Amy asked.

"How is it now? You can overcome emotional sickness because you love Maya. Isn't that fortunate?"

"Let me put it this way."

Kaiden's eyes filled with intensity.

"If I could just escape from this cursed fate, I wouldn't care about emotional sickness or anything else. If I could achieve what I want even for a single moment, I'd be fine with dying."

No one could define Kaiden's life.

"If I desperately want to sleep, sleep won't come, and if I desperately want to eat, I don't get hungry. I had to train not to be obsessed. Do you know what that means? It means I've never once in my life done what I wanted to do."

Shirone's eyes narrowed.

'I see. Emotion Scale.'

Kaiden's emotional scale was so twisted that nothing could be called a priority.

'Perhaps it's not just a matter of the immune system.'

Kaiden asked.

"But why is Maya here? She's a major singer, isn't she? I heard she had a contract with Valkyrie."

"Emotional sickness."

Shirone's face darkened.

"Like everyone else, she's forced to give up many things she held dear. But the truly precious things aren't easily abandoned."

Amy asked.

"For Maya, that would be singing?"

"Yes. I heard she terminated her contract with the performance agency. The CEO wanted to keep her, but that too would become an emotional scale and come back to haunt her. It must have been an unavoidable choice."

"Even so..."

As they left the main road and entered a gloomy alley, Kaiden's brow furrowed.

"Why does it have to be a place like this?"

"I've only heard information about it; I've never met Maya directly. If it's not to this extent, perhaps she's segmented her emotions so finely that she can't sing."

The place they finally arrived at was a tavern with a red sign depicting women's underwear.

From the narrow space leading underground, singing could be heard accompanied by cheap-sounding instruments.

"Maya..."

Kaiden could picture her the moment he heard it.

"Customers?"

A man crouched by the entrance smoking a cigarette looked back at them.

When Shirone didn't answer, the man threw away his cigarette and stood up.

"Table fee is 5 gold. Drinks are calculated separately. No going up on stage or throwing things."

The fact that he specifically mentioned obvious rules made Amy uncomfortable.

"So other things are okay? And 5 gold - do you know how much that is?"

The man scratched his ear with an annoyed expression.

"Didn't you come knowing? Maya's here. The most amazing singer in Tormia."

Shirone handed over a gold coin.

"Here it is."

After checking the amount, the man crouched back down by the entrance and lit a new cigarette.

"Go on in. Fair warning though - if you're a woman, you probably won't find it very entertaining in there."

Warning them after taking the money.

"Kaiden, go in."

Shirone planned to stay outside anyway.

"Just me?"

"Yes. It might hurt Maya's feelings more if I go in."

Kaiden looked up at the sign, took a deep breath, and nodded.

"Alright."

With each step down the stairs, the drum sounds grew louder and his heartbeat quickened.

As soon as he turned the underground entrance, he smelled acrid cigarette smoke, and everything was dark except for the stage.

Maya was humming along to a blues performance.

Maya's figure swaying under the cheap lighting was still beautiful, but...

'Why, why?' Her attire felt too cold even in the hot air filled with men's passion.

Kaiden surveyed the customers.

Men with dead eyes spouting lewd jokes and engaging in perverted behavior.

'Maya.'

The song didn't stop.

Maya's face, staring into the empty space above the tables, showed no emotion whatsoever.

'Stop...'

Kaiden, who had been clenching his fists and grinding his teeth, finally couldn't bear it and shouted.

"Stop it!" The musicians stopped playing, and emotions finally appeared in Maya's eyes.

'Who is it? Is he very drunk?' It was too dark to see his face. Meanwhile, the drunk customers around got up.

"What are you? Just when things were heating up, you're ruining the mood..."

Kaiden pushed the drunk's chest with his hand and walked quickly toward the stage.

"Oh..."

Maya's eyes widened.

"Kaiden?"

She hurriedly put on the coat she had thrown on the floor and asked while avoiding his gaze.

"How, how did you know about this place...?"

"Maya."

Countless words he wanted to convey to her flashed through Kaiden's mind.

'What should I say?'

His sincere feelings for her would ultimately become tragedy before the Red Cross fate.

"Outside..."

Kaiden said tearfully.

"Shirone is waiting outside. So let's go together. We'll protect you."

"Shirone?"

Her face, which had been unable to focus for a moment, suddenly turned pale.

"Shirone."

Her gaze shook anxiously, then she hurriedly turned around and fled to the back of the stage.

"Maya! Wait, Maya!"

Just as Kaiden was about to chase after her, a drunk approached and grabbed his shoulder.

"You bastard! Where do you think you're going after causing a scene? Gah!"

The drunk's body spun in the air from the punch thrown at tremendous speed as Kaiden turned around.

As the drunk fell upside down, the customers who had sobered up backed away hesitantly.

"This..."

He had been able to hit the drunk because there was someone else he wanted to hit even more desperately.

"Shirone!"

Kaiden rushed up the stairs in one bound and pointed his sword at Shirone.

It had the force of a great swordsman, but as expected, the sword couldn't pierce Shirone.

"Ugh!"

All strength left his body, and he felt as if he had forgotten even how to hold a sword.

"Don't get excited."

Kaiden twisted his neck left and right with difficulty, then glared at Shirone diagonally.

"Answer my question. You... said you have the ability to cure emotional sickness, didn't you?"

"It's only a temporary effect."

"Answer me!"

"...Yes."

"Then why didn't you cure Maya? Why did you leave her to become like that?"

"That's why I brought you."

While Kaiden couldn't understand, Shirone's eyes grew coldly calm.
