Solar War (3)

Aegis's wide-range communication spread out.

"Breaking news! Yahweh2 and Operator in standoff! Golden Wheel 1st battalion forces, requesting support!"

The Golden Wheel members checked the satellite footage.

Wild West, smoke still rising from his .44 caliber Magnum, gaped like an idiot.

"Huh? It's real?"

Around them lay Western Nation users, collapsed with holes blown through their foreheads.

"Shall we go take a look? If we end it here, that's that. Since we've already taken the bait, we could call off the Solar War."

Volga's Son communicated.

"Just stand by. The match won't be decided early on."

Fermi, who gave the order, thought to himself.

'The Solar War win rate between Eastern and Western Nations is roughly 50-50. But their victory patterns are different.'

Excluding the invincible user called Operator, the Eastern Nation was rated as having superior overall strength.

The Ascension guild members were also skilled, but Golden Wheel was a company of gathered professionals.

Yet still a fifty percent win rate.

This showed what the existence called Operator meant to the Western Nation users.

Aegis opened a private communication channel.

"Boss, what do you think? If we've really drawn out Operator, this is an opportunity."

"There's no need for the Eastern Nation to make sacrifices."

"Even so, the promise was a duel. Shouldn't both winner and loser accept the outcome?"

"But a direct confrontation has no chance of victory. Even Yahweh2 acknowledged that fact."

An undefeated record.

In a Solar War where thousands of users clash, never dying even once was practically impossible.

'Therefore, it's right to assume the record was managed.'

If he had wanted to, Fermi could have built an undefeated record as well.

'There's just no reason to.'

In a system where you revive after death, how inefficient was it to worry about honor?

'In High Gear, death is also part of tactics. But Operator can no longer do that.'

It had already become an issue directly tied to the morale of the entire Western Nation, beyond personal honor.

"Let's watch. As long as Yahweh2 focuses on the Solar War, Operator won't be able to strike too hard either."

Sirone was right.

"Understood."

Aegis, who cut the private communication, relayed Fermi's orders through wide-range communication.

Even during this, Yahweh2 and Operator were engaged in fierce reconnaissance battle.

Broadcasting satellites being livestreamed to all continents of High Gear zoomed in on the two.

"Whoa..."

The users gathered in front of the large electronic billboards were mesmerized by their combat.

"Four legendary-grade equipment."

It was the first time anyone had collected them all, and their skill in handling the parts was truly superhuman.

A sphere of light vibrated above Yahweh2's palm.

"Michelan Gun."

Operator, who moved in zigzags to avoid the flash rapid-fire, extended one foot to brake.

Simultaneously, his back opened and mechanical steel frames equipped with gun barrels came over his shoulders.

"Black Gun."

Each time ion cannons fired from the twin barrels, the steel frames shook back and forth.

The speed matched the Michelan Gun, and Sirone's time perception slowed the flow of time.

'○○○......!'

■—?! ■? ?

That's why it was eerie.

To see Operator between the ion cannons approaching in two rows, scraping the ground.

'What's that fast?'

Her delicate fist passed by Yahweh2's cheek, sharp as an awl.

"Whoo!"

Immediately the opposite fist flew in, striking Sirone's side with a devastating blow.

KWAAAAANG!

Though the reinforced armor Raphael activated, there was nothing to be done about the entire machine being sent flying.

'The machine itself is a weapon.'

All the top rankers were strong, but Operator seemed to focus everything on machine performance rather than firearms.

As Yahweh2 landed while scraping the ground, Eastern and Western Nation forces crossed and blocked the view.

"Kahahaha! I'll take down Yahweh2!"

Above that crowd of people, a machine over 8 meters tall unleashed a cylindrical rotary machine gun.

Code name Bishamonten.

As large bullets raked left and right, Eastern Nation users were shattered and sent flying in wretched states.

'Monster form.'

In reality, if a person with 2 arms equipped 4 arms, machine operation would be difficult.

'Yet he's handling it like his own body. That means the avatar itself is huge. Is he a demon?' 

Since all life forms that dream can come to Under Coder, it couldn't be confirmed.

Bishamonten charged while activating boosters.

"Is this all you've got!"

Plasma beams spread in fan shapes from the paired lenses on both shoulders.

As the front was swept away with a thunderous roar, dozens of Eastern Nation forces' armor melted.

"AAAAHHH!"

Just as Bishamonten's lips curled at the pleasant screams, his back felt eerie.

Turning his neck 180 degrees, he saw Sirone floating an enormous sphere of light.

'Tch! Direct hit?'

As Bishamonten crossed his arms over his chest in an X, his forearms opened and transformed into thick armor plates.

The flash struck directly on those armor plates.

"Urk..."

With a thud, the machine shook and the 80-ton machine slid across the ground.

"AAAAHHH!"

Finally collapsed, Bishamonten's armor plates were horribly dented, and Eastern Nation rankers rushed in.

"You bastard! Just wait and see!"

The moment his death cry erupted, Operator approached sliding with legs spread wide.

A black sword was gripped in her hand.

"Checkmate."

The dimension opened, and Sirone leaped over the code to emerge behind Operator.

What he saw in that moment was.

'Oh no.'

The blade of the black sword entering toward his neck.

'Foolish, Yahweh2. I know all the positions.'

Even if he leaped over the code, he couldn't escape her intentions as the designer.

High Gear output at maximum as the blade approached at terrifying speed.

Sparks flew from the black sword.

CLANG!

Just from Operator's arm being lifted, the power of the bullet could be fully imagined.

"Heh heh heh! You can't forget about me."

As Sirone looked to the side, Wild West was spinning his .44 Magnum.

Though called a .44 Magnum, it was the weapon with the strongest single-shot power in High Gear.

Operator lowered her raised arm.

'It's the Solar War.'

Watching the Eastern Nation users running from the distance, she bent both legs.

The arms behind her came over her head, and with the black sword aimed, she spoke.

"...Come at me."

Wild West loaded bullets into his .44 Magnum with skeletal hands as he spoke.

"If you push too hard, your undefeated record might get cracked, you know? How about the lady stays quietly in her palace?"

Operator checked the satellite footage.

'We're being pushed back.'

It was only the beginning, but Eastern Nation users were concentrating on this location.

If undefeated Operator was the Western Nation's morale, then the desire to defeat her was the Eastern Nation's morale.

'It might help if I don't step forward.'

Though she thought this, Operator's will took even deeper root.

"Then try breaking it."

She thought of it as a kind of reward for Yahweh2, who was taking the Solar War seriously.

"This might be your only chance. And probably... Yahweh2 is undefeated too, right?"

Those watching the broadcast stirred.

"What's she talking about? Yahweh2 isn't even a ranker, why is Operator paying so much attention?"

"Right. He's just a celebrity, isn't he?"

On the other hand, the rankers actually fighting the Solar War felt it in their bones.

'This Solar War is different from usual.'

All Golden Wheel guild members were moving to support Yahweh2.

Wild West opened his mouth and fell into thought.

'Is she trying to say that Yahweh2's death isn't free from affecting morale either? Well, the risk is greater for our side at only level 307.'

Aegis communicated.

"Boss's orders to proceed as planned."

"Okay."

Wild West raised his gun barrel.

"Let's go."

A powerful bullet fired, and Operator moved the black sword while creating afterimages.

Using the sparks flying from the blade as a signal flare, key figures from Eastern and Western Nations clashed.

That scene spread through the broadcast screens.

Even the users fighting the Solar War kept screens open - it was a matter of utmost interest.

As rankers gathered one after another, and now even those belonging to the 2nd battalion joined, the battlefield where Yahweh2 was located instantly transformed into the core of the Solar War.

Destruction Demon 707, unleashing firearms, shouted through the friend channel.

"Hey! Look at the broadcast screen! That's me on screen right now, right? That's me!"

Death Princess's voice also trembled.

"You're right. To think we'd be caught on the Solar War main screen. At this rate, aren't we becoming celebrities? Hohoho!"

Strongest Codename said.

"We're already celebrities. Users from all continents are watching us."

"Good! I am the Destruction Demon!"

The moment Destruction Demon 707 charged while increasing output, the augmented reality flickered off.

'Huh?'

Shortly after, the machine exploded, and Death Princess and Strongest Codename turned like mirrors.

"Destruction Demon!"

Western Nation ranker Little Witch was standing on the destroyed machine.

"Hello?"

It was just a simulation, but the moment they heard her voice, both felt their souls freeze.

Shortly after, two explosive sounds erupted in succession.

"What the...?"

Sirone confirmed his friends' deaths but had no time to worry about elsewhere.

Aegis joined the battlefield.

"Yahweh2. I'll provide cover."

Even fighting equally, the power shortage from level differences was unavoidable.

'The auxiliary charging device...'

Just as Sirone was about to retreat, Little Witch unleashed all her grenades.

"Capture Yahweh2!"

Hearing her words, Western Nation rankers who realized concentrated their firepower, causing an explosion.

"Whooooo!"

Sirone, who escaped through dimension-jumping, staggered as he stood up, when a shadow flickered in the smoke.

It was Wild West.

"Heh heh heh."

Isolated by the bombardment, he just kept pulling the trigger and spinning the empty cylinder.

"Unlucky encounter."

Operator, who appeared like a ghost, thrust the black sword toward his High Gear.

The sound of the machine being penetrated was heard.

"...Excellent judgment."

Sirone, who leaped over the code through dimension-jumping, took the sword in front of Wild West.

'It's better if I die.'

Wild West met Yahweh2's eyes.

"I owe you one."

Even while watching electricity flow through the entire machine, his hands were loading the cylinder.

The black sword was withdrawn.

As Yahweh2 collapsed, simultaneously the .44 Magnum's barrel spat fire forward.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Operator fled to the side.

'That's dangerous.'

As the grenade smoke cleared and appeared on the broadcast screen, all Solar War users flinched.

'What?'

Yahweh2 was down.

'One victory for now.'

Operator, who coldly counted up, launched her body searching for another prey.

'The sacrifice considering power was good. But what about Eastern Nation morale?'

Aegis communicated to Fermi.

"Yahweh2 down! Returned to start point! Should we abandon the combat zone and retreat?"

"Just hold position. He'll come back anyway."

"But currently Eastern Nation morale is..."

"It'll rise."

"What?"

Just as Aegis squinted and questioned back, Fermi couldn't hold back and burst into laughter.

"Heh heh heh. Heh heh heh heh."

"If he's serious about becoming a High Gear user."

"Boss?"

"Hold on."

Fermi's speed as he raced with fierce momentum was transmitted through the communication frequency.

"That'll become the most interesting place."
