Missing Link (3)

Even after Sirone's story about humanity's good and evil ended, the group maintained their silence.

Iruki was lost in thought.

'So that's how it was.'

The Gaians who had mastered the mind.

For them, who could achieve wholeness no matter what they did, good and evil, merit and love would have been indistinguishable.

'Ultima was broken.' It wasn't about what actions one took, but about how those actions were defined.

Sirone continued speaking.

"I don't know what happened to Cain after that. Disappearing in thick smoke was Omega's final record. In the end, he fled reality and escaped to Under Coder."

Though it wasn't recorded, the actions of Melkidu that Sirone's group had experienced told the story.

"I thought and agonized through countless nights."

Cain said.

"Where did it all go wrong? No, was it really wrong at all? Why did I have to make such a decision? Was it truly evil?"

The group listened.

"The conclusion is that everything is a dice game. I just threw the dice. Without even knowing what number would come up."

Whether the cold world chose Abel, or the moment he plunged the knife into his brother's chest.

"Yes, chaos. We are beings of chaos."

Cain knocked on his head.

"Before I call myself 'me,' there are commands that move me. From the top of this skull, there are special signals transmitted to us. Electrical sparks, perhaps a priori, what we call impulses...

There's a missing link.

"In the end, humans are nothing but puppets of signals coming from far away. Even the mind. That is, we cannot do anything by ourselves, and therefore cannot change anything."

This was evil's conclusion to the Beron problem.

Sirone asked.

"Does reaching that conclusion make the guilt disappear a bit?"

"...That's always the problem." Cain looked back at Lilith's portrait.

"Melkidu is a world based on evil's methodology. So far, countless sinners have gathered here. Though I'm trapped in this place, I've heard many stories. But whether they knew what they were doing or made a momentary mistake, sinners all think the same thing in the end. They wish that day had never happened..."

Because pleasure is only momentary.

"Of course, there are those who settled here because they like it. That type attaches all sorts of flowery words to sanctify Melkidu, but..."

Cain looked at Curtis.

"Even if I don't go to prison, even if the incident is erased, what I did doesn't disappear."

Because there is no holy land for demons.

Iruki said.

"I have one question. According to Sirone, Lilith died at Adam's hands, so how did humanity's lineage continue to this point?"

"Because she didn't die."

Sirone said.

"Of course Lilith died, but the seed of mitochondrial Eve still remained."

A miracle.

Or perhaps a curse?

Crash!

On that night of thunder and lightning, Adam came to check on his family in the village.

Heading first to his wife's house, he heard screaming through the noise of the heavy rain.

"What...?"

He changed direction and arrived unexpectedly at Abel's house, where the smell of blood was thick.

When he opened the door, what he saw was Abel's corpse and Lulluwa in a state of shock.

"Ah......"

Lulluwa regained focus and spoke.

"Father."

"What happened?"

Though Adam was also a Gaian who had fought wars and was accustomed to death, at least not in Eden.

"Ca, Cain..."

Lulluwa explained in a trembling voice.

Learning the full story, Adam's eyes flashed terrifyingly with a Gaian's killing intent.

"Foolish boy."

Adam said as he left through the door.

"Don't leave this place tonight. When dawn breaks, then go find your brothers."

"Yes, I understand."

Lulluwa nodded repeatedly, but as soon as Adam disappeared, her expression turned cold.

"...What happened?"

She raised both hands and examined her own body.

"Why am I?"

Had she become Lilith?

The moment she was shocked by Abel's death, massive memories flooded in as if her brain was opening.

'These are my memories from long ago. From before I gave birth to Lulluwa. But Lulluwa's life also remains in my mind.'

Including how much she had loved Abel.

Thanks to this, she could deceive Adam, but honestly, her own identity was questionable.

'Lulluwa with Lilith's memories, or Lilith with Lulluwa's memories - which one am I?'

After thinking for a long time, she stood up.

"I am Eve."

There was no such thing as identity.

She was the generic term for life itself, living through endless generations for eons.

'What should I do now?' While she was lost in this unanswerable contemplation, dawn broke, but Adam did not return.

She headed to Lilith's house.

In the desolate silence, her own corpse lay fallen with a broken neck, fluids spilling out.

"Haha."

The reason her husband killed her was probably not unrelated to Cain's disappearance.

"Ahahaha! Hahahaha!"

Tears flowed down her cheeks.

"It's over."

Thus the age of Gaians in Eden came to an end, but Eve's life was just beginning.

She infiltrated among the brothers.

Sometimes demurely, sometimes vibrantly, she played countless personalities and spread her offspring.

'Forget.'

Since whoever Eve loved would be incest, it was not love but murky desire.

'Forget everything.'

As generations passed, her descendants changed into primitive forms with only animal desires remaining.

'Love me! More!'

Each time taboos were broken, the magic grew stronger, and daughters became new Eves spreading into the world.

'Pleasure! Sensation! Endless desire!'

The reason mitochondrial Eve is inherited only through women is...

"Grrrr! Sniff! Sniff!"

Because they are all Eve...

"Therefore."

Sirone said.

"No matter which region they originated from, all humanity born on this earth becomes Eve's children."

Iruki let out a long breath.

'Now there have been so many mutations that even epidemiological investigation is meaningless, but...'

Conceptually, Eve was humanity's mother.

"Yes. In fact, what mother dreamed of was brilliant and beautiful love. But since all humanity are her children, all she could do was surrender to pleasure. And eventually she met you. Sirone, you specifically."

Everyone looked at Sirone.

"Hexa, you have no cause. You're the only one among humanity who isn't Eve's child. Though contradictory like a virgin giving birth, that too is a signal and proof that a god with a heart sent to this world. To mother, you are a special existence."

"So Uorin..."

The group realized.

Why the Empress of Kashan was obsessed with Sirone, and why Sirone avoided her.

The Holy Brain, Adam spoke.

"Still the same, those eyes."

While Kido remained tense, Uorin glared with a venomous expression.

"Don't treat me carelessly."

Though it had become hazy in primitive form, memories from Eden revived as humanity evolved.

"You killed me. You saw my appearance with a broken neck. What face do you have to appear before me? No."

Uorin sneered.

"Actually, you have no face. What's your reason for living so wretchedly? In such a hideous form."

Adam looked at Kido.

"Is that goblin your lover now? Your taste hasn't changed, then or now."

Uorin bared her teeth.

Though she was confident she wouldn't lose to anyone in the world, married couples were indeed not easy to deal with.

"Don't talk nonsense. I'm not the me you knew. Do you know how many generations I've been through?"

"Of course I know. I also became like this and traced humanity's history with you."

Adam had abandoned his physical body.

If Lilith lived a new life with Eve's abilities, he imitated humans as a phantom.

Men and women, young and old, politicians, doctors, beggars - he became countless humans and experienced Eve's history.

"Why?"

Uorin asked.

"What's the reason? You found me disgusting. What does it matter to you whatever I do?"

"Taking responsibility."

When he left Eden, he had intended to die.

"Lilith, you committed something you couldn't take responsibility for. That would be the evil you created. But I also couldn't be free from that responsibility."

Adam extended his hand.

"Come with me. The end of the world we created is coming. Shouldn't we do something for humanity at least once?"

"I refuse."

"If it's because of Sirone, give up. He won't come to you. Because he knows what you've done."

"Hmph, I don't care. What do you think I endured these long, tedious years for? Rather than use this body and abilities I perfected through countless generations for you..."

Uorin grabbed Kido's arm.

"I'd rather dedicate them to this goblin. This is my final warning. Never appear before me again."

"He has clear eyes."

Adam looked at Kido.

"Don't love Lilith. That woman will suck up everything you have. You'll endlessly wither away."

"Shut up."

Kido thrust out his spear.

"Ex-husband or whatever, I don't care at all. Because I love her. Of course... I'm a goblin, but."

The reason he added those last words was proof he was conscious of the ex-husband.

'Damn! I can't help it!'

Because this was the man who had already claimed her heart long ago, something he could never possess.

Adam laughed.

"Do you have the courage to say such things even looking at me now? Impressive. Don't worry. Lilith won't care in the slightest whether you're a goblin or not."

"What?"

Kido didn't understand.

"You..."

Without avoiding Uorin's murderous gaze, Adam stepped backward.

"Lilith, if you can't live for humanity, then leave with that goblin. The moment your history falls entirely into Harvitz's hands, you'll be committing another sin." Though Adam resented her, he understood the gravity of his words.

The Gaian body disappeared and a gray brain floated away into the darkness.

"Phew."

As tension released, Kido placed his hand on Uorin's shoulder.

"Are you okay?"

"Don't touch my body."

At the cold voice, Kido, lost in thought for a moment, slowly removed his hand and stepped back.

"Sorry."

Uorin found that even more unpleasant.

"I don't know what you're thinking, but don't mind Adam's words. I absolutely have no intention of doing anything with a goblin."

Kido nodded.

"I know."

Though thirst surged again, he accepted the enormous deficiency with his whole body.

'I'm the one who loves. At least... she doesn't push away even my love.'

Kido doesn't know.

That his savagery and intelligence make Uorin recall the past she wants to forget.

But he also suspects.

'Many things must have happened. She probably did things she wouldn't want to tell anyone. But that's okay.'

To Kido, Uorin was still the most beautiful and noble Empress of Kashan in the world.

"Kido."

And the man that empress loves is...

"Take me to Sirone."

A human shining so brightly that he, a monster, wouldn't dare compete.

"Alright."

Kido answered in a choked voice and smiled.

"Let's go, to Sirone."
