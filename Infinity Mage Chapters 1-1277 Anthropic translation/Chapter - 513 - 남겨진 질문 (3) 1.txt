[513] The Remaining Question (3)

Having learned the full story of the incident, Gando fell into deep thought.

He could understand that Ankera, upon realizing Satan's existence, had used the reset to give humanity another chance.

But one question still remained.

"Why... did you try to erase yourself?"

Ankera's erasure.

If Satan were to disappear, Ra could once again conquer the human world through a final war.

There was no reason to erase himself.

Uorin, who had answered every question readily until now, remained silent for a long time this time.

Through this fact, Gando realized.

While there was no déjà vu about Guffin's erasure, it was a story that could be sufficiently inferred.

Theraze had met Ra.

Otherwise, this kind of compromise wouldn't make sense.

"Yes. Theraze Mistra had a one-on-one encounter with Ra at the end of the final war. But the person he truly wanted to meet wasn't Theraze. The reason Mistra could prophesy Ra's erasure, and why the Empress was replaced earlier than scheduled, was all because of that child."

"That child being?"

"Ariane Sirone."

Gando recalled Sirone's face.

The bold boy who had proposed a deal to Gaold at the Magic Association.

Gaold probably intended to use him for the Heaven Project, but it was unexpected that Sirone's name would be mentioned even by Theraze.

"Why did Ra seek out Sirone?"

"To hear the answer to the remaining question."

When Gando tilted his head, Uorin added an explanation.

"Satan, that is, absolute chaos, was a concept that Ankera could never understand. He is the whole, but chaos exists outside the whole. The fear of that unknown awakened Ankera's ancient memories."

Uorin's expression slightly distorted as she drew out information close to primordial memories.

"Guffin was most likely a person who existed until recently. We've simply forgotten him."

Maclean Guffin had erased his existence from the Akashic Records.

Though he was still spoken of by a few people, what kind of human he had been could only be inferred through other information that had been combined with his name.

"The cause of Guffin's erasure is unclear. Currently, we can only think that he had some connection with Sirone. In any case, it seems certain that Guffin had some kind of consultation with Ra before his erasure. And in the process of that consultation, Guffin posed a certain question to Ra."

"What question would that be?"

"Ra is the incarnation of the Akashic Records. And everything, or the whole, of this world. When Mistra confronted Ra at that time, the question whose answer he wanted to hear from Sirone was precisely this."

Uorin straightened her long neck and turned her head slightly toward Gando as she spoke.

"Why am I..."

"Unable to become God?"

Ra asked, but Sirone still had no answer.

His avatar, bankrupted by the debt of Valhalla Action, was isolated in a prison of space-time.

Knowing this fact, Ra asked once more.

This was the promise he had made with Sirone during Guffin's erasure, and the one problem that Ankera could not understand.

"I am the whole. The beginning and end of this world. Yet why can I not become God? Why does chaos exist outside of me?"

"......"

Even a moment of silence was precious to Ankera.

A flash containing powerful energy was striking toward Araboth's spire, precisely toward himself.

If he couldn't hear an answer from Sirone, there was only one choice left for him.

"If I cannot seek answers from humans..."

Ankera's eyes flashed open.

"I will become human myself."

"Uoooh!"

Uriel pushed Miro to the very end.

23 seconds remained until Heaven's destruction.

But until the reset was attempted, until God's punishment destroyed Heaven, Miro had to be killed without fail.

"Graaah!"

Even with his jaw shattered, Sein clung to Uriel and cast Ilwol Gwangryun.

Though Ikael amplified the power of Ilwol Gwangryun, Uriel, completely ablaze, still rushed toward Miro and swung Geukrakgon.

Kuuuuuung!

Miro's eyes, forming hand seals, shook from the impact.

An archangel with such powerful force that he could create cracks in Miro's space-time using Cheonpok.

Though she had entered Sammae-gyeong to repair the cracks, thinking about it, Uriel was the root cause of all this trouble.

"What's wrong, Miro? Now that mouth of yours isn't moving, is it?"

"Graaah!"

Miro concentrated with all her might.

Crack.

Even so, small cracks were gradually forming in the small-scale barrier she had deployed.

19 seconds.

"Victory is before our eyes!"

"Everyone run toward death! Life lies beyond death!"

The rebels desperately advanced toward the spire.

The moment they entered Araboth, all thoughts had burned away, leaving only an obsession with victory that had become instinct.

17 seconds.

"Kieek! Kieek!"

Garas swept through the ruins of Jebul like wind, hunting angels.

The natural enemy of angels, noble spiritual beings, took the simplest form specialized only for reproduction.

Even at the moment the world ended, Garas would have only the animal urge to reproduce his species.

15 seconds.

"No! You can't leave us behind!"

Kanya embraced the broken Babel and wailed.

The transparent droplets flowing down the cold metal surface looked like Babel's tears.

13 seconds.

"Uncle! Uncle!"

"......"

Gaold was like a living corpse.

Where might his soul, dragged into hell, be wandering now?

Thinking that if she could, she would like to walk through that hell together, Gangnan buried her head in Gaold's embrace.

A flower blooming in hell.

That's why love is beautiful.

11 seconds.

Rumble!

Buildings were collapsing from all directions.

A large rock crashed down next to Quan's face as he looked up at the sky indifferently.

Perhaps next time an even larger rock might crush his face, but he simply continued gazing at the sky.

'It's ending.'

It was time for the clown's exit.

9 seconds.

Arius, knocked away by Uriel's strike, knelt like a defeated soldier and raised his head toward the sky.

Perhaps because he had lost his eyes, he discovered it before others.

"Eh. Eh."

A massive light was descending from the sky.

8 seconds.

With the unconscious Sirone before him, Flu staggered to his feet.

Without distinction between friend and foe, everyone had fought with everything on the line for what they believed was right.

"What is this..."

Flu shed tears.

Aspirations always shattered like mirages before reality.

"What is this!"

In the curves of a future twisted in an unknowable direction, where exactly were humans flowing?

7 seconds.

"Sirone..."

Ethella, having exhausted her strength with Myeolma's roar, knelt and arched her back like a bow as she looked up at the sky.

"Well done, Sirone."

She simply threw her whole heart into it.

"Myths are just myths."

Animal desires and sublime spirit, good and evil, everything one could throw their heart into.

All the myths humanity had created were racing toward destruction by a cold thought that had flashed through one boy's mind like lightning.

6 seconds.

'Parca Quan, was it.'

Armin smiled bitterly, feeling defeated.

'That person...'

Would be able to protect the woman he loved most for the rest of her life.

"Siina, you must be happy."

"Brother?"

Armin gave her a beautiful smile and cast Flicker magic toward the sky.

Siina, realizing too late, clutched her chest and screamed.

"Nooo!"

The terminal velocity of God's punishment was an incredible 41 Mach.

That is, 41 times the speed of sound.

Attempting to stop something at a speed that even Schema masters couldn't react to was an extremely low-probability gamble.

5 seconds.

'Sorry, Keira. I don't think I can keep my promise.'

She who had watched him leave the Ivory Tower right before her eyes yet hadn't activated the agreement oath.

Was it because she had seen Quan's sincerity?

Today, at least, he missed Keira's face in his memories a little.

4 seconds.

'Incredible.'

God's punishment was finally captured in Armin's Gwangan, which had a much larger field of vision than others.

A speed beyond description in his experience.

Though the distance was still far, it was a flash that made him feel as if it had already arrived before his eyes.

3 seconds.

"Damn...!"

Even with only 3 seconds remaining, God's punishment still remained at a tremendous height.

'Going any higher is impossible!'

The moment his thought ended, light flickered in the black sky, and immediately a massive flash pierced through Armin.

"Gasp!"

In an instant that seemed to split one second into a hundred, Armin clearly saw it.

The golden bird enveloping him.

'Photometry?'

God's punishment penetrated straight through the space-time bird and plummeted toward the ground.

2 seconds.

"Ms. Zulu?"

Flu turned to look at Zulu, who had arrived at Araboth's spire.

According to her mission, she should be searching for the Meta Gate in Jebul's underground.

'Why is she here?'

Zulu, having released Photometry, raised her hand toward the sky.

Erga, the first Tier 10 monster she had successfully tamed, began flying upward while gripping the Meta Gate.

"For a new beginning."

Flu's gaze followed Erga upward.

1 second.

The Meta Gate opened, and finally, from the distant sky, God's punishment revealed itself, shaking the atmosphere.

That was the last sight humans could capture with their eyes.

A long flash, drawing a line from sky to ground, was sucked into the black sphere of the Meta Gate.

Whoom.

And by twisting space-time, God's punishment struck down at the place where another sphere with the same coordinates existed—underground Zion in Jebul.

"I shall understand!"

Ankera's pupils moved at the speed of light.

Now that Satan had disappeared, this was the perfect time for a reset.

Reset.

The world went out.

Perfect nothingness that couldn't even be expressed by the concept of void.

In that state where neither time nor space existed, something suddenly amplified and the world opened.

As the concepts of birth and destruction meshed together, countless events occurred, but all probabilities had already been contained in that initial moment of amplification.

All things in the universe were once again repeating the events before the reset, drifting through billions of years of time.

Only one thing had changed.

23 seconds before Heaven's destruction, Ankera had immediately erased himself without summoning Sirone.

It was a true Ankera erasure.

Thus, the time of the universe would pass the point of Heaven's destruction at 0 seconds, when Ankera had performed the reset.

"Ugh!"

Uorin lowered her head as if her heart had received a shock.

"Your Majesty!"

When Gando jumped up, she raised her hand to stop him.

When powerful déjà vu rushed in, she received a shock like this, as if all the cells in her body stopped functioning.

'So this was the point.'

Uorin intuited.

'The point when the third reset began. Then currently, Ankera is in an erased state.'

Uorin, having regulated her breathing, stood up from her seat.

"Follow me. From now on, there's something you must do."

When Gando stepped outside the door, she was already standing in front of a room prepared at the end of the corridor.

When she knocked on the door, thirty Wind Generals who had been guarding the room saluted and hurriedly filed out.

Though invisible to the eye, her limbs, the Crouch, would also be hiding somewhere, watching for intruders.

"Only you and I will remain in this room."

The place Gando entered was a spacious room without even furniture.

A carpet with golden patterns on a red background was laid out, and Uorin sat cross-legged in its center.

"Listen carefully from now on, Gando. The reset has already begun. And from now on, I will..."

Uorin spoke with intense focus in her eyes.

"Find Ankera."
