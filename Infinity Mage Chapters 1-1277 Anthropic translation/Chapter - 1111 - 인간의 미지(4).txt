The Unknown of Humanity (4)

"Senior Researcher."

Seriel snapped to attention at the sound of the door opening.

"It's time to attend the Holy Assembly."

"Got it."

Extinguishing her cigarette and waving away the smoke with her hand, she put on her coat and organized her thoughts.

'Right. I'll have to meet them eventually anyway.'

As she stepped into the corridor, the World Health Organization delegation approached under the escort of knights.

"Let's go, Seriel."

"Yes."

The Holy Assembly's main conference hall resembled a small colosseum that could accommodate roughly 600 people.

With all attendees having taken their seats, the Holy Assembly's chairperson stepped onto the podium.

"We will now begin the 63rd Holy Assembly General Meeting."

Since these general meetings were held during major world events, the number 63 represented rings of history etched in time.

"Today's gathering is to select the world's leading nation. And the leading nation exists for the happiness and prosperity of all humanity..."

Even as the speech continued, the hands of each nation's think tanks never stopped moving.

Albino's mind raced rapidly.

'Each nation gets 5 minutes for opening remarks. By vote order, Tormia will go seventh.'

The speech was already prepared, but it would need real-time modifications based on other nations' addresses.

"With the opening of the Holy Assembly, each nation gains three authorities. Rom refers to one vote that can be given to another nation..."

Everyone already knew this content.

When it came time for each department's proposals, Dorothy, acting on behalf of Valkyrie's authority, stepped up.

"Good day. I am Dorothy, Valkyrie's General Commander. In this situation where the entire world is in a state of tension, the military department's proposal is..."

A man from Arachne raised his hand.

"Wait."

His name was Pedra, a figure who had started as a pimp in his youth and risen to Prime Minister.

"I only heard news that the General Commander resigned, but know nothing about the acting authority. Shouldn't you explain how you came to head the military department before making your proposal?"

Dorothy replied.

"She's my girlfriend."

"Girl... friend... No, what kind of—" Pedra, who had been seeking agreement with exaggerated gestures, realized everyone was quiet.

"What? Am I the only one who finds this strange? Huh?"

Still receiving no response, the same thought arose in each nation's leadership.

'It means the position is vacant anyway.'

The nation that became the leading power would inherit all of Valkyrie's authority.

"...Therefore, the military department's proposal is a comprehensive solution regarding peace agreements. We hope each nation's leadership will make the right decision."

Amid dry applause, Dorothy stepped down and Smith, head of the Economic and Social Department, came up.

Though from Zive, he was someone who didn't care about nationality if there was money to be made.

"I believe a leading nation should possess a vision for humanity's prosperity. Currency values of each nation have hit rock bottom due to the arms race. We urge decisive action from the World Bank and each nation's central banks, while proposing restraint measures against reckless war weapon development—"

"I object."

When Liz from the Neyd Group raised her hand, the chairperson intervened.

"Wouldn't it be better to raise objections after the proposal is finished?"

"No, I'm objecting to the proposal itself. I believe the expression 'reckless war weapons' could be interpreted negatively toward the industries of specific nations actually engaged in warfare."

Neyd Group's main business was military supplies.

Moreover, for the elemental bomb development card to gain strength, this point had to be addressed.

'Good timing.'

Rufist nodded.

'Once the meeting proceeds, the flow becomes fast and rough. It'll be too late to attack the proposal then.'

Smith countered.

"The core of this Holy Assembly is world peace. I don't think using strong language about restraining war weapons is strange—"

"Naturally, no nation would oppose peace. However, regarding fairness and the different circumstances of each nation, wouldn't it be better to avoid expressions that could give certain nations immunity depending on application? I request that such expressions be deleted or replaced with words that have clear interpretive standards."

Smith smacked his lips.

"I'll suspend the proposal momentarily."

The chairperson granted permission, and Economic and Social Department staff approached to huddle together.

After 5 minutes, Smith returned to the podium and made a correction.

"Accepting the suggestion, we'll replace the expression 'reckless' with 'threatening to human peace.'"

All weapons would threaten human peace, but that made it fair.

'This much should be fine...'

From now on, it was a matter of execution.

Pony spoke.

"You raised a good point. It would have been beneath the King's dignity to make such a suggestion."

The reason Liz's statement was effective was because she was a practitioner in the military industry that would be primarily affected by this proposal.

Rufist replied.

"Yes. The meaning would be distorted if it weren't from a businessperson. April Liz is the current head of Neyd Group. She has practical experience, and from what I can see, good instincts too."

It was meaningful that only Liz had stepped forward in a gathering of renowned economists.

'She doesn't watch the royal palace's reactions. That means she's reading Tormia's thoughts. She could handle an executive position.'

Just as Liz, who had waited until the proposal ended, was about to sit down, Pedra clapped.

"Hahaha! What a strong woman. Which company is it? You've got yourself a good secretary. Congratulations."

Liz shot back.

"I don't think this is a matter for laughter. And I'm not a secretary, but the CEO leading Neyd Group."

Pedra narrowed his eyes.

"Hmm? Neyd Group? So you're the next head who pushed out Mr. Neyd?"

"No, she's my girlfriend."

Of course, she was a co-founder of Neyd Military, but this response was good enough.

Pedra leaned back in his chair.

"Well I'll be, Tormia's really gone to hell. Girlfriend? What kind of personnel decisions are made this way?"

"Hehe, right?"

The aide who responded thought to himself.

'As if you're any better, you piece of trash.'

Regardless of position, as one woman, Pedra was the epitome of disgust.

"What's with that guy, is he a thug? Does he think this is some marketplace?"

When King Gis of Zive grumbled, think tank 'Smokescreen' reported.

"He's Arachne's power holder. A figure who rose to Prime Minister through nighttime politics."

"Nighttime politics?"

The man wiggled his pinky finger, then raised his thumb.

"Ah, that."

Gis's expression immediately became favorable.

"Now I see he's someone who does difficult work. Arrange a meeting."

"Yes."

Meanwhile, Pope Constantine, head of the Religious Department, stepped onto the podium.

"Let us pray."

"Oh my."

Gis hastily straightened up, bowed his head, clasped his hands together, and closed his eyes.

Prayer began.

"Oh Cria, all humanity is suffering. Save us from this cruel world..."

During this time, Sirone watched the backs of those bowing their heads.

'How many would there be?'

Those truly praying for humanity's happiness.

'If everyone considers others, ultimately no one would suffer harm. Theoretically possible, but...'

Would that really happen?

Uorin smiled bitterly.

'You must be troubled.'

Humans are not Gaians.

'Give up, Sirone. The world you dream of will never come. Because Eve crossed the forbidden line.'

"Your Majesty."

Gando whispered.

"I have something to say about the shadow warrior deployment matter."

"I said no. The idea of a human who looks exactly like me is unpleasant. Kido will be beside me anyway."

It was sad that the only being she trusted wasn't human but a goblin.

"But we must prepare for the case where Kido's defenses are breached."

"Hmm."

Uorin glanced at Havitz.

The sight of Satan peacefully sleeping while listening to the Pope's prayer...

"Punish the world's evil!" When the Pope raised his voice, Gis shed tears.

"Huuuk! Oh God."

Turning her gaze from Havitz, who was snoring, Uorin continued.

"It's fine as long as it's not Vanishing, right? There's no Ymir, no Lian either. There's no situation we can't prevent even knowing about it. It's not Kashan but other nations that should worry about royal assassination."

Her gaze turned toward where Sirone was.

"However, pay attention to Tormia's side. Handle all incoming intelligence carefully."

"Tormia... you mean?"

"Yes. They possess Quan."

The only swordsman who had ever severed Havitz's neck.

"If it's an undercover operation, that's the only one we need to watch besides Havitz. No, honestly, I doubt we could stop it."

"Then all the more reason for shadow warriors—"

"I said it's fine."

Uorin gazed upon Siena, who was listening to the prayer in a demure posture.

She looked beautiful and intelligent.

"He has a fatal weakness."

Yonglei's Albino, who had been pretending to pray, felt the gaze and turned his head.

When he met Uorin's eyes, he smiled awkwardly, but his inner thoughts were completely different.

'Why does she keep staring? So annoying.'

He couldn't not know the reason.

'Hehe, his neck must be tingling. From an assassination perspective, we'd be Kashan's natural enemy.'

Though they each possessed lethal swords in Havitz and Quan, Tormia's king could afford to die.

'Of course it's dangerous. If the assassination's mastermind is revealed, public opinion would worsen. But it's true that it's a card we could use once in an emergency.'

Therefore, in a mutual exchange, Kashan would suffer the fatal blow.

'But it's a difficult sword to handle. Well, the same would go for Havitz.'

Albino stroked his beard.

'Still haven't decided? How foolish.'

Parca Quan.

200 meters from Delta headquarters, guard units from all 12 nations were gathered together.

A line set by the Holy Assembly stretched long, with the rule that stepping even one foot beyond that line would be considered hostile intent toward enemy nations.

Rai was also on high alert regarding headquarters' situation when Zive's guard unit approached him.

"Are you Sir Rai, captain of Gangsin's guard unit?"

"That's correct, but?"

Despite knowing the Holy Assembly's intensity, the knights' eyes lit up.

"Ooh, then you're Augent Lian's older brother!"

Rai's face crumpled.

"Ah, sorry if that was rude. But he's the only swordsman who can face Ymir."

"Are you saying I needn't have an inferiority complex?"

"No, that's not what I meant..."

Though it might be true.

'Well, they wouldn't know.'

No one understood the position of an older brother whose youngest sibling was the world's strongest swordsman.

'Why... am I here?'

Because everyone more capable than himself had died?

"Captain."

Tes's voice brought him back to his senses.

'Protect the King. That's all I need to think about.'

At that moment, Rai's spine grew cold, and guard units from all 12 nations simultaneously turned their bodies.

"Who goes there!"

The friction sound of swords being drawn like one created a roar as a single sound wave.

"That's..."

A one-armed swordsman was approaching with a limp.
