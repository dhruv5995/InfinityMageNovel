New Humanity (4)

"I have returned."

Badbelb carefully set down the unconscious Borborr in front of Piri.

"Yahoo, meat."

The girl's eyes examining Borborr turned black as obsidian, then a small light flickered within them.

'Piri's eyes.'

Badbelb shuddered.

'Her gaze doesn't constitute an act of observation. Therefore, she's completely free from the laws.'

She could actually control quantum signals.

"Well then, shall we have a taste?"

Just as Piri was about to tear off Borborr's arm, the door to the inner chamber burst open with a bang.

"Lady Piri."

The grasshopper humans were crying.

"We are furious. Our comrades were brutally defeated by that woman. We are furious. Please, give us a chance for revenge."

Piri, looking back and forth between the grasshopper humans and Borborr, readily agreed.

"Fine, take her away."

No matter how outstanding a human might be, they were just food anyway.

"We are the new humanity. We're different from humans who commit fratricide just to eat more."

"Thank you! Thank you!"

As the grasshopper humans dragged Borborr away, Badbelb shrugged awkwardly.

"I thought you would like her."

"You must know how to share. Until now, humans have dominated by consuming everything on the planet. Now it's simply our turn to make humans into livestock."

That's all humans were to the new humanity.

"Kyaaaah!"

At the scream from outside, Badbelb approached the window to examine the castle walls.

"I'll bring you a better one."

When a gentle breeze swept through the inner chamber, not a trace of the grasshopper's body could be found.

"Krrr. Krrr."

Tanjura trembled as he watched Sirone, from whom smoke of light rose like a heat haze.

'Is this Yahweh's power?'

It was a single strike of Hand of God that annihilated over 300 grasshopper humans.

'The realm of seeing all phenomena as a single formation. It could be called the pinnacle of enlightenment, but...'

White Dragon Asriker said,

"There's no need to be so surprised. The Messiah is the one who will save humanity. It's natural that he's on a different level."

Tanjura fluttered his fan.

"Hmph, surprised? What do you mean? I was simply confirming the skills of the Five Great Stars with a magnanimous eye."

Uncomfortable with Asriker's excessive praise, he couldn't bring himself to look at her.

"Grasshoppers..."

As Sirone muttered with a serious expression, Earth Dragon Gaitan stepped forward.

"Is something troubling you?"

"In the East, swarms of grasshoppers are symbols of disaster. They destroy rice crops. Therefore, this mutant form isn't coincidental. It's a message being sent to humans."

"That interpretation is possible. But they don't seem particularly threatening."

"The problem is that the mutations were controlled."

That was the key point.

"Hexa can change the laws, but it can't control mutations. Humans are beings with hearts. The collision of their quantum signals would produce intermediate values."

They would mutate into countless forms according to their individual characteristics.

Asriker stepped forward.

"Are you saying the enemy we're facing can perfectly control human hearts? That's impossible. Because there's no way to simultaneously observe an electron's position and velocity."

Gaitan added,

"The heart is a quantum signal. When you throw a stone, its trajectory is already determined by the laws, but what kind of heart a human will have one second later exists only as probability. Even if you offer bread to a starving person, you can't guarantee 100% that they'll eat it."

Sirone was still lost in thought.

"What embodies that uncertainty of the heart is the quantum signal, and that's why humans define the world. If there were an existence that could deny this fact..."

Gaitan fell silent at the chilling conclusion.

'The outer world.'

The only dimension where electron position and velocity could be simultaneously observed was outside the universe.

'And that means...'

Even human hearts could be precisely measured from there.

"Messiah."

"I know."

Sirone finished his thoughts.

"Are we hearts or programs? Nothing will change. Hearts make mistakes, and programs have errors too."

Miracle Stream rippled and transformed into a massive Hand of God.

"What do you think, Mr. Tanjura?"

Tanjura stopped fanning and asked back.

"Hm? About what?"

"That mutant who felt the outer heaven. Do you think you could subdue that variant with Hand of God?"

After a long pause, the answer came.

"...It would probably be difficult."

Though the two apostles showed displeasure, Sirone nodded readily.

"I think I understand roughly. I'll give orders from now on. Mr. Tanjura, report to the Ivory Tower. And Earth Dragon and White Dragon, rescue Borborr."

"However, we cannot leave the Messiah..."

"You're the ones in for a difficult task. Borborr's mental fluidity is a weapon humanity desperately needs. We can't sacrifice her now. Use any means necessary and bring her back alive."

Just as the two apostles made reluctant expressions, a massive body crashed down from the sky with a thud.

Tanjura's body stiffened at the familiar grasshopper form.

"I am Badbelb."

"...We'll go ahead."

Asriker and Gaitan kicked off the ground, soared up, and disappeared toward the edge of the sky.

Badbelb, who had been tracking them with his eyes, turned his gaze back to Tanjura.

"You're that guy from before. Did you bring stronger humans? I really made the right choice letting you go."

Though his pride was thoroughly wounded, there was no time to consider emotions.

"Kugh!"

As Tanjura kicked off the ground and fled, Badbelb's vocal organs trembled.

"Kekeke! I knew it would be like this. But I don't like letting someone go twice."

Badbelb, who had disappeared without even a sensation, appeared like an afterimage behind Tanjura.

'I guess it's okay to kill this one and take him back.'

Just as the grasshopper's claws were about to tear into Tanjura's nape, he felt an enormous force from the side.

"Huh?"

When he came to his senses, he was wrapped in light, and in that state his consciousness vibrated.

Kwarrrrrrring!

Badbelb, who had flown through all the buildings in the northern district, rolled roughly on the ground.

After burying his head in the cold earth for quite a while, he turned his head and asked,

"What are you?"

Sirone was walking toward him.

"That's what I want to ask. What kind of being are you? Why are you in this world?"

He didn't want to talk about Piri.

"Are you the king of humans?"

Badbelb, with his limbs on the ground and his back straight, looked exactly like a grasshopper.

"Kekeke, if so, that's perfect. I can show our king the ultimate flavor."

Before he even finished speaking, Badbelb leaped and swung his claws toward Sirone.

Quantum movement activated.

"Kugh!"

All of Sirone's probabilities caught on the grasshopper's claws, creating hundreds of shock waves per second.

'As expected, this guy is...'

Before the force penetrating Miracle Stream's barrier, Sirone realized.

'Different.'

It felt like cutting out a specific part of one picture and pasting it onto a completely different picture.

'This isn't a being created from this world's cosmic constants. It's an absolutely different signal.'

When the universe was born in the beginning, the total amount of energy was more or less determined.

In other words, the mathematical limits of the universe, the limits of physical quantities, were set.

'If an outer world exists, our world would be blocked by barriers of rational numbers.'

For example, if the most powerful explosion in the universe and the limit of the fastest speed were set at a value of 99.

'No phenomenon could exceed 99. The moment it's exceeded, it becomes an error and the system would correct the world.'

But the Badbelb he was facing now seemed to cross back and forth over that limit.

The total amount might be similar, but there were certain aspects where he overwhelmed Sirone.

'Especially time detection ability.'

A temporal sense that even penetrated Gung-gam's quantum signals.

'This is dangerous.'

Feeling even more crisis from the fact that it was in its early developmental form, Sirone raised his power.

"Kiiiii!"

As Hand of God slammed down on the ground with a thud, Badbelb's body, shielding his face, compressed tightly.

'Incredible.'

Even if they were livestock, shouldn't he applaud such a level?

'No. We are the rulers.'

Badbelb, renewing the philosophy of the new humanity, moved his body even faster to attack.

Light flashed in all directions of the city, and tile houses evaporated with just the heat.

'Here.'

Badbelb broke through that barrier and thrust his fist toward Sirone.

A mushroom cloud rose.

In the clearing where several hundred meters radius had been cleanly swept away, Sirone exhaled heavily.

"Whooooo!"

Badbelb's shoulders trembled.

'He blocked it?'

A physically impossible phenomenon.

'Could it be the same as Lady Piri? No, that can't be. Livestock couldn't have such ability...'

Hand of God.

The technique of the hand.

If Badbelb was certain of something, Sirone could also deceive his heart.

"Where do you get off with such childish tricks!"

Just as Badbelb, having guessed the method, raised his opposite hand, the sound of cutting through air was heard from the distant sky.

A single sword emitting white light pierced straight into the grasshopper's side.

"Kyaaaah!"

Sirone's eyes widened.

'This is...?'

Sermon.

Gate.

Badbelb, screaming and pushed back dozens of meters, writhed trembling.

"It hurts! What is this!"

Shortly after, a man who had fallen from higher than the sky landed next to Sirone.

"It's me."

"You're working hard running around today too, Sirone."

Since they weren't on terms to shake hands and laugh together, Sirone asked warily,

"Why are you suddenly here?"

"That thing."

Nane pointed at the grasshopper human.

"I was watching from the moon and it didn't feel right. I also have something to discuss with you."

"Discuss?"

"The outer world. The situation has become much more complicated because of your stirring things up."

Sirone frowned.

"That's your perspective. If you had thought differently from the beginning, this wouldn't have happened."

"You lowly livestock!"

Badbelb screamed, trembling all over.

"How dare you harm me, who leads the future of the new humanity! I'll cut you to pieces! I'll chew you up bit by bit!"

The two men's conversation stopped.

"I withdraw my words about offering you alive to Lady Piri! Instead, I'll give you pain! Tremendous pain! The worst that a living being can feel...!"

"Shut up."

As both men turned their heads simultaneously, Badbelb's shouting stopped abruptly.

"First, let's deal with this and then talk."

"Right."

Sirone turned around first, and Nane slowly followed behind him.

'What, what is this?'

Badbelb unconsciously stepped back.

'Am I feeling fear toward mere livestock? No, that's impossible.'

Yet his legs wouldn't move.

'What the hell are those things?'

Yahweh's Hand of God covered the sky and Buddha's sermons poured down like a downpour.

"Kiyaaaaa!"

He was born to be king.

And at this moment, for the first time, Badbelb regretted choosing to live.

'No, no!'

Light exploded, and what shouldn't exist in this world returned to nothingness.
