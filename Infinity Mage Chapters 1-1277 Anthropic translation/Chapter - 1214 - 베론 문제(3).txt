The Veron Problem (3)

Although the procedures for Code One to be enacted were complex, there were less than 12 hours left until the vote.

Diplomats from each nation showed flexibility, and thus Albino met with Arachne's Prime Minister.

"My, my, we've brought quite a difficult person to meet."

Prime Minister Pedra wasn't a king, but as befitting Arachne's power broker, she put on airs.

"Tormia must be in a hurry too. What's the matter? If it's an urgent issue, we could move to another location."

Knowing that Arachne's specialty was honey traps, Albino shook his head.

"That's enough. Are you trying to kill an old man?"

"Hehe! Why are you so scared, old man? Just leave it to me. I'll take good care of you."

"I'm requesting Code One from Arachne."

Pedra's laughter disappeared.

'Has this old fool lost his mind?'

Code One to Arachne, which had formed an alliance with Zaib, the top candidate for world leadership?

Above all, how could negotiations be possible by meeting with a puppet king?

"Why complicate things? If there's something bothering you, tell me. And I hear... His Majesty Pony's health isn't good either."

"I won't hide it. His Majesty Pony won't be coming."

"Then?"

"Yahweh."

Pedra's eyebrows twitched.

"Yahweh will conduct negotiations representing Tormia. You know he's from Tormia, of course. Naturally, negotiations will be with your king, not you."

Pedra couldn't understand what the old fool was babbling about.

'Bringing in Yahweh? At a time like this?'

If there weren't only idiots in Tormia, they should already know the tide had turned against them.

'They should have done this before the Zaib scandal broke. The Pope will absolutely never approve Yahweh.'

Therefore...

'What kind of nonsense is this?'

It was the last desperate struggle of a third-rate nation that had lost its connection to Zaib.

"Haha."

Pedra said.

"Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed. In a situation where no offering would be enough, you're going to threaten me? Coming at me like that, do you think I'll say 'I understand' and approve Code One?"

"That's not my concern."

Albino didn't bat an eye.

"What I'm saying is that Yahweh wants to meet Arachne's king. Of course, this is just the beginning. If you think you can handle it, get up and leave now."

The world's strongest mage, humanity's representative, one of the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower, the era's philanthropist.

Yahweh was, after all, Yahweh.

'This is driving me crazy.'

Albino said this was just the beginning.

'What is he planning to do? Wage war against all nations? Even Yahweh would have a hard time winning.'

But also.

'...You can't say he'd lose either.'

When Pedra's conflict finally showed on her face, a gleam appeared in Albino's eyes.

'You'll have no choice.'

Being the weakest among Zaib's allied nations meant being extremely sensitive to changes in the tide.

'If I push with momentum, there's nothing you can do. There's a difference between someone truly strong and someone pretending to be strong.'

"Why aren't you meeting with me? You know all the kingdom's affairs go through my hands."

"Because you don't have voting rights."

"Listen carefully. You might think you've won everything, but each country is given only one right. Rom, Garto, Temica. On voting day, Arachne is just one of twelve nations."

Albino lowered his voice.

"And you're not the one voting. Whether puppet king or real puppet, the king personally enters the voting booth, signs, and puts it in the ballot box."

What choice the king would make at the last moment was a quantum issue, not a matter of law.

Pedra bit her lip.

'Until you open the lid, there's no 100 percent certainty?'

"Think carefully. If you're really confident, go ahead. But if you don't get the result you want, you know what will happen without me having to say it."

Pedra took out a cigarette and lit it.

Then she just held the smoke in her mouth while staring blankly at the floor beside her chair.

Albino smiled inwardly.

'Dante. You did well.'

Shirone was the ace of this game.

'Even if the turning political situation works unfavorably, even if it might lower the odds of winning.'

Dante knew.

'If Shirone extends his hand, there isn't a single nation in the holy war that wouldn't take that hand.'

It was the magic power called "the best."

'It's not simply because he's strong. The power that the concept of "the best" has lies in ignoring relativity.'

Therefore, the card everyone wanted to have was now in Tormia's hands...

'It's over.'

Albino laughed inwardly.

'Humans don't spend more than a minute on decisions. The unconscious has already decided. The time it takes is just the process of convincing oneself that the right choice was made.'

Pedra, who had kept her mouth shut until she finished an entire cigarette, quietly muttered a curse.

Then she chuckled and turned her head.

"I know it's a bluff. You're trying to drag me into this now. I'd be a real fool to fall for this."

Albino remained calm.

"Whew! Yes."

Pedra nodded.

"The stakes are too high. I know I'm being deceived, but I can't help but bet. I'm out. Instead, if your side takes the pot, you don't touch me."

"So be it."

After stubbing out his cigarette in the ashtray, he leaned forward.

"Let's proceed with Code One."

Fermi organized Omega 999 based on diplomatic documents collected by the ministers.

'Value judgments come later.'

First, if he arranged the events logically and fitted the framework together, the outline would emerge.

'The nation that becomes the world leader... Iron Kingdom.'

Fermi, who had been staring at the kingdom's name with cold eyes, moved his pen busily.

Time was running short.

'Where should I cut off the information? I didn't know corrupted files would be this fatal...'

Fermi, who finished his work with intense concentration, put it in an envelope and sealed it.

'Done for now.'

A amusing thought crossed his mind and he chuckled.

'How much would this document be worth?'

Information about the future, especially a file with all items about the world leadership organized.

'About half of this planet...'

He didn't need to know exactly how much.

"Haha."

It wasn't just an amusing thought.

"I've become the world's richest person."

He had vaguely thought it would happen someday, but when it became reality, he felt strange.

"Hmm."

He counted to ten with a gentle smile.

"That's enough now."

Just as Shirone became the Infinite Mage, Fermi had finally achieved his dream.

'Now there's only one thing left.'

And when that was finished, he would be able to feel satisfied for the first time since being born into this world.

"Your Highness, a World Health Organization official is outside requesting an audience."

It was Seriel.

"Tell them to come in."

After going through security screening, Seriel entered with a smile, but her eyes looked anxious.

"What brings you here at this hour? Did you miss me that much?"

"Fe, Fermi."

Her face gradually contorted, and tears streamed down one cheek.

"Run away!"

As if liberated from something, Seriel's face showed genuine emotion.

At the same time, a silhouette flickered beside her, and a snake-like woman revealed herself.

"Shh. It's unseemly for a lady to shout like that."

Sura, ranked 7th in the Ten Elders, embraced Seriel's neck while sending a cold gaze.

"I'm sorry, Fermi. I absolutely didn't want to bring her, but this woman manipulated my mind at will..."

"It's okay."

It was actually fortunate.

If a physical fighter had kidnapped Seriel, she would have fought even if it meant death.

Fermi looked at Sura.

"Shall I offer you some tea? Let's see, what tea should I drink? This isn't in the records."

"So you do know the future. Including the fact that I would come here with this woman."

"There's no need to bring up the future. I'm not the only one who went to the Apocalypse."

That was why Sura thought of Fermi when Basak asked for the world.

"I know you're gathering information. Hand it over obediently. If you don't, this woman dies."

Seriel shook her head.

"No, Fermi."

She couldn't understand their conversation, but it would definitely be bad for Fermi somehow.

"Going back to the beginning..."

Fermi walked to the dining table and poured tea.

"There are two types of tea in my room. Caffeinated and decaffeinated. What tea did the future me pour?"

"That's not important. What's really important is whether I would have poured the same tea even if I knew the future information."

Sura understood.

"Which country becomes the leader?"

"Iron."

Here's where the problem arises.

"Now then, why Iron? Option 1: Because that's the future. Option 2: Because you came and took the future information. Option 3: Because even you coming to take the future information was recorded in the future information."

"The answer is..."

Sura breathed out.

"Number 3, right? Otherwise, you couldn't have known the future of me coming."

"Right. Even if you know future information, obtaining that future information itself becomes the future. Therefore, you're wrong. The correct answer is..."

Fermi held up the documents.

"Option 4: Because I, knowing that even that becomes the future, handed these documents to you."

That was the most accurate explanation.

"Conversely, the moment I destroy these documents, the world leadership will change."

"Could you do that?"

"It doesn't matter. The only one who loses if I destroy these documents is Iron. Because other nations don't even know I have this information."

Sura's eyes widened as she tightened her grip on Seriel's neck.

"I'll really kill her."

Just as Fermi calmly opened his mouth, Seriel spoke.

"Kill me."

Now she understood everything.

'Future information.'

In a situation where just knowing that fact changes the future, he had been fighting alone.

'That's enough.'

Knowing his true feelings, she could smile.

"It's okay, Fermi. Do what you're trying to do. You mustn't give up because of me."

"Shut up. I'll really kill her."

Even as Sura strangled Seriel, Fermi showed no emotion.

'Seriel, Amy will die soon. I suggested it to Shirone. That she shouldn't live.'

Then what about Seriel?

"Kii!"

Just as Sura made a wickedly snake-like expression and was about to break Seriel's neck.

"Here."

Fermi held out the documents.

'Let's not run away.'

Even if the whole world condemned him.

"Cough! Cough!"

As Seriel, whose breathing passage had cleared, collapsed to the floor, Fermi threw the documents like a dart.

"Take it. It's future information."

Sura quickly caught it and tore open the envelope with her nails to check the contents.

"...Hmph."

She glared at both of them alternately, then evaporated like air.

"Are you okay?"

Just as Fermi bent down to check on Seriel's condition, his collar was immediately grabbed.

"You crazy bastard! What are you going to do now that you gave that away!"

"I'll prophesy. You're going to hit my right cheek. Ugh!"

Fermi stepped back after being hit in the stomach.

"You said it yourself, option 4. Not options 1, 2, or 3. You shouldn't have given that to Sura."

Because it was a future containing Fermi's will.

"Then you would die."

"That's trivial! You've missed the only chance to change the future! You should have just let me die!"

"Because I can't kill you..."

Fermi smiled bitterly while clutching his stomach.

"It's the future."

The option of killing Seriel wasn't anywhere in Fermi's heart.

"You... idiot."

Feeling both moved and afraid simultaneously, she buried her face in Fermi's chest.

"...What are you going to do now?"

"I got hit once, so I have to pay it back twelve-fold."

Seriel's head lifted.

"Do you have a way?"

Fermi winked at her and flicked a single chip into the air with his thumb.

"Depreciation transaction."
