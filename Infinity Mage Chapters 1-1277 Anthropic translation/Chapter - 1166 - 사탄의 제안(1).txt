Satan's Proposal (1)

The Air Press was far more powerful than the air gun Gaold had used before.

"Grraaahhh!"

Terrible pain—pain that even Gaold himself hadn't anticipated—struck him.

"Gaold! Snap out of it!"

When there was no response, Sein looked up at the sky with a pale expression.

Ultima's eyes were there.

'Damn it! Disappear quickly!'

As long as they defined Gaold in this dream, his real-world memories would remain intact.

Kang Nan muttered.

"It's gotten bigger."

No, to be precise, it had penetrated deeper.

Sein said.

"Gaold, stay calm. Accept this world slowly. Come back to Floor 1.5."

"Hrrgh..."

Whether Sein's words had any effect was uncertain, but Gaold's expression improved somewhat.

Accordingly, Ultima's eye in the sky also retreated beyond the world's veil.

Even after the pain disappeared, his inability to move for a while must have been mental shock.

'He wouldn't have known.'

No, he knew it in his head, but he realized it the moment the actual pain struck.

How powerless humans are.

The Merchant Union leader examined the shocking scene where even blood had evaporated and asked.

"What happened? Was it a bomb?"

In a world without magic, what they could imagine was limited.

"Something like that."

While Sein gave a vague answer, Gaold pressed his hands against the ground and stood up.

"Let's go."

His face, which had been fine just an hour ago, now looked withered with age.

Kang Nan said.

"Gaold, you can't anymore."

There was no answer.

"If you awaken your abilities, our world will collapse. No, you'll go insane before that happens."

Even Gaold himself couldn't guarantee whether he could step into that pain again.

"Will he be able to forget this time too?"

Ruber said.

"Humans repeat the same mistakes, but some stimuli are carved into the unconscious. No matter how strong one's consciousness is, they inevitably hesitate."

Mong-ah said.

"It's called a phobia."

"Just now, Gaold's breakthrough occurred when Ultima's eye had penetrated nearly halfway. If it goes over half, the initiative will pass to Ymir."

"Gaold getting stronger is also a problem. Tamo awakens too. If the compromise keeps breaking, Floor 1.5 will eventually collapse. What remains is total annihilation."

"There's nothing we can do. If I break the rules first, Ymir's unconscious will infiltrate Floor 1.5 by any means necessary."

"We'll have to trust the Five Great Stars."

Ruber remained silent.

When 〈Zhuangzi's Butterfly〉 was activated, Shirone had definitely received a signal from the outside world.

'The real Five Great Stars must have some idea about the outside world. About the divine perspective too.'

But knowing something intellectually and actually making contact were completely different concepts.

'He couldn't analyze the signal, but the shock from when the closed world broke would remain.'

Probably a vast emptiness.

'That feeling was reflected in Floor 1.5, causing him to lose his will—that seems like the right interpretation. On the other hand, deep inside, a spark trying to rise again must be sprouting.'

Shirone, drifting in the vast ocean of the open world, was waiting desperately.

'When some trigger is activated, that spark will revive frighteningly. The power to overcome the vast emptiness might...'

Might lie with Armand.

Ruber couldn't decide from a manager's standpoint which would be the better outcome.

Arriving at Tamo Organization's headquarters, Kang Nan pointed inside the iron gate and shouted.

"Over there!"

Arius was collapsed, bleeding, while Shirone and Miro were desperately trying to escape.

"Wh-what is that?"

The Merchant Union felt a chilling cold seeing Tamo's ability that shattered their imagination.

"Hey! Are you trying to get us killed like this?"

Bullets firing in all directions curved through the air, defying inertia.

Sein realized.

'He's awakened his abilities like Miro. Normal attacks won't work against someone like that.'

But since he didn't want to awaken Gaold, he charged toward the iron gate.

"Let's go! If we fight together, we can win!"

When the brave one took the lead, the Merchant Union also passed through the iron gate and unleashed a fierce assault.

"Right! It's just one person!"

The thought that they might be able to win ended as a delusion in just 3 seconds.

"Kahaha! What's going on?"

Several bullets hit Tamo, but he didn't even show a tense reaction.

When he openly fired a machine gun at the Merchant Union, four people collapsed instantly.

"Aaahhh! It's a monster!"

Those who ran showing their backs and hid behind walls no longer had the courage to show themselves.

Kang Nan shouted.

"Fight back! The attacks are working!"

"No, absolutely not."

When she turned her head, Tamo was standing in a cocky posture, spinning his machine gun.

"Even with good weapons all day long, war is fought by humans. Those who lose to fear are as good as dead."

As Kang Nan bit her lips, Miro and Shirone ran toward Sein.

"Dad!"

Sein, who embraced Miro, let out a sigh of relief and looked forward again.

"Stay back. We'll handle this."

"No! That bastard is incredibly strong. You need mine and big brother Shirone's help."

Miro's words were right, but if they continued fighting like this, Floor 1.5 would collapse.

"Listen to what Dad says."

Before Sein could explain, Tamo loaded his machine gun and kicked the ground.

"Shall we finish this!"

Though the group scattered in all directions to form an encirclement, Tamo felt no fear.

The battle continued for a while.

A bullet penetrated Sein's knee, and blood spurted from Kang Nan's right arm.

"Grrk!"

And after about 30 minutes, none of them were in any condition to stand properly.

"Hehe! Hehehehe!"

Tamo, bleeding all over his body, lifted his head while savoring the pleasure of victory.

"What? Is this all? Getting angry now? I'm not even having fun yet... Huh?"

The center of the moon opened, and something that looked like a human eye was blinking.

"What is that..."

Tremendous pressure crushed his body.

"Graaahhh!"

There was no pain, but the terror of his body being seriously damaged struck his mind.

Hearing Tamo's scream for the first time, Miro looked up with a dazed expression.

"Mister..."

Similarly, Gaold, who had been shot, was staggering as he walked.

"Finally works. How annoying."

Though his expression hadn't changed, the way his facial nerves twitched made him look like a demon.

"Dad, what happened to mister?"

"Miro, Gaold is..."

As Sein was explaining, Gaold struck Tamo's face with his fist.

Tamo, whose jaw was turned, rolled on the ground, then came to his senses and jumped up.

Fear dwelled in his eyes.

'What the hell is that?'

Not only the pressure from before, but even from that single blow, he felt an impact that struck his brain.

"Pain."

Proof of being alive.

"Kahaha! This is killing me! Hey! You again..."

Before he could finish speaking, a massive burst of air slammed his body into the ground.

Gaold screamed.

"Graaahhh!"

As consecutive Air Presses exploded and the ground shook, Miro stood up.

"Mister is... in pain?"

Sein's explanation was brief, but Gaold's appearance as he transformed into a monster was a story in itself.

"Graaahhh!"

Hair bleached from shock, white eyes with rolled-up pupils, blood spurting from his torn throat.

Tears welled up.

"Stop it."

She couldn't remember anything, but even her young heart wondered:

Why is that man doing such things?

"Stop it now. Even if you do such things, I won't change. Honestly, I..."

I don't dislike you.

"But mister, you scare me when you're like this."

Gaold, who had used all his strength to cast Air Press, received an equivalent backlash.

"Graaahhh!"

His limbs twisted on their own, and nothing came to mind except the thought of pain.

On the other hand, Tamo received the greatest stimulation of his life.

"Kahaha! More! More!"

His body, which stood up overcoming the powerful air pressure, trembled with convulsions.

Sein looked up at the sky.

"No."

Ultima's eyes had finally crossed the halfway point and were revealing their complete form.

"Grraahhh!"

As the compromise broke, memories of reality began flooding into everyone in Shirone's group.

'This will be total annihilation.'

With a do-or-die mentality, Sein turned his Wheel of Eyes toward the front.

As Tamo's movements slowed due to the power of the Sun and Moon Light Wheel, Kang Nan flew at him like a beast.

"Hyaaahhh!"

The moment she struck Tamo's side with her knee, tremendous recoil pushed her back.

"Grrk! He's gotten stronger!"

Heat waves shimmered from Tamo's body.

"Good, let's go to the end."

The moment he kicked the ground, his body disappeared and bullets poured down like rain from the air.

While Gaold, Sein, and Kang Nan coordinated their attack, Miro and Shirone couldn't move.

"What is this?"

Memories of reality flooded in, mixing 50-50 with dream memories in confusion.

"Mister."

Miro realized.

'So that's how it was. Mister really does...'

"Graaahhh!"

Gaold was feeding Air Press to Tamo in an almost unconscious state.

"Weak! Weak!"

With Floor 1.5's rules completely broken, Tamo's ability was overwhelming enough to dominate everyone.

"Blehhh!"

Finally unable to endure, Gaold collapsed coughing up blood, and Miro blocked his path.

"Come at me!"

She still didn't know what was real.

However, one fact that remained the same in both pictures was that she had to protect.

"Gaold."

The moment he heard a voice that had been fading in his memories, Gaold's head shot up.

A barrage of bullets was blocking his view.

"Grrk!"

Meanwhile, Shirone was also unable to get his bearings as memories of dreams and reality overlapped.

His ideal of protecting humanity mixed with the emptiness that even that was meaningless.

'I have to fight. Until the end.'

But the thought that nothing would change even so dragged Shirone's will into the abyss.

'I can't fight.'

His heart was completely empty.

There was a man...

Then, someone's voice that wasn't his own began echoing in his mind.

His body became hot as fire and his chest swelled as if his lungs were filling with water.

A story he didn't want to tell anyone.

"Graaahhh!"

Shirone stopped the bullets flying toward Miro with his mental technique.

But in the end... a story everyone would know.

Someone's dream, that sad and that grand, began unfolding in his mind.

"Ahhhh..."

Shirone's eyes rolled back as he collapsed forward.

"Miro!"

Gaold, revealing a demon's face, launched the strongest Air Press at Tamo.

"Kahaha!"

Tamo's body caught fire.

'It hurts.'

The process of his body breaking down was vivid.

'I'm alive.'

With his bones crushed and compressed to half size, he looked at Gaold and said.

"I am..."

And again, half his body sank into the ground and disappeared without even blood.

Kuuuuuuung!

The ground caved in deeply, and from within it, a tremendous pillar of fire shot up to the sky.

"Take cover!"

As Sein's Sun and Moon Light Wheel blocked the heat and impact, Gaold rolled while holding Miro.

Kang Nan cheered.

"We did it! We actually did it!"

"No, it's already too late."

In Sein's eyes as he looked up at the sky with a regretful expression, there were countless pupils.

"The world is collapsing."

If Floor 1.5 disappeared, everyone here would be swept away by Ymir's unconscious.

'It's over.'

As Sein closed his eyes, Miro looked down at Gaold's face and said.

"Mister."

The girl's lips touched his forehead.

"You can stop fighting now. I understand your heart well enough."

As shock filled Gaold's expression, Ultima's eyes began to retreat.

"Live with me here. When I grow up... I'll become mister's bride."

It was a perfect compromise.
