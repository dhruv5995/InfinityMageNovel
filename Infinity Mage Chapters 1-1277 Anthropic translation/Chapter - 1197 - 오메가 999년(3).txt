Omega Year 999 (3)

Gustav Sector.

Balkan realized as he looked at Zetaro's expression.

"You look like you're already dead."

Though Balkan, who had been shot, wasn't in perfect condition either, Zetaro's face looked like a corpse.

"What about Natasha?"

"I sent her after Uorin. What's the point of sitting around? Havitz has already slipped through our hands anyway."

"He just passed by me without a second glance."

That was just like Havitz.

"You're the gamemaker. Even if you can't kill Havitz directly, involving the Wizard is enough."

Just as Zetaro sighed and hung his head, Natasha entered the room.

She stuck her tongue out slightly.

"Got away."

"That woman's no ordinary person either. She won't be caught easily. But keep harassing her."

"Why? It doesn't matter what happens to the Holy War. We just need to kill Havitz."

"That's exactly the point."

Zetaro raised his head, and Balkan continued.

"Hide-and-seek is just a small game. Of course the Wizard is strong, but if you asked me to bet money on it, I wouldn't bet on either side. From a gambler's intuition, it's 50-50."

It was neck and neck.

"But there's no tie in gambling. You either split the pot or double down. But do you think anyone came here just to break even? The stakes are going to get bigger. The Holy War is going to be a complete mess because of Havitz. So we..." 

Just then, a secretary entered.

"Your Majesty, there's been contact from the Grand Conference Room. There's an emergency assembly of national representatives in 20 minutes."

"I see."

Balkan looked around at his friends.

"See? Other countries know too. That if things continue like this, everyone will be destroyed."

As Balkan stood up, Natasha supported him.

"You're going?"

"Of course I have to go. Everyone snap out of it. Nothing's over yet. When others get tired, that's a gambler's time. Natasha, you go to Uorin." 

His eyes flashed with madness.

"Use any means necessary to prevent her from attending the conference."

"Got it."

Natasha left the room, and Balkan, having changed clothes, placed his hand on Zetaro's shoulder.

"Don't tell me you're giving up already?"

"Balkan, I..."

"You're a gamemaker. And an excellent one at that. Do you know why?"

Zetaro looked up.

"Because your rules are always fair. You make it so there's no room for excuses even when you lose a game. That's exactly why Havitz liked your games."

"You're the one who created a game where even I, a gambler, can't predict the outcome. You understand? It's not the Wizard who entertains him - it's you."

Life returned to Zetaro's eyes.

'Havitz.'

Was it just a delusion?

Four neighborhood kids gathered together, looking up at a high wall and singing.

♪ Havitz? Havitz? ♪

Sunset.

Havitz glared at the Wizard.

"Grrrr..."

The Stars of the Ivory Tower caught the bewilderment mixed with the distortion on Havitz's face.

'What's going on?'

Leader Bartok was one of those who had observed the Wizard's training by the Ten Wizards Council.

'It's not strange for a human weapon raised by the Five Stars to learn to counter Niching, but Satan's reaction...'

He looked somewhat sad.

"Havitz."

The Wizard approached.

"I love you. Don't run away anymore."

"Hmph."

Unbelievable.

'She says she loves me? Not a chance. This is a lie. A trick to kill me.'

Yet the reason he couldn't resist was...

'What if it's true?'

The Wizard, catching that moment of rigidity, transcended one frame and struck Havitz hard.

"Gack!"

As Havitz rolled on the floor, the Stars of the Ivory Tower frowned and fell into thought.

'What? Just now...'

It felt like all of humanity had closed their eyes.

Armin understood.

'The pinnacle of space-time abilities. If Havitz doesn't have a specific time, that child erases space.'

They were two people who seemed similar but were completely different.

"Huff, huff."

Havitz, blood streaming from his nose and mouth, glared at the Wizard and asked.

"You say you love me?"

"Yes."

The corners of Havitz's mouth tore.

"Good."

As shadows of Sheol seemed to form, the next moment both of them vanished from the room.

"...Have they left?"

Even the Stars of the Ivory Tower couldn't interfere with what happened outside the laws.

"Yes, probably."

Armin pointed to the rattling door.

"Into the gaps of space-time."

Havitz isn't fast.

But movements that pass through 0.666 seconds of each second aren't recorded in the laws.

'Try to follow me.'

It wasn't a concept of fast or slow.

"Argh!"

At that moment, the Wizard transcended a single frame and struck Havitz's side hard.

"Are you going to keep running away?"

She wanted to break his neck, but strong hostility would destroy the rules.

"Hehehe."

Havitz laughed.

"Isn't that too harsh? Honestly, I'm starting to doubt it now. Whether you really love me."

What was she supposed to do?

"I love you. As long as I don't break your fingers, that's the truth."

That was the rule.

"Good, then..."

Havitz closed the distance through Sheol, embraced the Wizard, and fell to the floor.

The Wizard, whose killing intent surged, clenched her fist but couldn't bring herself to counterattack.

'I can't.'

If she attacked Havitz here, her words about loving him might become a lie.

'No, I didn't break his fingers, so it's fine. Havitz will believe it to the end.'

Would he really?

She wasn't confident.

If she couldn't predict properly, Satan, who she'd worked so hard to trap in the system, would escape again.

'How much does Havitz love me?'

She couldn't tell.

In the end, since they both didn't know each other, their odds were 50-50.

Havitz stood up.

"Good, so it's a 'fact' that you love me."

This should allow the Wizard to give him even stronger punishment, but he had no choice but to believe.

Havitz's face as he stepped back showed a somewhat hollow and unpleasant expression.

'What do I want to do with this child? Something inside me was definitely filled, but...'

He felt an even greater sense of emptiness.

"Come anytime."

As Havitz left those words and ran toward the end of the corridor, the Wizard bit her lips.

She struggled to hold back tears that threatened to burst and reviewed the situation.

'I couldn't counterattack.'

Thanks to that, she had gained trust, but the intensity would increase the longer their encounters continued.

Equivalent exchange of affection and violence.

'How long...'

Perhaps forever.

Because we can never know another's truth.

"What is truth?" Taesung said.

"Ssing, facts are truth. The fact that I've protected humanity all this time is the truth. You must trust me."

"Shut up."

Even as the armies of hell were devastating and climbing up the Ivory Tower, Ssing remained unshaken.

"The demons are coming up, Ssing. This is the last chance. If I die, intelligence dies too."

"No, it's the opposite. You're preventing humanity's intelligence from reaching broader places."

The barrier to the outside world.

"Don't be so narrow-minded. There are things that don't need to be proven. All of humanity has loved each other until now and borne fruit from it. Do you deny even that?"

"Yes."

Ssing squeezed out her soul and argued.

"Feeling that physical relationships are beautiful is also just a system created by the Administrator. No matter how much flesh is mixed, no matter how much bodily fluids are exchanged, the truth cannot be known."

"What's so important about that? We've lived without any problems for all this time."

"Now it's different. It's a matter that humanity's fate depends on. If you want to live, convince me. Prove it."

"There's mental magic. Humans can directly check others' minds."

"That's also a system. Drimo, the reverse world, everything is controlled by the Administrator. There's no way to directly confirm something called a heart. Therefore, logically, I'm the only being in this world with a heart."

"That's not very convincing."

"But you can't refute it either. That's the problem. If there's no contradiction, someone has to uphold it. At least in humanity's final moment, in Omega Year 999."

"How on earth are you telling me to prove it? There's no way to directly show a heart!"

"That's why I can't believe it. No one knows another's truth. It's better to trust myself than to trust the Administrator of the outside world. All of us humans should."

Even as she said this, doubt sprouted.

'Is this really right?'

Even she, who had humanity's strongest will, was on the verge of cracks in her heart.

She gritted her teeth.

'Don't waver. Trust myself. As long as hearts can't be shared, I am everything.'

"Share... hearts?"

Yorahan's expression became blank.

"Yes. It's called Small World Creation. You can connect with everything in the world. Hearts are integrated and a new realm opens."

"Even things like rocks?"

The Fire Tribe laughed cheerfully.

"We told you, you can harmonize with everything in the world. Grass, trees, wind, earth, birds and squirrels too. Of course, each bloodline has things they harmonize with better."

"What does earth feel like?"

"Um, how should I put it. An absolutely safe feeling? The feeling of being protected without any cost."

The Fire Tribe closed their eyes.

Watching them as the corners of their mouths gradually rose, Yorahan thought.

'Share hearts?'

The reason everyone can't be considerate is probably due to distrust and fear of each other.

'But these people are different. Because they're connected to each other, they don't have any misunderstandings or suspicions.'

Suddenly this thought occurred to him.

'If human hearts are hell...'

The Fire Tribe might be the only hope to pull humans out of the pit of hell.

"Oh my, why are you making that expression? Yorahan-nim seems like such an odd person."

"It's incredible."

"Pardon?"

"It might be difficult right now, but someday there will come a day when all humans will welcome you."

The Fire Tribe member's cheeks reddened.

"Really... do you think so?"

"Of course! I guarantee it. Oh, and could I try Small World Creation too?"

"Of course. Just a moment."

At that moment, Armand interrupted.

"Stop."

"Why, what's wrong?"

Though they'd become casual with words after spending three days together, dealing with her was still difficult.

"I definitely warned you. That I wouldn't let it slide if you pulled any stunts."

"It's not even dangerous."

"It depends on who's doing it. If you harbor evil thoughts, this child will get hurt."

"I don't have evil thoughts."

"That's unknown."

"That's why we should experiment and see."

When she stubbornly shut her mouth, Yorahan sighed and stood up.

"Fine, I'll give up."

Armand turned to follow him.

"Where are you going?"

"To my room. I want to write down what I thought about today."

"Not now. We have to go to the mountain."

"Huh? Me?"

"We're out of food. Since I can't watch you if I go hunting, naturally you have to come along."

"No, there's no such rule..."

At that moment, a sharp wind sound was heard.

"Aah! What's that?"

Yorahan crouched down, and a longsword flew into Armand's hand.

"How, how did you do that?"

She said as she fastened the longsword to her waist.

"Telekinesis."
