[713] What Do You Gain? (2)

"Rank...!"

Someone shouted.

"It's a Ranker!"

The moment they saw the number 97 written on the woman's forehead, everyone in the vicinity threw themselves to the ground.

"Noble one!"

The pursuers who had been chasing them also seemed to have noticed, trembling as they pressed their limbs to the ground from a distance.

Sirone estimated the city's population to be 427,620, and the girl before him was the ninety-seventh most superior among them.

"What's wrong, Panika?"

Code Name 97, Panika.

A girl of similar age who belatedly emerged from the shop approached Panika and looked around with a surprised expression.

"Oh my, why are there so many people here?"

Her forehead bore the number 113, lower than Panika's, and based on this fact, Sirone speculated.

'Does some humanity remain?'

Of course, if Panika intended to harm number 113, whatever she did would not be considered a crime.

"I don't know either. This man suddenly..."

Panika, who had been pointing at Sirone, stopped speaking when she noticed there were no numbers written on his forehead.

"Huh? A Numberless?"

The situation required explanation, but those prostrated around them only kept their mouths shut, even holding their breath.

'If you get caught by a Ranker, it's over.'

While Panika wasn't known for killing people for entertainment, who could say for certain?

Perhaps her hair was frizzy today, or her food didn't taste good, or maybe she was just in a bad mood for no reason.

"You."

When Panika pointed at someone randomly, the designated man startled and jerked his head up.

"Yes! Yes! Number 97!"

His complexion, bearing the number 324,801, darkened like someone afflicted with a terminal illness.

"Explain what happened."

"I shall obey your command!"

Having organized his thoughts during the time it took to rise, he swallowed nervously and spilled everything he knew.

"Hmm, so a Numberless entered the city, and that person is..."

Panika finally addressed Sirone.

"You, right?"

"You could have just asked me from the beginning."

Since he had encountered a high number anyway, Sirone also intended to gather information here.

"Oh? Your speech is different. Did you come from another city?"

Occasionally, strangers from other cities would become Numberless and flow into Code Name.

Though the worlds were different, the thinking was the same, so Sirone summoned the Artificial Brain Wai (Language Translation Version).

'Will this work?'

When Sirone gestured for her to hold it with both hands, Panika grasped the Wai without any sign of fear.

'Incredible confidence.'

It seemed she feared nothing except codes.

"That's right. This is my first time in this city. So I want to know. What's the reason for the numbers written on people's foreheads?"

As the Wai vibrated and infiltrated the language, an intrigued emotion filled Panika's eyes.

"Ooh, an unusual authority."

It was an ability used by the residents of Code Name.

"Panika, let's just kill him. A human who refuses numbers - just looking at him is filthy."

Number 113 glared at Sirone venomously as she spoke, but Panika didn't even consider it.

"No. If he came from another city, it would be better for him to receive a Code Name. It's better than dying as a Numberless."

"Let's do that. That would be better."

From number 113's instant change of opinion, Sirone realized that codes were still supreme.

"How about it? If you want to receive a code, I'll guide you."

'It's certainly simple and easy.'

If he could somehow be assigned a high code, he would be able to obtain all the information needed in this world.

"Alright, guide me."

When Sirone agreed, Panika looked around and spoke.

"Everyone, withdraw."

As if a natural disaster had occurred, people jumped up and began running frantically.

Unless numbers 1 through 96 appeared and gave special instructions, her commands would remain valid.

"Follow me. Let's go to the temple."

Under the pastel-colored sky stood a temple.

Labyrinth Andre
World No. 1583

The place where Sirone arrived was a village called White Black, inhabited by approximately 2,000 residents.

This place had a special rule: from age fourteen onwards, one had to choose between the White or Black districts.

"Do I have to decide as well?"

"Of course. You're over fourteen, after all."

The White district where everything was decided by vote, and the Black district, a lawless zone where even murder was permitted.

The surprising fact was that, unlike other worlds, most residents chose White.

'Well, who would want to live in Black?'

Sirone also chose White, and the next day, White's village chief came to his house.

"There's an agreement between White and Black. Each district selects 10 representatives to take a survival test."

"Why do such a thing?"

"Because no one in Black works. The winning district takes 80 percent of the village's production."

"That's too cruel."

"Black proposed it. Without such an agreement, Black would plunder White residents."

Though few residents chose Black, they were correspondingly brutal and were objects of terror for White.

"And you've been selected as one of White's representatives. You'll depart for Mount Anarchy at midnight tonight."

Sirone was dumbfounded.

"But I only just learned about the rules..."

"It was decided by vote."

The moment White denied the results of a vote, the distinction from Black would disappear.

"This is how we live. You can appeal, but nothing will change. White has 1,600 residents."

"What happens if I refuse?"

"You'll be exiled to Black. But they'll also select 10 people, and there's a high probability you'll be chosen by the logic of force."

'Whether chosen by vote or chosen after getting beaten up, it seems the same. Should I investigate the Black side instead?'

Though Sirone was confident he could win regardless of which district he chose, he postponed judgment for now.

'Still, I should participate.'

If this world was also something Guffin had isolated by special criteria, understanding his intention was the shortcut to breaking the seal.

"What are the odds?"

"The survival game has been held 843 times historically, with White having a 51 percent advantage."

"51 percent? That's higher than expected."

This was an achievement made by fighting against Black district people who committed murder as casually as eating.

"It's the difference in desperation. Black has a small population and follows survival of the fittest, so 20 percent of production is enough for them. But if White doesn't get 80 percent, families will starve all year long."

There was such a problem.

"Black is just jealous. They give despair to peaceful White this way. Sometimes truly strong ones emerge, but the opposite also happens. We must win."

After seeing off the village chief, Sirone was lost in thought alone.

'Because Black exists, White can be peaceful, and without White, Black cannot exist.'

Like good and evil defining each other while defining themselves.

'Does it mean the same thing regardless of which one you choose?'

Time flowed swiftly like an arrow, and as midnight approached, Sirone appeared at the meeting place.

"Phew, you came."

Hearing the sighs of residents who had been anxiously worried he might have fled, Sirone entered the plaza.

'Including me, five men. The fact that the gender ratio is half and half - is that the result of voting?'

The nine representatives standing in a row were each looking at Sirone with different emotions.

Hearing the roar of volcanic eruptions, Sirone flew rapidly over the dense forests of the primitive planet.

The sulfur smell was so strong it made him nauseous, but the world was so vast he couldn't spare a moment to rest.

'Humans.'

Except for using weapons and covering their genitals, they looked believable as monkeys.

"Uga uga! Uga uga!"

They were hunting with sharpened wood, but when the beast counterattacked, they screamed and scattered.

'They're still weak.'

Seven men regathered where the beast had disappeared.

"Grrraaar! Grrraaar!"

They stamped the ground like children, and finally began shedding tears pitifully.

Sirone opened the Ultima System.

"We have to starve again today! I'm hungry! I want to eat meat!"

A man who bared his teeth like a monkey struck his companion's chest hard and shouted.

"Why did you run away! You were supposed to stab it!"

"When did I say that!"

A fight eventually broke out, and unlike their helplessness against the beast, terrifying punches were exchanged.

"Kraaaaa!"

Trees snapped with crackling sounds, and as a giant dragon's body descended, the ground shook up and down with a thud.

"A dragon! Dragon! It's a dragon!"

The humans who stopped fighting drooled and wet themselves, then prostrated flat on the ground and shouted.

"Please spare us! Please spare us!"

To the humans of this world, dragons were gods.

"Insignificant things..."

Just as the dragon opened its mouth wide for a meal, a photon cannon struck its face.

"Grrrring!"

At the physical impact that could only be encountered in battles between dragons, the dragon hastily changed direction.

"Hu...man?"

After confirming Sirone, bluish electricity flowed in the dragon's eyes and its mouth shut tight.

"..."

With a flapping sound as it beat its massive wings, the dragon's body rose several meters.

"So you're the being said to have come from another world."

"How do you know about me?"

Dragons' minds were integrated through a binary network, and the experiences of specific individuals were stored intact on the web.

"Our king will summon you."

After leaving those words, the dragon disappeared into the sky, and the trembling humans raised their heads in disbelief.

"U-ugaaaaa! Uga uga!"

The cheers that clearly conveyed the joy of survival needed no analysis by the Ultima System.

The humans who gathered around Sirone danced and spun in circles, then each pressed their noses close to smell him.

"Wait... I am..."

As he recalled how to use the Artificial Brain Wai, one man touched Sirone's lower body.

"What are you doing?"

After confirming he was male, they looked at each other and giggled, then pointed somewhere and dragged Sirone along.

"You saved us. We'll let you do something good."

"Something good? What's good?"

The humans, who understood Sirone's words perfectly without any special ability, swayed their hips back and forth.

"No, wait! I don't need that kind of thing."

Though Sirone waved his hands, they dragged him along stubbornly, and soon arrived at a cave not far away.

"Here! Here! We caught one!"

"Keeee! Kyaaaak!"

Sirone's eyes widened in surprise as he interpreted the screaming of an angry woman through Ultima.

"Let me go! You stupid monkeys!"

If she called the humans of this world monkeys, it meant she came from another world or was a special prophet.

'Who is it?'

Inside the cave, a carefully guarded bonfire was burning, and in the corner was a woman bound with wooden vines.

She was as shaggy as other humans, and no dignity could be found even in her struggling.

'Was I mistaken?'

The disappointment was brief, as Sirone realized something from the woman's eyes and felt his heart stop.

"Kyaaaak! Keek! Kya...!"

The woman also seemed shocked upon seeing Sirone, stopping her screaming and barely squeezing out words.

"Si...ro...ne..."

Though her appearance was completely different, the energy felt from her eyes was definitely Uorin's.

'No, it's not Uorin.'

It was the first Theraje, Mitochondrial Eve.
