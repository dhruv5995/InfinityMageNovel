The City of Magical Engineering (3)

Magritte doubted his own eyes and checked the scan information once more.

'Is this truly human?' If the liquid from the scanning device were transferred to the real world, it would be closer to a 'feeling' than matter.

What they called spiritual wheat - reading records carved into the soul, which was also hidden code used in karma chains.

'Physical growth index: 22 years by photonic standards.'

Since it captured the very process of his life, Rian's age couldn't be wrong.

But...

'Physical capability index is 16,000 years?'

In conclusion, Rian had approximately 730 times the training intensity compared to his age.

'It's not a physical number. A biological body doesn't work that way. But 730 times the training intensity far exceeds human limits.'

It wasn't about disrespecting humans - no biological entity should be able to do this.

'If it were simply enduring great pain, one could helplessly suffer through it... but training intensity is different.'

'It requires the will to break limits. If training to the point where you can't take another step is intensity level 1, then this body means he walked 730 more steps from there.'

Terrifying willpower or conviction.

'Of course, humans are a species with high physical capability index. Demons are just strong from birth. But 730 times is a realm that no yaksha I know could imitate.'

Sirone and Rian approached.

"Did you find something?"

Magritte swallowed his saliva and turned his head toward Rian, taking in his actual appearance.

"Rian, you say..."

Imagining the path he must have walked sent shivers through him as intense impulses swept over him.

"The pinnacle of biology - no, a new physical model that transcends even biological limits. How much time would humanity need to evolve into this body? No, it's absolutely impossible. The more civilization develops, the lazier creatures become. Therefore, this isn't evolution but rather reverse evolution."

Magritte pointed at Rian.

"Moreover, the scope of that reverse evolution spans cosmic history. It's not simply returning to the origin, but the extreme of minus evolution that defies even biology's original model! In other words, it's like the change of a diamond - reborn as a different substance after enduring heat and pressure for eons - occurring in a biological body!"

Sirone, who had been listening blankly, spoke up.

"Um, I appreciate you praising my friend, but couldn't you think such things to yourself?"

Mercedes raised her index finger to explain. "His Grace is the smartest demon in hell. But he's a taciturn person, so other demons can't read his great thoughts. It's so frustrating that when His Grace is truly impressed, he can't help but speak - it's become a habit. This is absolutely not common. You should consider it an honor."

"Really? He's changed a lot."

They say when you age, you become like a child.

"Ahem, that was unseemly of me. My apologies. But this one's body is that exceptional. Of course, that alone can't break Gehenna's chains. Probably the unique spirit that created that body..."

"Well, I'll investigate that from now on. Let me also check Yahweh's scan information. This feels strange. To think I'd be analyzing Yahweh's mind... Huh!"

When he pressed the button, the red liquid's negative image disappeared and this time Sirone's information appeared.

"Th-this can't be!"

Ariane Sirone.

Physical growth index was an unmistakable 22 years.

And physical capability index was 32 years - the level of an ordinary person who trained their fitness diligently.

What surprised Magritte was the next category.

'Mental capability index.'

520 million years.

'Numbers are the result values of realms. You can't reach it just by contemplating for 520 million years.'

Even Magritte himself, who had lived over 500 million years, fell far short in mental capability index.

'Depending on enlightenment, it's possible to reach it in an instant. But what exactly is a 520-million-year mind? I've never even thought that such a realm of thought could exist.'

It should be like the ocean or the sun.

'The boundary between living and non-living things? No, perhaps a new system that encompasses both. Is this Yahweh?'

Magritte whirled around to look at Sirone.

"The extreme of self-destruction. The place reached after destroying all logic is the sole contact point between nothingness and existence. How many thesis-antithesis-synthesis cycles would be needed to make such a mind possible!"

In other words, he himself is the supreme ultimate.

"This is truly divine nature, divine attitude, divine perspective! Neither right nor wrong, only the 'undefined entity' of that moment exists! A mental vacuum state, as it were! Ah! Why doesn't he indulge in the whim of erasing the world with that mighty thought! Of course not. God is indifferent! Then why does he help humanity? Only one reason - a miracle. A miraculous delusion triggered in the vacuum! That is Yahweh's true essence!"

After Magritte finished his explanation with pointing, silence flowed through the laboratory for a while.

"Yeah, well... seems about right. Anyway, what are you going to do now? About Gehenna's chains, I mean."

Magritte, his excitement subsided, collapsed into his chair as if exhausted.

"Phew. First, fixing the purification system's error will take time. It doesn't seem to be in the realm of 'malfunction.' It appears to be a phenomenon caused by the special properties of Rian and Yahweh interacting with hell's system."

"But Sirone didn't do anything?"

"Hidden code operates before causality. It's not logic. For example, Yahweh's existence probably had a major influence on you breaking Gehenna's chains."

Rian kept his mouth shut.

"But if errors keep occurring, it's inconvenient for the parties involved and causes bad damage to hell's system. What we can do as a stopgap measure right now is control Rian's Gehenna. That is, make it independent from hell's system."

"Is that possible?"

"I don't know, it's unprecedented. But theoretically, I have several hypotheses. The problem is karma. We'll need to create a new program that can bypass spiritual wheat signals. For that, we'll need Yahweh's help."

"You want help from me?"

"What we're going to do from now on goes against hell's regulations. Satan might find it interesting, but the Ministry of Fire will definitely have a different position. If they find out you helped Yahweh, you'll not only lose your title but be purified."

When Sirone looked at him with worried eyes, Magritte dispelled the misunderstanding.

"I don't mind extinction. I've lived long enough. But if rumors spread, it becomes difficult to work. I really hate being disturbed while researching. I'll write you a list, so ask for these at the shops. I can't even have my subordinates do this."

If information leaked, it would be the end.

"If we can avoid suspicion, that is. But if Yahweh goes around obtaining this and that, won't disputes arise?"

"Of course we have to do it secretly. Yahweh's distinctive smell - should I call it code? We'll erase that. No one will notice your identity, so you can act comfortably. First..."

At Magritte's appearance as he continued his rapid explanation, Mercedes bit her lip.

'This is serious. His Grace is truly hooked.'

From what she knew, when Magritte set his mind to something, even Satan couldn't stop him.

'The Ministry of Fire won't stay still. If by any chance this reaches Lord Lethe's ears, His Grace will...' The succubus's fists clenched tightly.

'I'll definitely protect him. I'll thoroughly control things so it absolutely doesn't reach anyone's ears.'

Rian's laughter was heard.

"Looking good, Sirone? Anyone can see you're unmistakably a demon, right? Too good to keep to yourself."

Sirone stood in front of the mirror.

"What... is this?"

His height had decreased by about a head, with red skin and black hair, small horns sprouting from both sides of his forehead.

'There are fangs too.'

When he opened his mouth, sharp fangs like thorns were arranged to fit perfectly in his dental alignment.

Magritte said, "I changed everything except the facial features. Functionally speaking, it's not particularly strong-looking in hell. It's better not to stand out for getting work done."

Rian said, "It's not just that - he looks completely weak. Among the demons I've fought, none had such a gentle face."

"His face is actually gentle, so it can't be helped. If you want, I can change you into a completely different form. Three meters tall with about eight arms is also possible..."

"...No, this is fine."

He wanted to maintain at least his identity.

"I think so too. You don't need to feel repulsed - this is closer to disguise than transformation. The key is hiding Yahweh's code. Try to act like a demon as much as possible. The suppression rate is 7 percent. If you become more than 93 percent close to Yahweh, the disguise might disappear."

"Seven percent."

It required about amateur actor-level method acting, but it was definitely awkward.

"Here's the list." Receiving the note from Magritte, Sirone looked at the necessary items and roughly intuited.

'Hmm, this kind of method...'

Sirone, who had grasped the guidelines based on Omega's information, put the note in his pocket.

"Well, I'll be back."

Looking at the red demon wearing loose clothes, Rian somehow felt peaceful.

"Be careful. Even if someone picks a fight, don't talk back."

"Haha, it's fine. You think I'd get beaten up somewhere? I'll get everything and come back quickly."

Sirone, dragging his pants as he walked toward the door, looked back at Magritte and said, "You haven't forgotten our deal, right?"

However they solved Rian's problem, it would have to be in a form that could break the chains of true voice.

Magritte tapped his head.

"Understood."

Meanwhile, an unexpected visitor was flying toward the walls of Labyrinth City.

"Aaahhhhh!"

The figure approaching with screams trailing behind was emitting long streams of jet clouds.

Just as Richera, with only her head remaining, was rolling her eyes back in fading consciousness, the inertia disappeared.

"Oops."

Son Yujung looked around the castle wall.

"Hey, this is the right place, right? No matter how I look around, this is the only city in the area."

"Huh? Oh, yes."

Richera, having mostly regained consciousness, got goosebumps seeing the human face embedded in the castle wall.

"Eek! It really is Labyrinth!"

It was her first time actually seeing it, but she'd heard that most humans caught by dark priests were used here.

"Stop. Who are you?"

The two demons who had blocked Sirone two days ago pointed their spears at Son Yujung.

"I heard there's some archduke or whatever in this city - go quickly and call him. Or I'll go myself."

The demons looked at each other.

As Labyrinth's gatekeepers, they had excellent patience, but Son Yujung's words clearly crossed the line.

"Kekeke! Kekekeke!"

Murderous intent spread like fire, and the two demons, having lost their reason, charged with their spears.

"Huooooo!"

Even seeing the faces of ghosts burning with murderous intent, Son Yujung calmly drew out his staff.

"Arrogant monsters."

KWAAAAANG!

At the earth-shaking roar, the demons living in the city turned their bodies with surprised expressions.

"Quickly! Hurry!"

Shortly after, armed security forces ran in double file toward the gates.

"Huh? What's that?"

A cute-looking demon in a hooded cloak blinked and asked a nearby demon.

"What's happening? Where is everyone going?" A demon with hair as hard as blades looked down and nodded.

"You're too young to know. Those are His Grace's security forces who only deploy in emergencies. They say the gates have been breached, but it's probably just some devil-kin."

"Hmm."

Sirone looked toward the end of the city.
