**Age of Chaos (1)**

Abella gritted her teeth, but couldn't help but moan from the pain transmitted from her heart.

"Hnnngh..."

Everyone watching her, even Gustav's 4th Knights who prided themselves on understanding Havitz...

"Why? How could this be?"

They couldn't understand the current situation.

"Your Majesty."

They hadn't experienced Satan's 0.666 seconds, but even if they had realized it, nothing would have changed.

"Huha, huhaha."

Havitz's eyes were bloodshot red as he hid behind Abella's body, using it as a shield.

"Huha, huhaha."

His breathing was so rough that his nostrils flared and stuck together, and his blood-filled eyes were full of sorrow.

"Dar...ling..."

With a cracking sound,법살 shattered at the same time Abella's eyes rolled back.

"It's broken."

Balkan, who had been staring blankly at Abella collapsed on the ground, slowly raised his gaze.

'Havitz, you broke 〈법살〉.'

Havitz, still breathing roughly, was only mourning the death of the woman he loved.

As the door of Ex Machina opened, the thick smell of blood rose from the steam.

"Quickly! Move him quickly!"

The medical team waiting outside loaded the unconscious Iruki onto a stretcher.

Agaya looked back at Ex Machina.

"Phew, can't use it anymore."

The computational devices had melted from heat when Iruki forcibly twisted the laws.

'But we've obtained an even more powerful brain.'

Watching Iruki being carried away on the stretcher, Agaya prayed silently.

'If only he can wake up.'

Once the commotion settled, Gudio, who had been chain-smoking, stomped hard on the ground.

"Damn it!"

"What happened? Didn't it succeed?"

Kashan's special forces commander asked, but the card players kept their mouths firmly shut.

After a long while, Ness spoke.

"〈법살〉 couldn't make a prediction."

This was the only fact they could deduce from the current result.

"He killed the woman he loved."

If Havitz had simply used Abella as a shield because he didn't want to die, 법살 would have twisted even that law and pierced Havitz's heart.

"He didn't kill her to survive."

Meis spoke in a trembling voice, still seeming unable to believe it.

"He killed her for fun."

Simply because he thought this would be more entertaining.

"Could there be anything closer to chaos than betraying the woman you love most in the world at a life-or-death moment?"

Silence fell again.

"Th-then what happens now?"

No one answered the special forces commander's question, but the same thought arose in everyone's mind.

'Gaold broke Buddha. But the age of humanity is sinking into brief history.'

It was truly the age of chaos.

"Hnnngh..."

Havitz was crying.

"Abella, Abella."

Because she was a woman he truly loved, at the moment of final choice, he wondered for the first time in his life.

'Who exactly am I?'

Dying in Abella's place wouldn't have been difficult.

'But why did I have to do this?'

Patricide is common in the world, but the foundation of that act is hatred.

'Because I truly loved her.'

Abandoning someone you loved with all your heart without a moment's hesitation was something no one could do.

'Something no one can do.'

When doing such a thing, what emotion would I receive, what exactly would that feeling be?

"Keke. Kekekeke."

He was going crazy with curiosity about it.

"Kahahaha! Yes, that's right! This is it! This feeling! This pleasure that no drug can provide!"

The reason for not accepting Satan's proposal was only one.

"This is really fun!"

Because he was already Satan.

'He's awakening.'

Balkan realized this seeing the purple haze rising from Havitz's body.

"UOOOOOOO!"

Havitz's eyes widened as a massive Satan figure shot up through the sky.

If there's a concept that can resolutely kill someone you love, it's only chaos.

And humans call that ultimate evil.

"What's that?"

Gai, who had been crouching in an almost sitting position, hurriedly looked back toward the inner castle.

Sirone and Minerva were also looking at the same thing.

"My god..."

A form of ultimate evil made purely of demonic energy was looking down as if to devour Bashken.

Even the mad Gai realized the current situation was serious and sheathed his sword.

"If we meet again on the battlefield, I'll kill you without mercy then."

Sirone didn't answer, and as if he had no intention of listening, Gai passed through the castle gate and ran toward Havitz.

"What will you do?"

Minerva asked.

"We failed."

Just the appearance of Satan, the emperor outside the law, was enough to know that 〈법살〉 had been broken.

"It's my responsibility."

From now on, the world would be stained with great evil that neither universal love nor ultimate good could handle.

"No, it's all our responsibility."

"They said half-hearted good incites evil."

The counterattack of good that could only be executed because Buddha was absent.

'Should we not have provoked them?'

The situation Mahoro Amanta had worried about was the strongest ultimate evil that would emerge after crushing good.

'It's really difficult. How exactly can this world...'

How can everyone be happy?

"Sirone, let's go back. We need to make plans."

The domain of good that they had managed to expand a little through a year of effort would rapidly shrink.

"What about attacking Havitz now?"

The thought that they had failed kept occurring to him.

"Don't think hastily. Even the holy war was barely manageable. If you try something, they'll respond with something too."

If only I were human and everyone else were just dolls, the world would turn as I wished, but...

"This isn't a world you can change alone. Ultimate evil can't be destroyed unless the power of good is concentrated as one."

Thus the world goes into suffering.

"As of today, the Republic of Cotria will disappear. But there are still dozens of countries left to protect."

Sirone bit his lip until it bled and flew up to the sky following Minerva.

"Human desire. Truly endless."

Havitz's avatar, who had become ultimate evil while still having a physical body, declared from the end of the sky.

"From now on, you are Satan of this age. Lead my army of hell. The 72 legions will follow you."

At the voice that shook the entire Kingdom of Cotria, some felt ecstasy, others despair.

As the purple haze seeped into Havitz, his pupils scanned light like shimmering oil.

"What's happening?"

Balkan approached.

"Don't know. Just muttering something."

Havitz didn't care, but commanding the 72 legions of demons seemed like it would be fun.

"Abella went back."

Death is like mom's voice calling you to come in for dinner.

"Night is coming."

So the playground games would end someday too.

"Anyway, we're abandoned children."

Children whose parents don't look for them don't know how to stop running around even after dusk arrives.

"Lastly..."

Havitz looked around at his friends.

"Let's conquer the world just once before we go."

Balkan's eyes filled with mischief, and Natasha grinned with an excited expression.

"Great! No one goes home first!"

The Gustav Empire, which had destroyed the Republic of Cotria, began a full-scale world war.

Kashan, the neighboring country, lost one-tenth of its territory, and the Paras Kingdom in the Middle East also suffered fatal damage.

"We need to break through the Akad Desert. Then we can devour dozens of kingdoms in the central continent."

Across the sea on the eastern side, fierce naval battles with the Jincheon Empire were taking place.

"The sea side isn't easy. Occupy the Hoe Kingdom and Jung Kingdom first. Cut off the support route of the Seven Kingdoms."

The kingdoms of Hoe and Jung occupied the waist of the eastern continent.

"How should we treat the occupied countries?"

At the administrator's words, Balkan looked at Havitz.

"What should we do?"

"Play around with them roughly then kill them all. Don't let any humans except the Gustav Empire set foot in this world."

It was their playground, and also the ultimate goal that demons aimed for.

"By the way, there's something concerning."

Balkan looked down at the world map.

A red line starting from the northwestern region of Kashan came straight down vertically, connecting to the central continent.

"All demon armies along this line have been completely annihilated. As if erased with an eraser."

Natasha's eyes lit up.

"The Knight of Maha."

The number of demons he had killed while moving south exceeded 10,000, including two legion commanders.

"We thought it was the childish goal of someone doing knight training, but he really drew a straight line through Kashan."

Smodo was indifferent.

"No need to worry, right? He's not coming our way, and how much can one person erase?"

The red line drawn on the map was certainly thin.

"The problem is the legion commanders. We lost the 69th and 57th legion commanders. Regular soldiers are quickly replenished, but losing legion commanders is a big loss."

Natasha pointed to herself.

"Should I go take a look?"

Balkan didn't want that.

'I can't imagine Natasha dying to someone. But really, this line feels ominous.'

Going around when it's difficult and running away when it's dangerous - that's the trajectory ordinary humans can draw.

'Can't find any trace of wavering.'

He had just broken through.

"Let's just be cautious for now. I'll have the kids check on the Knight of Maha's movements."

It was spring when flowers red as blood bloomed.

"You... how dare a mere human...!"

The demons of the 55th Legion that had been dominating the southwestern desert of Kashan became corpses covering the sand.

"This isn't the end. Ten billion demons will definitely find you and tear you apart piece by piece..."

"Boring, always the same thing."

A young man with blue hair grown to his shoulders and a beard like fur strapped a greatsword to his back.

"Do you guys memorize that stuff separately?"

The massive body of 55th Legion Commander Pawell made a chilling sound as it split from the crown of his head.

"Is this the end of the desert?"

The blue-haired man closed one eye and looked at the horizon where a city was built in the distance.

The Knight of Maha, Ozen Lian (22 years old).

"Finally arrived."

He had never seen a map.

He just walked south following the stars, eating anything when hungry and digging into the ground to sleep when cold.

'Walking is something that leads you to arrival.'

He had defeated countless strong enemies but never felt like he had obtained strength.

"Can you be called strong if you split the sky?"

As he brought down the great sword vertically, an illusion of the world splitting flickered before his eyes.

He didn't know.

"Kido, how about you? Are you making any progress?"

What was his first training companion doing and where was he now?

"Work hard. I'm going ahead."

With confidence that he wouldn't have given up, Lian walked toward where the city was visible.

"I should wash up. People will mistake me for a monster."

It was also his first time encountering civilization in a year, but the smell of demon blood was too strong.

'If I came to the right place, this should be the Zive Kingdom.'

One of the Seven Sacred Kingdoms.

Long rainy seasons with many cloudy days, and home to the school that produced Nane, the Buddha of the age - that was all he knew.

"It would be nice if I could meet Sirone."

Lian didn't know.

The fact that the race that dominates the world's night was wandering the streets of Zive, thirsting for blood.
