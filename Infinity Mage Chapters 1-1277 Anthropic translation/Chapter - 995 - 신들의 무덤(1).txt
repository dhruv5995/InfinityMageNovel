Tomb of the Gods (1)

Drimo.

Sirone and the seekers of the world now understood dreams.

"Drimo is a system that processes signals of logic and illogic."

Sirone said.

"Therefore, signals from reality and the reverse world come in simultaneously. That's why dreams seem contradictory when we wake up."

Miro added.

"They're not actually contradictory though. At least within the dream, everything is perfectly logical."

Sein agreed.

"That's exactly what makes Hidden Code so terrifying. Things that should only be possible in dreams unfold in reality."

Even now, thinking of Syok made his teeth clench.

'I still love Miro...'

Not choosing her during the Judgment of 20 remained his greatest regret in life.

Of course, he had no intention of hurting Gaold.

'I don't have that right.'

Only Gaold had the right to love Miro, which was why Miro's heart had also been torn.

'But...'

Liking someone was still liking them.

As Sein gazed at Miro's face, he met eyes with Kang Nan, who was looking back at him.

They both knew what the other was thinking, but in the end, neither showed it and looked away.

"Anyway."

Gaold said, looking up.

"This definitely isn't a place to walk around sober."

KRAAAAAAANG!

The roaring sounds like monsters came from mechanical devices spinning in all directions.

"This is the center of Drimo."

The world called Somnambulism stretched out frantically before Sirone's group.

Kang Nan's mouth fell open.

"My god..."

Even the inside of a madman's head wouldn't be like this.

Mysterious structures repeatedly assembled and disassembled, and among them were ancient relics from Sirone's planet.

Abstract and impressionist paintings, sound waves exploding like fireworks, unknown mathematical formulas.

Ruber said.

"The process of illogical emotions being expressed as rational symbols is wondrous. That's why some call dreams the source of inspiration."

Even Arius, who had plundered countless minds, could only offer praise this time.

"Magnificent. The common sense we know is being overturned, and concepts belonging to completely different categories are combining seamlessly."

Mong-a said proudly.

"In dreams, all concepts go through a mysterious combination process. That's where logic and illogic are distinguished. When you wake from a dream, only the logical parts remain. This is very important work. If illogical code comes up to reality..."

"The world would change."

Sirone said.

"What defines the world is the human heart. Therefore, if we perceive the world by illogical standards, eventually the world itself becomes distorted."

Sein asked.

"Unregulated?"

Mong-a nodded.

"Yes. But that's rather a small part since it uses equivalent exchange."

Ruber continued.

"There are cases where concepts are artificially manipulated. The representative example of that is <Object>."

"Ah..."

"Concepts that shouldn't originally come into the logical world are forced through by exploiting system loopholes. Humans call those who do such things grave robbers."

When Ruber turned his gaze, Arius shrank his shoulders.

"B-but not all objects existing in the world are entirely the work of grave robbers, right? The <Idea> that Lian has is a representative example of self-manifestation."

"If the user has conviction, even the system can't help it. But rules exist to be followed. The reason I didn't enter your dream to punish you was also because of the rules."

"...I'm sorry."

Ruber didn't scold him further.

"That's enough. Anyway, objects have also contributed to the world in some ways. Besides, even I..."

Ruber gave a bitter smile.

"Haven't never broken the rules."

"You broke the rules, Ruber?" Even Sirone hadn't heard this story.

"That's right. Just once, I deliberately brought an object into reality by my own will. That's the object used by the Five Great Stars, <Demon Sword Armand>."

Many thoughts flashed through his mind.

Of course, Ruber would know the origin of all objects, but the fact that Armand was created by his hands felt quite strange.

"I've met Armand. She was a Fire Tribe member, right?"

"Yes. It was what she wanted. I'll tell you about it when there's a chance later."

Ruber had nothing to hide from Sirone.

Therefore, the reason for avoiding the topic was likely due to personal emotions.

'If it's Arius...'

As the person who handed Armand to Prince Zion of Kazra, he would know something.

But even that Arius just kept his mouth shut with an uncomfortable expression.

The place Ruber led them to was the lowest level of a massive pyramid.

"This is it."

At the small fountain Ruber pointed to, viscous red liquid was contained like a mirror.

"The non-physical engine, commonly called the dream engine. When activated, the barrier between logic and illogic crumbles, and not only time but even spatial boundaries disappear."

Sirone said.

"So that's how dream people can exist in everyone's dreams simultaneously."

"Yes. It's not a logical phenomenon like simultaneous events. Space-time itself just doesn't exist."

When Ruber activated the dream engine, the blood-red liquid gathered in mid-air and began chaotic changes.

Mong-a extended her hand.

"We're currently injecting negative energy—nightmare—into Imir's dream. Dream power is at maximum; Imir will manifest the event he fears most."

Arius added.

"If such a thing really exists."

When all preparations were complete, the red liquid began changing form at tremendous speed.

As if it were a human face, as if it were a monster, as if perhaps all of this was an illusion.

"We're going in."

As the dream engine turned Drimo, the surrounding scenery began to change little by little.

It was Imir's dream.

It was dark, and nothing could be seen.

'This place?'

It was a silence as if this world that had swallowed them was turning away from their existence.

Gaold's voice was heard.

"It resembles a vacuum."

Because that statement was so close to the correct answer, the group couldn't respond.

Miro muttered in her head.

'Imir's dream resembles a vacuum.'

Perhaps it was natural for Imir that not even the most insignificant creatures appeared in his dreams?

Kang Nan asked.

"Is this a nightmare? Or is there no dream at all?"

Mong-a's voice was heard.

"The problem is we can't tell. But I think there's a high probability it's a nightmare. If it were truly a vacuum, not only communication but our very existence would have been erased."

Miro said.

"I used Shining magic but no light appeared. Sirone, how about Miracle Stream?"

"Same here. The casting definitely works, but this space is controlling the phenomena."

Sein swallowed hard.

'It's not a simple vacuum. A world with power that ignores even Sirone's abilities. Maybe here we...'

It seemed they might be annihilated.

"There's something."

At Gaold's voice, Sirone stopped walking and saw an eyeball floating in the void.

The reason they could see it despite there being no light was probably because only that was the reality of this dream.

"It's a nightmare."

Mong-a said.

"I don't know why this is a nightmare, but... at least the nightmare did work."

"Hmm, Imir's fear."

Arius, stroking his chin, analyzed the psychology contained in the keyword of eyes.

'Voyeurism, observation, surveillance. Or maybe it's sensory? Could be a physical weakness.'

Eyes held too many symbolic meanings, but at least it was much better than the infinity of vacuum.

"They're increasing."

As they moved forward, the number of eyeballs kept growing.

Still, distance couldn't be measured, and finally the entire darkness was filled with eyeballs.

'Multiple eyes. A passive concept. Surveillance? Or resistance to voyeurism?'

While Arius continued thinking, Miro said.

"Ankera?"

"No."

Arius stopped walking and opened his Spirit Zone to sense the number of eyeballs.

Synesthetic insight never missed, but this time there were far too many.

"The number of eyeballs is roughly over 10 billion. These are probably the eyes of Gaians."

It seemed understandable at first glance, but Miro tilted her head.

"But why 10 billion? Eyes come in pairs of two. Then there should be over 20 billion."

"That's the key point. Why is there one eye? It's psychological unification. Just like people you dislike appear compressed into one person in dreams."

The group listened quietly.

"So here's the question. Why isn't the concept of eyes itself unified? If it were just fear of surveillance or voyeurism, wouldn't one giant eye be sufficient?"

"Well, maybe because Ankera exists?"

"That's also one answer. They avoid conceptually overlapping forms. But even so, they wouldn't output such a large number. Perhaps this number itself could be a source of fear for Imir."

Sirone looked up.

"10 billion eyes. Why would this be frightening?"

"Because it's not one."

Arius continued.

"Eyes also have the meaning of penetration and materialization. In other words, 10 billion eyes are defining it. Imir himself. And he fears such a situation. Therefore..."

Arius turned around once, then aimed at the center of the gazes where all the eyeballs were looking.

"Imir is over there."

As soon as Arius finished speaking, a figure appeared from the darkness where nothing had been.

Imir was sitting cross-legged, chin resting on his hand, smiling toward them.

"Correct."

"Imir."

Everyone took battle positions, but honestly, they didn't know what positions they were taking.

'There's no sensation.'

Because the 10 billion eyes weren't defining them.

"Right. So to speak... is this a dream?"

Normally one doesn't recognize dreams, but Imir wasn't an existence within normal categories.

"Yes, good method. What you're probably looking for is this, right?"

When Imir extended his hand, a sphere made of electricity emitted blue light.

'Ultima System.'

It was almost identical in form to what Sirone had obtained at Babel.

"Honestly, it's unpleasant. No enemy has ever been able to penetrate my mind. Could it be an administrator? Well, the world has reached the point of destruction..."

Sirone said.

"Imir, hand that over. If you're truly strong, use your power for the world."

Imir readily extended his hand.

"Fine, take it."

After watching for a moment, Sirone launched himself forward, but no matter how much he kicked, the distance wouldn't close.

'No, that's not the problem.'

Honestly, it was questionable whether he even had feet.

"Hehe, see? You can't take it. I don't even know who you people are. Do you know why?"

Imir said, splitting his mouth in a grin.

"Because I don't even care."

As long as the 10 billion eyes didn't define them, they were still nothing.

Imir absorbed the Ultima System into his palm and slowly stood up.

"I'll acknowledge you got one hit in. But if you want to meet me, you'll have to suffer quite a bit. Because my memory is..."

Imir's figure disappeared into the darkness.

"The tomb of gods."
