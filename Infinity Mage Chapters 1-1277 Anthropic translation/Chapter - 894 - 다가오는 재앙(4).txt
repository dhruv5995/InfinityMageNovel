The Approaching Calamity (4)

"I'm going."

Many things were uncertain, but if he delayed any longer, he wouldn't reach the center of the incident.

'Whatever bastard it is, I'll go see for myself.'

Shirone's nose bridge twisted like a beast as he considered the uncertain target.

"Graaaah!"

An unfamiliar headache pounded through memories that shouldn't exist, and finally his eyes snapped open.

'Got it!'

The time mechanism controlling 24 hours vibrated as the barriers between past, present, and future were destroyed.

As his senses reversed, memories also seemed to flow backward.

Meeting Mycon, lying in bed sleeping, making love with Lua on the beach, dancing.

'This is 12 hours.'

As the memory of drinking at the party became reality, village chief Begpa approached.

"Puhahaha! You really... *hiccup*. Amusing... magician... Kihihihihi!"

Shirone's hearing, having reversed past to present, began experiencing cognitive dissonance.

'It's different.'

Artificially manipulated memories.

The information carved into his brain was colliding with actual reality, distorting his senses.

"Shiro??????ne??????"

Begpa's face overlapped through retinal afterimages, looking like a demon.

"Kiaaaah!"

Finally the manipulated memories vanished, and his five senses perceived only reality.

"Die, Shirone!"

A 2-meter gray monster that wasn't human stretched out its hand, gleaming black eyes flickering.

"Ugh!"

He teleported to create distance and surveyed the white sand beach - not a single human was visible.

"What is this?"

It had a triangular face like a mantis, with two skulls spread flat like a fan.

Its body was dried like a mummy with reverse-jointed knees, thin arms, and golden gauntlets on its wrists.

'Not exactly identical, but... it was a familiar appearance.'

"Terraforce?"

What strongly proved this fact was the giant flying object floating above Mero Cliff.

"Correct. We are the Terraforce Combat Unit. You have betrayed Terraforce's expectations."

The alien life form that spoke human words stepped on the sand with bird-like split feet.

"What expectations did I betray?"

No, if this moment was an already experienced past...

'What on earth did I...'

What had he experienced before getting up from bed each morning and stretching?

'I can't tell.'

Even though he'd come back through time with Time Vibration, the manipulated memories were blocking him.

"Answer me. What did you do to me? The chip in my head? Why did you inject strange memories?"

The alien life form stopped walking abruptly.

"...Did you come from the future? Much faster than our predictions. Not that it changes anything."

Dozens of Terraforce surrounded Shirone.

"You have lost your qualification as humanity's representative. The moment you surrendered the realm of Yahweh."

"I didn't surrender it. I don't have memories because of you bastards, but I know that much."

"What comfortable sentiment. What effect your actions will have on humanity going forward..."

Dozens of palms aimed at Shirone.

"Watch from the swamp of oblivion."

The Terraforce's gauntlets activated, shooting sharp sound waves.

Shirone shouted.

"...Ah!"

He definitely spoke, but his voice vanished the moment it left his mouth.

'They caught the sound waves!'

The surrounding noise converged to an extreme 0 decibels, making his chest feel like it would burst from stuffiness.

In contrast, the Terraforce's voices were huge and majestic.

"Protect the order of the universe!"

It felt like someone else had entered his brain and was screaming, leaving Shirone unable to even think.

'Incredible.'

Though he prided himself on having a flawless mind as an infinite magician, Terraforce were also masters of waves.

"Block his escape route!"

The sound waves tore up the scenery, some becoming sharp blades aimed at Shirone's throat.

"Grr!"

These bastards!

By this point, any good feelings he'd had toward Terraforce were ancient history.

That's enough!

Homing Photon Cannons individually targeted the Terraforce combat troops and flew toward them.

Zing! Zing! Zing! Zing!

Invisible ripples spread before the Terraforce's eyes, blocking the flash attacks.

"Do you think you're right!"

The ground undulated like waves and the air became hard as iron, crushing down on Shirone.

"In this universe, on a planet occupying just one corner, a life form that appeared not long ago..."

The Terraforce's roar exploded.

"Do you believe you can define truth!"

Even in his mentally confused state, Shirone gritted his teeth and cupped his hands together.

'Elemental Photon Cannon.'

Powerful electricity gathered between Shirone's palms as he drew out all phenomena through spherical transformation.

"...!"

Whatever the case.

"Let me speak too!"

The Elemental Photon Cannon that tore through the sound wave barrier extended outward with vibrations.

Zing! Zing! Zing! Zing!

Electricity intertwined with the wave barrier, and several combat troops collapsed with convulsions.

"Hah. Hah."

Shirone, grateful even for his rough breathing, wiped sweat from his chin and raised his hand.

Dozens of electric spheres rose into the sky, targeting all the Terraforce.

"I don't understand. As you can see, I am Yahweh. And even if I left room for doubt, why are you attacking me?"

"Is it impossible to win after all?"

The Terraforce looked at each other as if avoiding an answer, then extended their hands toward Shirone.

"Just go to sleep."

The chip installed in Shirone's head activated, turning on brain waves regardless of his will.

"Uaaaah!"

Endless tinnitus flowed and extreme headaches surged.

"Forget, human. You can never defeat evil. We will judge."

"Grrrr..."

Shirone, kneeling while clutching his head, lifted his head with all his strength.

"No one can judge others."

"Yet you also judge evil, don't you? Haven't you annihilated countless demons?"

"Don't talk nonsense. I just act on what I believe is right. If the majority believes it, it becomes law. But that doesn't give you the right to judge others."

"That majority is your limitation. We are Terraforce, governing the entire universe. Human definitions are merely the opinions of an extreme minority to Terraforce. We are the law."

The Terraforce walked forward with outstretched hands.

"Of course truth exists everywhere. We saw Yahweh as such. But you broke the rules."

As the distance closed, Shirone's consciousness shook beyond control.

'No! I have to endure!'

He didn't want to greet another refreshing morning.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

There was no time.

Even now while he was doing this, the world was being trampled under demon feet.

'This is the last time.'

Thinking to make a final gamble, Shirone put his index finger to his ear and stabbed inward.

"What..."

As he tore through skin, he felt cold machinery.

'Fortunately it's not deep. But...'

He grasped it and slowly pulled it out, the wires connected to his brain stimulating it.

"Grrrr!"

His pupils rolled upward, and brain functions created electric-like afterimages on his retina.

"Are you going to take your own life? Let me be clear - you'll die if you remove that device."

Even without hearing it, that seemed likely.

'I need to stay conscious.'

Thud thud. Thud thud thud.

The wires had been pulled out 10 centimeters, and he didn't want to imagine how long they were.

It felt eerie, as if all thoughts and even his soul were being pulled out together.

"Uaaaaaaah."

Shirone's mouth opened without his knowing, and the chip's terminal structure stimulated his entire brain.

"He's dead..."

The Terraforce stopped speaking.

Blood was flowing down the wires connected between brain and hand, dripping steadily.

'Huh?'

Shirone had a strange experience.

'What is this?'

All the world's scenery remained before his eyes, overlapping in chronological order.

Looking back, he saw another version of himself frozen while grasping the wires.

Time wasn't flowing.

'Because 24 hours are completely unfolded.'

It was probably a side effect from stimulation entering his brain operating on resonance.

In other words, his brain was damaged enough that it couldn't perceive the flow of time.

'I really am dying.'

Looking far ahead, at roughly 3 hours later, he saw himself dead with blood flowing from his nose.

'There has to be a way.'

Shirone approached the other self pulling out the chip, inserted both hands, and spread them left and right.

In the world of thought and cognition, hundreds of Shirones overlapping within one second spread left and right.

'Damn!'

Shirone repeated the same motion.

Upon reaching 1/10th of a second, 1/100th of a second, 1/1000th of a second, he saw something that wasn't himself.

'Startling.'

Between the domino-like connected Shirones, a dark red sphere was writhing bizarrely.

'I don't exist in this time period.'

It was 0.666 seconds.

'When time is split extremely finely, there exist time periods where nothing exists...'

Why?

'Why does such a gap exist?'

To humans who believed the universe was perfect, this current flaw was incomprehensible.

'Because it's necessary for something.'

If the world was made of information, air could become specific signals necessary for humans.

Roughly 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, plus other information combinations totaling less than 0.1%.

'Time is the same.'

Information from specific intervals contained in instants must be affecting the world somehow.

'Going deeper!'

Shirone gritted his teeth and continued digging into time.

'More! More! More!'

Dismantling time.

Gradually gaining momentum, now time periods expanded even before he spread his arms.

Even as countless Shirones spread left and right, occasionally peculiar things passed by.

'I can't stop.'

Already split into astronomical fractions, it was too distant to go back.

Proportionally it would be a very small amount, so Shirone continued digging deeper.

'Come out! What the hell is there!'

Toward the end of time.

Perhaps because clear death awaited, Shirone focused only on that.

'It's changing.'

In that near-infinite instant, Shirone's form began to blur.

"Huk! Huk!"

Fear surged, but curiosity transcending life continued making his arms flail.

'It's coming!'

He was certain the end was approaching.

The things rapidly pushed left and right were forms beyond description in words.

'No. That can't be!'

Humans, this world, were completely different from what mere brain imagery could create.

Terrifying.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

Shedding tears, Shirone finally reached a situation where nothing was being pushed left and right.

The end of time.

"Ah, aaaaah..."

There was no form there.

The Terraforce screamed.

"This is impossible!"

Following Shirone's moving hand again, the wires connected to the chip were being pulled out.

The only problem was that they were passing straight through without going through his body.

"Could the Chief Judge's words... have been right?"

"Ugh!"

Shirone, his pupils returned to their proper place, completely removed the chip with its long trailing wires.

"Whew."

The Terraforce combat troops froze.

"How can a human..."

Sensation was impossible.

Like quantum particles, the universe's terminus that existed only in unperceivable states.

"The 10th sense..."

Terraforce called this Formlessness.
