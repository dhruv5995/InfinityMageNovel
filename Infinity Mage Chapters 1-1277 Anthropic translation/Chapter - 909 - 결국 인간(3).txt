Finally Human (3)

Abyss Cliff.

The place swept by a magnitude 12.4 earthquake was no longer a valley.

The ground torn apart by the waves had formed endless cliffs whose depths could not be fathomed.

"Graaaah!"

From the bottom of that deep cliff, Yujung leaped up, powerfully kicking off the air.

Her eyes, covered in black dirt and dust, flashed menacingly with golden light.

"Damn it... *cough*! *Cough*!"

Air leaked out from where her throat had been cut.

'Where are you?'

The corpses of demons filled half the landscape, but Satan was nowhere to be seen.

Yujung brushed off the dirt and plucked a strand of her lustrous hair that flowed like a wild horse's mane.

'String of Healing.'

The hair she released into the air began emitting golden light and vibrating rapidly.

As the light string created a new phenomenon, Yujung's throat slowly began to heal.

"Haaah!"

Once the hole in her throat disappeared, she first took a deep breath.

"You bastard!"

She glared with wide eyes and shouted angrily.

"Stop hiding and come out!"

The mana of her curses spread in all directions, but the demon corpses remained silent.

"Tch! Did he run away?"

Just as Yujung was about to swing her staff and chase after Satan, she heard footsteps.

"Hm?"

She turned her head casually, but an unknown tension crept across her face.

Tess was looking at Yujung from across a 20-meter-wide crack in the torn earth.

"There's a survivor?"

As the daughter of the spy family Elzain, she was well-suited to assess the earthquake's magnitude and the demons' movements, but...

'Not that woman.'

The person who made Yujung's spine tingle was Ryan, who had just landed beside Tess.

"Huh? She's human?"

Yujung stared intently at Ryan, who was blinking and observing this side.

'Eyes of Golden Truth.'

Looking with eyes that penetrated the world's truths, she could finally understand the source of her unease.

'She's just like me.'

Someone who had realized the Idea.

"I'm not human."

At Yujung's words, Ryan tilted his head.

"Then are you a demon?"

"I'm a stone monkey."

Tess turned her head with a dumbfounded expression.

"What should we do? She seems to be in shock."

"No, it's probably true."

She was a woman who emanated such an enormous presence that any words she spoke had to be believed.

"Did you cause the earthquake?"

Hearing Ryan's question, Tess frowned.

"What kind of nonsense are you... A magnitude 12.4 earthquake. The entire Abyss Cliff had collapsed, making it impossible to confirm the demons' movements.

'It's not something a human could do.'

Yujung said.

"Yeah. I did it, so what?"

Tess's face went blank, and Ryan and Yujung, who had been watching each other, asked simultaneously.

"Who are you?"

Silence again.

This time Ryan spoke first.

"We need to investigate what happened here. Can you cooperate with us?"

"Hmm, cooperation."

As Yujung put her hands in her pants and scratched vigorously, Tess's face turned red.

'Is she really a monkey or what?'

Yujung smiled and said.

"I don't want to."

"Then we'll have no choice but to force the information out of you."

The moment Ryan grabbed his great sword, Yujung's figure appeared as an afterimage before his eyes.

'Fast...'

Before the thought could fully form, the staff came rushing toward Ryan's forehead.

Ryan twisted his head to avoid the attack and swung his great sword at his opponent's waist.

Kurrrrrrring!

The Mach-speed slash split the world horizontally.

'She dodged.'

Ryan's gaze turned to the sky.

She didn't feel faster than Natasha, but her reflexes seemed to surpass hers.

Yujung's eyes sparkled.

'She attacks information itself.'

She realized why she, who was immune to physical force, had her throat cut by Habits' sword.

"In that case..."

She plucked a strand of hair and blew on it, causing a string phenomenon that created numerous clones.

"What the hell is that now?"

Seeing them filling the sky as they fell, Ryan gritted his teeth and swung his sword upward.

A massive flash passed by, clearing his vision, and through it, Yujung's real body came crashing down.

"Kiiiiiii!"

The moment Yujung swung her staff vertically, its length extended and struck Ryan's great sword hard.

"Graaaah!"

At the moment of collision, he realized it weighed dozens of tons, and it was getting even heavier.

"Is this all you've got?"

Just as Ryan, with both legs buried up to his knees in the ground, was about to lift his great sword high.

'There's no weight.'

Yujung, who had shrunk her staff to light speed, landed and spun around once.

"Mystical Art: Lotus Blossom."

She spread her legs wide and thrust out her staff with a "swoosh," sending afterimages shooting out like buckshot.

Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-bang!

Dozens of holes burst open in Ryan's body.

"Heh."

The moment she looked back at Tess with a meaningful smile, Yujung's expression froze.

She briefly felt something strange about the calm face that remained composed even before a comrade's death.

"Huuuuu!"

Feeling chills as she turned her gaze, there stood Ryan, his body already regenerating.

Crack! Crack!

As his muscle fibers twisted and transformed into a demon's body, Ryan brought his great sword down vertically.

'I need to block...'

Yujung tried to pull back her staff and defend her head.

'Huh?'

As if she were dreaming, time flowed slowly and her arms wouldn't rise.

'Huh? Huh? Huh?'

From behind Ryan, the world was opening up and the will to cut was surging forward.

Yujung screamed.

"Kiyaaaah!"

She barely managed to time it right as the great sword struck down like lightning on the center of her staff.

"Gaaaah!"

Yujung's pupils shook, and indescribable power surged into both her arms.

Crack.

In a time divided into thousandths of a second and then split into a thousand more pieces, she could see her staff splitting apart.

'Ah.'

A strike so beautiful it was ecstatic.

'If I get hit by that...'

Just as she felt a thrilling sensation in her lower back, the great sword stopped right in front of her forehead.

"Why didn't you dodge?"

"Huh?"

The woman who had been gaping like a monkey came to her senses and stepped back.

"Oops."

She had been so entranced that she had forgotten the fact that Ryan's sword could destroy her.

"This feels gross."

Yujung bent her waist awkwardly and kept rubbing her thighs back and forth.

After roughly composing herself, she discarded half of her split staff and aimed at Ryan.

"What's your name?"

"Ogent Ryan. What about you?"

"I'm Son Yujung."

It sounded like a name from the Jincheon Empire, but there was no way such a powerful fighter wouldn't be known.

"Where are you from?"

Yujung pointed to the sky.

"The Celestial Realm. I like you especially, so I'll tell you. Heaven's army has descended..."

A booming voice exploded from the sky.

"Son Yujung!"

At the voice that pierced her heart, she looked up to see Archangel Ikael frowning.

Yujung raised her head and bared her fangs.

"Tch, why did that old lady come? I was just about to have some real fun."

"Son Yujung. I can understand indulgence, but I cannot tolerate breaking the laws of Heaven."

"What will you do if you can't tolerate it?"

As Ikael's eyes widened, Yujung's body began to stiffen like stone.

"Graaaaah!"

"Even without Buddha, there are plenty of ways to restrict your freedom. If you defy my will one more time, I'll strip you of your right to exist as a living being."

Yujung's gaze turned to Ryan.

"How embarrassing...!"

Should I just fight here?

"So that's how it is."

Ryan looked up at Ikael and asked.

"Does Heaven's army infiltrating mean that Ymir is also here?"

At that moment, Yujung's restraints were released.

"Kiii! I should just..."

As she heated up her body and was about to soar into the sky, Ikael spoke.

"Are you Ryan?"

"Huh?"

Yujung released her killing intent and asked.

"You know this guy?"

Ikael recalled the blue-haired boy who had blocked Ymir's clone with his bare body.

'He's grown huge.'

Back then he was just a mere human, but now he was Heaven's army's top priority target for restraint.

'I'd like to deal with him now if possible, but...'

Making hasty judgments before finding Buddha would have bad effects on the future.

"Wait for the time, Ryan. You don't need to be impatient - Ymir will find you."

Yujung's head whipped around.

"Ymir? You're going to fight that guy?"

There was no answer, but the fact was clear just from looking at Ryan's eyes burning with fighting spirit.

"Oh ho."

Yujung wore a meaningful smile as she flew up to stand beside Ikael.

"Let's fight again next time, interesting human."

"Those bastards...!"

Tess stepped forward and was about to shout, but Ryan raised his arm to stop her.

"Let's send them off for now."

The moment Ikael's wings flashed with brilliant light, his body shot forward at terrifying speed.

Ryan watched the long cloud trail Yujung created, then turned his head to Tess.

"Are you okay? Any injuries?"

"At least I didn't get my back broken in a fight between whales. Anyway, let's go back and report first."

"Right. With this much time, the Holy War Council should have already figured it out too. What's left is all-out war."

Ymir is coming.

"Will it be okay? On top of Hell's army..."

Tess stopped speaking when she saw Ryan trembling with an extremely excited expression.

'Well, he has been chasing that shadow all this time.'

As a swordswoman herself, she could understand Ryan's complex feelings.

"Don't worry. You're the world's strongest swordsman. Even the King of Giants is no match for you."

Ryan wore a chilling smile.

"Come."

For the first time, he felt like time was passing slowly.

"How was it?"

After leaving the Abyss Cliff, Ikael, who hadn't exchanged a single word of conversation, asked Yujung.

"Huh? What?"

"That human called Ryan. You're too obsessed with fighting to have no thoughts about him."

Yujung's face lit up.

"Of course he was amazing! It's been a while since I felt that tingly down there! Ah, I want to fight again. With that human, I could fight for 100 days straight and never get bored."

That wasn't what Ikael wanted to hear.

"Of course you would. He's a descendant of Ogent."

"Huh? Ogent?"

Yujung, who had been searching her memory for a moment, suddenly widened her eyes and shouted.

"What! Ogent!"

The one who faced Ymir as an equal in a human body.

"Right! Come to think of it, he said Ogent Ryan! Ah, I see. Wow, a descendant of Ogent?"

Yujung also had pride in her own bloodline, but when it came to Ogent, she felt slightly inferior.

"That's why I'm asking. You've also fought Ymir before. What do you think would happen if those two faced each other?"

If Ryan had surpassed his predecessor's power, even Ymir could be in danger.

"He was really Ogent? Wow, that legendary swordsman. What a shame! If I'd known earlier, I could have at least heard some tales of Ogent's heroic deeds..."

Ikael frowned.

"Son Yujung!"

"Huh? Oh, why?"

"Am I not asking you which side would have better odds if the current Ryan clashed with Ymir?"

Yujung blinked.

"What are you talking about? Of course, I heard that this person called Ogent was the strongest in Heaven's history, but..."

After weighing Ryan and Ymir, she burst into laughter and raised her index finger.

"Of course he's no match for Ymir. He'd probably turn to dust in 3 seconds. Oh, if it's the main body, that is."

"...Is that so."

Since there was a history of humiliation at Ogent's hands, she had been worried, but it seemed there was no need for concern.

"To add to that, the only person in the universe who can beat Ymir is me. Of course, right now I don't feel like it so I'm staying put, but if I put my mind to it..."

Despite Yujung's endless chatter, Ikael only urged them to hurry on their way.
