Chain Reaction (1)

Chagall gritted his teeth.

"Graaah!"

Dozens of rapid-fire swords materialized, and just as he swung them all while charging at Lian—

Ethella shouted.

"Stop!"

Her sincere will dominated Chagall's body as the chains rapidly contracted.

"Urgh!"

Shirone's group stared blankly at Chagall as he fell backward with a thud.

"Teacher, what's going on here?"

Ethella bit her lip. What was most shameful was showing her already broken spirit.

"I'm sorry. I had no choice."

Ethella, wearing her tattered clothes like rags, slowly raised her body.

Her legs gave out and she had to grab the wall for support, but gradually her strength returned.

"It's exactly as you see. I embraced Chagall and fell to hell. I'm receiving this punishment as the price."

"How long is the purification time?"

When Shirone asked, the Informant's voice pierced through from outside the cave.

"87 years, 2,875 quintillion, 3,241 trillion..."

Ethella's resignation was understandable.

The number seemed meaningful to Chagall too, as he erased his killing intent and leaned his back against the cave wall.

"Tch! What a troublesome interference."

Ethella said.

"Shirone, there's a True Voice in the Valley of Wailing. She too is bound, accepting all karma. Please. Save her."

"That's exactly why I came to hell. And I'll save you too, teacher."

Shirone explained his method.

Saving Ethella would mean saving Chagall too, but there was no need to worry about that.

"No, please don't."

Lian, who would burn himself to purify hell, and True Voice, who closed the Spirit Zone to save humanity.

'Compared to them, I'm just...'

Rolling around with a devil-like man.

"Please leave. I've given up on saving True Voice and on finding you, Shirone. I don't have the right to fight."

"Don't blame yourself."

Shirone knew Ethella.

'A person so righteous she could face even Satan in heaven. Only someone of that caliber could embrace Chagall.'

In a world where you can't even die, having to live entangled with the man you hate most.

'It must be terrible.'

In the other world, karma isn't something to be solved but a weight to be endured.

'Karma that can't be solved is assigned from the start. Lian is just a special case.'

While purification time isn't a rank, 87 years meant exactly that.

"We need your abilities, teacher. The power of Taegeuk will surely help with what we're trying to do. And maybe we can find a way to purify you."

"You think you can break these damn chains?"

At Chagall's words, Lian's eyes widened.

"You shut up."

Though he couldn't touch him because of the chains, his anger toward Chagall remained.

"Kekeke, perfect. Hey, let's go. You must be sick of me too, right? Don't you want freedom?"

Ethella met Chagall's eyes.

Some emotion that only they knew passed between them, and Chagall's gaze turned away.

"Hmph."

He convinced himself he felt no guilt.

"Alright, if my power can help. But could you give me some time? My body..."

She wanted to cleanse her heart by purifying her flesh.

"Yes."

Miracle Stream rose from Shirone's body, and Hand of God pierced through the cave.

Son YuJeong looked up with her mouth agape.

"Wow."

While Imir might be supreme in battle, Yahweh's abilities felt wondrous to witness.

The giant hand of light carved out the mountain, then became clear water that filled the hollow.

Having finished the work in an instant, Shirone said.

"YuJeong, please give her new clothes."

Though he could create clothing with Material abilities—

"Yes."

YuJeong plucked her hair.

Once all the garments were made, Ethella held them to her chest and looked up.

"One more... may I ask?"

While Lian furrowed his brow in confusion, Shirone spoke calmly.

"Chagall's clothes too."

"Really? That guy's incredibly evil. Earlier he..."

When Yahweh's gaze shot directly at her, her shoulders flinched.

"Ah, I understand."

Having gathered what they needed, Ethella turned back.

"Let's go."

Chagall glared at Lian as if displeased, then clicked his tongue and stood up.

"Once these chains are broken, I'll kill you first."

Lian replied.

"I'd welcome that."

The two arrived at the lake Shirone had created.

Ethella knelt and first quenched her thirst, then cupped water in her hands and turned her head.

Chagall raised his middle finger.

"You drink plenty yourself."

As Ethella removed her ragged clothes and washed her body, Chagall's mood grew even more unpleasant.

"You were crazy for a while, but now you feel like fighting again? Well, if these chains could just be broken, you'd do anything."

"You come too."

Ethella, having finished her grooming, called out.

"To fight evil, the heart must be pure. This will help."

"Evil? Are you insane?"

Chagall shouted.

"I'm the evil of all evils! No evil can instill fear in me! So what? Something about the heart?"

"Chagall."

Ethella's sincerity transmitted through the chains.

"Urgh."

"Just as you can treat me however you want, I can teach you goodness. So come."

"How annoying."

Thinking it was better to just do it rather than look more foolish, Chagall walked over.

"Here..."

As Chagall leaned forward with his face down, Ethella scooped water and washed his hair.

"Archbishop Raphael said this: If the power of evil is selfishness, then the power of good is sacrifice."

Even knowing these were the words of someone she had directly killed, Chagall remained silent.

"For good to destroy evil is no different from evil itself. Sacrifice, Ethella. The stronger evil becomes, the more you must."

She lathered soap in Chagall's hair.

"That is the nature of yin and yang. Evil isn't destroyed but transformed into good..."

"He was a good person. I killed him."

Though Chagall's words still scraped at her insides, Ethella no longer got angry.

"Yes. Archbishop Raphael forgave you in his final moment because he foresaw the great battle between good and evil. Destroying evil doesn't make evil disappear. But if you become good..."

"Couldn't you become evil?"

"Certainly."

The greater the sacrifice, the easier it is to turn to malice, and Ethella had faced that crisis too.

"Resenting you, cursing my situation. But it's over now. This will be the last of our journey together."

Splash—water poured down.

'The last.'

As Chagall's long hair covered his face like a curtain, water dripped down his cheeks.

The Holy See was in great turmoil.

"What are you doing right now! To commit such acts while the Holy War is open. This is clearly an act of aggression."

Gis was angry enough to point fingers at Kitra, the king of Paras.

"What did I do wrong?"

"This, this...!"

You made the angels useless.

That was the core issue.

Though countless lives were lost due to pyramids being erected around the world—

'Isn't this actually a good thing?'

From other nations' perspectives, the fact that the angels' power was neutralized was cause for celebration.

'It's not like we're suffering losses.'

Kitra said.

"I'll say it again—establishing the ancient civilization wasn't my will. And I can't stop it either."

The Corona Kingdom struck back.

"We've already revealed that the Zodiac is manipulating the laws. We have evidence too."

"Even so, nothing will change. Those who can sit in this place know this. Humans cannot prevent divine intervention."

"It's not divine."

Everyone in the Holy See looked toward the observer seats.

Pope Constantine, who usually refrained from speaking except on religious matters, stepped up to the podium.

"God does not destroy human lives with such crude structures. That is a demonic calamity."

"Demonic."

Kitra chuckled.

"The Demon Knights of the Anti-Magic Department have departed to investigate the pyramids. They will thoroughly uncover the truth and collect evidence. And if you, Kitra, are a heretic..."

Constantine's eyes blazed.

"I will personally punish you with my own hands."

Golden radiance, called the greatest divine power of the Lamie religion, filled the conference room.

'Truly incredible.'

People's eyes searched for Havitz, but as expected, he didn't appear.

The Pope gritted his teeth.

'Will you avoid even this incident? Cunning bastard.'

Having secretly hoped for a power struggle, he turned to look at Shirone with his emotions intact.

Since their first meeting, he'd heard through reports that Shirone hadn't yet left the Papal territory.

'What are you plotting?'

Shirone, who had been thinking about Havitz and Wizard, felt the gaze and met his eyes.

'You couldn't even dream of it.'

What terrible things were happening in the place he considered holy ground.

In the forest 13 kilometers from the Vatican, small villages were scattered like dots.

Having visited several villages throughout the night, Shirone's group had been silent for some time.

Seina bit her lip.

'All of it was lies?'

In the village she'd examined, countless children were receiving special training.

Children emaciated from fasting, children praying until their throats bled.

Through such extreme training, the Holy Knights gained the ability to fight evil.

'So that's the true nature of the Martyrdom Code.'

The moment she realized that the power she'd believed in God and believed God had given her was mere brainwashing—

'It's all over.'

Seina lost her divine power.

"Let's go back. I'll take responsibility and spread the word. There must be people who'll listen to me."

"Will there really be?"

Shirone stopped in front of the entrance to the village located in the deepest area.

A sign read 'Village of Heaven.'

Even before stepping through the entrance, the terrible aura of malice was so thick it reeked.

"Ugh."

Though her holy power hadn't activated, Seina felt it too.

"What on earth... is in here?"

At the feeling too terrible to speak of, Shirone led his friends into the village.

Even without checking directly, they could hear prayer-like screams and groans from countless houses.

"No one's walking around. Are they confined?"

As Nade looked around, they saw someone walking toward the village hall.

"Hide."

Pressing their backs against the wall, Seina's eyes widened.

"High Priest?"

Maximus, third in the Vatican hierarchy, but the stern face she knew was nowhere to be found.

'How can a person change so much in just a few days?'

His eyes were unfocused as if drugged, and his face was haggard as if unwashed.

"Let's follow."

Following Maximus into the village hall, they arrived at the building and frowned.

"Ugh."

Inside the window, naked men and women covered in animal blood were writhing together.

Though she couldn't make out the details, Seina spotted some familiar faces.

"Those are priests I know."

Her voice was trembling.

Maximus entered the room and washed his face in a basin filled with blood.

Then he removed his clothes and slowly pushed his body into the crowd of people.

Faced with the sight of blood-soaked masses rubbing against each other, Seina felt nauseous.

"Bleh!"

Iruki rested his chin on his hand.

"Such acts in broad daylight. And this is Papal territory. That's not brainwashing or anything. It's like a demon worshipper's ritual."

A woman's voice was heard.

"Right, a demonic ritual."

When Shirone turned his head, a hooded girl stood in front of a window one space over.

"This is Satan's stronghold. But to think it can only be entered through the Vatican's underground. That's why I couldn't find it."

Seina asked.

"Satanism? No, more importantly, who are you?"

"Me? Yora."

The girl lowered her hood.

"Long time no see. Shirone, Iruki, Nade."

It was Candler Eden.
