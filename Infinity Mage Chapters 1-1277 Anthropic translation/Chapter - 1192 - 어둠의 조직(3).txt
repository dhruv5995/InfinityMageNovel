The Dark Organization (3)

Iruki looked around at his friends and asked.

"Then by any chance, that information..."

"No, no! I can't tell you anything more. If I reveal this... no, I can't."

If she couldn't tell them even with romantic feelings involved, it was likely related to personal safety.

Iruki ran his hand through his hair.

"Still, can't you tell me? Trust me. If you're in danger, I'll protect you."

Kara covered her cheeks with both hands.

"What should I do? You're so cool."

While Nade pouted with his lower lip, Shirone waited hopefully.

"I'm sorry. I..."

As she struggled with tears welling up, Iruki calmly stepped back.

"This seems to be as far as we can go. It's impossible to create variables outside of dice rolls."

Since he had no feelings for Kara to begin with, he remained composed even with her right in front of him.

Eden said, "Still, it's a good start. We finished with 2 million. If we'd been unlucky, it could have cost over ten million."

"Mr. Curtis didn't go bankrupt for nothing. What do you want to do? Should we check out the next shop?"

Shirone said, "Let's do it here. As Eden said, it takes considerable points just to draw favor from the other party. This is our chance. Whether it turns out good or bad..."

This was where they had to make their move.

"Ms. Kara, I want to get information about the purchase program. If you know anything, please tell me."

Kara's expression changed.

"It's true that I have information, but I absolutely cannot reveal it. If you want to persuade me, the rule is designated number, and you'll have to pay 10 million points per attempt."

'It's been cut in half.'

It must be the accomplice effect from Iruki's persuasion.

"Alright, I'll persuade you."

"I'll use 2 dice. From 2 to 12, name one number and if the same number comes up, you win."

"One number?"

It was a completely different level of difficulty increase.

'Emotionally speaking, it means it's a secret she wants to hide that badly. Honestly, it's spine-chilling.'

Even though the rules seemed to apply equally, there was actually a blind spot in this match.

'Even if it ends in a draw, the administrator has nothing to lose. Ultimately, it's an extremely difficult probability to win.'

Of course, that was by ordinary people's standards.

"Fine. I'll choose 7."

"I choose 4."

Two people threw dice in phase space.

'Quantum Collapse.'

The probability of Shirone's thrown dice was eliminated, showing 3 and 4.

Kara got 11.

'I won.'

While his friends clenched their fists, Kara at the counter had a dazed expression.

Tremendous shock... that kind of emotion.

"Whew."

Her legs gave out as she collapsed into a chair, her lips trembling.

"Fine, I understand. If you're going to play it this way, I have no choice. Your friend is really amazing, isn't he?"

"My friend is pretty strong."

Though he had only thrown dice, since he controlled it with mental techniques, it wasn't wrong to say so.

"Alright. I don't know the details either. Of course, even revealing this much puts my life at risk."

A blue light entered Kara's eyes.

"What I know is..."

'The mode has changed.'

Real-time keywords not stored in the basic database spilled from her mouth.

"Corcoras."

Shirone nodded.

'I see.'

As if nothing had happened, Kara returned to her bright expression and smiled.

"That's all. Sorry, honey. I wanted to help. Now... are you leaving?"

Even if they were mechanical emotions, when they came out this way, it was confusing.

"Let's go."

Iruki turned away coldly.

"Hey, shouldn't we at least say goodbye? I feel strangely bad about this."

"That's why we're leaving."

If you think of it as just a dice game, only humans would get hurt.

"Let's definitely go on a date next time."

The group couldn't turn back, thinking there would be no expression on Kara's face.

At the entrance to Sector 7, Shirone said, "Corcoras. That's the name of the garbage dump Mr. Curtis mentioned. Ms. Pena is waiting there."

Nade said, "Hmm, I think this is huge information. Mr. Curtis probably wouldn't have dared to persuade her this far. Anyway, let's not persuade hot-tempered people from now on. The rules are too difficult."

Iruki agreed.

"Without Quantum Collapse, even attempting twelve times wouldn't guarantee success. That alone would cost 240 million points."

Eden tapped his lips.

"Hmm, but that amount isn't impossible for point tycoons, is it? If luck is on their side... huh?"

If luck is on their side.

From Eden's surprised expression, Shirone also realized.

"I see. There were two ways to enter the Core. Either collect 10 billion points to buy a key, or get lucky."

Nade said, "There was never a third route from the beginning. This is one of the official strategies."

Iruki rested his chin on his hand.

"It definitely makes sense. Collecting 10 billion and spending points to persuade. Each is the core of the external track and internal track respectively. In terms of difficulty, they seem about equal."

Eden added, "On the other hand, we have an absolute advantage in persuasion. If luck is required, we can control that luck. We're probably the only team attempting purchase with just about 200 million."

Nade smiled.

"Mr. Curtis really did us a solid. We should buy him a meal when we meet him later."

He must be suffering in prison.

"Right, let's rescue him quickly. First, we need to strengthen our dice. Using persuasion, we can buy more items. The first thing we need to get is Loss of Motivation, then Royal Entry. Of course, we need to keep 50 million points in reserve."

Once the plan was set, Nade shouted, "Good! Let's go!"

Corcoras.

The place called the garbage dump was an island where all of Melkidu's trash was dumped.

Of course, there was a separate reason why users called it a garbage dump instead of using the place name.

This was where the worst criminals and human trash in Melkidu gathered.

"...Hoooooo!"

A golden flash landed in a curve on the white sand beach of an island floating in the vast ocean.

Nade's voice faded, and Shirone's group looked around the beach.

"Ugh, the smell."

Garbage was scattered everywhere.

"Looking at the coastline, it's quite a large island. It'll take time to find Ms. Pena."

"We have to stay here for a day anyway once we arrive. We might stay longer depending on the information."

On the path leading into the island's interior, all sorts of junk was piled up like mountains.

"Are there shops too? We need to get food from the sea, but I don't see any fishermen."

Iruki said, "Ms. Pena said if we came too late, we'd see her at the dinner table. She's talking about selling human flesh."

"Ugh!"

Just as Eden shuddered, a group emerged from the garbage pile.

"Heh heh. You came, you came."

They were men with tattoos all over their bodies wearing torn tank tops.

"You guys, do you know where this is?"

"The garbage dump."

"No, no. This is Corcoras. In other words, it's a place where you get completely robbed."

They didn't look particularly strong, but Shirone's group had also used up many points.

The leader said, "I'll give you one minute. Put down all your items and kneel. If you have expensive stuff, we'll spare your lives."

Eden carefully examined the different emblems on the man's forearm.

'Those are...'

The thugs shouted, "What are you doing? Why aren't you emptying your pockets? Do you really want to die?"

They held knives and were ready to charge at any moment, but Shirone's group remained calm.

"Kuk kuk! Kuk kuk kuk! Krak! Krak!"

As if he rarely laughed, the leader scratched his throat and coughed roughly.

"If your guts aren't swollen, you must be rookies. You don't know Corcoras's notorious reputation."

The thugs approached.

"If you're acting tough because you trust your points, that's unfortunate. Special regions each have their characteristics. In Corcoras, you can't use points. Instead, you can kill users all you want. In other words, it's a player kill free zone."

"Points don't get deducted?"

"Haha! That's right. It means I can slaughter you without any problems. Now then..."

Nade cracked his knuckles.

"Damn! That's what it was? I got nervous for nothing."

As the avatar of Thunder God descended to envelop his body, the thug pointed at him with a dazed expression.

"Hey, you... there's electricity flowing through your body."

"I know."

The western beach of the island flashed with light.

One minute later.

"P-please spare us. We were wrong."

Five people with twisted limbs lay convulsing on the beach, moving their mouths.

"You guys."

As Nade approached, they wriggled like live fish.

"Eek! S-sorry!"

"Let me ask you something. Has a woman named Pena come here? She's a bit shorter than me, thin build. Starting from three days ago in local time."

"N-no. We haven't seen her."

Even after answering, the leader anxiously raised his head.

"We really haven't seen any woman. There's another arrival point besides here, she probably went there."

"There's another one?"

"Y-yes. The eastern beach."

Shirone asked, "Who's guarding that place?"

"N-nobody. We control both the east and west sides completely. There's no one else."

Eden asked, "What are you controlling?"

"Uh, well... the garbage here."

Shirone looked around at his friends.

"They're probably bandits who only target beginners. There were types like this in High Gear too, called Tenmen."

Nade frowned.

"They're everywhere, aren't they? People who step on others trying to do something from the very beginning. How pathetic."

The thug's pride was hurt, but he couldn't show his twisted face to Nade.

Shirone asked, "What's the reason for living in a place with only garbage? There should be living spaces inside the island."

"That's a lawless zone. Three major gangs control it, and if you get caught, you really can't even find your bones."

Eden said, "Red Union. Desperado. Johan Cartel."

Nade turned his head.

"You know them?"

"The emblems tattooed on both arms of that man. They're fairly well-known criminal organizations in reality too."

"I've never heard of them."

"You guys who operate globally naturally wouldn't know. They call themselves criminal organizations, but they're basically just corporate thugs. They set up in small cities and throw their weight around. Shirone might know them though."

"Yeah. Even though I've never met them directly."

Omega remained.

"Because I assist with police work during missionary activities, I know this scene a bit. Don't think of them on the scale of world-class top 10 guilds like the Parrot Mercenary Group. There are hardly any strong people, and unofficial 10th-grade mages would have some power."

"Pack dogs."

Eden looked back at the leader.

"But their cruelty is second to none. Having three emblems tattooed means he betrayed organizations and moved around. In other words, these guys fled here."

Iruki said, "Actually, that works out well. If we just rob the gangs, we can get the information we're looking for."

"Oh? Come to think of it..."

Nade approached the kneeling leader and touched the top of his head.

"You know everything about the three major gangs, don't you?"

"Y-yes."

Already feeling electricity flow, the leader squeezed his eyes shut and answered.
