[643] Dead End (3)

A star orbiting intelligence, and the satellite that orbits and assists that star.

When faced with a card too dangerous to carry around as a joke, Lehman fell silent as a mute who had swallowed honey.

'The Ivory Tower? No, why would the Ivory Tower come here?'

While he didn't dare ask, Olivia stepped forward.

"I am Olivia, the vice principal of this school. What business do you have with Shirone?"

"It's nothing particularly major. It's something that happens all over the world at this time of year."

Arte, bowing slightly at the waist, brought his face close to Shirone.

"Congratulations. You've entered the candidate pool to receive the title of Star from the Ivory Tower."

"Whaaaat?"

Not only the advanced class students but even the graduating class students' eyes went wide with shock.

The three massive lines that divide the magical world.

The fact that there was a White Line besides Black and Red was something anyone aspiring to be a mage would know.

But because that place was the Ivory Tower, they only accepted it as knowledge, and expecting it to have any connection to their own lives was something only students who enjoyed delusions would do.

Knowing this fact, Olivia asked with a dazed expression.

"Shirone... are you saying he's the most outstanding among graduates worldwide?"

Though she didn't know the Ivory Tower's selection criteria, throughout history, those who could receive the title of Star had always been the best in some field.

Therefore, if they were deciding on a candidate among students, it should rightfully be the best among graduates.

"This time it's a bit different. The first place is somewhat ambiguous. That's why I'm calling it a candidate pool. Shirone has ranked 4th by the Ivory Tower's standards and will take a simple test along with 2nd and 3rd place to see if he's suitable to receive the title of Star."

"4th place..."

Being ranked by the Ivory Tower meant he was the fourth most outstanding among graduates worldwide.

'Shirone, you really are a monster.'

Having witnessed the graduation exam with their own eyes, there could be no disagreement, and the next thought that came to mind was that there were three more people who had ranked higher than such a Shirone.

"Let's discuss the details in a separate setting. Originally, selection is work done by 2-star residents, but since they're currently in orbit, I had to come unavoidably."

Though his tone was gentle, it was also a request not to take up too much of a 3-star resident's time.

"Shall we go then?"

When Arte raised his fan to point at the school building, Shirone looked back at his friends.

Without anyone taking the lead, they all nodded, and Nade pointed his finger while mouthing words silently.

'What are you doing! Go quickly, you idiot!'

That earnest expression made him nod automatically.

"Yes, I understand."

Arte was about to turn around with a pleased smile when Lehman, who had been watching the situation, stepped forward.

"Please wait a moment."

Though the voice came from behind him, Arte didn't turn around and spread his fan to cover his face.

Just that alone was enough to sense he was slightly annoyed.

"What is it?"

"No matter how much it's the Ivory Tower, isn't this the wrong order? Currently, Shirone is a criminal who committed a serious crime in the kingdom..."

"Hah."

Arte, who had quietly exhaled through his mouth, slowly raised the fan that had been covering his face.

"Wind Chime."

Ding-a-ling.

A clear bell sound reached Shirone's ears.

It was far too grand to be coming from the small bell at the tip of the fan, and everyone seemed to have the same thought as their expressions stiffened.

'Time is...'

In the feeling that it was slowing down, only Arte's right arm holding the fan was moving.

"Executive! It's dangerous!"

Sensing killing intent, the guards passed in front of Lehman and drew their swords at the same time the fan made a whoosh sound, pushing wind backward.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

As a tremendous gale struck, the swordsmen stabbed their swords into the ground.

Rather than wind, it felt like a wall was rushing in, and it felt like flesh was being pushed back and torn from bone.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

They tried to endure with the pride of the royal palace guard, but it wasn't wind power that humans could handle, so eventually they all lifted off the ground and flew away beyond the sky.

The gecko hanging on Arte's shoulder brought both hands to its eyes and watched the scene of grass, trees, humans, and carriages all disappearing beyond the horizon.

Nothing remained in the place where the gale had swept through.

Even the teachers couldn't close their gaping mouths at the power that had blown away even single blades of grass, and shivers ran down Shirone's spine as he watched from right in front.

'Blow-type magic.'

But could this really be called Blow-type?

It wasn't wind but a typhoon, and it wasn't strange that Gaold came to mind at the different dimension of magical power.

"No matter how much it's the Ivory Tower, I don't repeat myself."

When Arte fluttered his fan with an unpleasant expression, a small bell sound was heard.

Though it was an act separate from magic, just hearing the jingling sound made the students flinch and hunch their shoulders.

"It seems the message wasn't properly conveyed. Let me say it again. Mr. Shirone has entered the candidate pool to receive the title of Star from the Ivory Tower."

It was exactly the same story as before, but this time it was properly conveyed.

"Let's go. I have 187 problems that occurred in this world that need to be resolved. I hope Mr. Shirone can reduce it to 186 as quickly as possible."

With a feeling he couldn't refuse, Shirone slowly nodded, and Arte turned his body at exactly a right angle and walked toward Alpheus.

"May I use a conference room?"

"By all means."

From the school's perspective, if the Ivory Tower stepped in, it would reduce the burden of resolving Shirone's matter.

However, what was concerning was the expression 'candidate pool' rather than a clear candidate.

'Perhaps this might be Shirone's only opportunity.'

Watching Shirone and his friends entering following Arte, Alpheus prayed earnestly.

'Please let him be able to grasp this rope.'

Entering the conference room, Shirone looked back at his friends from in front of the door and gauged Arte's mood.

"Um, excuse me, but could my friends come along too?"

They had promised to help when negotiations began.

"Oh, no. We can wait outside."

Quick-witted Amy waved both hands, but Arte didn't care as long as it could end quickly.

"It doesn't matter if it helps with judgment. Please sit."

Getting the opportunity to sit with a Star of the Ivory Tower was more difficult than having an audience with a king, so Amy, Iruki, and Nade entered the conference room with excited expressions.

When Shirone sat across from Arte, the gecko jumped down onto the table and waddled over.

The gecko, with its spear-like tail curved over beyond its face, smiled with expectant wrinkles around its eyes.

"Nice to meet you. You certainly seem different from what I confirmed in your profile."

It was unclear whether this was meant in a good or bad way.

"Ah, yes. Nice to meet you."

When Shirone carefully grabbed the tail, the gecko nodded as if that was the correct answer.

In that state, Shirone asked Arte.

"You mentioned an evaluation. Will I be taking a test?"

"Don't worry. It's not particularly a difficult test. What's really difficult is that your two competitors have higher Kar values than you, Mr. Shirone."

"Kar values?"

"Let me explain from the beginning. The most accurate delivery is the fastest."

When the gecko wiggled its tail, blue glowing text was inscribed in the air.

It was the records of 1st through 4th place from the documents Taesung had received.

Arte looked at it and said.

"This is the record collected by the Ivory Tower. 1st place is, as you can see, La Enemy. Kar value is 98.7 percent. Originally, this person should receive the title of Star, but..."

Arte paused to give time, and Shirone and his friends slowly examined the records.

It was certainly much higher than 2nd place Daria Nane's 89.4 percent.

"La Enemy... Wait, did you say La Enemy?"

When Shirone, suddenly realizing, turned his gaze, Arte nodded.

"Yes. It's the previous life of Ankera whom you, Mr. Shirone, erased. Temporally it could be considered a later life, but the Ivory Tower sees his incarnation as belonging to the previous life. That's probably why there's still no special movement from heaven."

Shirone spoke with a serious expression.

"But if Ra has been born, an incident will break out soon. Is there any countermeasure?"

"Well. That would be something for humans to handle themselves."

Arte added while fluttering his fan.

"The final war is certainly an important event for humanity, but it's not something that would capture the attention of all Ivory Tower residents. That's the case for someone like me. Of course, some Stars do seem to be paying attention."

It was difficult to understand.

"If war breaks out, humanity could be destroyed, couldn't it?"

"It's not about life and death. What the Ivory Tower values is the world's balance. I see war as rather a process of restoring balance."

Seeing Shirone frown as if displeased, Arte tapped the table with his fan.

"I'm not opposing your thoughts, Mr. Shirone. If you're interested in this direction, you could become a Star and work in the Humanity Safety Enforcement Department. In any case, since we too are human, we'd like to take humanity's side as much as possible."

It was a strangely chilling statement.

Since this was an interview at the world's top workplace, Amy changed the subject to prevent conflict between the two.

"So what exactly is this Kar value?"

"It's the Ivory Tower's standard for finding those suitable to be Stars. It's a metaphysical concept that's difficult to explain in words, but if I had to define it, I'd call it perfection."

Iruki tilted his head.

"Isn't everything relative? What exactly is the standard for perfection?"

"There's no standard. Perfection is simply... perfect."

It was a concept that seemed understandable yet difficult to dig into.

In any case, if that meant perfection, Shirone's 88.9 percent was remarkable.

'It means he's almost perfect.'

That's probably why he could rise to the Ivory Tower's candidate pool.

'But...'

Amy's gaze turned to the names Daria Nane and Jin Seongeum.

If a woman with the surname Jin was from the Jincheon Empire, she'd be royalty, and the child named Nane was a whole 0.5 percent closer to perfection than Shirone.

"What kind of competition will Shirone have with them?"

"With Ra's incarnation previous life, the Ivory Tower made an exceptional decision. We're giving an opportunity to the top three people within a 0.5 percent Kar value range. It's simple. Just..."

Everyone's attention focused on Arte's lips.

"Find La Enemy."

"Find... Ra?"

"Yes. There's no time limit, and the method doesn't matter. Find Ra and return to the Ivory Tower, and you become a Star."

He spoke as if it were as easy as breathing, but it wasn't a simple matter.

Even if they set out to search, they had no idea where to even begin.

Nade asked bluntly.

"Aren't you just passing off work under the pretext of a test? Telling Shirone to find what even the Ivory Tower can't find."

"Hahaha! That's also correct. Currently, there are 27 residents with the title of Star in the Ivory Tower. Due to the nature of traveling around the world, we're very short on manpower."

"No, just because you're short on manpower..."

"But Shirone."

Arte interrupted Nade's words and leaned forward.

"Becoming a Star means gaining absolute authority that transcends nations. Even kings must follow the standards you present."

That was exactly what the Ivory Tower was.

"If you can't even find Ra, you can't receive the title of Star. How about it? If you'll take the test, I'll contact headquarters."

Shirone, who had been lost in thought with half-closed eyes, raised his head.

"No. I won't go to the Ivory Tower."

"Wh-what?"

His friends stared at him with bewildered eyes, but Shirone was unwavering.

"Hmm."

The gecko scratched its chin with a meaningful smile, and Arte's eyes flashed coldly as he covered his mouth with his fan.

'As expected, the candidates are...'

Close to perfect.
