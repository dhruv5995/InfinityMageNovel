[658] Mercenary Recruitment (2)

"Master, you were wrong."

Breaking free from his reminiscence, Chagall murmured toward the night sky.

He was a serial killer by circumstance.

Perhaps that's why tonight's starless sky seemed even more sorrowful.

As he lowered his magic sword and his hand brushed up along his body, a newly sharpened dagger was suddenly gripped in his palm.

The unique weapon of a rapid-fire swordsman - 23 blades layered like shells.

Looking at a tree 10 meters away, La Enemy's face flickered like a phantom in his eyes.

When he swung his arm vertically, one shell separated from the dagger and embedded in the tree with a thud.

It was precisely where La Enemy's forehead would be.

As he swung his arm upward again, another shell shot out and went exactly into the shell already embedded in the tree.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

A blade flew with each swing of his hand, and finally his arm began moving back and forth at invisible speed.

Thudthudthudthud! Thudthudthudthud!

The tree shook as the rapidly fired blades overlapped at the same spot, and when Chagall threw the final dagger after launching all 22 blades, the trunk was pierced through with a thud.

The recombined dagger fell to the ground just like when first thrown, and the tree, pierced through its center, creaked and toppled to the side.

"I said you were wrong, Master."

Chagall was a serial killer by circumstance.

And he was the worst of the worst.

The next morning.

Leaving the inn, Sirone took the commission letter stamped with Brooks' seal and entered the street where guilds were concentrated.

Even from morning, countless people were coming and going, all experts who had honed special skills.

"This is definitely the capital. It doesn't compare to regional guilds."

The headquarters of numerous guilds - mages, swordsmen, travelers, alchemists, blacksmiths - were competing by building higher floors.

"It works out well for us. We don't have much time."

Even a month wouldn't be enough to recruit the 20-member mercenary group Rufist demanded one by one.

"When he said to handle it ourselves, he probably meant just meeting the numbers, but I'd prefer to form an elite group if possible."

Since even the kingdom hadn't been able to deal with Radum until now, it was a mission where lives couldn't be guaranteed.

The mercenary group's cutoff line would be those capable of saving themselves even in the worst situations.

"First, let's finish the commission we received."

Sirone and Rian headed toward the Silvering Guild headquarters without conversation, as if by agreement.

Someone was tailing them.

After traveling through numerous danger zones and crossing the line between life and death multiple times, human nerves become as sharp as a cat's.

Rian identified several alien gazes among the many watching eyes, while Sirone, with Elision activated, confirmed the presence of a tail maintaining a certain distance and matching their speed.

"Who could it be?"

"Well. If word spread about us subjugating the bandit group, it could be anyone."

Rian only turned his gaze sideways without disrupting his movements.

"Should we catch them and beat them up?"

"No. They won't act in a crowded place. Neither will we. Anyway, with the Ultima System, we won't be caught off guard."

Since Elision had no Spirit Zone boundary, even if the opponent was a Zoner, they wouldn't notice.

With the uncomfortable gaze trailing them, the two arrived at the Silvering Guild headquarters and looked up at the building rising six stories high.

While it couldn't compare to the Magic Association, it had an imposing presence befitting one of the kingdom's three major guilds.

"Let's go in."

Just as Sirone walked toward the entrance, Rian's eyebrows twitched and he whipped his head around.

'They're coming!'

Two people with hooded faces were running through the crowd toward them.

'Surely not here?'

In the unexpected situation, Sirone took a defensive stance and Rian grabbed his greatsword's handle, when the two tails rummaged in their pockets and shouted:

"Now! Begin!"

'Damn! Assassination tools?'

Just as Rian drew his greatsword intending to cut them down before they could draw anything, the guild doors burst open.

"Welcome! New members of the Silvering Guild!"

A beautiful manager who emerged from the guild knelt on one knee offering a bouquet, while two burly men quickly spread out left and right, unfurling a banner.

While Sirone made a bewildered expression upon seeing the words 'Arian Sirone Silvering Guild Membership Celebration,' their tails pulled out paper poppers and set them off.

With popping sounds, colorful paper scattered everywhere, and Rian's greatsword stopped just before completely slicing through the two men's torsos.

"Eek!"

The mage who realized too late fell backwards with a thud, his hood coming off.

It was a young face.

A girl of similar age who had been tailing with him hurriedly helped him up.

"Are you okay?"

"Huh? Ahaha! Of course! I just slipped!"

Though it was a surprise welcome, Rian, Sirone's sword, was only displeased.

"What are you guys?"

The boy dusted himself off and stood up, extending his hand to Rian for a handshake.

"You must be startled. I apologize. I'm Tyler, a mage affiliated with the Silvering Guild."

"I'm Elsa."

Following Tyler, Elsa bowed with a bright smile, but the already tense nerves didn't easily calm down.

"Sirone, let's go inside first. Commotion isn't good."

"Yeah."

Sirone crossed the guild's threshold without showing emotion.

Over twenty people sat at their respective tables, all with sharp auras.

While it was unclear how many licensed mages were mixed in, it was clearly a gathering of those who had crossed the line between life and death.

"Now, now! The rookie who appeared like a miracle at the Silvering Guild - Arian Sirone!"

When Michela, the manager of the Silvering Guild headquarters, tried to encourage cheers, applause came from a few tables.

From the guild's perspective, Sirone was a big catch they couldn't let anyone else have, but to them he was a potential competitor, so the clapping lacked soul.

"That's too much. Jealousy among guild members isn't good."

At the voice from the stairs, the mages turned irritably.

A long-haired man in a bat-like black robe with red flame embroidery at the hem was walking down.

It was Arkman, master of the Silvering Guild.

"Master, before talking about jealousy, shouldn't you maintain fairness?"

A bearded giant who absolutely didn't look like a mage grumbled.

News had already come from the Kentra branch, and information about destroying five bandit groups had also arrived through Austin at dawn, but the bearded man wasn't the only one displeased with the guild's abandonment of dignity as one of the kingdom's three major guilds to welcome a single rookie.

"That's right! Let's say we acknowledge the skill! But how long do you think a mage who's even a candidate for the Ivory Tower will stay with our guild? In the end, he'll just betray us or cause discord!"

Trust was only possible between equals.

Considering the relationship between the guild and Sirone, the guild had nothing to give Sirone while there was too much they could gain.

"Hey, rookie! Answer me! Can you really give your all to the Silvering Guild? Can you fight with a sense of belonging and responsibility?"

The bearded man pointed and shouted.

A Veteran A guild rank was a vastly senior position to a rookie, but several mages watched Sirone's reaction.

Sirone had no intention of staying with the guild long, and as silence continued, the bearded man slammed the table.

"See that! He can't say anything! This is just a ridiculous show! I can't accept it."

As the bearded man packed up to leave, Arkman called out.

"Con, today is a gathering to welcome a new member. Staying as a senior is also courtesy."

"Hmph! What courtesy! He'll be gone soon anyway..."

"Shut up and sit down."

At the blatant killing intent, Con's shoulders flinched and he slunk back to his seat.

'How foolish.'

How could the guild master not know that Sirone couldn't be held?

'If we let Sirone go like this...'

The competing guilds War Chariot and Blood Rose would try to recruit Sirone by any means necessary.

War Chariot was belligerent so they'd lose in force, while Blood Rose, mostly female mages, excelled at honey traps.

What Silvering could offer was financial power, but at the level of an Ivory Tower candidate, it felt lacking.

"I apologize for the guild member's rudeness."

"No, it's fine. He's not wrong."

Arkman nodded at the honest statement and called Sirone to where everyone could see.

"Well then, let's begin the welcome ceremony."

Amid everyone's complex emotions, he knelt before Sirone and bowed his head.

"Please become the new master of the Silvering Guild."

Con's eyes widened.

"Master! Why?"

At this common sense-breaking event, the guild members finally realized the seriousness of the situation and stirred.

Who was Arkman?

He was the pride of the Silvering Guild, a flame mage who reached unofficial 4th class, a figure recognized by name even in mage society.

Only manager Michela knew Arkman's true intention in the guild.

'Show maximum goodwill. That's the first strategy.'

Even for an Ivory Tower candidate, rookie rank couldn't be arbitrarily adjusted by the master.

The only method was promotion to master.

Of course, it was unprecedented in guild history, but that made the effect more remarkable.

'If he accepts becoming master, we'll go through verification procedures. If he doesn't accept...'

Con asked again.

"Master, are you serious? This is unprecedented."

"An Ivory Tower candidate joining was also unprecedented."

That ended all objections.

But what Sirone wanted was simply to quickly form a 20-member mercenary group in cooperation with the guild.

"I refuse."

Killing intent appeared in the guild members' eyes.

The reason for desperately climbing from rookie to senior to veteran was ultimately to dream of becoming guild master.

While the opportunity wasn't given to everyone, such dreams of advancement were their driving force for living.

'Doesn't he even think it's worth considering?'

While Arkman had considered the possibility of refusal since Sirone could receive the same offer from other guilds, giving an immediate answer was honestly shocking.

"Then how about making an oath? That you won't join other mage guilds within the Tormia Kingdom."

Calculating rationally, there was no reason for Sirone to accept.

"I don't want to do that either."

"This damn bastard! So you're planning to betray us after all!"

Arkman raised his hand to stop the guild member, stood up, and spoke to the manager.

"Michela, turn off the mana control device."

If he couldn't hold onto him no matter what, giving up would be natural, but he still had something to confirm.

"Sirone, it's become a stubborn situation, but as guild master there are points I can't concede. While it may be a simple choice for you, it's our livelihood. If you go to another guild, dozens of guild members will suffer massive losses. You just need to make an oath."

"I don't want to concede more than trust. I won't leave without special reason. However, I can't accept oaths or the master position. This is as far as I can offer."

When Arkman gave a signal, Michela swallowed nervously and flipped the switch on the mana control device.

'Qualification to receive the Star title.'

How could Arkman not dream of the highest honor for a mage?

'To a mere twenty-year-old boy...'

Beyond the issue of feeding guild members, something else ignited his heart.

Personal ambition - the once-in-a-lifetime challenge of one who had reached unofficial 4th class mage.

'I want to know what difference there really is.'

As Arkman deployed his Spirit Zone, the flames embroidered on his robe's hem rippled as if alive.

'Mage equipment. An option for flame magic?'

If it was equipment used by a master of the three major guilds, it certainly wouldn't be commonly available.

"Sirone, should I handle this?"

"No, it's fine."

Wounded in pride by their conversation, Arkman ignited flames from his feet upward.

"Then excuse my rudeness..."

"Master, surely you're not really going to here..."

Before Con could finish, the hellfire surrounding Arkman burst forward.

"He actually did it!"

Startled guild members ducked under tables as the guild's front door exploded along with the wall.
