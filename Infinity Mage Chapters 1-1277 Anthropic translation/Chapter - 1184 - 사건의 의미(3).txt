The Meaning of the Incident (3)

Ymir's psyche, deep layer 1.5.

"Live on."

Kang Nan said.

"You don't have to stay by my side, so do whatever you want to do. I'll never resent you for it."

What Ymir's Ultima realized when 10 billion eyes penetrated the 1.5 layer was:

'This is a man who has lived a life I cannot imagine.'

It was Gaold's abnormal self-discipline and his obsession with Miro.

'Sein must think the same.'

Since Miro had chosen Gaold, their father-daughter relationship was now nothing more than hollow sentiment.

Sein's family came to Kang Nan's house.

"So you were here."

After taking down the Tamo organization, business flowed smoothly, but they had closed shop.

'Spot the difference.'

The boundary between dream and reality had become clear, and now all that remained was a matter of choice.

"I've decided to live here."

Kang Nan said.

"It's a conclusion I reached after much thought. I've realized how painful reality is. I'm going to live here."

Sein couldn't object either.

While Arius whined, Miro approached Gaold, who was sitting at the dining table.

"Are you feeling better?"

Though he had only briefly tasted the pain of reality, Gaold had been in shock for quite some time.

"...Yeah."

"Since Kang Nan and Dad gave their permission, it's over now. How nice. You got a pretty little bride like me."

Little bride.

Gaold, who had been quietly holding his cigarette, asked.

"Aren't you going to ask for my opinion?"

"What's there to ask? I know how persistent you are now, mister. Why, don't you like it?"

It would be awkward for anyone else, but for Miro to know the real-world Gaold was strange.

"Ah, I get it. Mister, you're going crazy having to wait until I become an adult, right?"

Gaold put out his cigarette.

"Don't be ridiculous, kid. If you knew how I've lived, you'd just keep your mouth shut."

Miro knew too.

That Gaold was the person who endured 20 years in a hell of terrible pain.

'Yes, this is right.'

With Miro making this compromise, the world became perfect, and Ymir would not be able to penetrate it.

Sein asked.

"By the way... what about Shirone?"

Since that day, Shirone had fallen into sleep and was maintaining slumber as if dead.

Mong-ah, standing next to Ruber, said.

"We've tried various methods, but it's no use. Even if it's a dream within a dream, approach should be possible..."

"There was a condition."

Ruber said.

"The fact that even a Dream Keeper cannot access the dream must only be the case when the Dream Keeper has given approval, wouldn't you think?"

Kang Nan asked.

"Have you given approval before?"

"Long ago..."

He had once accepted a proposal from a man now called the First Yora.

"The condition is simple. He said he had a story to tell someone who shared the same ideals. It's called an Inheritance Dream. This dream might revive his will, but..."

That was unknown.

"When will he wake up?"

"I don't know. Time isn't important in dreams. It's a matter of how much information gets processed. When all the data from the Inheritance Dream is transmitted, the dream within the dream will end."

At that moment, Shirone suddenly arched his back like a bow and his arms trembled.

"Five Great Stars!"

Mong-ah checked, but there was no consciousness.

"What's happening?"

Watching Shirone, who was almost convulsing, Ruber wore a serious expression.

'The Five Great Stars aren't affected by simultaneous events in dreams. Therefore, what's being affected is...'

The demon sword Armand.

The ability integrated under the name Material was acting strongly in reality.

"Convulsions?"

Just what kind of power was it that the unconscious master was suffering this much?

Ruber looked up at the sky of the 1.5 layer world.

'What are you doing?'

Glaring at the sun, Shirone gritted his teeth.

"Graaaah!"

An enormous amount of material was pouring out from between his spread palms.

Material that transcended human knowledge withstood even the harsh cosmic environment.

'I can't complete it all at once. First, I'll create a ring-shaped framework that encompasses the sun's diameter...'

Construction progress: 0.00134 percent.

Work efficiency reached approximately 64 billion man-months, but reaching even 1 percent progress seemed distant.

'I have to do it.'

If God's law takes effect, this universe will meet its end as one of many bubbles.

Solar wind struck.

"Grrk!"

Once again the law twisted, and the aftermath was immediately perceived through simultaneous events.

'It's okay. Mom will buy time.'

If he could finish within that time.

As he increased Material's power, the boundary where matter was output glowed red-hot.

Machine devices that assembled at light speed upon creation raced through outer space.

The aftermath of the final adjustment directly hit the Pyramid of Truth in the Paras Kingdom.

As the characters on the walls were replaced with new concepts, another wave of Human Baptism surged in.

"Aaaaah! No! I said no!"

Glen, a priest of the Rami religion, desperately held onto his mind that seemed ready to break.

"I... I love Lucia..."

Glen's cause.

What Lucia dismissed as a simple memory was an event that changed the outcome of Glen's life.

Born into a poor family, Glen had to live a harsh life from childhood.

A ray of light shone when Glen's parents began believing in the Rami religion.

Fortunately, he was able to enter a monastery, where he met Lucia's family.

"Hello? I'm Lucia."

"Oh... right. I'm Glen. Nice to meet you."

The two seventeen-year-olds quickly opened their hearts to each other, but their parents' circumstances were a bit more complicated.

It was missionary day at the monastery.

"Glen, mother. Thank you for coming despite being busy. May Cria God's grace be with you."

Lucia's mother, a priest, was kind to everyone, and Glen's mother liked her too.

"No need to thank me. It's something that should naturally be done."

Even then, Glen and Lucia formed a team together to evangelize to the townspeople.

Lucia's mother smiled.

"Those two are always together. It's nice to see. Glen is truly an outstanding young man."

He shouldn't have heard it.

'Back then, I shouldn't have heard those words.'

No parent would feel bad about their child being praised, so Glen's mother also brightened up.

"Lucia is really kind and virtuous. They say at the monastery that she's potential chief priest material."

"Oh no. Chief priest, what are you saying."

"I hope both Glen and Lucia do well. Maybe later when they grow up, if the two of them get together..."

The words stopped there.

Because she saw anger dwelling in the eyes of Lucia's mother, who was always good-natured.

"Oh, I spoke out of turn..."

"Glen's mother, please never say such things again. Even if we're fellow believers, please respect the boundaries."

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

Glen couldn't bear to watch his mother bow her head any longer and turned away.

Lucia asked.

"Glen, what's wrong?"

"It's nothing."

"Nothing? Your face is full of anger. Did I do something wrong?"

"Lucia."

Glen clenched his fists.

"I'm not feeling well. I'm going to go in and rest."

As time passed, the emotions faded, but the wound carved in Glen's heart did not heal.

"No!"

Glen clutched his head.

"Just for such a petty reason, I tried to have Lucia? I... I truly loved her!"

Love, a beautiful word.

"Why are you tempting me! Do you think I'll be swayed by something like this? I'm a priest of the Rami religion!"

Just because something sounds beautiful, how much do we turn away from?

"Oh God, look down upon me! Drive this devil's cunning away from me!"

Praying Glen heard voices.

Glen, Glen.

"I believe in God. Please save me."

There is no devil.

"Sob! Have mercy on me and... sob! I entrust everything to you..."

Is it not the result of what you have done?

"Aaaaah! Aaaaah!"

Bodily fluids streamed from the eyes, nose, and mouth of Glen, who had buried his head in the ground.

It was the night he returned to the monastery.

"Glen, what's wrong? You haven't spoken to me since earlier. You need to tell me what's going on."

"Go away! Just leave me alone!"

Glen shouted angrily.

"...Okay. Let's talk tomorrow. Good night."

Hearing Lucia's footsteps as she left, Glen swept away all the objects in his room.

"Damn bastards!"

His anger still wasn't resolved.

"Right, I'm poor. The idea of someone like me having their daughter is disgusting, right? But you know what? Lucia likes me. If I, if I put my mind to it...!"

Glen lifted his chin.

"I could ruin her right now. Make sure she can never dream of being chief priest for the rest of her life..."

"No!"

The moment Glen shouted, countless characters on the surrounding walls began to glow.

"You bastard! Why are you doing this to me! I really love her now! Back then I was just so angry..."

Then events began to overlap.

"Aaaaah!"

He slammed his head against the wall but didn't die, and that was Glen's last act of defiance.

"Hrgrgrgr! Hrgrgrg!"

He made countless choices, but the more he did, the more his life fell apart.

"Hrrrrr!"

Glen finally realized.

'I'm disappearing.'

From human (人間) to merely person (人).

Just as he felt his skull opening, a familiar voice came from down the corridor.

"Glen!"

Lucia was running toward him.

"Glen! There you were! Do you know how long I've been looking...!"

"Graaaah!"

Glen, making beast-like sounds, jumped up and grabbed Lucia's throat.

"Die! Just die!"

"Gl-Glen..."

Glen's face, looking down at her as she lay on the floor, was distorted like a beast's.

"You didn't love me! You regretted it! Because you were with me that night, you had no choice but to accept it!"

"No."

Lucia had also received Human Baptism, so she knew what Glen was talking about.

"We were too young! I was just scared! I love you now! Really, Glen!"

"Die!"

As he pressed on her throat, Lucia grabbed Glen.

'God's Right Hand.'

She could stir and change human hearts like water, but it rarely worked.

'He's lost his heart.'

"Die! Die! Die!"

As Glen put his full body weight on both hands, she had no choice but to use her last resort.

'Devil's Left Hand.'

Just grabbing his shoulder for a brief moment twisted Glen's body like a pretzel.

As Glen fell to the side writhing in pain, Lucia checked on him again.

"Glen! Are you okay? Pull yourself together!"

"Grrrrr..."

As his twisted body groaned, footsteps came from the darkness behind.

"Miss Eufra."

Lucia turned to see the Great Swordsman Eufra walking toward them with unfocused eyes.

He slowly raised his sword and said.

"Everything is according to God's will..."

Humans who lose their cause become mere artifacts, OOParts.

"God is waiting for us!"

Just as the sword was about to cut Lucia's head, a mass of light flew in from the side.

Thud—Eufra was slammed into the wall, and Shirone appeared from around the corner.

"Miss Lucia! Are you okay?"

"Ah..."

The moment she saw Shirone's eyes, which contained human emotion, she shed tears.

"Yahweh."

It was a heart unshaken by law.
