[665] Insufficient Five Senses (4)

Having interpreted Mayray's language through the Ultima System, Shirone felt a chilling coldness.

Though she hadn't pointed to any specific person, it felt as if La Enemy was whispering directly to him.

'The hell within me.'

La Enemy was waiting there.

While there was room for interpretation, this was crucial information for passing the Ivory Tower's test.

"What kind of ability is God's Frequency?"

"Terapos, whom the Gallon Kingdom believes in, is a conqueror of countless universes. According to doctrine, they came from a place much farther than the universe we live in."

The reason this couldn't be dismissed as mere mythology was that Shirone himself had actually been to heaven.

'Could it be the Gaians?'

While such a thought wasn't unreasonable, he immediately shook his head.

'No, it can't be them.'

The Gaians had already left the photon system, and their species' history had concluded with the departure of the last remaining Guffin.

"Terapos's oracles come through dreams. I too have been receiving oracles since I was seven years old."

Mayray explained while mixing in hand gestures.

"The place where I receive oracles in dreams is always the same. A dark place. Nothing can be seen. Then a vertical line of light opens, and within it is the silhouette of a god."

Mayray lowered her hands.

"When I wake from the dream, most memories disappear and only a few simple pieces of information remain. When the priest conveys that information, the people of Terapos follow it."

"But it's just a dream in the end, isn't it? How do you prove it's real?"

"Religion isn't a matter of proof. Actually, even in Gallon, heretics who reject the oracles are plotting revolution. The Papal authority is so strong that they're not much of a threat though. Anyway, the problem starts from now."

Mayray drew everyone's attention again.

"The reason I became a heretic and left Gallon was because my ability exceeded the Pope's authority. I fell asleep as usual with the feeling that I would receive an oracle. Sure enough, that space appeared in my dream. And when the door of light opened..."

Mayray spoke with a serious expression.

"I woke up from the dream."

"You... woke up from the dream?"

"Perhaps even that was a dream, but certainly all my senses told me it was reality. That's when I realized that all the dreams I thought were oracles were actually real."

Shirone gulped.

"The door of light opened wide and they approached. I don't remember their appearance, only blurry images. They examined me closely and then conversed in strange signals. I didn't know at the time, but now I do. It probably meant something like 'This one is rather peculiar.'"

Mayray's voice began to tremble.

"They tried many things on me. I screamed in terror and then lost consciousness. When I came to again, I was lying on something like an operating table. When I screamed to be saved, they said again: 'Really peculiar. Why does it wake up?'"

Mayray composed herself again.

"Then I woke from sleep. I was lying on my bed in my room, but by then I already knew the reality."

"Couldn't it really have been just a dream?"

Mayray turned her head and lifted her hair above her ear.

Where hair didn't grow, there remained the mark of an incision.

"I checked immediately after waking from the dream. I don't know what they did to me, but they probably implanted something."

Mayray covered both ears with her hands.

"This is an ability I've had since then. When I block my hearing, I can collect sounds of specific frequencies."

This was the true nature of Mayray's irregular formula, God's Frequency.

"Actually, just covering my ears can't completely block sound, so there's a bit of noise mixed in. I think if I cut off my ears, I could hear more clearly, but Mr. Lufist opposed it, saying communication with others would become difficult."

Shirone already thought it would be a waste to give up the advantage of communication by removing her ears.

"Did Mr. Lufist tell you about me?"

"He helped me seek asylum from Gallon to Tormia. He said if I joined forces with Mr. Shirone, it might be possible to eliminate La Enemy. The reason I gained this ability might also be part of Terapos's design."

It seemed better to discuss the rest with Lufist.

"Understood. Thank you for your hard work."

Since Mayray also knew she had passed anyway, she left the evaluation room without saying anything more.

Aria removed her glasses and said:

"What an absurd story. Both La Enemy and Terapos."

This was information that ordinary people would never have the chance to access.

"But it's reality. If we can't stop it, crisis will befall the place we live."

Aria too, as a Tormia official, recognized the severity of the situation.

"Right. For now, forming a mercenary group shouldn't be a problem. Let's notify the applicants individually and have a meeting in the evening."

That night.

The core members gathered in Shirone's room.

With Lian and Aria in attendance, Etela, Quan, and Mayray entered in turn.

Finally, applicants number 28 and 29 entered and removed their masks, and naturally no one was surprised.

"You assembled quite well. The list of successful candidates, I mean."

Lufist, who first praised Shirone, explained.

"You probably know roughly, but this mission has two key objectives. First, close Radum. Second, understand La Enemy's intentions and eliminate them if possible."

Etela raised her hand and asked:

"Where is Shagal?"

"The association is searching but his identity hasn't been confirmed. He either left the kingdom or is in Radum - one of the two."

"He must be in Radum."

Shagal was a figure corresponding to the aftermath of the Great Purification.

If he had followed La Enemy's traces all the way to Tormia, his destination was already determined.

"I'll handle Shagal. There's something I want to confirm."

Though she might have to kill him, Etela didn't use the word revenge.

"Permission granted. However, he's a guy worth using. You know that without me saying it."

"I have a question about that."

Shirone asked.

"You said eliminate if possible, but what method?"

"I'll explain from now on."

Lufist moved to where everyone could see him.

"We're protecting the personal safety of Venezia, the head of Spectrum. According to her, La seems to exert influence on Radum's organization by controlling the past. That's why the kingdom made the decision to close it despite the risks."

This was understandable so far.

"Then how will we find La? First, La exists only as past events. Shirone, what's your definition of the past?"

"Um, before a specific event, perhaps?"

"That's not wrong either. But I want to define it a bit more specifically. The past is memories of the five senses."

"Ah."

"Everything we experience is reconstructed through the five senses and recorded in the brain. Therefore, the way La Enemy controls the past also cannot extend beyond the five senses."

"Because it exceeds human limitations."

Lufist nodded.

"Now, what if you could feel past sensations as reality? That would be reality. Time is also just one way the human brain perceives the world."

That's why Immortal Function was possible.

"Venezia pointed this out with the Tribrain race's ability. To conclude, the past can become reality in any number of ways depending on how it's perceived. Therefore, La is not a specter without substance. It's just that it exists in the past."

Lufist raised his index finger.

"It merely exists in the past. Shirone, La might have been in this room just a moment ago. Do you agree?"

"Yes."

"Then why aren't we certain?"

"Because we have no memory of it through our five senses."

"Exactly. Because it's not in the present - precisely because it's not perceived in the present - we think it doesn't exist."

Lufist picked up a cup from the table.

"What if humans weren't in their current form, but were actually just brains submerged in some special liquid?"

Shirone tried to imagine it.

"Whether it's true or not isn't important. The key point is that even if that were the case, we'd have no way to realize that fact. What the brain feels is everything. So does this cup actually exist, or is it merely a delusion of the brain?"

No one could answer.

"When dealing with La, distinguishing between existence and non-existence is meaningless. If we can perceive La Enemy through our five senses, then it actually exists for us."

'I see. Finding La means...'

Shirone realized the intent behind the problem the Ivory Tower had posed.

Can you prove existence and non-existence?

This was precisely the problem that candidates for the stars had to solve.

Quan asked:

"Bringing memories of the five senses into reality to kill La. The idea is good, but how do we bring it into reality?"

"Jane."

When Lufist extended his hand, Jane handed him a box.

"What I'm holding now is an object specially procured with the kingdom's finances. Inside this box is a hint about La's ability."

Lian, who had been in a blank, vacant state until now, showed interest for the first time, his eyes lighting up.

"What kind of object?"

"Nemesis."

The moment Lufist spoke, Shirone slapped his knee.

"Ah, Nemesis!"

It was an A-grade object he had heard about from Uorin when he went to the Kazra Kingdom during the paternity confirmation incident.

"You seem to know about it. It's quite famous in this field. When you make contact with Nemesis, the user's imagination becomes reality within a 20-meter radius."

It was one of those objects that changed owners multiple times because the fate of humans consumed by desire was miserable.

"I don't need to explain further how imagined things can become reality. Anyway, the association speculates that La's ability is similar to Nemesis's mechanism."

Etela said:

"So we're using La's ability in reverse. But isn't Nemesis's reality manifestation ability limited only to those who make contact with it?"

"That's why we broke it."

When Lufist opened the box, eight rings made of jade-smooth material with a pinkish tint appeared.

Shirone pointed to the rings with an interested expression.

"That's... Nemesis?"

"Right. When we first obtained this, I was curious about what would happen if two people contacted Nemesis simultaneously. The experimental result was that imagination is shared. As long as the five senses perceive it, that becomes reality."

Lufist picked up one of the rings.

"Also, Nemesis's ability seems to be determined by the content of special components contained in the ore. The reason we processed it into ring form even while discarding nine-tenths of the total weight was for better portability and wearability. Control your mind from the moment you put on the ring. Of course, only those who think they can do so are gathered here. We'll retrieve the items again when the mission is over."

Quan said:

"I understand using Mayray's ability to bring La into reality. But the senses are too insufficient. Setting aside tracking solely by relying on hearing, just how are we supposed to cut down La?"

Shirone muttered as if something had suddenly occurred to him:

"Immortal Function?"

With everyone's attention focused on him, Lufist looked at Shirone and said:

"Right, it's you."

Shirone's Immortal Function could perceive the past as present, and therefore would be the sense of touch that could touch La Enemy.

"When Mayray finds it, you kill it."
