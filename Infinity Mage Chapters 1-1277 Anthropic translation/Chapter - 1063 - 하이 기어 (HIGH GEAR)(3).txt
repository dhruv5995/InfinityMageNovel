HIGH GEAR (3)

Feeling an ominous chill, Sirone reflexively spun his body around, only realizing after he moved.

'A sniper?'

Though it felt slightly different from the real world, his sixth sense was functioning normally.

Calculating the bullet's trajectory, Sirone spotted a man atop a pile of scrap metal stacked high like a hill.

Perhaps due to the limitations of Level 1, the AI kicked in belatedly and a codename floated up.

'Colonoscopy.'

Colonoscopy, who had realized it before Sirone, lowered his rifle and stood up.

'Damn! What's with that guy? Did he get some weird perk? No, there's no such perk.'

Though only Level 7, his time in High Gear rivaled that of rankers.

Unless there was some new update he didn't know about, a Level 1 shouldn't be able to dodge bullets.

'Unless he's someone who could dodge them bare-handed in reality.'

But was that even possible?

With a troubled expression watching Yahweh2, Colonoscopy decided to retreat.

'Iron Hometown's about to get noisy.'

As Colonoscopy quickly turned and disappeared to the other side, Sirone shouted.

"Stop right there!"

He kicked off the ground and leaped about 2 meters, but real-world magic was unusable.

"Damn it!"

By the time he reached where the sniper had been, the man had completely vanished.

Judging by the time it took to get there, it meant his speed was far superior to Sirone's.

'A sniper attack right from the start.'

He had sensed it when he saw the mountain of weapons, but couldn't understand the reason.

'What benefit is there in killing me when I just started? I don't have anything worth taking.'

It wasn't mentioned in the beginner tips either.

"Alright! Starting over!"

Descending from the scrap pile, Sirone proceeded forward with his senses sharpened.

After leaving the entrance area, strange creatures were wandering around where damaged machines had fallen.

They looked like rodents at first glance, but upon closer inspection, they were entirely mechanical.

Information about them appeared in augmented reality.

'Metal Rat. A type of creature.'

The information was limited due to his level, but he remembered what Fermi had told him.

'Ah, I catch those to level up...'

Thinking it was good that they weren't living beings, Sirone aimed his rifle forward.

The Metal Rats' pattern was simple.

They would cling to large machines, gnaw on iron for 2 seconds, then hurriedly move to another spot.

"Hmm."

Sirone found the mechanical evolution peculiar.

'They move constantly to avoid predators. A pattern that's conscious of ranged attacks too.'

Therefore, 2 seconds must be the golden ratio between feeding and survival.

'If they move too quickly, they can't eat iron, and if they stay too long, they get sniped. If all those countless scenarios established the current pattern through generations...'

Sirone decided on his hunting method.

'The moment they gnaw on the machine...'

As he brought his eye to the sight, the AI automatically corrected the aim point.

Though the angles of his shoulder and wrist were actually adjusted, it wasn't unpleasant since synchronization was complete.

'Now.'

The rifle spat fire.

Since Level 1 AI didn't compensate for recoil, two out of four shots hit.

Kyang! Kyang!

As the Metal Rat screamed sharply and limped away, Sirone changed direction.

'Again.'

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Firing single shots to reduce recoil improved accuracy, and each spark sent the Metal Rat reeling.

Kiiiiii...

Fluorescent liquid flowed from a hole in its abdomen, and finally its movement stopped.

"Got it."

Information appeared in augmented reality.

The experience gauge rose quickly, displaying 103 EXP in blinking numbers.

'It went up by a third. Just two more and I'll level up.'

Riding the momentum, Sirone thoroughly searched the area and quickly hunted two more.

"Level up!"

Brilliant light filled his retina as the level on the augmented reality main page changed to 2.

"Bonus points."

Opening the status window, he saw +1 displayed next to three categories.

Though there seemed to be no special changes to the AI, he could feel the difference in output with his body.

'I've gotten stronger.'

Though it was unsettling that it was machinery rather than a heart, honestly it was a vibration close to pleasure.

"Good, that was quick. Let's go for ranker."

He was beginning to understand the mindset of people obsessed with High Gear.

Savoring his enhanced engine, Sirone roamed Iron Hometown freely.

The creature types were varied, but none had higher difficulty than the Metal Rats' pattern.

"Yes! Level 3."

Hunting seven creatures leveled him up and added new functions to his AI.

'Hmm, 20 percent recoil compensation. If I fire ten shots in a row, two more should hit. But what's this Selective Option? Even after reaching Level 3, there's no change.'

He was starting to miss Fermi's absence, but hunting creatures was still much more fun.

Moving forward a bit more, he heard the sharp sound of metal scraping from a secluded area.

Pressing his back against a corner and peeking out, he saw a massive quadrupedal machine lying fallen.

Around the center of the machine, over thirty Metal Rats were swarming together.

'There's so many?'

The sound of gnawing metal was loud, and none of the creatures left their spots.

'They don't move when gathered in groups. Or maybe there's a secret to that machine?'

One thing came to Sirone's mind.

'Good experience points.'

Thinking of the experience he'd gain from wiping out the Metal Rats made his mechanical heart race.

Finally thinking it was time to use it, Sirone pulled out a grenade.

'Pull the safety pin and...'

He was following the manual that appeared on his left retina when someone suddenly popped up from beyond the quadrupedal machine.

"Hey! Are you crazy?"

When Sirone looked up, a heavily armed boy was glaring with fierce eyes.

'Destroyer707.'

It was a Platinum codename.

As the Metal Rats began scattering in all directions, Destroyer707 grabbed his helmet.

"Ah, shit! They're all running away! Hey, catch them quick! We're losing experience!"

A red-haired girl who had been hiding behind a scrap pile jumped out shouting.

"Catch what! It's already too late!"

The Metal Rats, having taken no damage, were incredibly fast and hid in crevices like cockroaches.

While Sirone stood there still gripping the safety pin, a scrawny man appeared from across the way.

'That person's Platinum too.'

His codename was 'Ultimate Codename.'

Approaching Sirone with his rifle aimed, he spoke in a cold voice.

"You picking a fight with us right now?"

"Huh? A fight?"

"You broke our trap. We barely gathered them and you're trying to steal the kill? Cheap bastard."

Then Destroyer707 arrived.

"Hey, Yahweh2! This bastard really! Acting all high and mighty with a Platinum name? Want me to make you quit High Gear?"

The girl spoke.

"Stop it. The Tenmen will be here soon. I don't want to run into those guys."

Her codename was 'Death Princess.'

"Look... if I made some mistake, I'm sorry. I'll compensate if there's a way."

Destroyer707 shouted.

"Talking about compensation! A mere biomech. Guys, should we just kill him?"

Ultimate Codename shook his head.

"The loss would be too big. All his equipment is probably free starter gear, and he won't have any Galaxy either. Let's take him with us for now."

Death Princess pointed at Sirone.

"Don't try anything funny and follow us. If you die on purpose, you won't be able to leave the start point."

According to the beginner tips, dying in High Gear could result in losing parts and Galaxy.

It was quite a severe penalty, but killing the currently empty-handed Sirone would be like setting him free.

'Actually, this works out well.'

Since he needed information to get to the city he'd promised to meet Fermi in, Sirone followed them.

"Ugh, shit! Getting out of Iron Hometown is annoyingly hard. At least let us hunt."

"Let's try once more. Using this guy, we can set up a trap quickly."

Sirone asked.

"Do you happen to know where Atogram is? I'm supposed to meet a friend there, and there might be some way I can compensate you."

"Hah, do we look like pushovers? We're doing this because we can't get to Atogram. If we could just get there, shit... even repairing parts would be nothing for me."

"Why can't you go?"

Death Princess said.

"Because the Tenmen are blocking it. It's so damn annoying I could die. Why are the operators just sitting there doing nothing?"

"What are the Tenmen?"

Destroyer707 was dumbfounded.

"What the hell do you even know? You don't know that but somehow got into High Gear just fine."

"I got some help."

Ultimate Codename said.

"Codename trading, right? Yahweh2 would be expensive. That friend in Atogram you mentioned, he's actually a dealer, isn't he?"

"Uh, well... something like that."

Destroyer707 chuckled.

"Got properly scammed. Alright, let me tell you about your bleak future. Telling you to come to Atogram means they're planning to put your codename up for auction there. There are tons of people doing code laundering because of kill orders. But the problem is Iron Hometown. This is the only place with a level restriction, so it's inaccessible."

"What's the level restriction?"

"10. That's why they're called Tenmen. They keep their level at exactly 10 and hunt beginners. When we try to hunt, they come in groups and kill us, giving us all kinds of humiliation."

"Why do they do that? There's nothing they can gain by trapping beginners in this area."

"Because it's fun."

Destroyer707 turned his head.

"Of course they do it because it's fun. Anyway, there are too many of them for the three of us to break through."

"Then this is basically the end?"

"Not necessarily. When new users gather, that's when we have an all-out war. Or we wait for when big guilds do large-scale code laundering. In that case, 30-40 people come in at once, and they're skilled enough to just push through the Tenmen."

Sirone twisted his lips.

'That bastard Fermi.'

He had left out the most crucial information and told him to come to Atogram by tomorrow evening.

Ultimate Codename said.

"There is one more method... but honestly it's annoying."

"Huh? What method?"

"Give them what they want. Those guys record it, and there are rumors that later when your level rises, they demand huge amounts of Galaxy as the condition for deleting the footage. If it's true, then they're not just doing it for fun either."

Death Princess added.

"There are various rumors about the Tenmen, but you don't need to worry much. Once we get out of Iron Hometown, we'll never see them again. The reason we made a trap was to level up all at once. If you hunt one by one, the Tenmen show up and kill you before you know it."

Destroyer707 said.

"You're lucky. You were hunting continuously, right? Normally you should have been caught by the Tenmen long ago."

"No, I ran into one at the start point too. I had just begun when they suddenly started sniping."

"If it was sniping... was it by any chance Colonoscopy?"

"Yeah, that's right."

"Haha! You had bad luck too. That guy's got some skill. So that's why you interfered with us? Getting killed by Tenmen repeatedly made you angry, so you wanted to take it out on someone?"

"I'm telling you it was really a mistake. And I didn't die either. After I dodged once, he didn't show up again."

"Dodged? Dodged what?"

"The sniper shot. It was close, but."

"You dodged? What, so you're saying you dodged a bullet?"

"No, what happened was—"

An ominous killing intent.

Sirone reflexively threw his body aside and rolled on the ground as bullets rained down from all directions.

"Damn it! It's the Tenmen!"

The three people lying flat crawled on their bellies, but the cover was too far away.

'We're dead for sure.'

But while the gunfire was deafeningly loud, not a single person had been hit.

"What the hell?"

Looking back while crawling, their eyes shook with shock.

About 11 Tenmen.

They were targeting only one person, and Yahweh2 was sprinting bare-handed between the bullet trajectories.

'He's really dodging them?'

Destroyer707, trying to understand somehow, grimaced and muttered.

"...Could this possibly be a bug?"
