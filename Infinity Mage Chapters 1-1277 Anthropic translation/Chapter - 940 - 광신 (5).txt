Fanaticism (5)

As Sein's group surrounded Harvits in a circle, the Shiok also took positions forming a circle from the inside.

'Simply manipulating the environment of a specific time period won't be enough to end this.'

Sein was still deep in thought.

'If even the incident that caused us to separate Harvits is just a future continuing from the past...'

He felt that Harvits's reason for coming here wasn't simply to avoid the elemental bomb.

"Hey, woman."

As Harvits's intent was transmitted through <Nemesis>, everyone realized it simultaneously.

"Dodge!"

A Shiok charged toward Mayray.

'Why?'

Armin, who had been maintaining his position to keep the stop magic active, was puzzled.

'I assumed the Shiok specialized in defense. But that's not the case?'

Perhaps they weren't beings that could be classified by simple concepts like offense and defense.

"You underestimate us." Kuan's voice came from behind.

But the next moment, he was already swinging his sword from the Shiok's flank.

'Asymmetric Pole.'

Sein's group could clearly see Kuan's position, but the Shiok didn't even know he was approaching.

Such was the law.

'This brings us to the second hypothesis. Why are there 12 Shiok, or 12 individuals?'

0.666 seconds.

A prison of time where no event could occur.

'Laws correspond one-to-one with all results. Otherwise, the world would become chaos.'

The Shiok - 12 individuals creating one law.

'In other words, twelve specific phenomena combine to create this prison of time. Therefore, if we eliminate even one...'

A hole would be pierced in Harvits's iron wall.

By the time he quickly reached this conclusion, Kuan was already swinging his sword at the lead Shiok.

'It won't even know it's dying.'

At that moment.

"Ugh!"

The lead Shiok suddenly tripped over a colleague's foot, causing its upper body to bend back completely.

'What?'

If this were a comedy routine, it couldn't be more ridiculous, but the sword had already been swung.

The blade sliced through the robe, and a stream of blood shot up with a whooshing sound.

"Blood?"

Like a machine stopping its operation, the Shiok dropped its shoulders and lowered its head.

"Not bad."

As the lead Shiok pulled back its hood to reveal itself, Sein's group's eyes widened.

"Human?"

It had no pointed ears, no red skin, no horns on its head or back - it was unmistakably human.

'If it's human, I can hear it.'

Mayray intercepted the Shiok's wavelength using God's frequency.

"This is...?"

Eden, sharing the wavelength through <Nemesis>, looked at the Shiok with a dazed expression.

'These voices, this is definitely... humans who became fascinated only with evil and became Satan's followers in their living flesh.'

"Fanatics."

The true identity of the Shiok was 12 fanatics.

How massive a flow would be needed to uproot a rock embedded in the ground by a torrent?

Information Castle crumbled like dust.

The battle inside the complex castle was reminiscent of an action movie, but viewed from afar, it was simply a massive force sweeping through.

"Charge! Charge!"

As the formations of demons that had destroyed the castle merged, tremendous impact pounded the earth.

Among the allied corpses bouncing on the ground where not even debris remained.

"Kill everything in sight!"

No survivors were visible.

"Haa! Haa!"

Dante's rough breathing echoed eerily in the gloomy space of the underground tunnel.

"Are you alright? If it's difficult, please leave it to me."

The 3rd Division officer supporting him looked at Dante with worried eyes.

His complexion was pale.

"No. It's a labyrinth integrated with a cipher system. It's not an exit you can find just by wandering around a lot."

Behind Dante and the officer followed soldiers who had defended Information Castle.

'Panic room.'

When the demons' impact exceeded Information Castle's durability, Dante headed for the underground facility.

And he evacuated the troops through escape routes created by a hundred serial magic circles.

'How thorough. If he had given up the panic room, he could have greatly enhanced the castle's functions.'

Mages don't overestimate their abilities.

'Well, none of the mages I know are interested in becoming heroes.'

Speaking as a swordsman, their purpose in life seemed to be solely in solving problems.

'Damn annoying! Always getting promoted faster than me! Cunning bastard!'

Thinking of his military colleague made his teeth grit for a moment, but the officer soon showed an understanding expression.

'...So this is how comfortable it is, having someone else do the thinking.'

Like a lost child meeting their parents, just having Dante there was reassuring.

"What should we do now? We don't have enough troops to carry out operations."

Dante had already finished making his decision.

"Joining other units would be good, but it's too valuable to give up the advantage of underground movement. Considering the distance to the flower field, even if we arrive, it won't be a time when we're being pushed back. Let's continue moving underground and then set traps."

"Traps?"

The officer asked in puzzlement.

"We won't be able to make great traps. The work efficiency is too low compared to the enemy's scale."

He wondered how threatening hastily made traps could be.

"Scale isn't determined only by size or form."

"Pardon?"

Dante created a laser model between his palms with precise photon output.

Inside a cubic frame was another cubic frame connected by lines.

"This is...?"

As if being born endlessly, the two cubes moved while reversing the concepts of inside and outside.

"Dimension."

Dante's lips curved upward.

The energy of the ancient weapon Saenghwa originates from sunlight received by vast petals.

There wasn't a single cloud in the sky.

This was thanks to the Holy War already requesting cooperation from the World Climate Organization to manipulate the weather.

"Block the sun."

Balkan immediately grasped the mechanism.

Flying demons from each unit shot up into the sky, darkening the area like night.

Enox, the commander of the flower field, gave orders.

"Intercept."

As 300 Saenghwa shot beams of light into the sky, the red flesh ceiling was cleanly pierced.

"Now! Charge!"

As demon ashes fell like heavy snow, ground forces infiltrated the flower field.

Protea, chief of the Fire Tribe, shouted.

"Lord Enox! The allied forces are being pushed back! We need to push them back with Saenghwa before they get closer!"

"No. Saenghwa must continuously charge energy. Without opening the sky, they're just scrap metal."

A demon division commander who had broken through the allied forces' tenfold encirclement shouted.

"You don't have to kill them! Torture them horribly! Break them until they beg to be killed!"

"Uaaaah!"

At orders that even faded the purpose of war, the faces of allied soldiers waiting at their positions turned pale.

"Filthy creatures."

Enox drew her sword and shouted.

"Brothers and sisters! Do not fear! Agape's light will protect us. Let's go!"

"Kahahaha! Elves, elves!"

Watching the demons charge with greedy eyes, the elf unit drew their respective weapons.

"For Idea!"

Enox's legs lifted off the ground and shot forward at tremendous speed.

"Recycling won't even work on these rotten chunks of meat."

A whirlwind formed on her sword, and each time she displayed swordsmanship, demons were cut into pieces.

Wind sharp as a blade sliced through a demon battalion commander's right arm.

"Guk! What kind of wind...!"

It felt like being hit by steel.

"Hmph, proof that you're inferior."

Flight magic Aios, cutting magic Aruope.

Both were ancient magic that Nor wielded.

"Elves are the new humanity."

A hybrid of Nor and Fairy.

Even with the same ancient magic, the magical power from a Fairy's mental strength was incomparable to humans.

"The next generation's Idea belongs to us."

Enox dreamed that someday elves would mix into human society and reach God.

"Surround her! Crush her with your bodies!"

At the brigade commander's orders, burly demons charged from all directions, shaking the ground.

Since her vision was completely blocked, Enox landed on the ground light as a feather.

"How dare you thrust your stinking flesh forward."

Looking over her enemies with cold eyes, she twisted her ant-thin waist to its limit.

"Mahagart."

For Nor, this was group magic.

But elves with 100 percent spirit affinity needed no help other than air.

"Spirits of wind!"

As Enox used her waist's elasticity to swing her sword horizontally, strong winds spread in all directions.

"Krgh!"

As if hit by a giant wave, the massive demons were pushed back, dragging across the ground.

Enox spun gracefully and thrust her sword into the ground, her eyes flashing wide.

"Estacion!"

Group magic that would require 100 Nor mages exploded alone from her spirit.

The atmosphere within a 100-meter radius became tens of thousands of small blades, creating turbulence.

"Kraaaah!"

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Like being trapped in a giant blender, the shredded flesh of demons whirled about.

"Damn! That elf, I won't let her be!"

Even the cruel demons could only watch from outside Estacion's range.

"Whew."

As Enox drew her sword, the waiting demons exploded with killing intent and charged.

"I'll start by chewing off your fingers...!"

The demon's face exploded with a bang.

"Chief!"

Elf archers born from wind spirits were approaching, pushing back the defensive line.

"All units, rapid fire!"

Each time the archer unit pulled steel bowstrings, arrows flew at Mach speed, creating sonic booms.

Their rate of fire, with physical abilities far superior to humans, reached 7 shots per second...

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The arrows' power was enough to pierce through demon bodies and disappear from sight.

Tess, who had been anxiously watching the vanguard fight, breathed a sigh of relief.

"Somehow we've managed to balance things. There's a limit to sacrificing flying demons, so if we hold out like this..."

Then a faint vibration that could only be felt by Schema's sensory系 was transmitted.

"What?"

Turning his head toward the epicenter, he saw one Saenghwa pointing toward the allied forces.

"Dodge!"

Ryan grabbed Tess's wrist and threw his body just as a beam of light scraped across the ground.

Rumble! The ground shook as a diagonal black line was drawn across the thousand-man unit Tess belonged to.

Ryan, getting up, muttered.

"Someone hijacked a Saenghwa."

"I'll go!"

Tess was a precious friend, but during war, there was no room for personal feelings.

"Be careful."

As Tess gave a thumbs up and moved away, Ryan turned his head again to look forward.

At that moment.

A time seesaw occurred.

For time to slow down just because he looked ahead was impossible...

Why on earth?

Even before his brain could form thoughts, every cell in his body furiously questioned this.

200 meters ahead was another thousand-man unit.

The rear forces blocked his view, so he couldn't tell exactly what was happening, but...

Further away, countless soldiers were simultaneously bouncing into the sky.

The fact that the rear soldiers weren't moving a finger meant they weren't even aware of it.

'Moving at tremendous speed.'

As the time seesaw was released, Ryan's arm pulled the Daejikdo deep into his chest.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Like landmines exploding, soldiers were flung away, and finally, as the rear was completely breached...

Clang!

Impact was transmitted to Ryan's Daejikdo.

"Krgh!"

Ryan, who had flown dozens of meters, braked with his soles and leaned his upper body forward.

'Feels like my solar plexus was pierced.'

Looking ahead, Natasha in a black dress was swaying her hips in a dance.

'Combat doll...'

Her cute hip-swaying motion seemed both adorable and seductive.

After spinning once, she tilted her head to one side, placed both elbows on her waist, and spread her hands wide.

"Hello?"

Ryan tracked 10 points of starlight starting from her fingertips and spiraling upward.

A hooded incarnation of death was looking down at her from above her head.

"Death's Dance."

Natasha disappeared.
