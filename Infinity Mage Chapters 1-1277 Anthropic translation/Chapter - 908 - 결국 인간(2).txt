In the End, Human (2)

'Truly remarkable.'

Minerva was amazed by Gaold's extremity.

'He loves good, and for her sake, he doesn't hesitate to follow the methodology of evil.'

For Miro, he would do anything.

'It must be painful... even knowing that this world is nothing but a ball.'

'One who fights for life until the very end in hell.' Gaold, who possessed everything of love and hate for good and evil, was utterly human.

"Why?"

Minerva asked.

"What are you doing all this for?"

Everyone who was a star of the ivory tower knew what kind of life Gaold had lived.

"Miro used you. Even if it wasn't intentional, she destroyed your life."

At Gaold's stubborn lack of reaction, fire blazed up inside Minerva.

"You even stormed into heaven and saved her! You defeated Ikael! You eliminated the demons of the south, and now by giving up love, you've made the human called Miro into ultimate good!"

"...That's right."

"Don't you get it yet? You were squeezed dry by Miro. Sucked completely dry without a drop left and then discarded!"

"I suppose so."

"Then why do you endure? Living is hell for you. You want to end it. Why don't you give up?"

"Again..."

Gaold slowly lifted his chin.

"She's crying again."

Miro was crying.

Minerva began to wonder if Gaold had even been talking to her at all.

"Please stop! You're a mage! What you're seeing is an illusion! It's not the real Miro! She's already forgotten you and is living well, having reached the realm of ultimate good!"

When Gaold opened his mouth, saliva drooled out.

"What do you people... know about Miro?"

Sein said.

"Persuasion is useless. He's trapped in his own world and can't accept reality. What remains is how to deal with him."

Freed let out a long breath.

'That's the problem.'

He looked like he couldn't even move a finger, but what would happen the moment they entered his range was obvious.

"I'll go in first."

The strategy was to bind Gaold's mind with the swordsman's physical abilities and then attack.

Sein formed hand seals with both hands.

"I'll restrain him with the law. I can probably buy about 0.01 seconds."

Freed nodded and moved forward.

"...That's enough."

Minerva drew on her pipe, and Amanta turned the wheel of worlds, preparing for battle.

Even under the crushing weight of enormous killing intent, Gaold was absorbed in Miro's phantom.

'Why are you crying?'

Why was she crying?

"I did everything you wanted. Now I'm a wreck. There's no point in crying like that."

"Going."

The moment Freed launched his body, Sein's law constrained Gaold's freedom.

Even as the blade flew toward his neck, there was no change in Gaold's expression.

'It's over.'

Even while moving at ultra-high speed, certainty of victory flashed through Freed's mind.

'Just a wreck after all.'

Nothing more, nothing less.

The moment a flash of light cut horizontally across Gaold's neck, the sound of metal breaking was heard.

"What?"

Only the handle remained of the sword.

'How?'

It wasn't an object, but it was a famous sword that would never break under ordinary force.

"Argh!"

Belatedly realizing the pain and examining his hand, it was torn to shreds with bone showing.

'Vibration.'

Air pressure had vibrated the blade, and shock waves had pierced through his skin.

'Which means...'

Sein's law had already been broken.

When Freed turned his head, there was a pitch-black hole where Sein had been.

The atmosphere had drilled into the ground.

'Still no impact?'

Unless the dirt was blown upward, there was no way the ground could remain intact with such a hole.

"Ugh."

Taeseong squeezed his eyes shut and staggered, while Minerva flew up on her jet.

"Get away!"

The ground swelled like a balloon, and red light leaked out from the cracks that split like a turtle's shell.

'It's going to explode!'

BOOOOOOOOM!

Freed, who had crossed his arms in an X-shape, was swept away by the powerful shock wave.

"Grrrrr!"

He released countless external gravity forces, but it was nowhere near enough to escape the inertia.

'Getting weaker.'

Amanta, who had offset half the impact, grabbed Freed's back and flew up into the sky.

"I was careless. Seems he had more strength left than expected."

At Amanta's words, Freed shook his head.

'No, that's not it.'

He hadn't been careless.

The destructive power of Gaold that he actually faced was simply far more powerful than anticipated.

When the smoke cleared, a huge crater had formed where the forest had disappeared.

"Are you okay?"

Minerva flew over on her jet.

"For now. But I'm worried about Sein. Just how deep did she get driven down?"

If she had been crushed into the ground by Gaold's atmospheric pressure, survival would be unlikely.

Minerva, who examined the depth of the crater's center, muttered with a grim expression.

"The depth must be 100 meters."

"I'm fine."

Then Sein's voice was heard.

Looking to the side, she was flying over panting with one shoulder dislocated.

"You held out?"

Sein pointed at Freed with her good arm.

"Five Organs armor set."

It was the world's best armor capable of 60 percent anti-magic effects.

"The aim was off by about 4 meters. But just the wind pressure dislocated my shoulder. I almost died."

Even though she avoided instant death, the moment she was crushed into the ground by atmospheric pressure, she had faced death.

"How humiliating."

Amanta's eyes narrowed.

"Even if he's a destructive mage, we are four of the ivory tower's five great stars. It makes no sense that we can't win."

Minerva agreed.

"Honestly, we're losing in terms of power. We need to suppress him tactically. It'll probably be harder for Taeseong though..."

Taeseong, the incarnation of a star, wasn't affected by magic, but was defenseless against planetary impacts themselves.

Freed prepared to jump down.

"Still, be careful. He ignored me charging at him and tried to take out Sein first. His instincts told him to. He's a master of combat."

Everyone felt it in their bones.

"Let's go."

As the four launched themselves, cylindrical atmospheric pressure fell consecutively from high in the sky.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

"Move! Detect with spirit zoneâ€”"

It was a speed that ordinary mages couldn't even react to, but they were stars of the ivory tower.

Minerva, who reached the ground, puffed out her cheeks greatly and exhaled green smoke.

Poison magic.

'Vulnerable to air magic, but...'

It was sufficient quality and quantity to force Gaold's magic to focus purely on defense.

'One breath and it's over.'

As expected, Gaold wrapped his surroundings in an air shield to block the rapidly spreading smoke.

'From here...'

Amanta reduced the air shield's density by half, and Sein concentrated law magic to create gaps.

"Breaking through!"

Freed, who squeezed through the gap, unleashed a barrage of strikes on Gaold.

"This is the end!"

Blood splattered everywhere.

"Huh?"

As a living being, his body should have been destroyed, but instead Freed's fists were torn up.

'Air shield?'

The air covering Gaold like skin was circulating as sharp as blades.

'Air shield isn't a passive skill. Don't tell me he released the outer shield?'

If he had eliminated the outer shield to survive immediately, he would have been hit by the concentrated fire of all four.

'It's still there.'

The fact that Minerva's poisonous smoke still couldn't get in was proof.

'But how...?'

As he continued pummeling Gaold, an absurd thought crossed his mind.

"Time division?"

A technique of rapidly alternating between two battlefields to maintain two active skills.

"Uh. Uhhh."

Painful groans leaked from the mouth of Gaold, who was staggering with unfocused eyes.

Freed burst into laughter.

"Puhahahaha!"

But unlike his hearty laughter, his eyes held sorrowful emotions.

'Pathetic.'

Still trying to live. The sight of Gaold alternating battlefields with a brain already broken by pain and pleasure.

"Wahhh. Uhhhhh."

The sounds he made while squeezing out concentration resembled a terrified fool.

"You climbed to the very top of the world..."

Freed vividly remembered the shock and awe he had felt when Gaold defeated Ikael.

"Did you even sell your pride, Gaold!"

Enraged, Freed unleashed violence without caring that his fists were breaking.

Gradually, as the air shield's durability weakened, impacts began reaching his body.

"Ahhh. Ahhhhhh."

Even in the pain of flesh tearing and bones cracking, Gaold was looking at Miro.

Sniff. Sniff.

The sight of her sitting powerless, covering her eyes and crying was surely an illusion, but...

'Why are you acting like that toward me?'

Gaold's heart was torn into a thousand pieces.

'What are you going to accomplish by crying like that!'

In his already ruined state, there was nothing he could do for her.

'I did enough! I did everything you told me to do, sacrificing my life!'

Sniff. Sniff.

'What more do you want me to do here! You became ultimate good! Now you should handle things yourself!'

Sniff. Sniff.

Freed's eyes became bloodshot.

"Die! Just give up already!"

It was an attack powerful enough to bruise his entire body, but Gaold didn't care.

'What do you want me to do! If you have any conscience, tell me! I gave you my whole life! So why do you keep coming to me crying and carrying on! Why! Why! Why!'

Miro lifted her head and moved her lips slightly with a face covered in tears.

Gaold.

Though he couldn't hear her voice, the shape of her lips felt like it was piercing his brain.

'Shut up! I hurt more than you! No one in this world hurts more than me! What more do you want me to do!'

Gaold.

'I'm dying to die! I don't even have the strength to move a finger! What exactly am I supposed to...'

I'm having such a hard time.

The moment Miro's words hit him, Gaold's pupils rolled back, showing the whites of his eyes.

"...What do you need me to do?"

The moment the dry voice leaked out, Freed's face turned deathly pale.

'What?'

The world was shaking violently.

"I'll do it."

Gaold, gritting his teeth, released his air shield and charged at Freed.

"I'll do everything you want!"

Don't cry.

"Dodge!"

The moment Freed shouted, he kicked the ground with all his might toward the opposite side.

"Damn it..."

But when Gaold's air press exploded, he realized it was futile.

The feeling of the weight of air on his shoulders increasing at tremendous speed was the height of terror.

'We're all going to die.'

WHOOOOOOOM!

A low rumble pounded the ground, and the four great stars sat down while looking around.

"Wh-what?"

Nothing had been destroyed.

'The atmosphere spread rapidly.'

At what would have been the impact point, Taeseong was panting with a pale face.

A gentle breeze fluttered her skirt.

"I'll spare you. But instead..."

Gaold, lifting his chin, smiled dryly with parched lips and said:

"Take me to the battlefield."

While everyone maintained silence, Gaold looked up at the sky and muttered:

"Is this enough now?"

Miro's phantom was sticking out her tongue and smiling.
