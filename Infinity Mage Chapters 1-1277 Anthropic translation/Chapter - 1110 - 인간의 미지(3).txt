Human's Unknown (3)

Cause.

"Are you Euphrat?"

The people trapped in the Pyramid of Truth experienced the countless causes that made up their respective lives.

The great swordsman Euphrat frowned.

'Damn it, how long do I have to keep seeing this stuff?'

What he was seeing was from his mid-thirties, a time when he was too ashamed to be called a great swordsman.

But he had managed his reputation well enough that swordsmen seeking to challenge him would occasionally come looking.

"Is that so?"

The Euphrat of that time had immediately sensed that the swordsman who came to find him was surprisingly strong.

Perhaps even stronger than himself.

"I've heard rumors of your mastery of the sword. However, I too have some skill with the blade, so I request a match."

Euphrat pretended to be indifferent as he studied the man.

'To be honest...'

He was afraid.

His heart was pounding, and images of being mercilessly cut down by the man's sword tore through his mind.

"Sorry. Today is the anniversary of a friend's death. I don't want to commit pointless killing."

'That's how I made excuses back then.'

There were countless dead friends, after all.

'I was always like that.'

While other swordsmen risked their lives pursuing their dreams, he only fought opponents he could beat.

The present Euphrat spat out:

"Damn it! So what?"

It was an inferiority complex.

At the time, he had turned his back and walked away, so he couldn't see his opponent's face, but...

"...!"

The look in the man's eyes that he confirmed in the Pyramid of Truth was...

Contempt.

"Uwaaaaah!"

The present Euphrat burst forward.

"Fine! I'll fight you! Come at me! You think I can't win?"

In the past, running away was all he could do, but now his skills had improved considerably.

*CLANG*

The moment their swords clashed, the young swordsman's face changed into that of Balzac, an old friend.

"Still the same, Euphrat. Yeah, you always only drew your sword when you knew you could win."

"Urgh!"

His heart began pounding again.

"You knew it all along. That if you held out like that, countless competitors would disappear on their own."

"That's not true."

No matter how much he shook his head, lies didn't work in the Pyramid of Truth.

The scenery changed, and he saw Balzac cutting down enemies left and right on the battlefield.

'He's a genius. A real genius.'

Only now, decades later, could Euphrat accurately assess his friend's abilities.

'What was I doing back then?'

The scenery changed rapidly, showing himself leisurely patrolling the civilian areas.

'The safest place.'

He could gain merit by killing enemy generals, but there was a high probability it would lead to death.

'I didn't want to take gambles like that. I was just... content to live like that.'

During his patrol, Euphrat saw flames rising on the horizon.

"Area magic?"

The entire region had been reduced to scorched earth by the mages' tactical bombardment, and there wasn't a single survivor.

Thinking of his friend, he shouted:

"Balzac!"

He drew his sword and tried to run toward the battlefield, but his subordinates grabbed his arms.

"Captain! Please restrain yourself! You can't break formation!"

"Let go, you bastards! Balzac is over there!"

Really... couldn't he have broken free?

"No."

Was it really just concern for his friend?

"Stop it! You son of a bitch!"

Perhaps I... wasn't I dreaming of new hope while looking at those burning flames?

"Uwaaaaah! Damn it! What do you expect me to do!"

The moment the scenery changed to his friend's funeral, Euphrat's face, which had been shouting, turned pale.

'No.'

Eliana, now a widow, looked much more beautiful than he had thought at the time.

The thirty-something Euphrat thought:

'I liked her first.'

As if that reason of his own was some kind of indulgence, he walked toward her.

"Miss Eliana, you must be very sad."

Throughout the funeral, Euphrat stayed by her side.

"Balzac was obsessed with the sword, wasn't he? He had the most magnificent end as a swordsman."

She remained silent while Euphrat talked a lot.

"That guy Balzac, I heard he didn't leave much inheritance. I'll help you."

"Mr. Euphrat." The first words Eliana spoke were:

"Please don't do this."

And the look in her eyes as she gazed at him was exactly the same as the man who had challenged him...

Contempt and disgust.

"What am I supposed to do! You damn bastards!"

*CLANG!*

Euphrat's twin swords were blocked by Balzac's sword.

"Fine! I loved her! I loved her so much! But did I ever lay a finger on your wife?"

He swung his sword to forget.

He avoided strong opponents, greatly exaggerated his victories over weaker ones, and after decades passed...

"Great. Sword. Master. Euphrat."

"Shut up! You think you're any different? If you're so confident, let's examine your past too! We're all the same! Living somewhat cowardly, shamefully! Everyone lives like that!"

Euphrat was half out of his mind.

"I did a lot of good things in my life! I had pride! Who are you to look down on me!"

Balzac smiled sadly.

"Euphrat."

It sounded like a voice that transcended time, so for the first time, Euphrat thought it might not be a phantom.

"Be happy."

As Balzac sheathed his sword and walked away, the scenery began to recede around him.

"Happy?"

Euphrat lowered his sword.

"You turn my whole life upside down and tell me to be happy? Is that really what you want to say to me?"

Murderous intent gleamed in his eyes as he glared into the darkness.

"Canis, how long are you going to stay here?"

In the narrow room of the pyramid, Canis and Arin sat side by side with their backs against the wall.

Considerable time had passed, but they had no desire to move.

"That can't be right."

Canis said.

"This crazy space is trying to drive us insane. Think about it. Twins? Do you and I look alike?"

They did.

Not exactly like twins, but with the Iran bloodline, it wasn't impossible.

Arin lowered her head.

"What... what happens to us?"

"You don't need to think about anything! Nothing will change. Arin, remember the time we've spent together!"

A person more precious than life.

'I want you. I was planning to live with you forever. But we share the same blood?'

Overcome by anger, Canis grabbed Arin's shoulders and roughly kissed her.

It took great courage, but Arin would have gladly accepted it.

"No!"

But she pushed him away, and Canis, who fell backward, looked dazed.

"Why, why are you doing this?"

Having read Canis's emotions through her supernatural senses, she shed tears.

"I'm sorry. I love you too, but just in case..."

"No! That's absolutely impossible. No, we decided to believe it's impossible and live that way!"

Though they had never said it in words.

"We did. But now we know. At least until we know for certain..."

"This..."

Just as Canis was about to let out a frustrated scream:

"So you were here."

Eyes glowing red in the darkness approached.

"Mr. Ares."

"Is everyone safe? I need to find Sirone."

Muttering this as he approached, he was surprised to see Canis and Arin's faces.

"What happened? Why do you both look like that?"

There was no answer.

"Right, you two were affected too."

"Mr. Ares... did you also see the past?"

"Mm. I keep resetting with the Crimson Eyes ability, but it's quite a horrific process. The timeline of this place is twisted. The fact that our party is completely scattered is proof of that."

Canis muttered:

"Why is this happening to us?"

"There probably isn't a reason."

Ares examined the text flowing along the walls.

"It's just that kind of space. Here, all causality seems to be completely dismantled regardless of time. It's like..."

"A god's perspective?"

Ares nodded.

"Right. If viewed from outside the universe, even time would be just another line. Perhaps a god really does live in this place."

"Let's go."

Canis stood up.

"I'll meet them directly. What reason they have for doing this horrible thing to us. I'll reverse it. If something called a god really exists..."

Even if I have to kill that god.

The WHO expedition members were each given private rooms.

Ceriel, who had placed a large bag on the desk, was disappointed that her mood had been ruined since morning.

"Annoying."

Fermi's face came to mind.

A small incident from her school days that she couldn't tell anyone about at the time.

'Amy would try to kill me if she found out.'

Her face flushed hot, but at the same time, she had this thought:

'Would she really?'

Everyone has secrets.

If you break down a person's life into causes and effects, there are countless impulses, shame, and ecstasy that others can't imagine.

'Back then, I didn't know the world would become like this.'

Sitting on the edge of the desk, she put a cigarette in her mouth and lit it.

"Phew."

Why did she start smoking?

Perhaps that too was...

A cause.

When Ceriel was in her graduating class.

That day was when the 19th week of training had ended and they were given a day of rest.

Amy and Ceriel were best friends, but leisure activities were unthinkable for graduating students.

"Amy, it's a day off. What are you doing?"

"I'm going to do supplementary Spirit Zone training. What about you?"

Unlike the tireless Amy, Ceriel was an ordinary person who needed rest.

"I'm just going to have some coffee or something."

"Okay, then... let's go to a cafe."

She agreed readily, but a troubled look flashed through Amy's eyes.

Sensing this, Ceriel clapped her hands together.

"Oh, right! It's the day the sequel to 'Primitive Snare' comes out! Amy, sorry. Let's have coffee another time."

"Got it. Let's go to the bookstore."

Not wanting to interfere with her friend's training, Ceriel came up with an excuse.

"Hoho! No way. It's an incredibly dangerous book. It's deadly for innocent kids like you. I'm going. See you tomorrow."

"Hey! Ceriel!"

Amy called out urgently, but Ceriel was already running down the corridor and turning the corner.

Could she really not have been caught?

Such a feeling suddenly arose, but there was no time for idle thoughts in front of the immediate task.

"...I should train."

Meanwhile, Ceriel, who had come outside, let out a sigh of relief that she hadn't become a hindrance.

"I'll just have fun alone."

Having left the school with a light heart, she arrived at a shabby bookstore.

"Hello."

It was her secret hideout, far from the noble district, where dark books frequently found their way in.

"I knew you'd come. It's in the corner."

Ceriel had covered her face with large glasses and a scarf, but the bookstore owner recognized her immediately.

Ceriel bowed her head, and her eyes sparkled behind the lenses.

'There it is, the sequel to Primitive Snare.'

A not-so-beautiful love story between a noble and a maid.

Though it was treated as adult material due to its decadent and explicit sexual descriptions, it wasn't particularly shocking to Ceriel, who had been reading romance novels since childhood.

It started from the first page with characters from the previous work making love.

Swallowing her saliva as she read on, she was soon absorbed in the content.

'The positions have switched.'

A maid who had bound a noble man with chains approached with a whip.

'Her breath made all the man's fine hairs stand on end. The jelly-like wet tongue that emerged from between her red lips licked the man's nape...'

"What are you reading?"

Startled by the sudden voice, Ceriel quickly closed the book.

"Eek! Who, who is it!"

When she turned around, she saw a familiar face - one that was familiar but that she didn't want to become familiar with.

"Fermi?"

When she lowered her large glasses to confirm, Fermi raised his hand in greeting.

"Hello?"

With his usual mischievous smile.
