Memory (1)

Alpheas continued speaking.

"A year ago, there was an incident where one of the magic school students was murdered by an assailant."

"Murdered?"

"That's when I learned about the bitter relationship between Ethella and Shagal. You know who Shagal is, don't you?"

One of the world's 100 most dangerous individuals.

He was someone who had once clashed with Rian, a figure corresponding to the sense of smell of the Great Purification Period.

"I heard there was memory distortion."

Ra Enemy had injected false memories into Shagal.

Everything he believed he had experienced was an illusion, and as a result, he killed Raphael, Ethella's master.

"Raphael forgave him. Following that will, Ethella also tried to lead Shagal toward good, but..."

Alpheas let out a sigh.

"Shagal's mind had fallen into an abyss too deep for her to handle. He harmed everyone around her. Not only students but teachers were also in danger. And then finally... one student became a victim."

"Did you arrest Shagal?"

"No. I don't want to admit it, but he's strong. That's why Ethella left the school. Wherever Ethella is, Shagal comes."

Ethella's feelings were understandable.

"Where is the teacher now?"

Alpheas shook his head.

"I don't know. They say Shagal's sense of smell has reached a transcendent level. If he can track her wherever she is, there would be two possible places. Either she's confronting Shagal somewhere with no one around..."

If he were an opponent she could subdue, Ethella wouldn't have let him run wild in the first place.

"Or she's hiding among crowds, waiting for the right moment."

A place where she could mask her scent.

The Kingdom of Pesia.

Though it bordered Tormia, it geographically belonged to the southern continent.

As a developing country, it suffered from severe corruption and serious slum conditions due to economic polarization.

Slum District Secte 7.

If Radum in the Kingdom of Tormia was a place where the poor hid to plot schemes, Secte 7 was literally a den of beggars.

In this place lined with shacks that couldn't even block the rain, approximately 450 beggars were being kept like livestock.

The kingdom provided meals, but the quality of food was at a level where calling it garbage wouldn't be wrong.

Still, the reason they were taken in and fed was because they served as good guinea pigs for politicians.

Secret biological experiments, assassination plots, unsolved cases - Secte 7 was the starting point for countless crimes.

"I'm hungry..."

In the 7-pyeong room teeming with people, the stench of their waste filled the air.

Everywhere seemed like a toilet, but in the filthiest spot among them all, a woman sat alone.

Romy Ethella.

Meals were once a day, but her turn rarely came.

Every time she covered herself with what had once been white but was now black rags and smeared filth on her body, the beggars would glance at her.

"There she goes again. What is that woman anyway?"

The sight of her doing this whenever she had time since entering Secte 7 was bizarre.

But since there were quite a few mentally ill people like her in this place, the beggars didn't pay particular attention.

'I have to leave.'

It had already been 30 days since she entered Secte 7.

Though she was disguising herself with all kinds of foul odors, Shagal's sense of smell could even remember incidents.

'He knows all my scents.'

To erase even the smell of her internal organs, she scooped up filth from the floor with her hands and put it in her mouth.

It was something revolting even for a monk's spirit, but Ethella's eyes only blazed with fury.

'I cannot forgive him.'

Until the magic school student was murdered by Shagal, she had tried to uphold Raphael's will.

But what she gained in return for carrying out good intentions was the deaths of countless acquaintances.

Monks of the Carsice Order, believers, magic school students.

'The methodology of evil.'

It seemed to mock her, asking if she could still forgive him even after going this far.

'I'll kill him.'

Shagal's evil was gnawing away at Ethella's good.

'I'm sorry, Master. I have lost my heart.'

By the time her revenge against Shagal was complete, Ethella would no longer be something that could be called good either...

'Don't worry, Shagal. I won't let you die alone and lonely.'

Now even that didn't matter.

'I'll kill you and go together.'

A gleam flashed in Ethella's eyes.

'To eternal hell...'

Mark made a suggestion.

"Seniors, since this gathering is so memorable, how about we have dinner together?"

The sun was already setting, and all the alumni felt it would be regrettable to part ways like this.

Shirone and Amy felt the same way.

They moved to a restaurant, and as alcohol was served, frank conversations flowed.

As expected, the topic was the war with the demons, and Iruki, the chief strategist of the Valkyries, explained the war situation.

"It's bad. We're going to lose."

The reason they weren't afraid despite the hopeless outlook was because they too were in the middle of the war.

"The key is the Kingdom of Tormia. This is the last gateway to the central continent. If the demons break through here, no country in the world can stop them."

Dante said,

"Tormia won't be easily breached."

Ceriel asked,

"Do you have some strategy?"

"It's classified, so I can't tell you the details. Though some of you probably already expect it. Anyway, it's almost certain that Tormia will be the final battleground."

Iruki added,

"The Valkyries are making their own preparations too. Of course, the scale of damage will be arithmetically impossible to estimate, but there's also a small chance of winning the war."

"...How many will die?"

"Based on the kingdoms occupied by demons, on average 87 percent of their own citizens died. So assuming they reach Tormia, most of us here will die."

In the somber atmosphere, Dorothy spoke.

"Then this gathering might be our last alumni reunion. Should we toast in commemoration?"

"I won't die."

People's gazes turned to Shirone.

"I absolutely won't let anyone die."

"Shirone..."

From Shirone's fierce expression as he glared ahead, they could feel what burden he was carrying.

"When we first started the war, they said it was impossible too. But we've come this far in the end. The Ivory Tower is moving, and Seongeum closed the spirit realm. And if all of us fight with everything we have..."

Shirone smiled.

"So let's toast to victory."

The alumni of Alpheas Magic School raised their glasses and shouted.

"Let's win!"

The time to leave was approaching.

Shirone, who had come outside for some fresh air, heard the boisterous sounds from the tavern echoing in his ears.

'It's coming.'

Was this a manifestation of time perception, or just wishful thinking created by emotions?

'Something enormous is coming.'

The acceleration rushing toward the end felt more vivid than before.

'What kind of future awaits?'

He still couldn't even imagine it, and could only shudder at that vague image.

"Shirone."

As he slowly turned around, Amy approached with a smile, her cheeks flushed red.

"Are you leaving?"

Shirone had to go.

"I'm sorry. I have to deliver this to the Ivory Tower as quickly as possible. Even though we met like this..."

Amy shook her head.

"Let's not try to be happy by ourselves. I hope a world comes where everyone can be happy. I'll fight hard too. And I'll wait. Because there's no one in my heart but you..."

Though she was already borrowing courage from alcohol, she still had to muster more courage.

"So what I want to say is..."

Amy smiled brightly.

"I love you."

Shirone saw the full moon floating in the sky clearly reflected in her two eyes.

"Uh..."

Hot tears flowed down.

"Why are you crying?"

"Huh? Me? Why..."

Shirone, who realized belatedly, hurriedly wiped away his tears, but somehow couldn't stop them.

'I must remember this moment.'

Though he didn't know why, that thought occurred to him.

'I must remember this woman.'

Amy's face, voice, scent, even the night sky's moon reflected in her eyes.

'I absolutely won't forget!'

Shirone grabbed Amy's shoulders and etched her form into his retinas.

"Amy, you absolutely must not forget me. You have to remember me no matter what moment comes."

"What do you mean by that?"

Shirone was afraid.

The enormous future pressing into this world seemed like it would sweep everything away.

"Promise me."

Amy didn't understand, but seeing Shirone's terrified face, she nodded.

"Yes, I'll remember. No matter what happens, even if it's a world without you, I'll remember you."

Shirone kissed Amy, and their hot breath connected them as one life.

And a moment later.

People who came out of the tavern after hearing the roar of spatial movement saw Amy standing alone.

When Gaold's Air Press, having reached the realm of breaking limits, exploded, a mushroom cloud shot up from the ground.

Kang Nan's eyes, looking down at that scene from the distant sky with Zulu, shook with shock.

"This can't be..."

Gaold, who had begun to forget even his memories of Miro, took drastic measures.

This was the result.

"How can he become even stronger?"

"Because he's human."

Zulu said.

"The human heart has no limits. It's just that Gaold... chose a more convenient method."

After the explosion disappeared and they confirmed a huge crater had formed, Zulu descended to the ground.

As wind blew away the smoke, Gaold appeared with a meaningful smile.

"It's over."

The demons of the south had been perfectly eliminated.

But to Kang Nan, Gaold's smiling appearance seemed eerie beyond sadness.

"Are you really okay?"

"About what?"

"You know. You are..."

At the sound of applause heard through the smoke, Kang Nan and Zulu hurriedly turned around.

"Wow, impressive? As expected of the strongest man."

The familiar voice and familiar tone made Kang Nan's face turn pale.

Miro was approaching with a smile.

"Long time no see? I heard our handsome guy was working hard, so I thought I'd come give some comfort. Have you been well?"

Though her heart couldn't help but race at meeting Gaold, she had no intention of creating a cheesy situation.

'I'll allow up to a kiss.'

Only after drawing that line could Miro come to the south, but Gaold didn't move.

"What? Are you so overwhelmed with emotion..."

At the killing intent she suddenly felt, Miro's eyes widened, and immediately Air Press fell downward.

KWAAAAANG!

As Miro hurriedly created distance, the incarnation of Thousand-Armed Guanyin had already risen behind her.

It was instinct.

"Run!"

At the same time Kang Nan shouted, Gaold charged at Miro, firing Air Guns rapidly.

"Ugh!"

The Thousand-Armed Guanyin's palm techniques shortened time to strike the bullets, but she couldn't bring herself to attack Gaold.

"I'll kill you!"

Gaold grabbed Miro's neck, pushed forward, and pinned her to the ground.

More shocking than the grip strength that seemed like it would break her neck was Gaold's gaze.

"Die. I said die."

It was clear hatred.

"Gaold... why?"

"Feelings of love are bound to become dull. Gaold was amazing for protecting that even in pain. But now it's the limit."

Even those memories were disappearing.

"Instead of forgetting you, Gaold chose to hate. That way he can endure a little longer."

"Ugh..."

Watching Gaold strangling Miro with indifference, Zulu spoke in Middle Eastern.

"Extremely human."
