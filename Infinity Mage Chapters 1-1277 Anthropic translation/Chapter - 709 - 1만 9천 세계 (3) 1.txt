[709] The 19,000 Worlds (3)

Venda.

The colossal, overwhelming power of law brought Lian before the sorceress's eyes, disrupting the gears of logic like a twisted mechanism.

'Venda!'

The force of the great sword plunging down vertically carried a transcendent quality that couldn't be measured by speed or impact alone.

'I'll end it here!'

Faced with this life-or-death strike that gave no thought to what came next, the sorceress experienced a paralyzing sensation in her brain.

'A natural enemy?'

When something is perfectly split in two, humans become unable to choose between this side and that side.

'Conviction violates the ethics of beasts.'

The sorceress's monstrous senses were destroyed at that point.

"Kiyaaaaa!"

Letting out a bestial cry, the sorceress retreated with tremendous power like that erupting from a V-12 engine.

"She dodged?"

The crushing disappointment of a world going dark lasted only a moment before Lian, burning with the single-minded determination to protect Shirone, charged forward again.

Watching the two figures rapidly moving away, Kido took a deep breath and glared ahead.

"Get inside Andre! Kill the mage!"

Dozens of Maga bandits who had already received orders from the sorceress were rushing toward Kido.

'Can I do this?'

If it were just about fighting, dying would be the end of it, but if Kido fell, Shirone would be the next target.

He swallowed hard.

'I'm thirsty.'

His throat was parched to the point of madness.

The place Shirone had reached was the center of the labyrinth he had confirmed with Andre's three-dimensional model.

The key was fitting all 19,000 entrances within the Spirit Zone, and by his estimation, it would be extremely close.

'If I activate Quantum Superposition in this state...'

The Ultima System, acquired independently rather than through sensory integration, was still imperfect.

As incidents multiplied, control would become impossible, and unintended experiences would contaminate Shirone's ego.

'I have no choice.'

Like glaring at Guffin waiting at the end of fate, Shirone widened his eyes and cast his magic.

Quantum Superposition.

The Wheel of Emptiness.

It began with a double overlay.

And the two began endlessly generating incidents toward infinity, starting to fill Andre's labyrinth completely.

"Graaah!"

From World Name No. 1 to No. 19,000.

Codes that could only be deciphered by the Ultima System unraveled in Shirone's hands as the iron doors burst with light.

'Who am I?'

Shirone collapsed to his knees.

As his consciousness grew dim, he couldn't recall his name, his age, or even the fact that he was human.

"......"

Finally, as control was lost, countless Shirones began to unfold independent incidents.

If this world was someone's dream, then the lives of the Shirones now manifesting were also created by the original's mind.

"I will definitely return."

As every Shirone spoke while looking back at their own universe, all 19,000 worlds opened simultaneously.

A tremendous light swelled and then fell silent again.

At the top of the Ivory Tower, the artificial planet.

The seven stars and Araka discovered Mahagaruta guarding the Great Earth Temple where Taesung resided.

'It's a Five-Star.'

Though there was no hierarchy among the stars, this wasn't due to logic of equality, but because it was fundamentally meaningless.

Anyone capable of gauging the depths of enlightenment would have no choice but to acknowledge it from the heart, without needing to mention ranks or classes.

Especially Mini, Borvol, and Tsuoi were feeling in their very skin what it meant to be "heaven above heaven."

'An enlightened one...'

If those who understood Luber and Noe were extremely few, then perhaps Taesung was the only one who understood the essence of the Five-Stars.

While the 2-star residents made a mental fuss, the 3-stars Arte and Heukgangsi didn't act rashly.

Luber stepped forward as representative.

"Buddha, it has truly been a long time."

As Mahagaruta lifted his eyelids, golden radiance filled his pupils completely.

Though the light in his eyes was truly bizarre, his smile was warm.

"Indeed, Luber. We shared many conversations in the past. I miss those times."

"Since you don't sleep, we cannot meet. Perhaps you could find time to visit us soon?"

"I'm already having quite pleasant dreams."

After this Zen-like exchange, Mahagaruta slowly turned his body while maintaining his lotus position in midair.

"Please enter. Taesung is waiting."

As Mahagaruta's golden light exploded, the white radiance faded to reveal the magnificent sight of the Great Earth Temple.

As if everything until now had been a dream, or as if this itself was a dream.

"Taesung, we have come at your summons."

A woman in pure white robes stood with her hands clasped behind her back on the glass floor of the Great Earth Temple, from which planets could be seen below.

Like universal gravitation, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that all the stars of the Ivory Tower orbited around her.

"Welcome, my children."

Her voice was clear and pure, cleansing the mind of every speck of dust.

"Sit wherever you're comfortable."

As Taesung sat down on the glass floor overlooking the vast lands of Kashan, the stars gathered around her.

"The reason I called you today is..."

Since debates had been raging even before meeting Taesung, everyone focused on her lips.

"Today is my birthday."

At first, they thought it was a joke.

'Birthday? Taesung has a birthday?'

Though they knew nothing about her, they had thought she wouldn't share concepts similar to humans.

Borvol spoke first.

"Uh... Happy birthday. Hello?"

Taesung playfully responded.

"What good are just words? You should give me a present."

While the 2-stars visibly panicked, the expressions of the 3-stars gradually became serious.

"Are you serious? Then this year you turn...?"

"Hehe, actually I'm past the age for celebrating birthdays. I just remembered the old days. I missed you all. That's all."

Though her words were heartwarming, the cold rationality of the stars quickly identified the source of their unease.

"Taesung, we still need you."

When someone at the pinnacle of intelligence became emotional, it surely meant tremendous events were occurring in the world.

Arte spoke with intensity in her eyes.

"Please tell us. Is it the Altar? Anke Ra? Nane? Or Shirone? I will resolve it."

Taesung shook her head.

"If you destroy everything just because you have the power to destroy, then ultimately nothing would have value worth existing. Everything exists without reason, and that's why it can be precious."

The atmosphere became solemn.

"Um, Taesung."

Tsuoi quietly raised her hand and asked.

"Who did you vote for this time?"

Though it was a question thrown out to change the mood, she couldn't avoid the glares from Arte and Heukgangsi.

"Hehe, who do you think I voted for?"

Mini said.

"Obviously Nane. Though Shirone and Jinseong-um are excellent too, Nane is on a different level. His Kar value is also the highest."

"Kar is not a tool for competition."

Taesung said, bringing her hands together.

"Think of this universe as a small room. When you first enter, all enlightenment comes at once - smells, shapes, colors, atmosphere. Anyone could say they roughly know this room, which is why achieving a 50 percent Kar value is easy."

Taesung's palms slowly opened.

"But to know more precisely, more than the five senses must be employed. The position of objects, their uses, the history embedded in them, their meanings. That's why the closer to perfection, the harder it becomes to raise the Kar value."

Taesung spread both arms wide.

"Now, imagine you've grasped everything. You've understood everything about the room, even knowing every speck of dust settled in the corners. So finally, is that 100 percent Kar?"

Everyone remained silent.

"It can never be. Even if you've grasped everything in this room, how do you prove it? Might there be something you missed? Is what I know actually true?"

"There's no one who can say they know their own room perfectly."

"Right. That 0.01 percent missing from 100 percent, or perhaps an even smaller piece - its identity is..."

Taesung's palms gently came to rest on her chest.

"The heart."

"The heart..."

"To perfectly realize that you've reached perfection, the heart must necessarily function. Something Nane lacks but Shirone possesses. If variables arise, it will probably be a matter of the heart."

As the stars each fell into thought, Tsuoi pointed at Taesung and asked.

"Then as expected... the person who voted for Shirone?"

Taesung stuck out her tongue playfully and smiled with her eyes.

"That's a secret."

The Labyrinth Pytharos.

A lawful lowland where the world's turbid energy flowed, an impregnable fortress that countless monks had challenged since ancient times to destroy evil, but had never once succeeded.

"So this is the Hole of Corruption?"

When Canis and Arin arrived, numerous organizations were still camped outside the pitch-black cave of the labyrinth.

They were all renowned masters from around the world, and after confirming their identities, Arin said.

"Canis, let's reconsider this. This definitely isn't right. The difficulty is too high to start with."

Pytharos, viewed through Chokyo, appeared as a damp, moist, slimy form like the gaping entrance to intestines.

"That's exactly why it's worth challenging. If we conquer even just the entrance, we'll make a name for ourselves instantly."

Canis and Arin, who had failed their graduation exam, had dropped out of magic school and were wandering the world investigating ruins.

Canis's dream was to be an archaeologist, and Arin actively supported that dream, but this time it felt like reckless bravado.

"If I give up now, I feel like I'll never accomplish anything. If you're scared, stay here. I'll go in alone if I have to."

Knowing Canis's stubbornness, Arin sighed.

"Fine, I'll go with you. But promise me you'll listen to me when it's truly dangerous."

Just as Canis nodded spiritedly, Arin suddenly turned toward the wilderness.

A boy with tattoos densely covering his face was slowly walking forward, wearing a tattered hood.

"Ca, Canis..."

Her voice trembled with serious concern.

'It's not Chokyo. Too clear an incarnation...'

Taking in the distant sight of Pytharos, Nane walked forward with calm eyes.

Nane's time was different from everyone else's time.

Kar value 97.8 percent.

Nane's thoughts were different from everyone else's thoughts.

Kar value 98.2 percent.

"...I understand."

Kar value 99.1 percent.

For him who had experienced every path, the enlightenment gained in the world of apostles functioned as the ultimate synthesis.

"Ah, I was mistaken."

Through nearly infinite combinations, he was approaching perfection.

Kar value 99.3 percent.

With each step, enormous barriers seemed to crumble one by one, leaving Canis breathless.

"This is impossible..."

Having fallen on her backside with a thud, Canis looked up at Nane as he passed by indifferently.

'Shirone, honestly, you're amazing too, but...'

Why was Shirone coming to mind at this moment?

'This guy is on a different level. He surpasses you.'

'Seven steps.'

The remaining distance to Pytharos.

'Six steps.'

As the distance decreased, Nane's Kar value endlessly broke through seemingly insurmountable limits.

'One step.'

Briefly stopping the universe, Nane took his final step on the ground and looked up at the sky.

"I have achieved enlightenment."

Kar value 99.99 percent.

As everyone held their breath and watched, Nane pointed to the sky with his right hand and to the earth with his left, saying:

"In heaven and earth, I alone am honored."
