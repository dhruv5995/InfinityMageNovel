[589] The Mastermind (4)

"Scramble Royale has ended."

Collie, the senior class head teacher, entered the principal's office.

Alpheas stood with his hands behind his back, gazing out the window, while Vice Principal Olivia sat on the sofa with her legs crossed, lost in thought.

"Shirone's team has won."

Olivia let out a sigh of relief.

"That's fortunate. At least we can now block the Underground Research Society's approach."

Alpheas spoke up.

"It's good that the incident didn't escalate. But Shirone's team winning means they'll be approaching the heart of the matter."

"How would you know that? We don't even know what Estas's core secret actually is."

Alpheas turned from the window and sat at his desk.

"Right. Until Miro opens her mouth, no one will know."

Even though there were two people with voting rights in the Council of Twenty, they knew nothing concrete about the upper echelons.

"But Shirone was with Miro. Maybe she told him something."

"Then he'd be even less likely to investigate Estas. Shirone's curiosity is remarkable, but he's also cautious. He's not foolish enough to carelessly dig into global secrets."

"I hope that's the case."

There was an unpleasant aftertaste to Alpheas's agreement.

'If possible, it would be best to let this remain buried.'

As a mage, he desperately wanted to know Estas's true identity, but too many factions were entangled for mere curiosity to approach it safely.

"I'll step out for a moment."

Olivia rose from the sofa and headed for the door.

"Where are you going? Don't cause unnecessary trouble. It's best if Estas just closes down like this."

"I know that. That's exactly why I'm going."

Murderous intent flashed in Olivia's eyes as she left the room.

'There's exactly one person who's bothering me.'

Though the girls' dormitory rooms were basically equipped with beds, Anchal sat cross-legged on the bare floor, deep in meditation.

When the bell chimed past midnight, she slowly opened her eyes, sat at her desk, and pulled a small brush from her robes.

The brush handle was thin, and the tip even thinner.

Above a scroll of paper that would fit perfectly if you overlapped two fingers, a brush tip finer than a hair strand trembled.

Each tremor of her fingertips began filling the paper densely with the language of Jincheon.

To His Imperial Majesty, whom I revere

I now stand before the secret of the 'Fragment'.

Though I do not fear death, considering the difficulty of this mission, I worry I may not fulfill my duties.

Therefore, I intend to unseal the family heirloom Demon Eye that Your Great Imperial Majesty bestowed upon us, so please forgive my meager abilities.

I will spare no effort and surely return with the 'Fragment'.

Long live His Imperial Majesty.

Long live the Jincheon Empire.

Anchal carefully set down the brush, waited for the ink to dry, then rolled up the scroll.

"Hong-gyu."

As the name was called, two giant eyes snapped open on the ceiling as if painted there.

"Yes, Director."

Anchal.

Director of the 'Jincheon Space Agency', which handled the most classified matters within the Jincheon Empire's External Intelligence Department.

She was also a global secret-holder serving as advisor to the analysis agency for Valkyrie's reset system.

"You'll need to deliver this personally."

"Leave it to me."

When Anchal tossed the scroll upward, a tongue shot out from the mouth on the ceiling, snatched it, and swallowed it whole.

"Forgive my impudence, but please be careful. It's no exaggeration to say Jincheon's future rests in your hands, Director."

"...I understand."

The painting on the ceiling faded away like drying ink, and Anchal held her head in her hands, lost in thought.

'Estas.'

By now, Scramble Royale would have ended.

Though it had become a match where either side's victory didn't matter, Anchal thought it would be slightly better if Shirone's team won.

'If I use Sibulsangpokmae's ability...'

She hadn't initially planned to involve Shirone, but after realizing time could be manipulated, even Scramble Royale itself had become meaningless.

'Fermi will start moving soon too. He probably obtained Estas's blueprints.'

Though she needed help from both sides, Anchal could abandon either one depending on circumstances.

Just as she finished thinking and walked toward the bed, someone knocked on her door.

"Anchal, are you in there?"

'Vice Principal Olivia.'

Thinking that what had to come had come, Anchal instantly composed her expression and opened the door, pretending to know nothing.

"Vice Principal? What brings you here at this hour?"

"I'd like to have a chat. May I come in?"

Though the room contained no trace of even minor mistakes, she honestly didn't want to let in someone who was a certified Second-Class Grand Mage.

"Or shall we talk outside?"

Olivia's voice was beautiful as a nightingale's, but tonight it carried a sharpness that pierced the heart.

"Yes. I'll listen outside. I wanted some fresh air anyway."

As soon as they left the building, Olivia cast spatial movement without warning and flew away.

An ordinary student would have been bewildered, but Anchal also followed her without complaint.

They arrived at the opposite side of the mountain range surrounding the school, deep in the bottom of a valley.

"What's this about? Bringing a student to a place like this—what are you planning?"

"Anchal, how old are you?"

"..."

If she'd come here intending to settle things, Anchal had no reason to keep lying.

"Thirty-two years old."

"I thought so. Eastern people really do look young."

"Not particularly in the East. So what do you want to know? Estas's secret? My identity?"

"If possible, everything."

Anchal shook her head.

"I've always thought you weren't a foolish person. Not paying attention would be better for both you and the school."

The rulers of Jincheon were none other than the Three Imperial Houses.

"I have no intention of getting caught up in imperial conflicts. But Estas is strictly private property. And I'm the person entrusted with full authority to manage it by the owner."

"I'll make sure no harm comes to the school."

"That's for me to judge after hearing what you have to say."

"I'm sorry. I have nothing to tell you."

"Really?"

Olivia slightly parted her lips and cast supersonic arts, producing syllables at the highest frequency humans could hear.

The sounds reflecting off the cliffs amplified, tormenting Anchal's eardrums.

'Loud noise. So that's why she chose this place.'

While Anchal's mind was dizzy, Olivia finished reciting incantations equivalent to a full textbook and cast her magic.

'Great Expansion.'

As the air expanded, the valley dozens of meters high collapsed inward.

Rumble rumble rumble!

After the spectacular landslide ended, no valley remained within human sight.

Olivia landed on the rocks that had filled the valley, her eyes flashing momentarily.

Jincheon Arts

Giant.

The moment she launched herself, a 20-meter giant appeared and brought down its fist.

CRASH!

As the giant's arm pierced through the rocks and buried itself up to the shoulder, even Olivia couldn't help but break into a cold sweat.

'An illusion destroyed physical matter...'

Like searching for a buried ring in soil, the giant swept its arm around and pulled Anchal from deep underground.

The leather eyepatch covering one eye was torn, revealing the bluish pupil contained within.

"Is that the Demon Eye?"

The giant placed Anchal on the ground and disappeared.

"What kind of behavior is this? Do you really intend to fight me?"

"For the school's safety, there's nothing I won't do."

"Don't get cocky, Olivia. I'm a soldier. Even if you're a Grand Mage, I'm not someone a teacher can handle."

As Anchal tore off the leather eyepatch, Olivia added:

"I don't want to get involved in imperial secrets. But this is about students. Convince me why it's Shirone, why Fermi is interested in Estas. This is the maximum I can offer. If you refuse even this..."

Olivia opened her lips and said:

"I'll gladly face you."

"..."

After thinking for a long while, Anchal extinguished the Demon Eye's light and sat down on the rocks.

"I'm an agent of the Jincheon Space Agency."

Olivia lowered her hands and leaned against the rock wall.

"My mission is to collect information about cosmic initialization—resets. So far, the universe has undergone three initializations. It started with someone called Guffin."

Anchal looked up at the sky.

"Nineteen years ago, someone called Guffin was protecting humanity from heaven. But he entrusted his mission to Miro and disappeared. This raises a question."

Anchal raised a finger.

"Why was Guffin forced to erase himself? Given that he made Miro his successor, it's hard to believe his affection for this world had cooled."

"Hmm."

"The conclusion we reached through Valkyrie's hypothesis is that Guffin had to complete through Miro something he couldn't do himself. And we believe Shirone is somehow involved in that task."

"Shirone?"

Anchal kept silent about classified information and moved to the next topic.

"Guffin's erasure must have been a disaster from humanity's perspective. The breakwater protecting them from heaven's army had vanished."

"There must have been strong backlash."

"We can't remember, but we can predict. And we estimate that Yolga, Fermi's mother, was at the center of that backlash."

"Shirone and Fermi."

"Is this enough reason to convince you? To investigate Estas, we absolutely need those two people."

"Fine. But why Estas?"

The security level jumped significantly from here, but Olivia's question was natural.

"Do you know about crack field verification experiments?"

"Roughly. It's about how the total amount of time and energy in our world is subtly misaligned, right?"

"Right. Through the Anke Ra Erasure Period and the Great Purification Period, we continuously calculated crack fields. In the process, we discovered that the crack values from Guffin's Erasure Period were always constant. The cracks should become more complex with each reset."

"What does that mean?"

"It means there's an event that absolutely never changes even as the third reset progresses."

Anchal drew a spacetime cross in the air.

"Why Estas? Unlike other ruins, Guffin's Door installed there is fixed to one coordinate in spacetime. A coordinate absolutely inaccessible unless time is stopped. The Jincheon Space Agency separated that coordinate into time and space through crack field values."

Anchal made a gesture as if grasping thread, then spread it left and right.

"Connecting spatial information through time, we concluded that an event lasting roughly three hours had occurred."

That event was the true nature of the crack that occurred during Guffin's erasure.

"In short, Guffin fixed a specific event. Why did he have to? It's different from the second and third resets."

"Are you saying that event is Estas's upper floor?"

"You know the rumors about the upper floor, right? Everything that cannot exist in this world exists there. This refers to an event. And that event is unaffected by resets."

"Is it really possible—an event unaffected even when the world is reset?"

"It's possible."

The answer was immediate.

"Of course, it would normally be difficult. However, if the event itself became a world and existed independently while connected to our world."

"Like another universe?"

Anchal nodded.

"The Jincheon Space Agency collected all information to simulate Estas's upper floor world in advance. We needed to know what kind of world it was to assess infiltration difficulty. Amazing results came out."

"Amazing results?"

"It has no beginning or end."

Looking at Olivia, Anchal rotated his finger.

"Some event that occurred on Estas's upper floor—that roughly three-hour event is repeating eternally."
