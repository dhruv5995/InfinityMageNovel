Stroke of Annihilation (1)

He endlessly divides an instant of time.

In that process, Sirone realized that this world was never truly continuous.

'This world is...'

The second hand of a clock appears to move seamlessly, filling the space from 0 to 60 seconds without gaps.

'Disconnected.'

If you endlessly divide the space between 0 and 1 second, you eventually discover the void between moments of time.

'This world is originally nothingness.'

He recalled Fisho's words that feeling something exists is merely human delusion.

'Like a video recording device.'

When dozens of photos per second are flipped rapidly, the brain cannot perceive the disconnections in the screen.

Human perception of time was the same, and Sirone thought of this as stepping stones of time.

'And when combining all these facts...'

The possibility arises that this world where all things exist is nothing more than electrical signals, not reality.

'If that's the case...'

Where does the power that's being supplied to the universe even at this moment come from?

'In the beginning was light.'

And everything began from that light.

Sirone imagined a scene where the universe suddenly turned on from a state of nothingness.

'Don't be certain. If I open the lid and imagine as I please, nothing becomes impossible.'

Only what remains closed is real.

'However, if there truly is a supplier...'

The power needed to operate the current universe wouldn't be as great as one might think.

'That's what scale means.'

The universe is vast only to humans; to the supplier, it might be no bigger than a palm.

'Thousands of universes could be created in the same tier.'

In other words, the possibility that universes similar to or completely different from this one exist outside the universe where Sirone lives.

'And if even the world where the supplier lives receives power from a higher dimension...'

In parallel, in series, new universes are created, endlessly penetrating into the void.

'It's infinite.'

It was eerie.

'How far did Garfin go?'

The Gaians escaped the photon system, but there's no guarantee that where they arrived was the final destination.

'If they continue escaping like that, what exists at the place they eventually reach?'

Fisho called it infinite nothingness.

'I think I understand a little.'

There's a world where only Sirone and an apple exist.

Sirone saw the apple and realized that nothing other than the apple existed.

'Absence. This is the nothingness humans can imagine.'

But if he couldn't see the apple from the beginning, what could Sirone think of?

'He couldn't even think that he should think of something.'

Probably the state of Sirone's mind would be...

'Truly nothing at all, and therefore the possibility where everything can exist.'

Only delusion flows without even a subject of delusion.

'In the end, everything is built up from nothingness.'

Sirone felt a little sad.

'Nane was right.'

The more he opened his senses and realized new facts, the clearer the truth of this world became.

'But I'm not wrong either.'

Nane had said so too.

'If this world is truly empty, wouldn't the place where the heart resides be the only meaning?'

Thus, before the truth of the world, emptiness and love separate.

'I will fight, Nane.'

After finishing his thoughts, Sirone found Terraforce combat soldiers waiting before his eyes.

"Have you arrived?"

The question lacked context, but Sirone, who had surpassed them in enlightenment, understood.

"Let's stop now. I don't want to fight. I just want to hear the reason why you're hostile toward me."

"We are not human."

It wasn't in a biological sense.

"To Terraforce, fighting is a dead language. We act only for the order of the universe."

"You don't like that order."

"That would be so."

The Terraforce combat soldiers extended their hands again.

"Because you are human."

The moment sound waves that shook heaven and earth rushed forward, Sirone disappeared from his position.

"Slow."

Sirone, who had somehow arrived behind all the combat soldiers, turned his body slowly and spoke.

"No, I should say distant."

The Terraforce combat soldiers quickly twisted their bodies, but Sirone was already gone from there.

Sirone, who had returned to his original position, walked leisurely with his hands behind his back.

"Infinitely distant, at that."

Or eternally slow.

"Faster than light..."

If the Terraforce combat soldiers had expressions, they would probably have looked like defeated soldiers.

"Nothing is faster than light. It doesn't mean it's impossible. It means it's meaningless."

Sirone realized that all signals forming this world are transmitted based on photons.

"The speed at which information is implemented in this world. We feel that speed by converting it to time."

Despite reaching a level that was considered theoretically impossible, Sirone's eyes remained calm.

"Therefore, being faster than light means recognizing information faster than time."

It wasn't a matter of speed, but of perception.

"I feel the space between time and time."

The world Sirone saw with the sense of Mu-tae was completely different from what his brain had perceived until now.

'There's nothing.'

There was only Terraforce where he chose to look; beyond that was a realm of nothingness with no buildings or ground.

'If you don't perceive it...'

The vast ocean beyond the Terraforce combat soldiers disappeared from Sirone's view.

'It doesn't exist in the first place.'

The moment Sirone's consciousness reaches it, specific signals implement the scenery at the speed of light.

'That's the true nature of the law.'

Now Sirone knows too.

Unless consciously perceived through the senses, no world exists behind him.

"But the reason it also exists is..."

Because the Terraforce combat soldiers were perceiving the village scenery spread behind Sirone.

'That's why it's Mu-tae.'

Sirone was also seeing the world that Ange Ra had seen and that was still reflected in Nane's eyes.

"I'll give you one last chance. Stand down."

Terraforce didn't give up.

"Didn't we tell you? Having no purpose, we don't stand down either. We act by necessity."

The Terraforce combat soldier's gauntlet fluctuated and formed a barrier of waves around Sirone.

"Realm of Nothing."

If you block even radiation beyond convection and conduction, no phenomenon can occur.

"I hate using my body, but..."

The combat soldiers who drew blade-like sharp beams from their gauntlets kicked off the ground and charged.

"There's nothing we can do about foolish humans!"

It was surprisingly fast, but it had no meaning to Sirone who perceived faster-than-light speed.

"Distant."

Sirone, who was somehow standing outside the Realm of Nothing, raised a Photon Cannon above his palm.

'It won't be as easy as crossing space.'

Since Terraforce's consciousness was also another signal forming the world, collision was essential to suppress them.

'Raising the power...'

Sirone, who raised a Photon Cannon above his palm as a test, threw it at the enemy in front.

KWAAAANG!

The flash broke through the barrier and entered.

"Kuaaaah!"

The combat soldier who screamed unlike a Terraforce flew dozens of meters and rolled on the ground.

"It worked."

If he could break through the barrier, there was nothing to fear, and dozens of Photon Cannons illuminated the night.

When the endless explosions disappeared, the lonely sound of waves rolled in.

"Whew."

Sirone, who had annihilated the Terraforce combat unit, exhaled deeply and moved his steps.

"Couldn't find out in the end?"

He had tried to leave survivors, but Terraforce didn't give up with almost manic persistence.

"What's that...?"

Looking at the horizon where dawn was breaking, Sirone saw an aircraft above the Mero cliff.

"I can't leave that behind."

When he fired a Photon Cannon, the air around the aircraft rippled like waves and blocked the impact.

Sirone, who was considering whether to increase the power, shook his head and deployed Ataraxia.

KWAAAAAAA!

A huge flash swallowed the aircraft and eventually made it disappear without a trace.

Sirone spread his光翼 and flew up into the sky.

'Time is running short.'

Just as he was about to leave the island at maximum speed, a magnificent roar was heard from within the clouds.

As the clouds scattered like smoke and an extremely small part of the aircraft was revealed, Sirone narrowed his eyes.

"Terraforce?"

A voice was heard like divine revelation.

"Come up, Sirone."

At the Chief Justice's voice, Sirone increased altitude and burrowed into the clouds.

It was a city-sized aircraft.

When he arrived at the center, a hole opened like an octopus's mouth and sucked him in, defying gravity.

No one came to greet him, but among the countless doors connecting in all directions, one opened.

Following the guided path, he arrived at a cavity the size of a village.

"We meet again, Sirone."

Thump! Thump!

Thinking that the same species would be the same size was probably only human delusion.

As the Terraforce Chief Justice approached, Sirone had no choice but to crane his neck all the way up.

"Meet again? When did we ever meet?"

Long fingers that seemed capable of penetrating a human body covered Sirone's ear.

"When I installed the memory transmission device on you. Though it seems you've removed it now."

Sirone furrowed his brow.

"You put a chip in me?"

"Yes. To be precise, you requested and persuaded me, and I complied."

"What?"

He definitely had no memory of it, and even if he did, he wouldn't have made such a request.

"What was the reason?"

The Chief Justice turned around.

"Sit down first. I'll take you to the Ivory Tower. I have something to tell you."

Sirone climbed onto a chair that seemed fit for a giant, sat cross-legged, and waited.

The Chief Justice, who had set the destination, returned.

"First, I should apologize. I thought your opinion had merit, but other members of my race thought differently."

"What do you mean?"

"Extremists. They found out about the chip implanted in you and hacked the transmission. If you hadn't destroyed their ships, I wouldn't have been able to find you either."

"In other words... it has nothing to do with you?"

"I'm not trying to make excuses. It's my mistake. However, I want to make it clear that it wasn't the will of all Terraforce."

"I don't understand. You have minds far superior to humans, yet you can't coordinate opinions."

"It's not a common occurrence. It also means your opinion was that groundbreaking. But to be precise..."

The Chief Justice brought his face close to Sirone.

"Even we, who rule the universe, haven't achieved an integrated mental system."

Sirone closed his mouth.

"Gaians. Unique. When you think about it, how difficult and great is that? Being able to think as one while maintaining individual diversity."

The Chief Justice pointed at Sirone's head.

"To explain the human level, it's about this much. Murderers should be punished. Most would agree. But even this - from the murderer's perspective, they think differently."

It's not perfect integration.

"Terraforce is a bit better. At a crossroads, should we go left or right? The correct answer varies by situation, but our choices are always identical without exception. Our standards for action are that perfectly established."

"But you split this time."

The Chief Justice withdrew his hand with an awkward feeling.

"Yes. That's how difficult a problem it is - an integrated mental system. And that's also why, even though you've opened the 10th sense..."

A thick voice echoed.

"You cannot open the Ultima System."

This had been a question lingering in one corner of Sirone's mind since he realized Mu-tae.
