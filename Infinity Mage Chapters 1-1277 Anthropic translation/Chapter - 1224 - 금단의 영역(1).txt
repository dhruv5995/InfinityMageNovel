Forbidden Territory (1)

"You want to go out into the human world?" asked Lutia, the chief of the Fire Tribe.

"Yes, Chief. I want to help my husband change the human world. I believe it's my calling."

Yorahan expressed his apology through silence.

'To the Chief, Armang is like a special daughter. The pain of letting her go must be great.'

Above all, she was the only warrior with an active disposition capable of protecting the Fire Tribe.

"I see."

Lutia smiled warmly.

"So this day has finally come. The Fire Tribe must help humans. That is our reason for existence, passed down from our ancestors."

Realizing her sincerity, Yorahan suddenly had this thought:

'Who were they, the ancestral Fire Tribe?'

The Fire Tribe was generally passive, so their identity should have naturally faded over time.

'Yet they've maintained one calling throughout all this time. This isn't a matter of disposition.'

It was some kind of enlightenment.

'Before truth, neither active nor passive can exist. The first Fire Tribe knew this.'

About humans, about human life...

'Perhaps even more deeply than I do.'

Yorahan spoke for the first time.

"We won't be leaving immediately. The forces of the Mikas Kingdom are encroaching on Fire Tribe territory. At this rate, contact will be made within a month. I'll find a suitable place for the Fire Tribe to relocate."

"Hehe. You're always so considerate, Yorahan."

Yorahan's face reddened.

"Don't worry. I know the Fire Tribe better than anyone. Though we may be passive, that's also how we've continued to exist. We'll manage well."

Armang stepped forward.

"But Chief, humans are..."

Lutia cut her off.

"Yes, they're a dangerous species. But Armang, you must now understand them. How else could you follow your husband's will?"

She turned to look at Yorahan and continued.

"Leave tomorrow if you must. I'll handle the Fire Tribe's relocation myself. The world we see is different from the world humans see. No matter how good a sanctuary you find, it won't be a place where flowers can bloom."

The Fire Tribe could sustain themselves through photosynthesis alone.

"Understood."

Having received Lutia's permission, Yorahan and Armang returned home to pack.

Their movements were sluggish, as befitted such a precious place.

'I really don't want to leave. But if I keep putting it off day by day, I'll end up living here forever.'

Fighting back tears for the sake of his dream, he discovered a box he'd placed under the bed.

"Huh? This is..."

After touching the dagger he hadn't taken out since arriving at the Fire Tribe village, he turned his head.

"Honey, can I use the whetstone?"

"Why the dagger? You never even looked at it before."

"We're going out into the human world. I used to carry it all the time. I need to carry something like this to avoid bad people."

Armang chuckled.

"What are you worried about? I'll protect you."

Then she embraced Yorahan from behind and whispered in his ear.

"And I guarantee you'll never be able to use that thing. You tremble just preparing a sparrow."

They knew everything about each other.

"Tch! Says who? At least I can threaten people with it. Who wouldn't be scared of someone holding a rusty sword?"

Armang shook her head at Yorahan stubbornly insisting and pulling out the whetstone.

"Honestly..."

Still, it was reassuring, truth be told.

At dawn, Yorahan, who had been sleeping in bed, opened his eyes to screams from outside.

"What, what's that...!"

By the time he sat up, Armang was already heading out the door with her longsword in hand.

Fire Tribe children approached with pale faces.

"Sister! Something terrible has happened!"

"What's wrong?"

Yorahan followed and looked outside to see a group of soldiers occupying the village entrance.

"Cavalry?"

They were armed with metal armor, and their banner bore the emblem of a lion's face.

"House Mikas."

There was no doubt about it, but the force was too small to have broken through this naturally fortified remote area.

'The kingdom's strategy was gradual encroachment alongside development projects. But why...?'

Yorahan looked at the cavalry's leader.

Still bearing the marks of youth but with a cleft chin and intense eyes was a man.

'Probably the eldest son of House Mikas... Mikas Areon.'

'He would have been fifteen when I heard about him three years ago, so eighteen this year. Desperate to prove his imperial bloodline.'

Though unpopular, Yorahan was also a thinker, so he could easily read the nature of those in power.

A pale-faced scholar rode up beside Areon.

"Your Highness, this appears to be the Fire Tribe village. Please give us our next strategic orders."

"Hmm, the Fire Tribe."

Areon stroked his chin.

'They have strange abilities, but according to records, they're not dangerous. Rather, they're a slave race that obeys any command.'

It was a scholar's record.

'In other words, I can have servants who will never betray me. This too is essential for a king. No wonder the old man was so determined with his development projects.'

Of course, there were dozens of other reasons.

'Anyway, I arrived before Father did. I made it here through that forest.'

The ambitious Areon had connections with many talented individuals, one of whom was Fisk beside him.

The person who had accurately navigated through the maze-like forest.

"Fisk."

Areon spoke.

"This place will be the first conquest in my history. If I bring back the Fire Tribe, even Father will acknowledge me."

His succession to the throne would be secured.

"He'll surely think of you as the rightful heir to a great king. None of your brothers have achieved such a feat."

Areon pointed his sword forward.

"Conquer them."

The moment the command was given, over 100 cavalry charged forward at terrifying speed.

The Fire Tribe members watched in bewilderment, not knowing what to do, when Chief Lutia shouted.

"Run!"

Armang rushed against the flow of people, drew her sword, and charged at the cavalry.

Yorahan followed.

"Honey!"

"Don't come! Stay as far away as possible!"

"I'm coming with you."

"Are you crazy? You'll die! Protect the children. You can lead them. The Chief can't handle it alone."

"Ugh."

At these undeniably correct words, Yorahan bit his lip and turned away.

"Just buy time and get out!"

Armang nodded, cleared her mind of distractions, and focused on combat.

"Precision Control."

Her sword flew through the air, and fountains of blood spurted between the knights' steel gauntlets.

Watching the knights fall one by one, Areon's eyes sparkled.

"Who is that woman?"

Fisk opened his notebook.

"Among the Fire Tribe, there are extremely rare individuals with active dispositions. They're called carnivores. Combined with their unique abilities, they display tremendous combat power."

"She's certainly strong."

Areon added.

"And strength is beautiful. Fisk, I need to capture that woman. Can we take her alive?"

"Yes."

Fisk was capable.

"Divide the cavalry into three groups. One unit blocks the escape route, one captures the civilians. Finish in three minutes."

When the aide signaled with flags, the cavalry scattered in perfect formation like they'd been cut with a blade.

Yorahan grasped the enemy's strategy.

'We can't outrun cavalry. At this rate, everyone will be captured. We need to fight back somehow...'

A sudden thought struck him, and he spoke to Lutia.

"Chief! To the forest!"

When the Fire Tribe entered the forest, the cavalry hesitated briefly before abandoning their horses and rushing in.

"Hah! Even so, they can't even attack... Huh?"

As if the forest itself came alive, all manner of plants and insects began attacking the knights.

"Damn it! They're using strange techniques!"

No matter how many branches they cut, the attacks were endless, and eventually their stamina began to run out.

Surveying the forest, Fisk said.

"They're putting up quite a fight."

"It's the same for them though. Are they properly trained?"

Those granted full authority also had much to be responsible for. Fisk dismounted and spread both arms.

"I'll handle this."

Suddenly, strong winds centered around him, and with both feet off the ground, he flew like an arrow.

At the unexpected approach, Armang hastily twisted her body, but his hand grazed her shoulder.

Fisk said.

"Slow."

In that moment, Armang felt something unfamiliar.

'What is this?'

If this had been Sirone's era, she might have thought it similar to electricity.

"Ugh!"

But for her in the present, there was no way to understand the phenomenon of air becoming as sharp as a blade.

Clutching the cut wound on her forearm, she stepped back as Fisk landed again.

Armang, calling her sword back, asked.

"Hidden weapons?"

"No."

Fisk extended his hand.

"The power of the mind."

"Woman, I am one who seeks the truth of the world. My king seeks you, so surrender quietly. Then no one will be harmed."

"Hmph."

Armang bared her fangs and swung her sword.

"You underestimate the Fire Tribe. We may love peace, but we're not cowards who fear death."

In the distance, the forest shook and exhausted knights emerged holding their heads.

"I've seen it in ancient texts. The hypothesis about synchronizing with all of nature seems to be true. However..."

Fisk raised his hand above his head.

"Humans dominate the phenomena of all nature, and this is the fifth element that unifies fire, water, earth, and air."

The air heated up, and an amber-sized fireball formed above his palm.

"It's called mental concentration."

At the sight of fire being created without using anything, Armang's expression went blank.

"Fireball."

When he swung his arm, the fireball traced a parabolic arc and fell at the forest entrance.

"No!"

An explosion occurred, and black smoke began rising from within the forest.

Fisk said.

"How is it? Far more powerful than natural fire. This is the potential humans possess."

As the residents, choking on smoke, emerged from the forest again, the cavalry surrounded them.

"Choose. If you abandon their lives, you might live. Will you fight, or will you surrender?"

And so the battle ended. Though mutual sacrifices meant the cavalry's losses were greater than expected, Areon was in good spirits.

"Is everyone gathered?"

While all the Fire Tribe members had assembled with terrified expressions, Armang looked around.

'Where's Yorahan?'

He was nowhere to be seen.

If he had escaped, nothing would make her happier, but the opposite was also possible, weighing heavily on her heart.

'Please, please just be alive.'

Areon spoke.

"I am a prince of the Mikas Kingdom. From today, this territory will become Mikas domain, and you will all be subjects of the kingdom. If anyone denies this..."

While the lengthy speech continued, Yorahan was watching the situation through a gap in the warehouse.

'They were captured after all.'

Leading the Fire Tribe to drive off the cavalry had gone well, but then the forest suddenly caught fire.

'Magic.'

That's what they called it, he'd heard.

'What do I do now?'

As long as the children were held hostage, Armang would never draw her sword.

'Outrunning cavalry is impossible. Even if it were possible, if even one person falls behind, the Fire Tribe won't run. But if we're taken like this...'

Suddenly, Yorahan's eyebrows twitched.

'There is a way!'

A method to escape with everyone.

'I don't know what judgment the mage will make, but no, it's not luck. They absolutely cannot follow us.'

Now only one thing remained.

'Can I do it?'

Yorahan's eyes were more intense than ever as he fingered the dagger in his breast.
