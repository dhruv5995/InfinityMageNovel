The Only Chance (2)

Maron Parts Shop.

The automatic door opened, and Shirone's party's data was remotely transmitted to the company.

"First, let's buy a large quantity of explosive rounds..."

Just as Destroyer707 was explaining to Shirone and entering the shop, the second floor became noisy.

"Huh?"

A man in a tuxedo was hurriedly coming down with robot guides in tow.

"Welcome! I'm the manager of Maron Company's Atogram branch!"

He was also a robot, but so precise that you couldn't tell the difference from a human.

Users murmured among themselves.

"What? That's the branch manager? I saw him once during High Gear's early days, and this is the first time since then."

"Right. Are they having a discount event or something?"

Shirone stared intently at the branch manager's face, which was grinning like a seagull.

'It's probably because of this.'

Next to the Golden Ring guild mark was registered the serial number of an unlimited credit card.

Destroyer707 said, "We want to buy parts and some equipment. There's a lot of stuff - can you prepare it quickly?"

"I'll do my absolute best to rush it."

"First, three Centurion sets, one Maron integrated unit, fourteen boxes of armor-piercing rounds for Centurions, and one auxiliary charging device. Please get us these."

As the manager's eyes lit up, all the guides working in the shop scattered in all directions.

The users were dumbfounded.

"Buying Centurion sets from a shop? Buying from users would be three times cheaper."

"Look at their mark. It's Golden Ring."

"Oh, right. So did they launder their codename?"

"No, they're probably new members. Golden Ring has no reason to launder codenames. Those guys must be the ones Aegis took from the free plaza earlier."

Before the conversation could even end, the manager had neatly stacked the ordered items in front of them.

"Here you are. The payment..."

Destroyer707 said, "I'll handle it."

The moment he finished speaking, the credit card flashed and displayed payment complete.

'Even the balance doesn't show. This is really incredible.'

Literally a blank check.

He realized anew the scale of Golden Ring, but the pressure of time felt even greater.

'Level 100 in 2 days. This is insane.'

Destroyer707, having regained his senses, urged them on.

"First, Yahweh2 and I, plus Deathprincess get Centurion sets, Strongestcodename gets the Maron integrated unit."

When they touched the boxes, an 'instant replacement' display appeared.

"Just approve it. Reselling existing parts to the shop also takes time. Instant replacement doesn't work otherwise."

This was to prevent losses due to poor judgment.

Shortly after, Shirone's party's bodies changed, and Maron package parts scattered everywhere.

"Let's go, let's go. No time."

Without even glancing at the fallen parts, they left the shop as the manager bowed deeply.

"Please visit us again anytime."

The users looked back and forth between the scattered parts and the exit with blank expressions.

"...What are they in such a hurry for?"

Mago's Stronghold.

A place where the average creature level was 20 - too challenging for Shirone's party's current level to hunt.

"Listen carefully. The reason I chose Centurion sets isn't just because they're the most expensive, but because the basic firearm is a shotgun."

Thud thud!

The three people's mechs were as heavy as heavy infantry armor, with upper arms swollen like balloons.

"Weapon deploy."

Their forearms opened and gun barrels protruded. Shirone aimed forward in that state.

Auto-aim calculated hit probability based on range.

"Yeah. The program automatically switches. The range is much wider but the firing distance is shorter."

"The power also drops slightly compared to bolt guns. Though that's calculated per individual projectile."

Strongestcodename said, "That's why we use armor-piercing rounds."

His mech, having chosen the Maron integrated unit, was closer to a transport armored vehicle than a person.

"Ammunition types are expensive, but among them, armor-piercing rounds are premium items. Even without penetration judgment, they can punch through most armor. So normally you'd buy one 20-round magazine and only use it in emergencies. But we have fourteen boxes - that's 1,680 rounds."

Deathprincess said, "We'll lure the creatures and Yahweh2 will take them down. Strongestcodename will keep supplying ammunition. That way we can reduce travel time. The problem is power..."

Destroyer707 said, "The auxiliary charging device is just a temporary measure. It only charges up to 10 percent maximum. In other words, we'll use it to return after completely draining our power here. 100 percent charging can only be done in Mid Gear."

This was why solar warfare was important.

"Got it. I understand."

When they arrived at the center of Mago's stronghold, the forest disappeared and a huge clearing appeared.

Countless users were shooting at mechanical gorilla-type creatures swarming from all directions.

Shirone immediately realized.

'They're strong creatures.'

At least in High Gear they were.

Except for lacking ranged attacks, their speed and armor durability matched the users.

"Let's start too."

Destroyer707 moved with heavy steps toward the forest outskirts, raising his arm.

'Spraying armor-piercing rounds as shotgun pellets. I imagined it, but...'

Now it was reality.

"Growl! Growl! Growl!"

Like a recorder playing on repeat, the Magos roared and charged.

The AI calculated the shotgun's radius, and the moment the Mago's large body was caught in the aim.

"Fire."

KABOOM!

With a thunderous roar, the mechanical gorilla's body was shredded like paper.

"Success! The strategy worked!"

Twenty users gathered in the clearing stared at the cheering Destroyer707.

"What? Did he take it down in one shot?"

Strongestcodename set down a box of armor-piercing rounds and said, "Then I'll go back to Atogram again. One more time should get us to our target level."

The Maron integrated unit quickly moved away, and Shirone and Deathprincess, having watched the demonstration, joined the battle.

Bang bang! Bang! Bang!

No matter where the shotgun pellets came from, they couldn't be avoided, and it was undoubtedly instant death.

'Fast. My level already went up.'

Every time they killed a level 20 Mago, he could see the experience gauge rising.

Originally, Mago's stronghold was a hunting ground where users enjoyed the tension of encirclement formations, but...

"Groooowl!"

Currently, the Magos were being wiped out, and most users were just watching in a daze.

"Level 15."

The growth speed was thrilling, but Shirone's expression was serious after quickly calculating.

'Will this work? If the required experience keeps increasing, 2 days is really tight.'

It needed to be even more efficient than this.

Just then, a user who hadn't been here long shouted angrily at Shirone.

"Hey! Let us hunt too! What are we supposed to do when you kill fifty while we kill one!"

A nearby user approached and stopped him.

"Cut it out, idiot. Those guys are Golden Ring. If you mess with them wrong, we'll all get purged."

"Huh?"

After checking the mark next to Yahweh2, he blinked for a moment then tried to act tough.

"Tch, so what if they're Golden Ring? Let them purge me. I'll just launder my codename."

"That's your business. But if we get caught up in it..."

shirone said, "Sorry. We have circumstances. We'll hunt a little more then leave."

Engine sounds came from the distance, then Strongestcodename set down a box of armor-piercing rounds.

"Is the timing okay? It's fourteen boxes."

"Just barely made it."

Shirone's party, having reloaded with armor-piercing rounds, hunted the Magos that had gathered again.

"Level 20."

The hunting was over.

"Let's head back. How much power is left?"

"2 percent remaining."

Destroyer707 opened his chest armor and installed the auxiliary charger, saying, "12 percent total should be enough to reach Atogram. I deliberately calculated and chose this place. After a full charge in Mid Gear, we should be able to run 10 kilometers."

Shirone's party, having installed auxiliary batteries, immediately left Mago's stronghold.

"They're gone."

Only the armor-piercing round boxes worth 1 million galactic credits that Shirone's party left behind remained there alone.

On the way back to Atogram, Deathprincess said, "Let's start buying selective options. Turbo activates at level 20, so hunting speed will get faster."

Shirone purchased communication and turbo from the electronic shop.

Destroyer707 said, "Many selective options link with parts functions. In other words, even if you unlock communication, you can't use it without communication equipment in your parts. Same with turbo."

"Yeah. But I can use both now?"

"Of course. It's a Centurion set after all - that much is standard. But you'll need to consider it later."

Strongestcodename said, "You guys go with turbo. While Yahweh2 charges in Mid Gear, I'll level up too. Deathprincess will handle transport."

Shirone activated turbo and shot forward like a bullet, feeling twice the output.

"Whew!"

He could see the power draining, but it seemed like it would last until Atogram.

Upon reaching the city, Destroyer707 found a Mid Gear charging station and requested rapid charging.

Deathprincess said through communication, "When you enter Mid Gear, external information gets cut off. In other words, it's a reset. Normally people disconnect during charging as well, but since we don't have time, let's come right out."

"What do you mean come right out?"

"Exactly what I said. Rapid charging takes 20 minutes in High Gear time, but you can skip that process. In other words, if you go in and come out, 20 minutes will have passed."

Shirone blinked.

'Time flows quickly? Maybe this world is...'

Communication cut off and as Shirone entered the capsule, cables descended and connected to his mech.

Do you wish to skip the charging process?

When he selected agree, his vision went dark and power surged through him as if he'd become electricity.

High Gear charging complete.

"Huh?"

With no time to process what happened so suddenly, the capsule entrance opened.

Deathprincess was waiting.

"Sleep well?"

Since it felt like less than a second, Shirone looked around.

"20 minutes passed?"

"Yeah. In High Gear time. Let's go. Now we need to upgrade parts again."

Destroyer707 grinned widely.

"Hehe, this is real luxury for our level. No, should I call it designer goods?"

The place they arrived at was the most luxurious building in the shopping district.

Shirone checked the business name.

'Metal Genome.'

Looking through the glass window, he could see obviously high-level users shopping inside.

"It's a company with technology that covers up to level 300. It's on par with Hwayoung Company, but their minimum parts specification is level 40 or above. Anyway, the masterpiece is definitely the Grim Reaper series. It covers from level 20 to an amazing level 60. Of course, if you max out at level 60 it won't be the absolute best in its class, but it's still specs that won't be embarrassed anywhere."

"In other words, parts equipped at level 20 still work at level 60? That's amazing. Maron Company's bolt guns lost balance with just a 10-level difference."

"That's why they're designer goods. But they're expensive. No, not just expensive - way too expensive."

Shaking his head, they entered and once again the branch manager quickly ran over.

"Welcome to Metal Genome!"

Five minutes later, Shirone's party had replaced all their body parts with the Grim Reaper series.

The design concept was tropical wasps - sleek bodies with thin waists and functional legs in harmony.

"This... is really good."

The output was on another dimension, durability was 7,000, and the firearm was also beam-type energy rounds.

"Haha! Now you know why they're designer goods? Up to level 60, this is death incarnate. Nobody can touch you."

Deathprincess packed equipment in her bag.

"Even with the same energy rounds, beam types drain quickly. I'll keep replenishing. Now let's go to the hunting grounds."

Just then, Destroyer707 received a communication.

"Support request. Hostile activity occurring in Destroy-02 region. It's Chaos5MinutesAgo's party."

"Got it. Wait for us."

Destroy-02 was an extensive hunting ground with an average creature level of 47.

'These guys were party hunting.'

Calculating the hunting ground's efficiency, he smiled and looked back at Shirone.

"Want to do some performance testing?"
