Living On (1)

Apocalypse.

Racing between the buildings of a future city where the Law had triumphed, Sirone bit his lips.

'There's nowhere to hide.'

In this city without even a speck of dust, only androids called Jets remained.

A mechanical voice from a Jet echoed:

"Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form."

Dodging countless bullets as he soared into the sky, Sirone's eyes widened as he looked down at the ground.

'Damn it.'

In the vast city, Jets swarmed like silver paint had been spilled only beneath Sirone's feet.

'Where are they all coming from?'

As a Jet that had risen through magnetic force formed hand seals, all the Jets output the same Sanskrit phrase:

"Destroy the Law. Blazing Net of Devastation."

Countless bullets fired from the ground in the form of a blazing net, striking Sirone directly.

"Tch!"

An explosion erupted, and Sirone, who had defended himself with Miracle Stream, landed on a building rooftop.

'Why?'

A question that arose every time he explored the city.

'What am I missing?'

A future where the Law had triumphed meant the fairies had still won the racial war.

'That's why I sent the Twelve Apostles to the elves. But the fact that the outcome still doesn't change means...'

It had to be a variable outside Sirone's perception—a variable from the outside world.

"Eliminate suffering. Eliminate suffering."

His hair stood on end as he watched the Jets crawl up the building walls like spiders.

'Winning here won't change anything. Just how long will this go on...'

Then a mechanical voice spoke:

"Lost soul."

One Jet sat in lotus position.

'When did it...?'

As Sanskrit characters appeared on its facial screen, the Jets in the sky scattered in all directions as if they had lost sight of him.

When Sirone looked down again after blankly watching this scene, an entrance had opened in the floor.

"If you seek the world beyond, please follow me."

Feeling the vibrations of Jets crawling up the walls, Sirone threw himself into the black entrance.

Countless eyes began infiltrating the ceiling of Gaold and Miro's wedding hall.

Even hearing the sound of Floor 1.5 collapsing, Miro couldn't take her eyes off Gaold.

'Gaold.'

The boundary between dream and reality was crumbling, and memories that seemed like neither were overlapping.

What was certain was that Gaold's choice now transcended desire.

Gaold groaned:

"It hurts."

It hurts again.

With the limits of pain sensation removed, he perceived this world more vividly than anyone, and the power of magic unleashed from that sensation was undoubtedly humanity's strongest. But the clearer the sensation became, the more proportional the pain grew.

Was it a curse or a blessing?

Gaold simply called it this: life.

'Life is suffering.'

As more than half the eyes defining Ymir had infiltrated, reality was becoming closer than dreams.

'It's neither curse nor blessing.'

For him, who couldn't die from shock, the only way to escape pain was to take his own life.

'Why wouldn't I want to die?'

Right now he wanted to hang himself, slash his wrists, or jump off a high cliff.

He wished lightning would strike him, that a boulder would suddenly roll down and crush his body, that someone would cut his throat while he slept.

'Why can't I die?'

What more was left in his remaining life? Gaold chuckled.

'Because I'm human.'

Because tomorrow, something good might happen.

Though that would never happen, though it was a fact that wouldn't change even after waiting decades, still, tomorrow—that tomorrow that hasn't come yet...

Tears as hot as lava flowed down.

'You never know!'

For the first time in his life—no, even if it were the last time—wouldn't a day come when he could laugh freely?

'Just once.'

He needed nothing else; he'd give up all his flesh and blood...

'Just once.'

He wanted to feel happy.

'Miro.'

My Idea.

'There's no tomorrow here.'

Pain makes humans into philosophers, and his philosophy pointed toward supreme good.

'You're not here.'

Perfect order.

If you close your eyes quietly, everyone already knows the rightness that lies within—the realm of supreme good where one endlessly practices it.

'If you can smile in that world.'

As Gaold gritted his teeth, the ultimate technique of the Great Burning Hell unfolded.

'Could I smile then too?'

Would peace come to my heart wandering through hell?

"Graaaah!"

Would tomorrow come for me too, Miro?

As Gaold's face grew younger as if time were reversing, water began rushing in from all directions.

Louver let out a groan:

'So it comes to this after all?'

The human heart is like a sunflower—when it sees a glimmer of hope somewhere, it has no choice but to head toward it.

'Humans can't leave even the smallest doubt alone. That's why the existence of the outside world is dangerous. The world must remain closed at all costs.'

Mongah shouted:

"Lord Louver! What do we do? At this rate, Floor 1.5 will be flooded!"

It was already beyond the point where they could stop it.

"Protect the Five Stars."

"But..."

Hadn't they evacuated to Floor 1.5 precisely because they couldn't withstand the water pressure of Layer 2?

"It's the only way now. Hold out as long as you can. At the very least, the Five Stars must remain breathing until the end."

It would be better to leave even 0.1 percent hope.

"Yes."

Understanding Louver's resolve, Mongah quickly left the wedding hall.

"Good heavens..."

Looking out at the distant sea from the sky, a tsunami of immeasurable height was rolling toward the city.

"Five Stars!"

Reaching home by the shortest route, Mongah embraced Sirone, who was still sleeping.

'The water pressure isn't the problem. Just the tsunami's impact alone...'

At that moment, an astronomical quantity of water struck the city, and Gaold's group sank into the abyss along with the debris of Floor 1.5.

Kang Nan's eyes widened.

'Ah.'

Everything became clear.

'We defeated Leviathan in Layer 2. Then suddenly the water level rose and...'

This was the situation.

'It was all a dream.'

The nearly twenty years spent on Floor 1.5 were just momentary memories now that she'd awakened from the dream.

'Gaold refused to compromise.'

Now that Kang Nan was also in reality, she had no intention of blaming him, but the situation hadn't changed from a moment ago.

'What are you trying to do? Are you really trying to die?'

The water pressure they were feeling now was Ymir's mind, so unless they could deliver an even stronger impact, it would be annihilation.

Gaold glared at the darkness of the deep sea.

'I can do it.'

Because he had suppressed the Tamo organization on Floor 1.5.

'Ymir cannot feel sensation.'

Because he's too strong.

'The frustration from absent sensation drives him into battle. His threshold is probably as unfathomably deep as this sea.'

Therefore, if they couldn't impact the seabed, Ymir wouldn't even know Gaold's group was there.

'Air Press.'

The moment he cast the magic, tremendous pain hit him, but there was no hesitation now.

Having voluntarily abandoned happy lies.

'I've gone as far as I can go.'

Gaold's eyes rolled back, and the power of Air Press rose endlessly.

It was a seesaw game between a human who had reached the peak of sensation and a giant at the peak of insensitivity.

Though Air Press was enormous in size, to Ymir it would be like a needle.

The air pressure hammering down at ultra-high speed began penetrating through the water pressure.

'Damn it! Still so far to go?'

The depth was frustrating, but his will that transcended desire was no less determined.

'Graaaah!'

How long had he endured? It was well past the point where anyone else would have suffocated.

'No. Too far. I can't reach it.'

Gaold.

A voice he'd never forgotten even in dreams whispered like a hallucination in his ear.

'Miro.'

As if someone had pushed him, his mind broke through the extreme of pain, and tremendous agony rushed in.

Blood from his eyes mixed with the sea, his limbs convulsed, and at that point...

*Thunk.*

He felt resistance.

'I reached it.'

It was an impact delivered to Ymir's nerves.

Following a surge of heat, the entire sea evaporated, and Gaold's scream could be heard aloud.

"Aaaaargh!"

Kneeling on the surface of the seabed while clutching his body, he couldn't even recall the word "pain."

"Graaaah!"

The reason he could endure even hell was because there was tomorrow.

While Louver and Mongah checked on Sirone's condition, Saint, Kang Nan, and Arius rushed over.

"Are you okay? Stay conscious!"

The moment Kang Nan saw Gaold's face, she froze her hand.

Terror washed over her, as if she were touching someone whose skin had been peeled off.

"Move aside."

Miro approached and without giving anyone time to stop her, wrapped her arms around Gaold's neck and pulled him up.

"Aaaaargh!"

Fire lit in Kang Nan's eyes.

"Are you crazy? Don't you know what condition he's in?!"

Regardless, Miro pulled Gaold's neck toward her while ruffling his hair with her other hand.

"Well done."

Finally regaining consciousness, Gaold trembled in pain and slowly raised his head.

Miro grinned and said:

"No matter what anyone says, being held by the real thing is the best, right?"

"Haa!"

Fury blazed in Gaold's eyes, covered in blood.

'Right, this is what she was like.'

How could he have forgotten?

'Crazy psycho. Absolute nutcase! What a...'

As consciousness grew distant and he slowly closed his eyes, Gaold smiled and said:

"Yeah."

The woman who had made his heart flutter since school days—I love her so much.

As Gaold's head collapsed, Miro, who had been watching him intently, set him down on the ground.

"Anyway, we made it this far. Below here is Ymir's maternal psychology—Layer 1."

Miro stomped on the ground.

"Hmph."

Then, as if her anger wasn't resolved, she stomped hard again.

"Die! Just die."

"It's useless."

Arius, who had lived as a dog in the dream, approached on two legs.

"Mr. Gaold penetrated the deep sea, which is a realm of insensitivity, and delivered stimulation. But this seabed is also solid. Hitting it that much won't even register."

"Really? Then should I smash it?"

As Miro activated the Avatar Art of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara, Kang Nan thought she seemed a little angry.

'The desire to return even a little of the pain Gaold suffered...'

If so, Kang Nan had no choice but to accept reality.

Arius continued:

"That's possible too. Since we've already broken through the realm of insensitivity, we could reach it by digging in. But I don't think that's necessary."

Beyond the horizon that Arius pointed to was an undersea volcano.

"The moment Mr. Gaold's Air Press touched the seabed, the volcano must have erupted. That heat evaporated the sea."

"Is that even possible?"

"The mental world is composed of symbols and metaphors. To interpret it differently, it means Ymir's desire is that hot and powerful."

The group fell silent.

Just from feeling pain, the desire was strong enough to blow away the sea, which made Kang Nan feel intimidated.

"How much has built up? In another sense, it's scary to go in."

"Haha! Don't worry. Giants have no reproductive ability. Of course, Mr. Gaold would be insanely happy. And Mr. Sirone is..."

Louver walked over carrying Sirone on his back.

"Sleeping safely. It means information from the battlefield of dreams is still coming in."

Miro nodded.

"We can't wait forever. Time in reality flows quite fast here too."

Miro picked up Gaold.

"Let's go. To the final gateway, where Ymir's avatar awaits."

Saint approached.

"I'll carry Gaold."

"It's fine."

Walking toward the volcano, Miro looked back.

"I should have something to say later too."

Pondering the meaning of those words, Saint nodded.

"...Yeah."

And so, toward tomorrow.
