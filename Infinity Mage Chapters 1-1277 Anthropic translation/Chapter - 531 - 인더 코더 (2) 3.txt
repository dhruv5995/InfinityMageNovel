[531] Under Coder (2)

Twenty-four hours had passed since then, and Miro's group still hadn't even managed to approach the Under Coder.

To reach the Under Coder, they first had to enter Drimo.

The problem was that finding the Dream Person Ruber required the ability of lucid dreaming—being aware of reality even within dreams.

Marsha had achieved lucid dreaming in just two attempts, but Rian was struggling.

"Do we really have to go through Drimo? Can't we just separate from the dream?"

Fermi shook his head.

"The Under Coder is a realm outside the mind. Drug designers have tried various approaches, but they've all failed. Dream Star only works in Drimo."

"You heard him? Let's try properly this time, okay?"

At Marsha's words, Rian nodded dejectedly and entered the adjacent room.

This was following advice to reduce psychological pressure, but honestly, he couldn't even grasp what lucid dreaming was.

"Damn it! Now I have to struggle even to dream?"

And so the four of them fell into dreams once again.

The dream they entered under Arius's control was some slum area with complexly connected alleyways.

Miro, Fermi, and Marsha quickly found each other, but as expected, Rian was nowhere to be seen again.

The three found Rian in an empty lot filled with scrap materials at the end of an alley.

Watching him swing a rotten piece of wood while muttering something, Miro shook his head.

"He's fallen into Rilpin."

Rilpin was the opposite concept of awareness—a state where one completely loses focus within a dream.

"It shouldn't be cut this way, but maybe that way would be fine, but still, if it must be done..."

Fermi said, "Meaningless muttering."

"Hey! Rian! Snap out of it! This is a dream!"

Marsha cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted, but Rian was already beyond hearing.

Frustrated, she asked Fermi, "How do you get out of Rilpin?"

"You need to give a shock strong enough to make him aware. But then he'll wake up from the dream."

As soon as he finished speaking, Marsha strode over and struck the back of Rian's head with all her might.

"Hey!"

The moment the smacking sound was heard, Rian in reality bolted upright.

"Ow!"

Though he'd been hit in a dream, he was rubbing the spot that felt numb when the door burst open with a bang.

Marsha stood there with her shoulders squared, huffing angrily.

"Even so, there was no need to hit me..."

Marsha, who had quickly walked in, raised her hand and struck the back of Rian's head.

"Hey!"

But unlike in the dream, this time Marsha's hand stung.

"Why are you hitting me?"

"Do you want to die? Are you doing this on purpose? They say even ordinary people can do it with expert help!"

"When I'm dreaming, how am I supposed to know it's a dream?"

Marsha let out a long sigh.

"Listen carefully. If you fail, Sirone will never be able to return here either. Are you okay with that?"

Rian's face hardened with tension.

'Right, I have to save Sirone. But how exactly should I...'

Knowing that Rian was the most frustrated person, Marsha softened her expression and comforted him.

"If technique doesn't work, try with determination. You must awaken within the dream no matter what. Think of Sirone."

"I'll try again. Let's start right now."

And exactly twenty-four hours later, all four finally gathered in the dream while in a lucid dream state.

When they found the Dream Person Ruber and asked him to find them work, he proposed three jobs related to love, power, and honor.

When Miro's group rejected all of them, he made a mischievous expression and opened a door in the dream, saying:

"Go in. Dream whatever you desire to your heart's content."

The group that entered through the door widened their eyes at the instantly transformed scenery.

The door they had come through had already disappeared, and in a world covered with thin fog, impossibly tall buildings pierced through the sky.

"Incredibly tall. Nothing compared to heaven."

"These aren't real buildings."

At Arius's voice, they looked down to see a dog with fluffy blue fur sitting there.

It was Arius's wish to become Miro's dog projected in the form of an avatar.

"What do you mean they're not real?"

"They're just landscape information. The specific details of the buildings probably weren't even created."

"So they're decorative. Like stage props for a play."

Then, with a thud, the ground shook.

The faces of the group, who reflexively looked up at the sky, all turned pale.

"Cotton candy?"

Marsha said in a trembling voice.

"Who... wanted cotton candy? You should have said so. I would have bought some."

"No. It's not just our thoughts here. This is also why Drimo is dangerous."

Fermi said, "Sorry, but there's something more serious. It's time for the capsules to dissolve. The Dream Star's effects will activate soon."

As predicted, the four bodies lying side by side in reality stirred lightly.

As Dream Star awakened their brains and transmitted real sensations to their minds, Drimo's landscape began to violently fluctuate.

"Kiiiiaaaa!"

At the same time, the cotton candy's colors turned murky as if soaked in sewage, then dissolved like smoke and attacked the group.

"It's starting! Be careful with your focus and run!"

As Fermi took the lead, Miro followed and asked, "Why is it suddenly acting like that? Was it junk food?"

"It's because of the drug's effects. We've become foreign entities that shouldn't exist in Drimo."

Rian gestured toward the front.

"Then is that normal too?"

In the vibrations that shook the world, all visible structures were crumbling like fragments and falling.

The dream was collapsing.

"This way!"

Fermi sharply changed direction, opened a building's door and entered, and the remaining four people dove toward the door.

The scenery changed once again, and the four who discovered an endless ocean stretching beyond the deck were dumbfounded.

"Damn it!"

They were on a ship, and no matter where they looked, there was no exit in sight.

"What do we do? This place will collapse soon too."

"We can't escape Drimo just by changing dimensions like this. We need to somehow reach the end of the ocean or find an exit to a new dimension."

"Wait! Something's strange!"

The water began to surge as if the ground was shaking, and seawater started rising high.

As if there was a fire under the sea, all kinds of sea creatures jumped above the surface, arcing through the air before diving back down.

"I don't think we can make it in time."

Just ten meters ahead might be the end of the ocean's information.

But if they rowed believing that and their judgment was wrong, they would be helplessly submerged here.

"Th-there...!"

As Marsha couldn't continue speaking and pointed at the sky, everyone turned to look.

A planetary-scale giant white pillar was descending diagonally from the sky and submerging into the distant sea.

The four stared blankly at the void.

The face of a child, seemingly missing a few chromosomes, floated across the entire sky, with the white pillar held in the child's mouth.

"Other dimensions are starting to interfere."

"Run! Get off the ship!"

Miro lifted everyone with Air magic and threw himself off the deck.

The moment they desperately ascended into the sky, the child's cheek caved in deeply, and the seawater level instantly dropped as it was sucked into the white pillar like evaporation.

The sight of an entire planet's seawater being sucked in at once was so beyond common sense that it was shocking just to witness.

Arius, riding on Miro's back, shouted, "Found it!"

"Where?"

"Inside that pillar—no, that straw!"

They had found the only passage to another dimension, but they didn't even need to make an effort.

As the sea disappeared, air began to be sucked in next, and the four humans and one dog also entered there.

"Whooooo."

As the child exhaled air, beautiful soap bubbles were born and scattered in the wind.

Five soap bubbles burst, and Miro's group looked around with surprised expressions.

Pretty children were playing with soap bubbles.

But without time to savor the afterglow of escape, the aftermath of collapse came immediately.

As darkness began rolling in from beyond the distant meadow, the children burst into tears as if terrified.

The earth shook in response, and finally, countless sticky, mucus-like forms descended from the darkness that covered the sky.

"It's Nightmare! Never let it touch you! If it does, this world will turn into a nightmare!"

"Kieeeee!"

Sleek-looking darkness rushed toward Miro's group.

Rian, who reflexively tried to swing his sword, recalled Arius's advice and immediately cast Denai.

As his upper body twisted as if space was distorted, the Nightmare barely grazed his chest as it passed.

"There are too many!"

The speed itself wasn't very fast, but movements without inertia seemed like each one was performing Axing.

Miro, who sent two Nightmares between his sides, shouted to Fermi, "Can't we escape with spatial movement?"

"Can you maintain focus?"

"Have you forgotten who I am?"

"Then hurry!"

As soon as Fermi finished speaking, Miro took everyone and cast spatial movement, and immediately darkness fell like the sky collapsing and crushed the earth.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

The giant darkness endlessly pursued the flashes of spatial movement like an elephant's leg stepping on ants.

"Where the hell does this end!"

Arius shouted, "It's expanding because of the Nightmare! We'll never be able to escape like this!"

"Ugh, seriously!"

As Miro stopped spatial movement and set the group down, a giant Nightmare extended a human hand-like form from beyond the horizon and surged forward.

"Let's see this through to the end!"

Glaring at the Nightmare that covered the world as it surged forward, Miro extended his clasped hands straight ahead.

Spiritual Transcendence Prajna

Single Water Palm.

A giant Avalokiteshvara avatar was born from Miro's halo and stabbed the center of the Nightmare with clasped hands.

As Miro spread both arms, the avatar made the same motion and tore the Nightmare's body apart left and right.

"Got it! Let's go!"

Ignoring Rian and Marsha's dumbfounded stares, Miro immediately cast spatial movement and escaped everyone outside the Nightmare's domain.

"What's left now?"

Fermi said with a disgusted expression, "Nightmares."

Kukukukukukuku!

The meadow undulated as if floating on the sea, then explosions erupted from underground.

As Miro's group scattered and flew in zigzag patterns as much as possible, time began to slow down little by little.

'Damn! It's Nightmare Time.'

Explosive sounds came from all directions, and pillars of fire burst through the ground from below.

And finally, an incomparably massive explosion erupted at the midpoint connecting the group in a line.

Boooooooom!

In the slowed time, everyone soared into the sky and spun randomly from the impact.

Marsha could clearly see the group moving slowly as if floating.

Passing by Arius, who was pitifully upside down with his tongue hanging out, her gaze moved to the explosion's flames again, and she felt a thrill she had never experienced in her life.

The flames filled with hot heat were spreading massively, becoming a single flower in full bloom.

Flowers of fire were blooming everywhere.

The surface of the flowers was glossy as if oiled, burning like gold and illuminating the world as bright as midday.

"Ah..."

Marsha looked at it with dreamy eyes.

'This is a really amazing nightmare.'

At the same time, time returned.

"Snap out of it!"

Just before losing focus, Miro wrapped around Marsha's waist and flew toward the horizon.

Everyone was already gathered around her.

The largest explosion spread shockwaves that sent Miro's group flying hundreds of meters, and just before falling into the Rilpin of floating sensation, Miro crashed down and rolled on the ground.

"Huff, huff."

Marsha still couldn't calm her excitement as the spectacular scene she had just witnessed remained vivid, and Rian also had a deflated expression.

"We've arrived."

Fermi smiled and pointed ahead.

"This is the end of the mind."

No explanation was particularly needed.

The sunset they had seen from the distant meadow was right before their eyes.

Like a painting drawn on a wall, it was exactly the same size as when viewed from afar, without an inch of difference.

"Information can no longer be generated. Cross this boundary line and you'll enter the Under Coder's domain."

Miro rolled up his sleeves energetically and took a step forward.

"Alright, shall we begin in earnest?"

Miro paused briefly in front of the sunset, then pushed his body forward with determination, and like a curtain of illusion, his body disappeared inside.
