[723] The World We Live In (4)

White vs. Black, the battle of laws.

Survivors: 9 people.

White's survivors numbered 4.

"We still have the advantage."

Among them was Marco, who had forced Sirone to activate the Harmony of Laws in the carriage.

"Just a moment ago, 4 people from Black died simultaneously. 3 of them were the only ones who had been moving as a team."

The information was accurate since it was confirmed through Marco's weapon card, the periscope.

"Black will fight individually until the end. If we act together from now on, we have a chance."

Breeze, who worked as a hairdresser in the White district, spoke.

"Hmm, that would be best. But before that, we need to decide something by vote. Revealing our cards."

It was human nature to not want to share weapon cards essential for survival, even with teammates.

Initially, White's participants had also sought only minimal cooperation, but ultimately 6 people had died.

"I'm against it. Isn't it too early to combine cards? Black only has one more person than us anyway."

The opposing opinion came from Ballard, a man in his mid-50s who was a guard in the White district.

As someone who was trained, he would have superior combat ability compared to other participants, but in White vs. Black, weapon cards were everything.

'He has a good card.'

Marco wanted to combine cards even more.

"Fine, then let's decide by vote. Me, Breeze, and Atria are in favor of combining cards."

16-year-old Atria raised her hand.

"I haven't said anything yet."

Of course, she didn't have a high-level card, but if she simply agreed to combine cards, she would be looked down upon.

"Oh my, it's just cards anyway... Fine, I understand. What are we doing? Team or individual?"

Atria hung her head dejectedly.

"Team."

"If you were going to do that anyway, why act difficult..."

Marco sighed heavily and looked at Ballard.

"Now it's over, right? Three votes in favor. One vote against."

Ballard's expression soured.

"Damn voting."

"Hey, if you ignore White's rules..."

"I know. I'm a guard. My job is to beat people to a pulp if they don't follow the rules. A young kid trying to teach me."

When living peacefully in the White district, Marco had been on good terms with the residents.

'I will definitely return alive.'

Thinking of his family waiting at home, a father could become shameless enough.

"Then let's share our cards from now on. After combining everything, we'll redistribute according to roles. Combat, support, reconnaissance, etc..."

Just as Marco was speaking while searching his pocket, Sirone landed with the sound of spatial movement.

"Wh-what!"

All of White's participants jumped up.

"How are you alive?"

Since the White survivors confirmed through the periscope card were definitely 4, Marco felt like he was seeing a ghost.

Sirone held out his Seeker card and said.

"I'm Black. I came here because I have a proposal."

"Seeker..."

While Breeze's eyes lit up looking at the job card, Marco's mind raced.

'A Seeker appeared? So it's 4 vs 5? If Sirone comes over to White, we can not only form a team but also have numerical superiority. We've won.'

Sirone asked with an annoyed expression.

"Why are you so surprised? Don't tell me you thought I would die when you activated the Harmony of Laws?"

"No, not at all. I told you. It probably wouldn't be particularly dangerous. We were looking for you too."

Everyone knew it was a lie, but they couldn't honestly confess in this situation.

"How about forgetting what happened and moving with us? If you join us, the match will go to White's side..."

"I'm Black."

Sirone cut him off.

"I'll say it again, I only came to make a proposal. If you accept it, I won't treat you badly."

Killing intent filled Ballard's eyes.

"Hey, kid. You think being a Seeker makes you omnipotent, but this is a battlefield where laws harmonize. There's no reason we can't do what Black does."

Marco stopped Ballard.

"Wait a moment. There's no need to fight when they might become an ally, right? How about deciding by vote?"

This time Sirone snorted.

"Voting, what nonsense."

The participants' faces turned pale when they saw photons from the Photon Cannon floating above his palm.

"Ma-magic...?"

When he threw the vibrating sphere of light as if brushing it away, rocks exploded with a tremendous sound.

'How can a Seeker use magic? Is it a weapon card? No, he never drew a card. Then...'

He had been a mage from the beginning.

"Don't tell me... you killed the Black team?"

Only an event of that magnitude could explain why 4 Black district participants died simultaneously.

"That's right. Black or White, it doesn't matter. If you don't accept my proposal, you 4 will be the same."

At the chilling threat, Marco closed his mouth and Breeze asked with a frightened face.

"What kind of proposal?"

Sirone extended his hand and stepped forward.

"Take out all the cards you have."

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 1.

'It's a dragon. A real dragon.'

He had seen the water dragon Chaos on Galiant Island, but this was the first time he was having a conversation with one at such close range.

'And it's Karathorsa at that.'

Although the Neutral Dragon Karathorsa was called the King of Dragons, in Sirone's world, it was known that he no longer existed.

When no one can bear it, I will bear it.

Only the words he supposedly uttered before entering eternal slumber in the depths of an unreachable wilderness were still talked about.

"Karathorsa, I have found one who remembers reincarnation."

The thunder dragon that had dragged Sirone out of the cave landed next to Karathorsa and spoke.

'He's definitely different.'

Unlike other dragons, he had a sleek, streamlined body, and his sharp beak resembled a sword.

"Indeed so. But this probably belongs to the first reincarnation, Blitz."

Sirone's eyes widened.

'Blitz? That dragon is?'

While Karathorsa became a legend after entering eternal slumber, Blitz was the most famous dragon in Sirone's world.

Thunder Wing Dragon Blitz.

Among the 12 Apostles called the First Dragons, he was evaluated as absolutely the strongest in combat power.

Flying at supersonic speeds while raining lightning on the ground was the image that symbolized Blitz, and Sirone had also imagined that scene through countless artists' works.

"...I see. It's the first incident."

Blitz, who had absorbed Karathorsa's experience, looked down at Sirone with cold eyes.

"A drop of poison burned by the flow of time. It's natural to remove it before it spreads further."

Although all Sirone had done was save a few primitives, it would develop into a completely different history in the future.

"You know."

But that meant the dragons understood the reset perfectly.

Karathorsa spoke.

"One who came from the future, we are apostles who guard time from the tribulation of reincarnation. But because of you, hundreds of millions who would exist in the future will disappear."

If some transcendent being tried to change the system through reset, dragons were the antithesis to that.

"I deeply feel the responsibility. But I can't ignore people in danger."

That was Sirone's karma.

"We can't delay any longer. For the hundreds of millions more that you will erase in the future, disappear."

Plasma breath began to spread eerily between Blitz's clenched teeth.

"No. No."

Mitochondrial Eve blocked Sirone's front, spreading both arms wide.

"Stand back, one who remembers reincarnation. If we don't eliminate this one, your blueprint will also become useless."

Mitochondrial Eve's sub-event was information absolutely necessary for the apostles who guard time.

"Can do it."

Mitochondrial Eve was doing her best to use language.

"Sirone... can do it. Can stop it."

"Can stop it?"

After being lost in thought for a moment, Karathorsa looked at Sirone and his eyes flashed wide.

"Kugh!"

The feeling of his head filling with light was similar to the Eye's technique Clear, but with incomparably different intensity.

'My memories are being forcibly opened.'

It was a kind of mental hacking, and Sirone desperately blocked Karathorsa's access.

'With the Ultima System...!'

When he dismantled the primitive dragon language composed of binary code, the Neutral Dragon's head shot up to the sky.

"Kruuuung!"

"Karathorsa!"

Blitz cried out sharply and glared at Sirone, creating a sphere of lightning before his eyes.

"How dare you...!"

Karathorsa's voice stopped Blitz.

"The ultimate language."

Where the dragons turned their heads, Karathorsa was looking up at the sky with his massive eyes wide open.

"Indeed... is that what it is?"

If dragon language was the perfect signal that implemented the world, then the Ultima System was the higher signal that implemented that dragon language.

"So that's how you could come here. You opened the seal of time with the ultimate language."

To be precise, he had opened the prison of space-time created by Guffin with the Ultima System.

"You can do it, human. If your signal is added, we can correct the twisted history."

"What method is that?"

Karathorsa's explanation was bizarre.

"Unless time before now is sealed, events that have already occurred cannot be reversed."

This was World Number 1.

"Then we have no choice but to forcibly correct history in a state where it cannot be reversed. We must predict all variables that will occur in the future and eliminate them."

"Is that... possible?"

"With the computational ability of the time apostles, the dragon race, it's possible. In approximately 673 years from now, history will flow as if you had never come."

It was the time for a drop of poison to be purified.

"The problem is that it's not a method of elimination according to the flow of time. It must happen simultaneously. Therefore, we need the master code, the ultimate language. You must directly permeate the world and apply the results we derive."

"Immortal Function."

Expanding the self to infinity and inputting new variables that transcend space-time with the Ultima System.

The insight he had been vaguely aware of at some point was:

'This is exactly the method to break Andre's seal.'

Even if he was simultaneously exploring 19,000 worlds, each Sirone was a being with unique life.

'I don't want to die.'

Therefore, what was needed to break Andre's seal would be something that would make him willingly sacrifice himself.

"Human, it may not be you now, but in the distant future, seek me in your world. Blitz will guide you."

Blitz, whose eyes met Sirone's, nodded with eyes as unwavering as time itself.

"Sacrifice yourself. For the hundreds of millions of lives that will disappear because of you, abandon yourself."

For the people who will live in the future.

"For the future."

Mitochondrial Eve's eyes welled up with tears.

'Can wait. Can endure.'

It wasn't an eternal farewell.

But she also knew how long a time would have to pass until they met again.

Truly tens of thousands of years.

It was the magnitude of longing she would have to bear alone for eons, waiting only for Sirone to appear.

"You must make a choice, human."

Taking a deep breath, Sirone looked up at the sunset sky and fell into thought.

"I..."

Hundreds of eyes were waiting for his decision.
