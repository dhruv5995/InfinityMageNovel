Age of History (2)

Heaven's army circled the planet.

Once along the axis of rotation, twice along the equator and prime meridian they searched, but...

'We can't find him.'

Buddha was nowhere to be found.

'Unless we're incompetent...'

Shura's gestalt dominates falsehood, but before the power of amplification, it's nothing more than childish word games.

'Is he deliberately avoiding us?'

That possibility was quite likely.

When her memories were amplified 20,000 times, Ikael had recovered all her lost memories.

Even what Ankera had done to her.

'Of course I resent it too.'

But she didn't feel like tearing him apart or seeking revenge at all costs.

'Because he has no heart.'

Every judgment Ankera made was merely a cold means to maintain the world.

'But Ankera has now become human. If I meet the human called Nane, what should I do? No, how will he treat me?'

Satiel stole glances at Ikael, who was lost in thought.

'She's definitely recovered her memories.'

Of course, the other archangels also had some suspicions about Garfin's erasure.

An angel's mental body is the most pure, and they feel unease even at the slightest crack affecting the world.

'No matter how the whole changes, it's still the whole, but the first reset is definitely different.'

Also, the fact that angels felt unease was proof that some other being had performed a reset in Ankera's world.

'If this feeling is true, then I must be like an enemy to Lady Ikael.'

Satiel used Nostalgia's ability to break down memories to their smallest units and collect the fragments.

'McClain Garfin. Jealousy. Ikael's sin.'

Just having these words connect at the level of delusion made her shiver and get goosebumps.

'But why? Why isn't she saying anything to me?'

Even without clear memories, it seemed certain she had done something very bad to Ikael.

'Did she really recover her memories? If it's possible through amplification, then it's not impossible for me either.'

That's what puzzled her.

Why was only Ikael able to remember everything about Garfin's erasure?

"Stop."

At Ikael's command, Heaven's army halted.

The photon signals showed an ordinary sky scene, but to Ikael it was a childishly obvious lie.

"Come out."

The sky scene bulged and Shura revealed himself.

"I come bearing Buddha's command."

"Shura."

7th in the Council of Ten's hierarchy.

Heaven's immortal couldn't be ignorant of an archangel's authority, yet Shura showed no respect.

'Ankera is gone.'

The world's administrator was a human named Nane.

'All to understand the heart.'

She was newly chilled by Ankera's determination to fall from divine status to become a mere creation.

"Buddha's command? You should choose your words carefully. The only being who can command us is..."

"Follow me."

As if Ikael's opinion didn't even need consideration, Shura coldly turned away.

Protea, chief of the Fire Tribe, squeezed her eyes shut with a pained expression.

'We keep losing bio-weapons. Can't hold out much longer.'

The Fire Tribe's strategy was this:

300 Fire Tribe members control 300 bio-weapons, while Protea oversees everything from the center of the flower field.

Therefore, eliminating Protea should be the demons' top priority, but in reality they paid no attention to that.

"Kahaha! I caught one! It's mine!"

They were absorbed in the horrific torture of the humans, Fire Tribe members, and elves right before their eyes.

"Damn it!"

Still, their numbers were so overwhelming that eventually Rufist gave orders to Flue.

"Pull back the defense line! Protect Protea!"

The allied forces quickly moved and reconstructed their defense line 300 meters forward from Protea.

Screeeech!

The sound of bio-weapon steel breaking came from all directions, then the ground shook with a thud.

"An elf! Catch the elf! Those are delicacies!"

Elves were by far the most popular prey among demons.

"No! Stay away!"

A race with stronger immunity to fear than humans, but once their spirit breaks, their emotions show completely.

"These damn bastards!"

Seeing his kinsmen being violated, Enox finally raised his sword to charge, when...

"Huh?"

A fireball came flying from the sky.

The flame sphere, shaped like seeing the sun up close, didn't arrive even as the demons watched.

"Huh?"

And finally, when their skin began to melt, they realized it was a massive sphere over 20 meters in diameter.

"Ahhh! It's hot!"

The moment the fireball struck the ground, Enox retreated with the elves.

"Are you trying to kill everyone?"

At the same time, Rufist blocked the elves' rear and erected a 40-meter-high steel wall.

"Grrrr!"

The hot energy was briefly blocked, but soon the steel wall began turning bright red like lava.

"Water magic!"

When Enox shouted, the water spirits cast ancient magic.

"Ascol!"

The blood of demons and humans instantly evaporated, then torrential rain poured down over the entire area.

Hissss!

With the sound of cooling metal, the temperature dropped enough to breathe and the steel wall collapsed.

Though the power was dangerous even to allies, thanks to it the demons' advance line had been pushed back 700 meters.

Rufist's eyes deepened.

'As rumored.'

There was only one person present capable of wielding flame magic of this level.

Garcia arrived via spatial teleportation.

"Are you alright?"

Feeling that the title of world's greatest flame mage wasn't empty, Rufist nodded.

"Thanks to you. How's the battle situation?"

"Not good. We've lost 20% of the Valkyrie forces."

Considering the allied forces lost 50% and the elves 30%, they were truly world-class elites.

"But the biggest loss is that the 1st Corps Commander was defeated. At this rate, we won't be able to defend the flower field."

Rufist's eyebrows rose.

'Fidero is dead? A swordsman called the reincarnation of the great swordsman Cadel?'

It was certainly shocking news, but the battlefield was a place where anything could happen.

"It's your call, Guild Master. Whether to retreat here and plan the next strategy, or defend this place."

Garcia held the higher operational rank.

But for matters involving Tormia's fate, he thought it better to leave it to their own nation's commander.

"Hmm."

Rufist stroked his chin.

'If we retreat, we save our forces. But if we pull back here, do we have any future left?'

They had been able to face the demons despite the asymmetric power balance because of the flower field.

Between humans and machines, which is more efficient?

"All forces!"

Rufist shouted.

Abandoning the ancient weapons would mean never again being able to inflict this level of damage on the demons, but...

"Retreat!"

Without humans, there's no system either.

That was the human called Rufist, and Garcia respected his decision.

"Valkyries! All forces retreat!"

Seeing the allied forces show their backs and flee, the demons drooled.

"Kahaha! This is my favorite part!"

When striking fleeing enemies' backs, the despair that rose in their eyes was thrilling.

"Ahhh! No!"

Their allies' screams, familiar voices crying out in agony, pierced the allied forces' hearts.

"Grrr!"

Jaws clenched tight enough to shatter teeth.

"Run! Keep running!"

But ultimately, because someone gets caught, someone else can escape.

"Just wait and see! You bastards!"

As they retreated with tears of blood, the roar of spatial teleportation crossed the sky.

"What?"

Judging by the sound wave's length, it was magic cast from an incredible distance.

Rufist's gaze followed to deep within the demon camp.

"Why?"

The distance was far too great.

If the coordinates were miscalculated, they could only hope to die without pain.

The demons surrounding the spot where the flash landed also looked bewildered.

"What's this little brat?"

A girl with a slender build and short-cropped hair like a boy's muttered quietly.

"Fire Realm."

Burns everything completely.

Despite her gentle voice, massive flames rose up around her, piercing the sky.

"Ahhhhh!"

Amid screams of hell, as the fire tornado danced, the allied forces' faces went blank.

"Could it be?"

At the familiar flames, Garcia's eyes lit up, and as the fire scattered to reveal the ashen earth...

"Amy...?"

Amy stood there, having created the fire storm yet not a thread on her burned.

Only Garcia, the greatest flame mage, could guess what this meant.

Complete combustion.

'It's not magic. It's a mental realm. And one's understanding of fire must reach its peak.'

A very difficult thing.

It was like saying only those who've burned to death in fire know fire's true nature.

Amy's body seemed to ignite for a moment, then suddenly appeared before the allied camp.

'Magic using concepts rather than phenomena. It requires unique understanding of fire...'

It was also a privilege of great mages.

He didn't know why flame magic needed teleportation, but it would have its uses.

"Lieutenant Colonel Carmis Amy, returned to the battlefield."

As Garcia watched with a serious expression, Tess came running with Lian.

"Amy!"

Tess embraced Amy so tightly it was breathless, crying as she spoke.

"I really thought you were dead! What happened?"

"Wait, wait, Tess..."

"And why is your hair like this? You look completely like a boy. You're still pretty though."

"Lieutenant Colonel."

Only when she heard Garcia's voice did Tess come to her senses and hurriedly step back.

"Ah, sorry!"

Meanwhile, Amy smiled meaningfully as she met Garcia's gaze.

'Master.'

She knew he was the one who had been waiting for her return more than anyone.

"If you survived twice, it can't be luck."

After briefly surveying the enemies ahead, Garcia looked back at Amy and said:

"The 1st Corps Commander position is vacant. Take it."

"...What?"

Amy, unable to process what she heard, asked again, but Garcia's words remained brief.

"As of this moment, you are the Valkyrie 1st Corps Commander."

"Gasp!"

Tess covered her mouth, and the surrounding soldiers also murmured with shocked expressions.

"1st Corps Commander means... Major General, right?"

No matter how close the world was to destruction, it was an unprecedented promotion.

Amy's voice trembled.

"Commander..."

"As you know, it might just be an empty title. This could become our grave. But the weight of responsibility a corps commander must bear is the same. Nothing to gain, much to lose. Will you still do it?"

Tears welled up in Amy's eyes.

"Yes!"

The moment she clenched both fists, her pupils began burning with red light.

'I did it. I did it.'

A lifetime flashed by in a brief moment.

Entering magic school and failing the first graduation exam, graduating 4th out of 10 on the second graduation exam.

Enlisting in Tormia's army and the Valkyries with grades that couldn't be considered promising.

Training was brutal, and Garcia's instruction was inhuman and cruel.

'Thank you, Beric.'

Even having overcome all of that, today wouldn't exist without Beric.

'And...'

Amy pulled out memories she had carefully guarded even in extreme pain.

'Sirone.'

As Valkyrie 1st Corps Commander, she could obtain the title of Great Mage just by applying fame points.

Since she was actually a great mage who had realized the Fire Realm, the Red Line ranking system was reasonable.

'I can meet him.'

How frustrating her own weakness had been that night when she had to let Sirone go before her eyes?

'I can fight alongside him.'

Watching Amy burning with red eyes, Tess conveyed with her heart:

'Congratulations.'
