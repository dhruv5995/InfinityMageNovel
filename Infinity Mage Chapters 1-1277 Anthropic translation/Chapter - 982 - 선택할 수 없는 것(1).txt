Things That Cannot Be Chosen (1)

"Rian..."

Even Nade had to give up when faced with a swordsman who had reached the divine transcendence realm of Idea.

Tess said, "But how do we enter the other world? Don't we have to be half-dead?"

"Yes, that's exactly it."

While Tess's face went pale, Taesung remained calm.

"Actually... being half-dead isn't enough to reach the other world. We usually call it wandering between life and death. Even then, you're only straddling the boundary between reality and the other side - you haven't completely entered it."

Shirone said, "Reality and the other side are separated by just a sheet of paper. That's why it's called the thin barrier. But the spiritual distance is like end to end. That's why the ancients called it the river of no return."

"Wait, Shirone! Are you saying Rian can't come back?"

"Seekers call crossing the boundary between the afterlife and this world 'Choeoni Bardo.' But now even I can't do it. Princess Jinseongeum of Jincheon completely sealed the passage from the other world to reality."

Miro said, "Thanks to that, humanity gained hope too."

"Yes. If demons continuously born from hellfire could cross into the real world, victory would be impossible. It was such a tremendous achievement, and in exchange, she..."

Must suffer eternally in hell.

"So you're telling us to bear it? Because there's a woman named Jinseongeum, Rian should also be prepared to die?"

Shirone understood Tess's feelings.

"Don't misunderstand. Of course, half of what I said means that, but there is a way to return. If we liberate Seongeum from hell, the boundary barrier will disappear too."

"How do we liberate her? Is it possible? Has anyone ever purified hell before?"

It was something even Guffin couldn't accomplish.

Taesung said, "The problem comes after that. Shirone can cross to the other world through the thin barrier. But Rian must use a cruel method. The best way is to burn with fire."

Tess was on the verge of fainting.

"Rian possesses a strong mind. Ordinary shocks won't faze him. We burn him, endlessly burn him, until emotions condense to a degree reality cannot accept."

"No, how could anyone do such a thing..."

"It's impossible."

When Rian cut off her words, Tess turned her head as if she'd been waiting and retorted.

"Right? You think so too? Setting a living person's body on fire."

"No, it's the opposite. I can't guarantee it since I haven't experienced it, but even if burned, my mind won't waver. I need something stronger."

While Tess gaped in bewilderment, Taesung smiled with satisfaction.

"That's why we need you, Rian. If you fall into hell having lost your reason, you'll just be devoured by hungry ghosts. The method doesn't matter. Fire only helps gather emotions - what's truly important is your will."

"I understand."

Rian looked around the Grand Hall and faced Shirone directly.

"I'm going too, Shirone."

Seeing the firm trust between the two who communicated through their eyes, Tess lowered her head with sad eyes.

Pony said, "It's not just Baschka - other regions are problematic too. Though hell's army spread out radially, considerable numbers of demons must remain in the central and southern regions."

Shirone looked at her.

"Yeah. Actually, I was about to discuss that."

Amy asked, "You followed Dante. Did you reach Creas?"

Amy's family home and Rian's family home were there, and most importantly, Shirone's adoptive parents.

"Not yet."

"You couldn't reach it? What happened?"

"Well..."

Shirone began to speak.

From a mountaintop overlooking Creas city, Dante made a disgusted expression.

"This is incredible..."

What appeared to be hundreds of thousands of demons completely surrounded the castle walls, conducting a siege.

Giant monsters used their horns to pierce the iron-plated gates, and demons poured through the holes like being sucked in.

"Let's go. We don't have time."

When Dante spoke, Shirone looked back.

Thousands of refugees they'd rescued from various regions stood with tired faces.

"To go to that place..."

An old man with a walking stick spoke for the refugees.

"We won't be of any help. Maybe against bandits, but against such monsters..."

Eden said, "I'll stay and protect the people. You go help those in need."

With such a large group, it was only a matter of time before flying demons spotted them.

'Eden's defensive magic. Even in the worst situation, it should hold for several hours.'

Having made his decision, Shirone said, "Alright, let's go. Dante, assess the situation at the Creas branch of the Magic Association. Ms. Lilia, support the castle walls. I'll enter the city to rescue people."

Even as he spoke, flames were rising from inside the city moment by moment.

Just as Shirone was about to cast spatial movement magic, Dante called out urgently.

"Shirone."

"Yeah?"

"Stop by the Ogent family first."

Shirone couldn't answer.

"Go. You have every right to do so. If you don't save your parents first, no one in the world will be able to accept help from you with a good heart."

"...Thank you, Dante."

Dante nodded, and Shirone's body transformed into a flash of light, flying toward the city.

Landing precisely in the central courtyard of the Ogent family estate, Shirone heard a familiar voice.

"Taha! Taha!"

In front of the main house, Reina was shooting arrows at demons all alone.

Her rapid-fire rhythm was excellent and demons fell one by one, but when opponents reached company commander level, her arrows had no effect.

A company commander covered in scales deflected arrows with his forearm as he approached.

"Kekeke, a human daring to fight demons. I've found an interesting toy after a long time. I'll tear off your limbs one by one."

Reina calmly drew her strong bow to its limit.

A powerful arrow shot forth with enough force to pierce scales, but the demon caught it right in front of his face and charged.

"Kahaha! A mere human trying to fight me...! Gah!"

Before he could finish speaking, Hand of God flew over and backhanded the company commander.

Simultaneously, hands of light swept across the ground, capturing demons and hurling them to the distant sky.

It was truly the hand of god.

Reina, who had been watching blankly, turned her gaze forward.

Her bow fell with a clatter.

"Shirone!"

She ran over with tears welling up, grasped Shirone's hands, and shouted.

"What happened? Why are you here?"

"It's a long story. What about Uncle Bischoff?"

"He's fighting at the castle walls. Your parents evacuated to the magic school. That's probably the safest place."

'Right, it's not a level the army can handle.'

On the other hand, Alpheas Magic School had a certified 2nd-class mage, rare even in the association.

'Headmistress Olivia.'

Reina continued, "I escorted your parents to the magic school, then came back briefly and got surrounded. I felt I had to protect the family seal no matter what."

"I see."

In a knight family, the seal was like the heart itself.

He was grateful to Reina, who had abandoned such an important item to evacuate his parents first.

"That's really fortunate. Honestly, I was half giving up too. Let's quickly go to the magic school..."

At that moment, there was an explosion from across the city, and a mushroom cloud of fire rose up.

"Over there?"

It was where the magic school was located.

Alpheas Magic School had grounds vast enough to compare to small villages in other regions.

Demons crossing over mountains converged on the central building, now transformed into a fortress, and launched a siege.

With the high-level faculty of the five prestigious schools, even the demons showed clear signs of confusion.

But not being a race to abandon their warlike nature, they began pouring out mass attacks.

Saad, who had been bombing the ground with fire magic, looked at Alpheas and shouted.

"Headmaster! The defense line has been breached!"

The wrinkles around Alpheas' eyes deepened.

"...Have the faculty evacuate with the students and citizens. I'll buy some time."

Shiina said, "We can't leave you behind, Headmaster. I'll stay here instead."

"This isn't the time to be stubborn. Should students die before teachers?"

"Then I'll stay."

Olivia stood beside Alpheas, glaring at the window with cold eyes.

"What time can a decrepit old man buy? Leave it to me. I'll get out alive."

Everyone knew it was bravado, and Alpheas raised the corners of his mouth slightly.

"Kekeke, I am old, but..."

As he walked toward the window, a terrifying killing intent began emanating from his body.

"You haven't forgotten who I am, have you?"

Mirhi Alpheas.

Seeing Alpheas' back overlapping with his younger self, Olivia's expression became wistful.

"...How foolish."

To want to spend life's final moments with the man she loved, even at this age.

She approached Alpheas and said to the other faculty members.

"Go. We'll handle this."

Faced with the noble atmosphere emanating from their relationship, the faculty could no longer be stubborn.

"We'll come back."

After Saad said this and left the room, the other faculty quickly followed.

Opening the underground iron door revealed advanced class students waiting with anxious expressions.

Behind Mark and Maria, the only graduating class, were also Shirone's parents.

Looking at the students, Saad said, "From now on, we must act calmly. We're leaving the magic school. I'll take you to a safe place."

If such a place existed in the world.

Even the advanced class were aspiring mages, and without anyone faltering, they followed the faculty.

Just as they were about to exit through the back door, Shiina, who had been scouting ahead, raised her hand.

"Demons are coming."

It was a strike team attempting to infiltrate by circling the building - small in number but clearly elite.

"Damn! At a time like this..."

"I'll lure them away. Take the kids and run."

Planning to divert their attention before they discovered the door, Shiina cast teleportation.

There was no time to stop her, and even if there had been, the faculty's role was clear.

"Over there! Chase her!"

The demon strike team chased after the retreating Shiina, shooting explosive spines embedded in their backs.

Hundreds of spines flying with pillars of fire bombarded the ground, shaking the entire grounds.

"Urgh!"

She blocked the heat by spreading cold air, but the shockwave left her ears ringing.

'What kind of firepower is this...'

She tried to counterattack using ice magic, but the enemies' physical abilities exceeded imagination.

More spines were fired, and this time they seemed to have their own will, changing trajectory to follow Shiina.

'Guided missiles.'

Biting her lip as she waited in position, she cast teleportation at the precise moment.

The spines collided and exploded, and she was thrown by the shockwave, rolling across the ground.

'Frustrating.'

Until the world had reached this state, she had her own pride.

You'll become a good teacher.

Armin had known.

That the enemies appearing in the world ahead were not at a level mere humans could handle.

"Don't be ridiculous."

Shiina put strength into her trembling legs and summoned the full power of Absolute Zero.

Though a localized magic, she could at least take a few as companions in death.

"Come at me, you bastards!"

How many times in her life had such crude profanity left her mouth?

Even at her death-prepared roar, the demons only launched themselves with greedy eyes.

"I won't kill you. I have much to ask."

As Shiina's hand rose and hundreds of spines curved and flew from left and right.

'Huh?'

The world suddenly tilted to one side and all the spines began falling downward.

'What?'

Had the planet flipped?

'No...'

She was the one moving.

By the time she realized it, no one was around her, and she stood alone on the ground.

"Gaah!"

A demon's brief scream.

When she turned her head, the entire strike team lay on the ground with their heads severed.

"Wha...?"

And at the center of that bloody scene, a man's back entered Shiina's view.

He had one arm.
