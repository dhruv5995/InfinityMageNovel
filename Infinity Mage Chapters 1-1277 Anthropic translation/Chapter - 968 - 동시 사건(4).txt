Simultaneous Events (4)

Ionas's fist, decomposed into particles, rapidly took shape right in front of Shirone's nose.

"Kuk!"

As Shirone twisted his head, the air was pushed back and a sonic boom exploded somewhere in the void.

"You do have some skill."

Shirone took in Ionas with his eyes.

'Ionas of Ultimate Decomposition.'

With his pale face and silver hair falling to his shoulders, he resembled a human overall.

However, his pupilless eyes and double row of teeth would be chilling to ordinary people.

'Atomic Movement. This is really troublesome.'

The ability to decompose one's own body to the extreme and execute atomic-level movements.

The attacks derived from this ran at the pinnacle of change, transcending the myriad techniques of transformation.

'It's not just fast.'

The reason one cannot dodge an arrow even after seeing it is because the reception time of each sense is different.

Though he could perceive with his eleven senses, avoiding the attacks was entirely dependent on Shirone's own capabilities.

"Shall we get serious now?"

Ionas, his entire body decomposed into atoms, unleashed attacks from unpredictable trajectories.

'Miracle Stream!'

As smoke of light wrapped around Shirone's body, black holes were punched through him as if hit by buckshot.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The light scattered into fragments, but Shirone had already retreated 20 kilometers away.

"Right, running away in the end."

Ionas, who had moved in particle state, rotated around Shirone with only his face combined.

"I've always wondered."

The movement of roughly 10 quadrillion particles was comprehensively detected through Ultima.

"Being this strong, why don't I feel like I'm the strongest?"

Shirone discovered a single technique within the pattern of 10 quadrillion particles moving.

'Left punch.'

A straight punch that could truly be called genesis grazed past Shirone's side.

'That was close.'

Shirone, who had distanced himself again, created and fired roughly 4,200 photon cannons.

"Is that all?"

Ionas's arms moved at invisible speed, deflecting the photon cannons.

Uriel, watching the battle from 20 kilometers away, spoke.

"He was a strong boy."

Whatever the standard of strength, she remembered him as a human who made one think such thoughts.

"And now he's actually become strong."

While his mental capacity might be infinite, humans have something called physical limits.

The very fact that he could sense and dodge Ionas of Ultimate Decomposition was close to miraculous.

"But it seems that's all there is to it in the end."

Rayel agreed with silence.

'Actually, Uriel's words are contradictory. Strong things don't need any elements other than strength.'

The reason she couldn't deny it was probably due to a question that had arisen in her mind at some point.

'Why can't I—no, we—feel like we're the strongest?'

Only Ikael knew the answer.

'Mclain Guffin.'

All the renowned strong beings in heaven commonly shared the experience of being unable to defeat Guffin.

When Guffin's erasure occurred in that situation, a transcendent concept that couldn't be explained in words emerged.

'Even though he was erased from memory, we had already experienced strength beyond that...'

Unable to reach the feeling of being supreme.

'Shirone.'

Ikael's eyes, looking down at her son fighting fiercely, filled with sorrow.

'I love you.'

More precious than anything in the universe.

'Though I don't deserve to be called a parent, I cannot lose you again.'

She would never gamble with her child's life again.

'Please retreat now. Go back and live a happy life. This mother will somehow take responsibility for the world's affairs.'

Every time Shirone barely dodged Ionas's attacks, Ikael felt her heart being torn apart.

'This level won't be enough to defeat Ionas. But it's not because of lacking skill.'

Something that transcends strength.

'Simply... because he's not Guffin.'

Even if their mental states were equal, Shirone's body was far weaker compared to the Gaians.

'Giant-level physical strength, spirit transcending angelic concepts, integration of numerous Gaians.'

It was because they were a race possessing all of this that the divine world was shaken to its roots.

"Ikael, I'll give you one last chance."

Satiel said.

"Reveal the truth about Guffin's erasure and admit your mistake. Then I'll acknowledge your authority as well."

Ikael clenched her fists tightly.

'I mustn't act on emotion.'

To protect Shirone from all of heaven's armies, the position of archangel was absolutely necessary.

"You know too, don't you? Though Ionas is my subordinate, his combat ability surpasses mine. If you follow my words, I won't act unilaterally either. In other words, if I order him to leave Shirone alone, he'll comply."

It was a sweet proposal.

If only she could endure the humiliation of bowing her head to the very one who killed her son.

'It doesn't matter.'

Strength entered Ikael's eyes.

'Because he came back alive. If I can protect Shirone, I'll prostrate myself at anyone's feet.'

In her bird's-eye view, Ionas's fist struck Shirone directly in the solar plexus.

"Keuuk!"

Even after reducing the kinetic energy by more than 99.99 percent, it was pain that felt like his body was being pierced.

"I do think you're impressive."

Ionas walked through the air as if taking a stroll.

"Humans die from just a graze. To have endured this far with such a body deserves applause."

Shirone wasn't pleased.

"You're strong. You're probably among the top ten strongest in heaven. Therefore, if there's one reason for defeat, it's me."

Ionas raised his fist before his eyes.

"You ended up fighting me, one of the top five strongest in heaven."

"Haha."

Even in pain, laughter burst out.

"...What's so funny?"

Having experienced all of Omega's history, Shirone knew what position Ionas held in heaven.

"Honestly, isn't it close?"

Ionas's eyebrow twitched.

"Ymir and Ashur are evenly matched, and below them are Uriel, Ikael, and others—"

"Huh...?"

Shirone pointed at Ionas.

"Though I'll admit you sometimes make it in there. Sometimes."

A mere human couldn't know heaven's long-standing debates, but it wasn't entirely wrong anyway.

"Just kidding. Forget it."

Shirone recovered from the shock.

"It doesn't matter anyway, right? You'll never be able to become the strongest."

"Now I understand."

Ionas, who had instantly flown above Shirone's head, swung his leg.

With a crack, the air split and the sea 600 meters below was divided with tremendous force.

'When did we?'

They had left land behind.

Ionas, who had been looking at the surface that healed instantly, raised his head.

"You have the typical mentality of a loser. You might feel the bottom you're standing on is a bit shallower by putting forward the strongest to crush me, but let me tell you precisely. You and I are on different levels."

"I don't care about levels. Who's stronger has nothing to do with me. Because..."

As Shirone's eyes widened, Miracle Stream compressed powerfully in both hands.

"I absolutely have to win."

A flash pierced through the sky, and Hand of God descended, bending its finger toward Ionas.

The offensive application form of the Ultima System.

'I was hit by that before.'

It was a mental ability powerful enough to scatter heaven's entire army across the world.

"How dare you act leisurely against me?"

Ionas's double row of teeth was revealed chillingly.

"It's not leisure. It's responsibility."

Shirone surveyed the sea.

It was the middle of an ocean 800 kilometers west from above the Kaizen Kingdom.

'I can fight here.'

Of course, there was life here too, but saving humans was strategically important.

Ionas's triangular pyramid glowed red.

"It's over."

Ultimate Decomposition.

Atomic Crash.

Particles compressed into a fist-sized sphere spread in all directions, emitting explosive light.

'He increased the particles' activity.'

Moving with energy of a different dimension, Ionas aimed for Shirone's back and raised his hand blade.

'Human after all.'

If you rip out the heart, they can't survive.

'Huh?'

Hand of God, forming a circle with thumb and middle finger, had completely dominated his field of vision.

'Damn it!'

The distance remaining to Shirone's back was 0.03 millimeters.

'Too late.'

Ionas's arms decomposed into particles, then crossed in a defensive posture covering his face.

Simultaneously, Hand of God flicked its finger.

"Kuk!"

The shockwave struck all 10 quadrillion particles as Ionas's body was driven into the sea.

Splaaaaaash!

Water splashed, and rough water columns erupted from the surface that bubbled as if boiling.

"Kraaaaa!"

Breaking the spine of a sperm whale, he emerged and glared at the sky through his water-droplet-covered vision.

"A mere human...!"

His words cut off with a thud as Ionas saw Shirone raising his hand in his field of vision.

But what left him speechless was Hand of God positioned above Shirone.

'Don't worry, Ikael.'

As if projecting Shirone's heart, Hand of God spread all five fingers wide toward the sky.

'Because we're definitely connected.'

Simultaneously, a sphere of light of immeasurable size was born with a pop above the giant palm.

Not only Ionas but even the archangels observing from afar were left speechless.

Shirone looked down at the sea and spoke.

"You feel it too."

Hand of God.

Photon Cannon.

"This is my responsibility."

As he swung his arm with all his might, Hand of God drove the photon cannon straight down.

The moment the astronomical mass touched the sea.

"Uaaaaa..."

Ionas's scream was cut off, and the sea exploded in a crown shape before evaporating.

Because the scale was so massive, every process was vivid as if time flowed slowly.

Rumble! Rumble!

With water vapor completely obscuring vision, only fearsome roaring could be heard.

As Hand of God waved its hand, vision cleared to reveal a giant hole punched in the sea.

'He's gone.'

Ionas was nowhere to be seen.

Shortly after, gravity pulled the seawater back, creating a spectacular scene of intertwining currents.

At that point, Satiel cut off his bird's-eye view.

"...Obliterated."

Neither Uriel, nor Rayel, nor the Maras with transcendent vision spoke for a while.

The power of Hand of God made them recall times they didn't want to remember.

'Is it not over yet?'

It seemed like Shirone was saying they were definitely still connected.

Rumble. Rumble.

Like images created for divine entertainment, the sea continued to produce endless amazing changes.

'Two minutes have passed. Is this enough?'

As Ionas's obliteration became certain, Shirone turned toward the direction he had flown from.

And toward her who would still be watching him, he spoke in a gentle voice.

"Ikael."

Though the heart shattered to pieces after Guffin's disappearance couldn't be gathered and mended again.

"You're not alone."

If they could share memories together, he thought that too would be a beautiful life.

"So..."

With a beautiful smile shining in the sunlight, Shirone extended his hand toward her in the distance.

"Let's go together, Mother."
