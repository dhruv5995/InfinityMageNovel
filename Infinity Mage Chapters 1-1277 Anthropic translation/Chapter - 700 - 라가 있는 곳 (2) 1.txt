[700] Where Ra Is (2)

Uorin, who couldn't track Ra Enemy, tracked the movements of all humanity except Ra Enemy.

"History Search isn't anything special. It's just a method of searching my memories and sorting them into various categories."

However, it was impressive because the scope of those memories encompassed all of humanity.

Most humans can only pass down fragments of what they experienced in their lifetime to future generations, but Terase's memory transfer had no information leakage.

"In other words, no human in my memory has ever encountered the real Ra Enemy. Therefore, what remains are places that even I haven't experienced - only the world's three great labyrinths. If it's not here either, then it's not on this planet."

Shirone was convinced.

'A region where the frequency of coming out is extremely low compared to the frequency of going in. But that means...'

Even if they encountered the real Ra Enemy, the probability of escaping would be extremely low.

"I said I'd vote for you on the premise of risking our lives, but honestly, your progress is behind compared to the other competitors."

Anyone who could become an Ivory Tower candidate would have similar judgment speed, so what remained was differences in disposition.

"Nane has already chosen one of the three great labyrinths and is heading there. Without anyone's help. Jinseongeum has the powerful soldiers of the Jincheon Empire. The Sambo Three Steps, her direct guard unit. They're those granted the authority to approach within three steps of her, and their skills are first-rate. And Shirone, you have... the Knight of Maha and the King of Goblins."

When Kido coughed awkwardly, Uorin smiled with her eyes.

"I know Lian and Kido are strong, but this time the opponents aren't easy either. You'll need to work hard."

"It's fine. There are three labyrinths. I don't think they'll find what even you, Uorin, couldn't find."

What Uorin was aiming for was along the same lines.

"Ra Enemy is in one of these three labyrinths: Jessica, Andre, or Pytharos. Therefore, you still have a chance, Shirone. Do you happen to have a map?"

When Lian handed over a world map, Uorin spread it on the table.

"Do you know the difference between a maze and a labyrinth?"

"Hmm, a maze is a path, and a labyrinth refers to a space?"

"Similar. But precisely, a maze has an exit while a labyrinth has no exit. It wasn't originally created to confuse someone."

Uorin pointed to the Molton Kingdom, which bordered Kashan's southern frontier.

"First, Jessica."

Befitting the largest empire, there were three kingdoms that bordered Kashan to the south: Zaib, Molton, and Bornai.

"Jessica is named after its first discoverer. It's located 87 kilometers from Molton's royal castle, in a forest adjacent to the Mediterranean. You'll probably be able to find it right away. It's too massive."

"What do you mean by massive?"

"Literally too big. Jessica's other name is the Giant's Ruins. It's presumed to have been built by giants before humanity settled on this land. No one has fully explored how vast the space beneath the pyramid is, but archaeologists estimate it's equivalent to a small kingdom."

"Hmm, escaping would be a problem, but finding it would be a problem too."

"Among the three great labyrinths, it's relatively popular. It's called a labyrinth because it can't be conquered, but even without going too deep, valuable artifacts and sometimes ancient weapons are discovered."

Among those conversing with Uorin, none were unaware that giants came from heaven.

"Next is Andre. It's in the Akard Desert."

Terase pointed to the desert southeast of Kashan's territory.

"The Akard Desert is the world's largest desert. The southern desert is territory of the Paras Kingdom, but Andre is in Kashan's territory in the northern part of the desert."

Since Tormia wasn't a very large country, introducing one of the three great labyrinths within their own territory felt unfamiliar.

"Andre's common name is the Prison of Time and Space. As far as I know, it's the most unique place among the three great labyrinths and also the hardest to escape from."

"Why is it called the Prison of Time and Space?"

"The flow of time and space is completely different from reality. The survival rate is 1 in 1,000. According to records, some say it's the past from 3,000 years ago, others say it's a primitive era from 10,000 years ago. Of course, I think there are those who've been to future worlds too."

"I see. So different time-spaces unfold each time you enter? This would be difficult. You'd be leaving survival to chance, wouldn't you?"

"Not exactly."

"Huh?"

When he looked up, Uorin was smiling mischievously.

"It's actually a famous tourist destination. Even now, thousands of people visit this place every year."

"What... do you mean?"

"Long ago, someone independently separated Andre's time-spaces. Even if you enter Andre, you can no longer experience the mixing of time and space. Instead, when you go there, you'll find 19,000 circular steel doors densely installed. Each one serves as an entrance to a different world."

"There are 19,000 independent worlds?"

"Yes. Each world from different times and different spatial dimensions is sealed away. Naturally, they made it so tourists can't open the steel doors, but nobody tries to enter anyway. Since the steel doors appeared, there have been no survivors. So nobody knows how each world might have developed. Some worlds might have already perished."

"So that's why it's called a prison."

"It's a kind of penitentiary. They created a prison to confine time and space that broke the rules and ran wild."

At this point, there was one thing he was curious about.

"Who on earth did such an incredible thing?"

"I don't know. Nobody knows."

Shirone's expression hardened.

"Mclain Guffin."

"Right. The fact that it can't be found even after searching through all of history means it's already been erased. Now do you understand? Andre is Guffin's relic."

Shirone swallowed and said,

"Maybe Ra Enemy isn't here either?"

He wanted to believe that.

"Ahaha. That might be so, but Ankera isn't an ordinary creature either."

Wiping away her smile, Uorin looked at the map again and pointed to the Middle East, the Paras Kingdom, on the left side of the southern Akard Desert.

"Lastly, Pytharos, commonly called the Pit of Corruption."

Kido stuck his tongue out upward.

"Just hearing the name makes me not want to go."

"If Andre has temporal-spatial peculiarities, then Pytharos has legal peculiarities. All the corruption energy of this world gathers here. Just like rainwater flows from high places to low places, Pytharos is a legal lowland."

Lian said briefly,

"That would be dangerous."

"Even if they're not Ivory Tower candidate level, those with low Karma go insane as soon as they enter. Moreover, countless non-entities born from corrupt energy threaten explorers. Of course, demon ranks range from at least B to Triple S."

According to what he learned in school, demons were known to be born from the projection of ancient people's collective consciousness.

An aggregate of corrupt desires, pleasures, and taboos.

And now that Shirone had realized Bakji, he could understand another fact.

"Demons are the masters of the other world, right?"

"Correct. Reality and unreality were born like twins, exercising indirect influence with a thin membrane between them. But sometimes that veil is torn away, or humans' collective consciousness becomes too strong and crosses over into reality."

"Just hearing about it gives me chills."

It was Kido's realistic assessment.

"Anyway, Ra Enemy will be in one of these three labyrinths. To summarize: Jessica is as massive as a kingdom, Andre has countless worlds, and Pytharos is literally a paradise for demons. Choose from these."

Uorin smiled like a merchant's face, as if all were cheap and good items.

Though Shirone looked at her with hollow eyes, it was time to make a choice anyway.

"Then let's choose. Giant's Ruins, Prison of Time and Space, Pit of Corruption. Which one do you want?"

After a moment of silence, Kido spoke.

"Can I be honest? I just want to go home."

It was the first time he had missed his dead sister this much.

"Where we're going is important, but shouldn't we also consider where Ra Enemy might be hiding?"

Lian executed his very rare precision strike.

"Ah, right. Hmm."

Shirone examined the map again.

"Giant's Ruins is connected to Ankera, and Prison of Time and Space is the optimal place for hiding."

Kido said,

"But wouldn't Pytharos be comfortable for Ra? He moved the army of the other world in Radum too."

In the end, it wouldn't be strange wherever it was.

"What about the other competitors? Can you tell where they went?"

"They haven't made definite decisions yet either. But judging by location, Jinseongeum seems likely to enter Jessica."

"Giant's Ruins."

"Jinseongeum is an Unlocker. Magic is the ability to dominate space through ether waves. A wide radius isn't important to her."

"So she utilized her specialty."

If they couldn't guess Ra Enemy's location anyway, it was an excellent judgment.

'What remains are Andre and Pytharos. Which place will Nane choose?'

In a three-way competition, he wanted to avoid fighting with Nane over one labyrinth.

"Shirone, don't think too hard about it. This isn't a competition where tricks work. It's about each person displaying their strengths. Nane and Jinseongeum have also reached great heights, but you have senses that transcend humanity."

"Sibulsangpokmae."

"Right. Senses become stronger with training, but originally equipping them is a separate issue. You can't attach ears to someone who has no ears. But you're different."

Uorin held up both index fingers side by side.

"It's said that living beings have a total of 11 senses for accepting the world. Humans only have 5 senses, but angelic abilities are all theories established with senses transcending humans. That's why humans can't understand them."

Even Arius couldn't perfectly understand Ataraxia.

"The Valhalla Action that the Great Mages are currently paying debts for is also an extreme manifestation of temporal sensation."

"Valhalla Action?"

Come to think of it, the core principle was similar to Sibulsangpokmae.

"Just as someone uses eyes to draw while someone else hunts, the same sense can function in countless different ways depending on how it's developed. So equipping one additional sense is an enormous merit."

He gained some confidence.

"You probably inherited angelic senses from birth."

'Ikael...'

His heart ached when he thought of her.

"Normally it would end there, but you've opened the 7th sense, Bakji. You've already opened Gunggam, which is called the final sense. That's a sense even Ankera doesn't possess."

'Guffin.'

Shirone pressed his lips tightly together.

Though he bore no responsibility, the two people who designed him might have bequeathed something even greater.

"I don't know how far you can open your senses, but just training your current senses should be enough to compete with other Ivory Tower candidates."

Opening senses was on a different dimension from learning new magic.

'Indeed, just realizing Bakji...'

As he began to feel non-physical concepts like mind and concentration like matter, Shirone's mental power underwent tremendous strengthening.

It was a confirmed fact that Ataraxia's accumulation time had completely disappeared while fighting Igor, the Lord of Fear.

'This is just the beginning. I can become stronger.'

As conviction finally filled Shirone's eyes, Uorin smiled and asked,

"So what's your choice?"

Shirone looked down at the map again and no longer hesitated.

"Here."

Lian and Kido's gazes followed.

The Prison of Time and Space, where Guffin's breath lingered.

I will be where you seek.

"Ra Enemy is here."

It was the labyrinth Andre.
