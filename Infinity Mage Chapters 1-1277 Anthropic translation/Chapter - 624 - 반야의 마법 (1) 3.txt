[624] Wisdom's Magic (1)

'4 seconds. 3 seconds.'

Shirone slowly raised his body upright.

Complete recovery was impossible, but his eyes were clear and there was no sign of disorder to be found.

Entering Survival Instinct Stage 9.

As the guidance voice of the Ithaca system rang out, the participants' hearts dropped with a thud.

'Stage 9.'

Just the number alone felt overwhelming.

"From now on, it's a different dimension. The average ability stats are 8.7 times higher compared to 3rd tier."

It was an increase rate that didn't make sense to apply to an exam, but in reality, there was no such thing as an intermediate stage between 3rd tier and 2nd tier.

Though they had been downsized considering the colosseum's size, only creatures at the demon god level among demons were registered as 2nd tier.

The fire incarnate Phoenix, Peroton who could freeze lakes with just its breath, the grim reaper of death, and Thundara who brought thunderstorms - powerful beings that transcended the category of living things and represented attributes swept through the colosseum.

"We've come this far under the leadership of one person. This makes Survival Instinct itself meaningless. If we're not careful, there could be mass casualties."

Unlike Shirone who had climbed the stages step by step, the other participants were like meeting disaster while just standing still.

"We have no choice but to exploit the virtual system's weakness. Unlike reality, in Ithaca, the higher the tier, the simpler the patterns become."

Upper tier creatures mostly lived outside human habitation areas and even had outstanding intelligence, so simulation data was lacking.

"Of course, if you know the pattern, you could dodge dozens of blades."

That was the terrifying power of intelligence overwhelming force.

"But you can't dodge thousands of blades. They'll dominate in an instant."

"......"

Thousands of blades - that was exactly the situation currently unfolding on the battlefield.

Puoooooo!

Every time three Phoenixes spat fire balls, more than half the colosseum was engulfed in flames.

Peroton, covered in iron scales, flew through the sky with fins as huge as wings, creating straight paths of ice, while Thundara madly poured lightning strikes at random coordinates.

On the ground, a giant 5-meter-tall grim reaper sat on horseback, swinging its scythe of death.

"What do we do now? Can we even take the second evaluation?"

Though Survival Instinct was supposed to select 15 people based on skill, now it was just elimination if you were unlucky.

'No, we'll die. Even in Ithaca, we'll die.'

The attacks from 2nd tier creatures were powerful enough to destroy even a mage's spirit.

'Absolute Barrier!'

As Eden's defensive barrier blocked the front, 17 creatures poured concentrated fire.

"Grraaah!"

Though changing the battery with wide-area defensive magic made the name Absolute Barrier seem meaningless, being able to protect over 20 participants actually raised her value.

"At this rate, our son will die!"

Under the demon gods' barrage, there was nowhere to stand in the colosseum, and inside Eden's barrier was the only safe zone.

"What are you doing right now? We sent him to school to become a mage and now he's going to die!"

The parents knew competition was fierce, but the current situation was beyond comprehension.

"End it here! Let's go to the second round!"

It seemed like testing who was luckier, and if so, it would be better to petition the organizers to move to the next evaluation.

"The situation has become serious."

Olivia said, hearing the parents' outcry.

"But there's no cancellation. That's what the graduation exam is."

Principal Alpheas could no longer intervene from this point.

It was an exam being held simultaneously in all countries under the Red Line.

"Find a solution! We can't hold out any longer!"

Eden's mental strength had reached its limit.

The Phoenix's fireballs spread like oil along the barrier's surface, and Peroton remained fixed in the sky, continuously breathing freezing breath.

'If the barrier breaks...'

Several students were raising their mental power while thinking of their own countermeasures.

"Shirone! It's dangerous!"

Before they could act, Shirone leaped toward the center of the demon gods where all firepower was concentrated.

"Reckless! He'll die!"

Baical didn't want Shirone to die like this.

"What...!"

But Shirone passed through between the demon gods without taking any damage.

"What is that?"

The scouts all stood up abruptly to check more closely.

"Huuuuu!"

As Shirone crossed the colosseum and raised the sequence at the colosseum's edge, golden light burst along his body and soared as the incarnation of a giant archangel.

Kieeeee!

When the Ithaca system captured the most active target, the demon gods all turned direction and charged at once.

"That, that's...!"

Just as everyone sensed a terrible accident, Shirone's time technique created thousands of whirlwinds, distorting the landscape.

'Shining Instantaneous Movement!'

A single flash of light smoothly escaped the chaos mixed with flames, great scythes, freezing breath, and lightning.

"Hrrgh!"

Simultaneously, analysts from each country grabbed their heads and groaned.

"What's happening?"

Elizabeth frowned and shouted.

"The Ithaca system's time is malfunctioning!"

"Time?"

"It can't recognize properly. The error rate is roughly plus-minus 1.14 seconds!"

"What does that mean?"

"Time is going backwards!"

Baical finally looked at Shirone.

There was no particular sense of wrongness, but as errors accumulated in the system, situations where creatures' movements were interrupted began occurring.

"Avatar magic...?"

An ability that only the highest level wisdom practitioners could use was unfolding in the graduation exam's colosseum.

"Miss Reina, this question is a bit strange, but..."

Vincent asked while staring blankly at Shirone weaving through the demon gods.

"Is that student really my son?"

Reina also hadn't imagined such a scene.

"Well, I... don't really know either."

"It's Shirone, father."

Rian placed his hand on Vincent's shoulder and said with an excited face while looking at Shirone.

"I can swear on my sword."

"Now! Everyone attack!"

The participants who had again been outmaneuvered by Shirone belatedly joined the battle.

'Nuclear Fusion!'

As Iruki, who had finished long calculations, activated his deadly magic, an explosion occurred in the colosseum's center.

"52,437 kilobusters! The explosive power exceeded 50 megabusters!"

It was the first time such numbers appeared in a graduation exam.

As if making up for trampled pride, each person's specialty exploded forth, and scouts were busy with evaluation, analysis, and recording simultaneously.

'Just hold out a little longer!'

The total amount of data generated in the colosseum threatened the performance of the Ithaca system specially made for the graduation exam, but even so, they couldn't exterminate the demon gods.

Entering Survival Instinct Stage 10.

"Will we finally see it?"

Just as scouts were moved by an event that could be counted on one hand throughout Red Line history, warning lights flashed.

Ithaca main system access authorized. Activating Level 1 security program. Program Dragon, summoning Fire Dragon Infercus.

The audience's eyes widened at the emergency announcement.

"A dragon?"

Even among 1st tier, it was a supreme creature of a different dimension from intermediate-level liches.

Kieeeeeee!

A tearing roar erupted first, and Fire Dragon Infercus appeared in the colosseum's center with its head seemingly piercing the ceiling.

"What the hell is that?"

Even participants who approached the exam with desperate resolve were frightened by the dragon's ferocious appearance.

Grrrrr...

As Infercus breathed flames between its clenched teeth and roared toward the sky, clouds of fire covered the ceiling!

"Dragon speech."

Dragons perceive and even dominate the world not through language but binary code.

Even the cutting-edge Ithaca system was mere scrap metal compared to a dragon's brain, and the magic created from that powerful computation was completely different from anything human.

Kraaaang!

The form of flames breathed toward the ground seemed like it would pierce right through, and mental damage came from just the transmitted heat.

"Grrgh!"

If this were physical reality, their bodies would have already burned up.

"Dodge!"

"Dodge where?"

The only safe zone was outside the colosseum, which meant elimination from the exam.

'We can't beat this! What are we supposed to do?'

Since it was the final stage, there wasn't even a time limit.

'This is completely perverted!'

While avoiding the breath that turned the earth to lava, participants cursed the unknown exam creator.

It seemed to say, 'How dare you try to solve problems I created?'

"Karinter is indeed a pervert."

Baical knew the person responsible for designing the Survival Instinct evaluation.

"But it's a program officially approved by the Red Line. There must be a blind spot."

There was a blind spot, but it was too narrow.

Kraaa! Kraaa!

Every time Infercus breathed flames, participants were busy just dodging.

"Damn it! Go up to the sky! Let's scatter!"

As Infercus raised its head chasing the participants, it spat thunderous white noise toward the audience seats.

"Aaaaah! What!"

The audience who faced the dragon's breath head-on retreated, forgetting even dignity, but the flames disappeared in front of the audience seats as if blocked by a curtain.

"Take it down! Otherwise we'll all be eliminated!"

Thinking that dragging out time was disadvantageous, all participants cast attack magic, but Infercus seemed completely unaffected, just continuing to breathe flames following set patterns.

"Analyze the parameters. Was Infercus's magic power 360 million magicles?"

Elizabeth opened the percentage parameters.

"Currently 98.7 percent."

After taking attacks from nearly 30 mages, only 1.3 percent had been shaved off.

"Ah, it went up to 98.8 percent."

Like participants, creatures also recovered magic power.

"Based on current numbers, estimated clear time is 197 hours, 44 minutes, 15 seconds."

"...It'll end next year."

"Infercus's set magic recovery rate reaches 14 percent per minute."

It was faster than Shirone's Unthinking.

"Unless we produce firepower that momentarily overwhelms the magic power numbers, the designer will ultimately win."

"What's the point of students winning?"

Annoyed Baical frowned.

"Evaluator! Over there!"

Then Lara pointed to the colosseum.

Shirone was firing lasers, accumulating damage on Infercus's body.

The breath still swept through space terrifyingly, but it couldn't burn Shirone who had activated Shining Instantaneous Movement.

"Now! Everyone attack!"

Participants who already knew the laser's function began casting their deadly magic.

"Parameters."

Elizabeth immediately answered.

"It's decreasing at a considerable speed. 88.7 percent. 86.4 percent."

The participants had only one thought: they had to end it here.

"67.6 percent. 64.2 percent. Estimated clear time reduced to 24 minutes 43 seconds."

"Amazing. But can they maintain this firepower until then?"

"It'll probably be difficult. Actually, the laser's damage accounts for 40 percent of total damage."

"Kraaaaa!"

Infercus let out its first roar of pain.

"Yes, Shirone."

As the hooded woman crossed her legs and put her arm on the adjacent seat, the middle-aged man beside her glanced with displeasure.

"Push it away, the world and all."

When Shirone's laser disappeared, everyone turned their heads.

"Shirone! What are you doing!"

If firepower dropped even slightly, Infercus's mental strength would quickly recover.

'This won't work!'

What he squeezed out with all his might was 4th Dimension Ataraxia combined with Shining Instantaneous Movement.

"52 percent! 53 percent! It keeps recovering!"

The audience who had been cheering with one heart let out disappointed sighs, and even the middle-aged man shifted his hips angrily.

"Eh! That, that! He should attack quickly! How can he give up after coming this far?"

Looking down at the magic circle of the sphere emitting brilliant multicolored light, the hooded woman muttered.

"Ataraxia."

The middle-aged man frowned and asked.

"Are you talking to me now?"

The woman ignored him and continued.

"Long, long ago, angels' existence was like natural disasters to humans. So great and powerful that all they could do was submit."

'What? Is she crazy?'

At her muttering to herself, the middle-aged man turned his head as if looking away.

"Actually, what angels had to fight were dragons who had dominated this planet before humans."

"......"

But it was a strangely compelling story.

"From then on, humanity's gods split in two. Gods of that distant universe became religion, while gods of this place became the names of kings ruling humans, passed down through history."

"What on earth are you talking about..."

Just as the middle-aged man couldn't stand it and asked, the hooded woman whipped her head around and asked.

"Do you know what humans who witnessed the war of gods called angel magic?"

"Well, I don't really know..."

As he stammered at the inexplicable pressure, the woman slightly raised the corner of her mouth and turned her head toward the battlefield.

"Dragon-slaying magic."

Photon Cannon.

The flash that passed through 4th Dimension Ataraxia dispersed in tremendous numbers from the colosseum's outskirts and concentrated on Infercus.

Kraaaaaaang!

"It's dropping again! 44 percent! 38 percent! 27 percent!"

Watching the rush of stars condensing at tremendous speed, the audience felt some sacredness that had been imprinted in their genes since ancient times.

'This is the end!'

Shirone glared at Infercus writhing in pain and raised his arm, clenching his fist tight.

Annihilation magic, Quasar.
