Law War (1)

Melchidu, sanctuary of murderers.

Georgi stood at the place where the Catacomb executives and the believers of Maryu had arrived.

"Is this everyone?"

Elder Euphrapus said.

"Elka and Amidal are dead. Only four remain in the Catacomb now."

Deacon Marit said.

"Still, we've confirmed the emblem's power. If we hold out just a little longer, we should be able to kill Yahweh."

Georgi said, lowering the Devil's Bible.

"No, we end it here."

Gultan asked.

"What do you mean? We should run with our tails between our legs. We need to expand Satanism."

"Now that Yahweh has seen through us, it won't be as easy as before. And above all... we can't escape."

That was true.

"He tracked my quantum movements. That Yahweh has detection abilities that transcend time and space."

Georgi's words made sense, but Gultan had a fundamental doubt.

"Is that really it?"

"What do you mean?"

"Mr. Georgi, you're a demon born from Yahweh's darkness. But perhaps because of that, I don't really feel much hostility toward Yahweh from you. Could it be..."

The dark aura rising from Georgi's body made everyone, including Gultan, tremble.

"Gultan, watch your words."

"Y-yes."

Although all the Catacomb executives were corps commander level, at this moment the hierarchy felt clearly established.

"I don't need your thoughts. Among all demons, only I understand Yahweh."

Marit took a submissive posture.

"We trust you, Mr. Georgi. Everything is happening just as you predicted."

"...Bring Seina."

The Catacomb executives watched as Georgi entered the forest.

'What a strange demon indeed.'

The higher the level a human reaches, the more insignificant their inner darkness typically becomes.

'But Mr. Georgi is a special case.'

To reach Yahweh's level, Sirone had compressed his turbid emotions to the extreme.

'The more darkness is suppressed, the larger it grows.'

That enormous darkness was expelled outside its master and fell into hell.

'That's the leader of Satanism, Georgi.'

A devil created by Yahweh.

"Huu."

Once it was confirmed that Gultan had escaped, Sirone knelt down with a pained expression.

Mica said.

"Let's go back first. The shock from the emblem's spear is greater than expected. You need rest."

The wound from the spear had healed, but Maryu's energy was circulating through his body like poison.

'That was really dangerous.'

The reason Hand of God was pierced was because it wasn't a photon-based ability.

'A technique of the heart.'

An attack that comes regardless of physics.

If Maryu's size had reached near 100 million, his life would have been in danger.

'A spear that kills Yahweh.'

Georgi's judgment in establishing Satanism to assassinate Sirone was accurate.

'I have to stop it before it grows larger.'

Sirone raised his head with a strained expression and cast spatial movement to return to his original location.

When the flash arrived, Eden shouted.

"Sirone!"

"As expected..."

Looking around, all the Maryu believers - that is, the Satanists - had completely disappeared.

Nade and Iruki approached.

"What happened? What about Ms. Seina?"

"I lost her. She seems to have disappeared even from phase space. It must be Georgi's hidden code."

Iruki nodded.

"Same here. They were wrapped in red light and vanished. But if they're not in phase space..."

"Cough! Cough!"

Maximus coughed up blood.

Eden provided emergency treatment with divine power, but there was nothing to be done about the penetrating wound in his heart.

Sirone approached.

"Mr. Maximus."

"They went to Melchidu. The sanctuary of murderers. It's the Catacomb's hideout. I heard it only appears in reality during deep nights filled with dark energy."

"Save your words. I'll heal you now."

Maximus shook his head.

"I know my own condition. I also know Seina's abilities well. And... I'm okay."

Maximus looked peaceful.

"I believed I could turn back time. If I had done this then, if I had made different choices... wouldn't I have been happier? In the end, I succumbed to the devil's temptation."

Sirone listened with a sad expression.

"What I realized too late was that it would have been the same regardless of what decisions I made. The way to avoid regret isn't to make the right decisions, but to live taking responsibility for what you've chosen. I was foolish."

Maximus looked back at Sirone.

"When everyone can take responsibility for their own causes, humanity will achieve unity. But that's either impossible or something for the very distant future. If you want to save humanity, you must dig to the very end of their causes."

The first cause.

"Perhaps even the sin of being born. That would be an incredibly difficult task..."

Maximus grasped Sirone's hand.

"If you can't even dream, miraculous things will never happen. But if even one person dreams, then it's not the end. So please, until the very last..."

An impossible dream.

With a slightly surprised expression, gazing into empty space, Maximus passed away.

"Rest in peace."

Sirone stood up and looked at the people.

The priests freed from Maryu hung their heads, unable even to put on clothes.

"Return to the Vatican."

There was no answer.

"Go back and announce all these facts. If we can't stop Satanism, great disaster will strike."

"B-but!"

One of the priests said in a dying voice.

"What... what right do we have?"

Sirone's eyes hardened.

'That's not the real reason.'

They had enjoyed bestial pleasures that couldn't be done while wearing human masks.

Even if they repented, excommunication was a foregone conclusion, and they would face condemnation from believers worldwide.

The priests were wretched.

'I can't do it even if I die. How can I reveal with my own mouth that I did such things?'

Eden approached Sirone's side.

"It can't be helped. For those people, the title of priest is more important than faith itself. If it were the opposite, they wouldn't have fallen to Satanism in the first place."

Iruki said.

"Let's think about it after we get Ms. Seina back. Maximus said Melchidu? We have to go there."

Nade asked.

"A place that only appears in reality during deep nights filled with dark energy - where in the world is such a space?"

"There is one."

Sirone said.

"In remote places untouched by human feet, the laws of space can develop independently. Actually, the civilizations of tribes hidden in jungles are vastly different from ours, right? It's about different observers' perspectives. When such tendencies persist for a very long time, they become places like the Bustark Triangle or the Sky Mountain of the Mino Range."

Iruki nodded.

"Places where ships suddenly disappear, or magnetic fields become so strong that stones float. But for that kind of system to settle would take a really long time."

"Right. In the case of the Bustark Triangle, there was a blank in observation for over 10,000 years. The currents were so strong that ships could only circle around the triangle's perimeter. That relative isolation created holes in the laws. Of course, now that navigation technology has advanced, it's gradually closing up. Other regions are also disappearing one by one due to civilization's expansion."

Sirone raised his index finger.

"But places untouched by civilization still remain. I've seen them in Andre's Labyrinth. Cities like Codename where all populations are ranked, or White-Black where you must choose between black and white."

"Ah."

He had heard about this before.

"Melchidu must also be a place with its own laws. Since Mr. Maximus called it a sanctuary of murderers..."

Eden frowned.

"A place established through murderers' perspectives."

"...Probably."

It was horrifying just to imagine.

Delta Headquarters.

The National Intelligence Service office at the center of Tormia Sector was hot as a steamer.

"Huu."

Though access was strictly controlled, the heat emanating from Dante also played a part.

"Ah, really!"

Unable to bear it any longer, he slammed the table, causing three staff members to look at Dante.

"Chief, please calm down."

"...Sorry."

He quickly regained his composure and apologized, but his overheated brain showed no signs of cooling.

Dante, with a cigarette in his mouth, carefully examined the chart showing the relationships between the 12 Holy Nations.

'The whereabouts of Luhm, Garto, and Temica.'

Within a network more complex than a spider web, Dante calculated all possibilities.

'The problem is that I keep missing the mark.'

Even at this very moment, officials from the 12 nations would be making contact in the shadows.

Tormia was the same.

But the results from intelligence were quite different from Dante's predictions.

'It's because of that pyramid.'

The immediate change was the decline of angels, but that alone completely revised each nation's strategy.

Dante was world-class in information processing, but changing systems were difficult.

'A changing system means the meaning contained in information changes. Apples become knives. This isn't information warfare.'

It's law war.

'Therefore, we need someone with the ability to extract meaning from information - an expert in laws.'

This was why liaison nations were flocking to the Moon Kingdom.

'So an alliance after all. No, we need an expert on our side anyway. But if we just bring in anyone... security will collapse.'

'There are talented people in Tormia too, but I can't trust them. Once it leaks, it's over.'

Just seeing Flu approach Gis showed there was no one to trust.

Dante stubbed out his cigarette that had burned to the filter, put on his clothes, and headed for the door.

"I'm going to get some fresh air."

"Chief..."

The staff members with sad expressions looked at the closed door and said.

"We're hot too."

Dante, who had left Delta Headquarters, lit a cigarette while feeling the wind cool his sweat.

"Ah, annoying."

As he watched the guards patrolling, he heard voices from beyond the wall.

"Please let us in!"

"Huh?"

It was an accent familiar to Dante.

"The laws are changing! If we don't warn humanity, disaster will strike soon!"

A guard shouted.

"I told you, you need a state-certified entry pass! Do you know how many capable people there are here besides you?"

"I'm Lilia from the Arcanes Divine Order. I'm the mage who worked with Mr. Miro in Zion!"

"Miro or whatever, if you keep this up, according to international law..."

"Lilia?"

The guard who turned at the voice from behind quickly stepped aside.

"I'm sorry. This woman was causing a disturbance."

There was no need to check the affiliation badge worn on the chest of someone coming from headquarters.

"Oh? Dante!"

As Lilia happily raised her hand and tried to approach, the guards blocked her.

"I said no!"

"Dante! Tell these people something! Something big is happening in the world right now!"

"Ah..."

Dante walked over with a blank expression.

"Time waves will come rushing soon. If we don't suppress the pyramid's power... Eek!"

Before she could finish speaking, Dante pulled her into his arms.

"Um... Dante?"

As Lilia awkwardly rolled her eyes, Dante let out a sigh of relief.

"Ahhhhh."

I'm saved.
