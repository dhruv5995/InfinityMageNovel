City of Magical Engineering (2)

Void, the deputy director of the Fire Company, took Monoras and left the Marquis of Picaras territory.

"The president said to get to Labiet as quickly as possible. If we hurry..."

Monoras, whose belly was churning from swallowing all those massive bribes, changed direction.

"Let's do this instead. I'm way too heavy right now, you know? So I need to lighten this load a bit."

Monoras's gaze was fixed on the gambling city of 'Unlucky.'

"Deputy Director! We don't have time for this!"

Void shouted, but Monoras's body was already flying toward Unlucky.

Meanwhile, at the Fire Company...

"It's done."

Lete, who had worked through the night processing official business, looked up at the ceiling with a tired face.

His head was spinning and drowsiness was pouring over him.

"...I need to work."

He had sent Void, but this matter was too important to leave entirely to others.

Throwing on some rags and leaving the president's office, the employees who had just arrived for work bowed their heads.

"President, where are you going?"

"Business trip. I'm going to Labiet. I've processed all the pending approval documents, so things should be fine for a while."

"You look so tired. You didn't sleep a wink last night either, did you? You should at least get some rest..."

"I'm fine. Everyone's working hard. Oh, right, let's stop by the cafeteria together. I need to pick up some snacks that Monoras likes."

"Yes. I'll let them know."

The employees liked the Fire Company's president.

"You're really amazing though. I hope you don't mind me saying this, but I don't think I could stand the Deputy Director's personality."

"Haha, but she's good-hearted deep down. Being the deputy director, she must have her own struggles."

'Doesn't seem like it at all.'

Sometimes he wondered if she had amnesia.

Hell's morning.

Flames reeking of sulfur filled the sky, evaporating the previous night's cold snap.

"We've arrived."

The grand castle where the Archduke lived was one of the largest structures in Labiet.

Unlike the desolate landscape that dominated the city, it was neat and tidy, and above all, it resembled a building from reality.

"I knew you'd like it. Come, let's go in. The Archduke is waiting."

Following Bielmann's guidance into the castle, they found a luxurious feast prepared.

"Welcome, Yahweh. And your companions."

The Archduke, dining at the head of the table, set down his utensils and smiled.

He had the appearance of an elderly man with a white beard reaching down to his chest and a kindly expression.

'Archduke Magritte.'

The lack of any special reaction from Rian was clear evidence that he was tense.

'He's definitely formidable.'

Compared to Hell's army, it felt like facing a legion commander ranked within the top 10.

"If it's before your meal, how about joining me?"

Steam was rising from the food that had clearly just been prepared.

Rian swallowed his saliva.

Unlike the restaurant food, this looked like something humans would eat, and the utensils were familiar too.

"Do you always eat like this?"

As Shirone sat across from him and asked, Rian also quietly took a seat beside him.

"When you've lived this long, there's really nothing particularly important in the world. Anyway, I put some thought into it."

He was even fluent in the continental common language, which only heightened their wariness of Magritte.

'He's no ordinary opponent.'

He might not be as strong as a legion commander, but he was a key factor in the current situation.

While eating the prepared food, Shirone asked,

"I'd like to hear a direct explanation about what happened yesterday. The demon race you sent, Archduke, used strange abilities."

"Just entertainment, entertainment. How could I dare lay a hand on Yahweh with something like that?"

"So, what was it?"

For the first time, their gazes clashed and the atmosphere rapidly grew cold.

"Desire. It's a demonic substance I created."

Magritte took a step back.

"By refining turbid magic with special techniques, you can obtain a special substance that reacts to desires. About 0.1 grams can be extracted per human who falls to Hell."

How many humans would need to be ground up for that?

"War advances technology. Humans are desperate, but we can't just sit back and take it either. I was confident this substance would bring victory to the demon race. The problem is..."

Magritte adjusted his expression.

"The Spiritual Realm was closed. Before Desire could be commercialized and supplied to the army."

In the end, Seongeum was right.

"If the system had been destroyed, it could be fixed, but that woman used the system. Once someone enters from inside and closes it, it can't be reopened. Not until she's purified."

Power filled Shirone's eyes as he dropped his pretense.

"How long will it take?"

"I don't know. The Fire Company would know, but I didn't feel like asking. Since then, I've been somewhat neglectful of technological development, just killing time, and when I heard Yahweh had arrived, I played a little prank."

Magritte leaned forward.

"Now let me ask. What brings someone busier than myself to this Hell?"

"To destroy the demon world."

A catastrophic system that only upper legion commanders could wield was tormenting reality.

"I'm thinking of going to the Fire Company to settle things. You'll probably need to lend your strength."

"Hmm."

Magritte stroked his beard.

"Of course, the demon world's power is based in Hell. Since you can't crush the sprout, you'll burn the roots?"

"Yes. I'll purify Hell. Even if it means all demon races disappear. But if it's you... couldn't you find some better method?"

"If that's a threat, you've gone too far. Even with the Spiritual Realm closed, demon races are born endlessly. Hell's army, the legion commanders - they'll all be restored given time."

"You want to end it too, don't you? This tiresome yoke between reality and the other side."

Magritte's eyes half-closed.

"Do you believe in that legendary lesson that 'not all evil refuses to repent'?"

He rose from his seat.

"Of course, such things did exist. Very long ago. But don't be mistaken. I haven't reached such noble enlightenment. I'm just one of countless common demon races who hate Yahweh and dislike humans."

"There should be room for negotiation?"

"Hehe. Do humans negotiate with dogs and pigs?"

Killing intent flashed in Rian's eyes.

"Don't misunderstand. Well, if you're offended, let's say demon races are dogs and pigs. In any case, we're completely different species. We can never have the same purpose."

Magritte turned and walked away.

"It was a pleasant breakfast. Then may you achieve everything you desire in Hell..."

Even at his mocking tone, Shirone responded calmly.

"What if I open the Spiritual Realm for you?"

Magritte's steps stopped.

"...What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said. If I open the Spiritual Realm that Seongeum has closed, would you be able to help us?"

Magritte turned back to Shirone.

"So Yahweh lies too. No demon race understands Hell's system better than I do. True Seongeum - that woman can never find freedom until her karma is exhausted. Which means opening the Spiritual Realm is impossible."

"I can break the Karma Chain."

"Impossible."

"Rian."

At Shirone's words, Rian rose from his seat and filled his entire body with powerful force.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Gehenna's chains burst from his chest and struck the ground, causing Magritte's brow to furrow.

The next moment, four chains snapped with a clink and were sucked back into Rian's chest.

"...How?"

Shirone smiled and said,

"How about it? Don't you want to analyze this? There seems to be some hidden code you don't know about."

A system error?

Magritte, who had been glaring at Shirone with sharp eyes, raised his right hand in front of his chest.

Simultaneously, chains emerged from Rian's solar plexus and entered his grasp.

"Graaah!"

As the displeased Rian exerted force again, heat like molten metal was transmitted to Magritte's hand.

Sizzzzz!

Even as burning sounds could be heard, Magritte kept his gaze down, examining the chains.

After staring at Rian with a serious expression, he threw the chains away, and they embedded in the floor with a thunk.

"Tch!"

After confirming that Rian broke them again, he walked to the window with his hands behind his back.

Silence continued for a while.

'This is no ordinary problem.'

The first person who came to Magritte's mind was the Fire Company's president.

'Lete couldn't not know. But still not coming, no, the fact that Yahweh reached me first means...'

Is Hell also heading toward ruin now?

'If it's the natural order, it can't be helped.'

How naive was the thought that only Hell would be safe in the grand cycle?

"Tell them to prepare lunch."

After saying this, Magritte snapped his fingers at Bielmann and moved away.

"Open the underground laboratory."

When they arrived at the Archduke's laboratory, a one-meter-tall young succubus came running over.

"Hello, Archduke. Huh?"

The succubus's face turned pale upon discovering Shirone.

"Ya-Yahweh!"

She instinctively activated her dream demon ability, but rather than being seductive, she was merely cute.

"They're guests. Treat them politely."

As the succubus looked dazed with her ability dispelled, the Archduke turned around in front of the central device.

"This is Mercedes, who manages the laboratory. For the time being, that child will attend to Yahweh's needs."

Rian looked around.

There were easily over 200 massive glass tubes containing human samples.

"Are they all dead?"

"In reality, death is 'sleep from which one doesn't wake,' but in Hell, death is only purification. Well, if you meant 'sleep from which one doesn't wake,' then let's say yes."

Shirone asked,

"Why did you bring us here?"

"Just breaking Gehenna's chains isn't enough to determine a system error. First, I'll examine Rian's body. And if possible, please assist as well, Yahweh. You'll serve as reference data."

As Magritte activated the device, two capsules opened with a whooshing sound.

"Please enter here."

Rian thought of the humans sleeping in the 200 glass tubes, but Shirone obediently walked forward.

"Wait, Shirone. It could be a trap."

"It's fine."

Shirone didn't stop.

"The Archduke enjoys intellectual battles with enemies, but he doesn't stoop to exploiting opponents' weaknesses."

That was the kind of demon race Guffin knew the Archduke to be.

"Right?"

Magritte avoided Shirone's gaze and turned toward the device.

"Please enter. It won't take long."

As Shirone and Rian entered the capsules, the doors closed and clear water filled them.

The moment water rose above their chins, Rian turned his head, but Shirone remained calm.

The interior of the capsules filled completely with water, then the water level quickly dropped after 5 seconds.

Mercedes reported,

"Scan complete. Transmitting to demon world screen."

"Hmm."

Magritte examined a rectangular steel plate containing shallow, blood-red liquid.

Rian's information was being extracted.

"Th-this is...!"

Numbers that had never been seen in any demon race were being engraved on the red plate.
