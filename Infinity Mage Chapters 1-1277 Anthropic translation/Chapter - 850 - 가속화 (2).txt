Acceleration (2)

"Hmm."

Parkma, division commander of Hell's Army 7th Corps, glared at the Ifrit and brought down his axe.

"This is... rather interesting?"

Behind Amy, a sergeant shouted.

"Battalion Commander! Quickly, this way!"

"Go ahead. I'll buy us time."

"We can't do that!"

They couldn't retreat and leave their commanding officer behind.

"Don't worry. I won't overdo it. If we don't retreat now, the entire unit will be wiped out."

Through the Spirit Zone, the confusion of her subordinates was transmitted to her.

"Hurry!"

At Amy's sharp command, the troops who had snapped back to their senses rushed out in a crowd, and Parkma burst into laughter.

"Magnificent! Sacrificing yourself for your subordinates. Well, that's what makes tormenting humans so entertaining."

The longer she could drag this out, the more survivors there would be among her allies, so Amy remained silent.

"I've decided."

As Parkma swung his axe, a fierce wind howled and the Ifrit's body swayed greatly.

"Pain won't work on a human like you. I'll whisper sweet words and slowly melt you down."

As a woman who had stepped onto the battlefield, she had already prepared herself for what treatment a defeated woman might receive.

"How disappointing. Is that the best you can do?"

Compared to her resolve, the demon's pathetically inadequate threat was actually ridiculous.

"I'm more of an action type. Once you're caught in my hands, you won't have time to feel disappointed."

That was also true.

Confirming that her allies had gained distance, Amy's eyes blazed as she charged forward.

'A demon division commander.'

For Amy, who aimed to become a Valkyrie Corps Commander, this was a mountain she would have to climb someday.

'Fire Fist!'

The Ifrit's fists swung like a gale, causing explosions of flame from all directions.

Each strike had power equivalent to advanced magic.

"Is this all you've got?"

But once you reach a certain level, raw power becomes basic technique that anyone possesses.

"Too easy isn't fun either, but..."

Parkma, who had broken through the Ifrit's flames, twisted his waist and raised his axe.

"I've taken a liking to you!"

As he delivered a powerful strike, a tearing sound erupted from the three holes in the axe.

Sonic waves of corruption.

The moment Amy heard the irresistible sound, hellish scenery unfolded before her eyes.

'What is this?'

Rotted arms rose from underground to grab her ankles, and before she knew it, corpses filled her surroundings.

'My body won't move.'

Was she in shock?

'But my mind is clear?'

She remembered hearing that terrible sound.

"Hehehehe..."

The corpses that had crawled up from the ground surrounded Amy and pried open her mouth with their hands.

Parkma was walking toward her through the corpses.

"Kukuku, finally caught."

He approached Amy and held out a centipede with dozens of legs.

"Eat it. It'll be delicious."

It was the height of revulsion, but a trained mage's mind perfectly separated situation from emotion.

'It's not that I can't move.'

This was an illusion that occurred the moment the sonic waves pierced her brain.

'Time hasn't passed.'

Time is a deception of the five senses; a brain separated from sensation cannot feel the passage of time.

The moment the insect entered her forcibly opened mouth, crimson flames blazed in Amy's eyes.

Self-memory reset could initialize anything related to mental effects.

As her pupils turned red, cracks began to appear throughout the hellish scenery.

'Revert.'

To the state just before hearing the sound.

As she regained her senses, she saw Parkma reaching out with a grotesque smile.

"Got youâ€”!"

Amy's body reflexively turned, and Parkma's center of gravity suddenly shifted forward.

"Puuuu!"

Flames began to blaze around Amy's fist as she amplified her mind to the level of Ildo.

'Eat this instead!'

Using rotational force drawn up from her lower body, she struck Parkma's side, causing an explosion.

"Kraaa!"

Parkma, blown away by the shockwave, clutched his side where black smoke was rising.

"You..."

Parkma's face twisted ominously, but Amy paid no heed and took a fighting stance.

"I'll remember this."

Light flashed in Parkma's eyes.

"I'll never forget. Even if I have to gouge out my own retinas, I'll engrave your face there. Remember this. I won't forget you."

If she was immune to mental attacks, then direct confrontation would be disadvantageous. Parkma leaped high and retreated toward his allied forces.

"I struck with killing intent."

She could truly feel the power of a division commander.

"Amy!"

Tess's voice was heard.

The cavalry unit she led was cutting through the demons and approaching.

"Tess!"

Tess, who had precisely embedded three swords into the demons' eyes, pulled Amy up onto her horse.

"What are you doing here! Everyone else has retreated!"

Sitting back-to-back, Amy fired flame magic toward the rear as she shouted.

"How's the battle situation?"

"We're completely pushed back. Orders came down to pull the defensive line back 2 kilometers."

Amy bit her lip.

'Damn it! I couldn't even take down one division commander.'

The difference in power was stark.

The victory reports from the other side of the world, as rare as beans in a drought, felt like lies.

* *

Sirone stood up urgently.

"What on earth is happening?"

Murderous intent gleamed in Seongeum's eyes.

"Hell's army has completely dominated the seas. The 8th Corps Commander Miturah. A demon who rules the ocean. There's no way for Jincheon to stop him."

At the name of one of the top 10 corps commanders, Sirone's expression changed.

"What about the demon realm?"

"It hasn't opened yet. Even so, being pushed back is shameful. I heard rumors that you saved Kashan. Please help us."

As Seongeum tried to bow again, Sirone hurriedly grabbed her arm.

"Don't do this. If it's about fighting demons, I should help. But first, there's something I need to confirm..."

As Sirone trailed off, Lian glanced sideways.

'There's no way he wouldn't be concerned.'

He had been secretly hoping for it.

For the Ivory Tower's leadership to evaluate the demons invading the central continent as the highest risk factor.

"I know what you're worried about. I heard from Taeseong."

"Huh? Taeseong?"

Seongeum's eyes intensified.

"If they secure naval supremacy, Jincheon will immediately attack Gustav. It could be called Hell's army's main base. If we can gain the upper hand there..."

Sirone realized it too.

"Hell's army fighting in the central continent will have no choice but to return to Gustav."

Even without corps commanders, it was the unit where Habitz was located.

"If you help Jincheon, we'll help you too. No, I'll find a way no matter what it takes..."

"Alright."

He couldn't bear to watch that upright Seongeum's expression crumble any longer.

As he extended his hand toward the living water, the Material dissolved and 'Beolsal' returned to Sirone's hand.

The reason he could grant mobility to his matter-creating ability was because Material was Armand's consciousness.

'Naval warfare...'

The fact that he had never fought on water showed just how short Sirone's growth period had been, but with Material, he should be able to find a way.

"Let's go, Lian."

As Lian nodded energetically and stood behind Sirone, Seongeum cast an ether wave.

"Thank you."

The moment Sirone's lips curved up slightly, the three people suddenly vanished from the mountains.

Heaven's 3rd Heaven, Shehakim.

Ikael, who had organized Heaven's army, visited the Eternal Community's Council of Ten Elders before departure.

Called by La Enemy, nine executives had crossed over to the ground world, but only one remained here.

'No, she couldn't leave.'

Entering the secret chamber, she saw a woman who appeared to be in her teens sitting at one spot of the long table.

It was to the left of where leader Beron used to sit.

"What are you waiting for in this place where everyone has left?"

Council of Ten Elders, 2nd in hierarchy - Son Yujeong.

Despite her youthful appearance, she was easily over 10,000 years old, yet remained silent even at the archangel's visit.

'Was this really the right thing to do?'

This matter had been much debated even at the Archangel Council's White Mirror, and Ymir in particular had been disgusted.

In Heaven's history, there had been a powerful being who reached the realm of breaking boundaries before Ymir or Ozent.

'She'll become uncontrollable. She's different from Ymir.'

Yujeong had no purpose in life.

Having no standards for judgment made her closer to pure evil.

'I wish she would come to her senses.'

The golden ring that Ankera had placed on her head to restrain her became useless when Nane permitted breaking boundaries.

"Will you fight for Heaven?"

Even so, the reason she had to bring her was because Satan, the natural enemy of angels, had descended to the ground world.

'I need Son Yujeong.'

Fight chaos with chaos.

This was the conclusion Ikael had reached after much deliberation before the final battle with the ground world.

"For Heaven?"

Yujeong turned her head and stuck out her tongue.

"Why would I do such a thing?"

Ikael's eyes widened as she swung her hand, shattering the chair to pieces.

Screech! Screech!

What hastily leaped away and clung to the wall was not a human, but a single monkey.

"I wasn't asking a mere beast."

She approached like the wind, grabbed the monkey by the neck, and pulled it close to her face.

"Where is your master now?"

The one Ikael sought was a descendant of the warrior who had attained enlightenment in a monkey's body and risen to the ranks of gods.

Son Yujeong, great-granddaughter of Son Goku.

Screech! Screech screech!

As the monkey pointed beyond the wall with a dying expression, Ikael looked up at the ceiling.

Her halo rotated and instantly broke through the wall and rose up, revealing a sky 2 kilometers high.

Screeeeech!

The terrified monkey wet itself on the ground.

"Where?"

The moment it pointed to a mountain range beyond the horizon, Ikael's 'Looking Down' swept across the entire mountain range.

Finding Yujeong, she sighed and became a streak of light extending toward the mountains.

Screech! Screeech!

Landing on the ground, the monkey wiped its tears with its arms and leaped into the darkness of a massive cave.

Following behind, Ikael relied on the light of her sacred luminous body to examine the dim cave scenery.

On the floor covered in dry sand, she saw a girl lying down using her disheveled black hair as a pillow.

"Get up. Are you going to sleep for hundreds of years?"

"Mmm?..."

Yujeong frowned, then put her hand in her pants, scratched vigorously, and smelled it.

Ikael, who knew how to handle her, shouted.

"Get up!"

"Ah, damn! Really!"

As if nothing had happened, Yujeong suddenly sat up and turned her head.

"This is annoying as hell! Why are you waking me up and making a fuss?"

"There's a battle. Come with me."

Yujeong let out a snort of laughter.

"Battle? Has the angel gone senile? Looking at those glazed eyes, you've completely lost it, haven't you?"

"Buddha has permitted breaking boundaries. There's nothing left to restrain you now."

Blinking, Yujeong checked the golden band around her head and pulled it off with her hand.

"Huh? It really comes off?"

"I have need of you. If we win this war, I'll give you freedom."

Yujeong tossed the golden band away.

"No thanks. Too bothersome."

"Still arrogant. Do you really think you'll be safe acting like that in front of me?"

"What if I'm not safe?"

Taking up her staff and assuming a stance to leap out, golden light blazed from Yujeong's eyes.

"What are you going to do about it?"

Energy powerful enough to explode the cave rippled through the air.

'As expected, threats don't work.'

Ikael tried a second approach.

"If you don't want to do it, then don't. But shouldn't you save your friend who has fallen into hell?"

"Friend? What friend?"

"Council of Ten Elders rank 10, Mortasinger. She's been dragged away by the ruler of evil and is suffering."

"What? Molta?"

Yujeong shot to her feet.

If there was anything she could be counted on for, it was that she understood the way of monkeys.

"If you don't want to, it can't be helped. Just keep sleeping here..."

"Wait."

Yujeong bared her fangs.

"What bastard is tormenting my friend?"

Ikael smiled and pointed outside the cave.

"Satan."
