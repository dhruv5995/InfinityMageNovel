[598] Cube of Time (5)

Fermi waited endlessly for an answer.

'If I twist the events, mother can live.'

But to Fermi, Yolga was more than just a mother, so even denying her death felt like an insult.

That's why he wanted to know.

Why Yolga had to enter the upper levels, why such an outstanding mother couldn't return to her family's embrace.

"In life, there are many times when we lose our way."

Yolga finally spoke.

"But Fermi, contemplating right and wrong is always a good thing, no matter what. When we stop contemplating it, that's when human existence loses its value."

"Even if I... were the world's greatest villain?"

Yolga smiled kindly.

"Humans choose between good and evil, not the other way around."

Then she placed her hand on Fermi's now-grown shoulder.

"Always remember this fact - that you can still choose. If you do, even if you lose your way, you'll be able to find it again."

All parents embrace their children, but Yolga's words held a benevolence that encompassed Fermi's entire being.

'My mother. My own mother.'

No, she was the mother of the entire world.

"Does that answer your question? I'm not sure if it's adequate compensation for the fine item you gave me."

"More than enough."

As Fermi turned around, Yolga hurriedly asked.

"Where will you go now?"

"Forward."

Fermi turned his head and smiled.

"Because I've made my choice."

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 2 hours 13 minutes.
Space: Supernatural Psychic Research Society.

It was a fierce battle.

Mustang, who freely manipulated the three attributes of fire, cold, and air, deployed magic that seemed to be uniquely developed and nonexistent in the world, while Anchal, the director of the Jincheon Space Agency, was defending by drawing out every possible illusion.

Shirone's Elysion pressured Edgar and Nine by casting magic on space itself rather than targeting objects, and Miro's Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara was now pummeling Yolga's body as if consumed by madness.

'You really are strong, Miro.'

It wasn't just a matter of realm - Miro's very existence transcended humanity.

'I can understand why Guffin chose you.'

If Yolga had reached the realm of Prajna from the world's lowest position, Miro looked down at the world from a place higher than human thought.

'I want to rely on you.'

The fact that being by Miro's side brought peace of mind was a completely different temperament from Yolga's tendency to blindly embrace someone.

'If I am humanity's mother...'

Miro is humanity's father.

At the forefront of crisis, showing no sign of any pain and sacrificing only himself to protect humanity.

'Yes, Miro. We weren't wrong.'

But the world says only one of them can remain.

In a situation where humanity's end approaches, what do humans need - a father or a mother?

Yolga smiled contentedly.

'You've grown up well.'

The face of a young man flashed through her mind.

That's why this isn't the end.

"Miro, I can't go easy on you anymore."

The kindness disappeared from Yolga's expression.

Prajna

Fa Maria.

"Really? Now this is getting interesting!"

Since Fa Maria could cause destruction, Miro accelerated the Avalokitesvara's combo even more.

This was after Anchal had crushed Mustang with his Jincheon Magic Mighty Hammer and Shirone had defeated Edgar and Nine.

'He must think he can't buy more time.'

That's what Miro thought, but Yolga was smiling.

"What...!"

Just as the Avalokitesvara's Paradise Palms flew in from both sides to crush her, a flash of light swooped in and snatched her away.

"Ugh!"

Released from his photonization state, Fermi gritted his teeth as he slid across the floor and slammed his head against the wall with a thud.

"Fermi?"

Yolga looked back at Fermi with a surprised expression.

He was covered in blood all over his body, with serious sword wounds in various places.

"How did you end up like this..."

"Hehe. They're quite formidable, the people targeting you."

To prevent Yolga's death, Fermi had fought Mars and achieved the feat of eliminating 14 members.

Thanks to having numerous advanced magic spells, he was able to eliminate 14 members of the kingdom's top assassination unit, but he couldn't avoid fatal injuries in the process.

Yolga, who had laid Fermi down on the floor, looked around the research society.

Edgar and Nine's corpses lay fallen in front of Guffin's door, and Mustang was dead next to the bleeding and kneeling Anchal.

Finally turning her gaze to Miro, she spoke.

"I'm going to disappear. Please grant me a favor instead."

"No, don't ask favors. Don't disappear either. Just come out with me."

"Die!"

At that moment, Nickel, Mars's captain, entered the research society.

Covered in the blood of the subordinates Fermi had killed, his eyes were filled with the will to complete his mission.

"I'll kill him!"

'Idiot! That's not Hexa!'

To Nickel, who didn't understand the current situation, it was natural that Cazla's prince would look like the child Miro was holding.

"No!"

As Yolga ran toward the child, warning sounds from <The Last Cry of the Jaeger Family> erupted continuously in her ears.

"Danger!"

The girl's scream meant death.

"Danger!"

She'll die.

"Danger! Danger! Danger!"

She'll die. She'll die. She'll die.

Kicking away dozens of chances to live, she headed only toward a future with nothing but death.

Nickel's sword pierced through her back.

"Gasp!"

Yolga's head shot up toward the ceiling, and Nickel twisted the blade to push the sword deeper.

'I must kill the child!'

The trained soldier's mind was cold as a machine.

Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara

Single Strike.

Just before the sword tip could stab the prince, the Avalokitesvara's palm flew in and separated Nickel's face from his body.

Behind Yolga, who had fallen to her knees with a thud, Fermi stood up, grabbing one shoulder.

"Moth..."

But Miro's words came first.

"Why?"

It was incomprehensible.

"This child was destined to be trapped forever anyway! Why do you keep doing foolish things?"

"That too is something he must choose for himself."

Miro saw Yolga's limit.

"Miro, trust us. Trust that we can protect the future with our strength."

"Even if you say that, you won't remember once you leave here. It'll be erased! You foolish sister!"

"No, I'm sure we'll be able to remember."

Yolga smiled as if her life was burning.

"Because you're not foolish."

Remember.

Miro clenched both fists.

She would definitely remember what Yolga conveyed through her death.

Yolga's body, seemingly satisfied, fell backward, and Fermi hurriedly caught her.

'Mom.'

He felt he should say it.

"Moth..."

"Fermi, thank you."

Yolga raised her hand to stroke Fermi's cheek.

"Your choice changed the world. My proud..."

Her hand fell limply.

"My son."

Thus Yolga left Fermi's side.

Just like 19 years ago.

"Thank you, mother."

But he no longer grieved, and sent Yolga off with a smile just like his mother's.

"Fermi! Get away!"

The moment Shirone shouted, powerful lightning struck around Fermi.

As he threw himself while embracing Yolga's corpse, a black shadow grabbed Cazla's prince and rushed to a corner.

"Hah! Hah!"

Likan, bleeding from his head, gripped the child's neck and glared at Fermi.

"Traitor. How dare you use me?"

"You should speak properly. You weren't used - you were the one being used, weren't you?"

Knowing Fermi's personality, Likan asked directly.

"Where are the objects? Hand them all over."

"I don't have them."

Electricity flowed through Likan's hand gripping the child's neck.

"If you don't want to kill an innocent person, bring the objects."

Knowing Yolga's identity, Likan also knew that the child she risked her life to protect would be useful for blackmail.

"Even so, I don't have them. They were all destroyed."

"Then find a way. It's your specialty, isn't it? Create them if you have to. Otherwise, this child dies."

It would be impossible for anyone to snatch the child away from Likan, who was wrapped in electricity.

"Likan, you'd better judge wisely. There's nothing good about making me angry."

"Hehe, that was true until now. But not anymore."

Likan's gaze turned to Yolga's corpse.

He thought using the incident of his mother's disappearance to replicate objects was everything.

But when he actually opened the lid, Fermi turned out to be human after all.

"You pathetic bastard. Just because you missed mommy's embrace..."

To Likan, who couldn't even guess how the complex incidents in the upper levels would change the future or what Fermi truly wanted to protect, it was a natural misunderstanding.

"I don't need to explain to you. But the moment you refuse my words, your life will become difficult."

"You know what, Fermi?"

Killing intent flashed in Likan's eyes.

"I've always found you annoying."

With a crackling sound, lightning erupted and the child's crying stopped. Likan threw the corpse and activated lightning magic to escape the research society.

"Likan!"

As Fermi burst out in furious rage and gave chase, Shirone immediately moved to check on Cazla's prince.

"He's dead. Let's change the events again."

It was regrettable that Yolga's will was broken.

"Do as you please. I'm going out."

But Miro had to protect Yolga's teachings, the realization of how important choice was to humans.

'Sister's last memory. I'll definitely take it with me.'

To do that, she had to leave now.

"Once I leave Estas, the time loop will be completely closed. I'll end the incident with this."

If the events were twisted, Yolga's death would unfold in a different direction and Miro's resolve would also become a non-existent event.

If Hexa became trapped in the space-time barrier like that, consequently Shirone would also be unable to remain here.

"I don't know when it will be, but if we meet again someday, please remember today's events."

Miro crossed the threshold of the research society.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 2 hours 35 minutes.
Space: Warehouse No. 9.

Even while Shirone was operating Estas's mechanism, Anchal's nagging continued.

"Shirone, let's just end it here. Twisting events any further is dangerous."

Shirone gave no response.

"Think carefully! If it leads to the worst possible event...!"

"I'll meet him."

"What?"

Shirone's eyes sharpened as he pressed the completion button.

"I'll meet Guffin."

"What are you talking about? How will you meet Guffin?"

Guffin definitely exists.

In the world before 0:00, when Miro enters and the incident occurs.

'Guffin, I don't know what you're thinking by doing this, but...'

Listening to the vibrating sound of Estas changing its structure, Shirone left the warehouse.

'You'll have to convince me!'

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 2 hours 42 minutes.
Space: Estas Warehouse No. 72.

Covered in blood all over her body, Miro walked with stumbling steps.

If she left Estas like this, time would be isolated and only the events she experienced would circulate.

"Shirone."

With the exit right in front of her, Miro stopped dead in her tracks.

"Don't come. Whatever you're thinking, you absolutely must not come here."

It was a warning to Shirone, who would be watching from behind Anchal's illusion magic and had just entered.

Rumble!

As soon as she finished speaking, Estas vibrated and the structure's positions began to change.

"This idiot...!"

Turning around, Miro saw Shirone running toward her.

'I will definitely meet Guffin!'

It would probably be possible.

If only she could reach 0:00.

'Shibulsangpokmae!'

The closed loop of Warehouse No. 72 began to open.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 0:00.
Space: Estas Warehouse No. 72.

Miro, holding Hexa in her arms, looked back at Guffin outside the exit and asked.

"How much time do I have?"

After hearing Guffin's words, she nodded.

"Don't worry. I'll definitely succeed."

"Guffin!"

The moment Shirone's phantom appeared, running with his temporis blazing, time began to flow backward.

As Miro, performing her actions in reverse, disappeared outside the light barrier walking backward, Shirone leaped into the exit.

'Come out!'

The starting point of the 2 hours and 48 minutes record.

But to Shirone, one second of the past was also the present...

'I know you're there!'

Finally, Shibulsangpokmae leaped beyond the barrier of time.

<Event Coordinates>

Time:

1 second.

Space: Unknown.
