[796] Complex (1)

"Excuse me."

The Justin Guild members, who had finished breakfast and were about to head to the competition venue, turned their heads toward the unwelcome visitor.

"If you have business, I suppose you'd have to excuse yourself. But who are you?"

It was a sharp-featured woman with short hair and large glasses that were clearly worn for fashion, giving her a prim impression.

"Isn't this the Justin Guild?"

Eyepatch stepped forward as their representative.

"Of course this is Justin... Urk!"

He had been about to make a joke, but when a pale man with shaved eyebrows entered, he hastily backed away.

"What are you doing in a place like this?"

As Freeman looked around, the top four executives of the Parrot Mercenary Group filed in one after another.

'They're masters.'

Each one had an extraordinary aura.

Finally, Justin stood up and asked confrontationally.

"What are you people? Barging into someone else's guild first thing in the morning."

Marsha let out a snicker.

"Really now, if you're going to call people over, you should have established the pecking order first. Miss, do you know who we are?"

"I don't know, but I think I can guess. I've never seen a decent person who delivers that kind of line."

Marsha raised her index finger.

"I agree. But I'll make an exception this time. If you're also people who live in the same world as us, that is."

"Hmph, that kind of talk is..."

Just as Justin was about to step forward, Shirone, who had finished bathing outdoors, opened the back door and entered.

"Huh? Marsha unnie. When did you arrive?"

Marsha narrowed her eyes as she watched Shirone vigorously toweling her hair.

"Hmm."

The Shirone from Undercoder was merely a copy of information, so this was the first time seeing her in four years since they parted in Galliant.

'She's grown a lot.'

The innocent impression of a seventeen-year-old remained, but she had been sharpened much more keenly in temperament.

Shirone hung the towel on a chair and ran over to grab Marsha's hands.

"It's really been so long."

Marsha tucked Shirone's neck under her arm.

"You! You must have summoned me through some strange method! What on earth is it? I couldn't even send a reply when I tried to refuse!"

"Uwaaah! There were circumstances!"

Marsha, who had grabbed Shirone's neck like hooking a fish, looked back at Freeman and laughed heartily.

"Circumstances? This one's talking all kinds of nonsense now that she's grown up."

The Justin Mercenary Group, who had been watching the commotion, seemed to come to their senses and narrowed their eyes.

"Don't tell me, the Parrot Mercenary Group?"

Marsha spoke to Justin.

"That's right. I came because someone said they were dying to see me, so who is it?"

"I was the one who wanted to meet. I have a favor to ask."

While Shirone grudgingly explained the whole story, Justin studied Marsha intently.

'This woman is...'

The Holy Mother of all the forsaken.

'What a nasty personality.'

Whatever her relationship with Shirone, her boldness in wielding the Five Great Stars like a thug wouldn't discriminate against anyone.

"Hoho, so that's how it is..."

When Marsha approached the table after hearing the explanation, everyone sitting there made room for her.

Sitting alone in the chair, Marsha took out a cigarette, put it in her mouth, then gestured to Shirone with her hand.

"Light."

There was debt from Undercoder, and since she was the one asking for a favor, she couldn't refuse.

'This unnie really never changes.'

Marsha lit her cigarette with Yahweh's flame, held it between her fingers, and exhaled smoke in a long stream.

"Fine. Justin Guild, I accept. Whether it's Harvitz or whatever, once we become family, we go all the way."

"Thank you, hehe."

Even Marsha couldn't help but chuckle at the cheekiness she hadn't seen before.

'This kid's an adult now too.'

Still, she was like a little sister to her.

"But we have conditions too. It's nothing major, but it seems like going through you would be faster."

"What is it?"

Marsha's expression became serious for the first time.

"Do you know anything about Fermi?"

It wasn't strange that Marsha knew about him since they had fought together in Undercoder.

"No. I only heard that he left after the graduation exam. I don't know what happened after that..."

"Do you know what that guy's nickname is in this business?"

Marsha held up her cigarette.

"The Crimson Drug King."

Shirone's mouth fell open in shock.

"The central continent is already taken, and it's spreading to the southern continent. The weaker the addiction, the higher the price. Surprisingly, this works. Even ordinary people get their hands on it. He's targeting people's fear of demons."

"But why drugs? If he needed money, he could have made plenty through depreciation deals..."

"You fool, you don't know this business, so you don't understand - it's not at that level. The contract money he made with the Empress of Kashan has already been exceeded and then some."

Even so, it was incomprehensible.

'Has he broken down?'

Did he lose both his beliefs as a mage and Yorga's will due to the shock of the graduation exam?

"How did you find out, unnie?"

"As Parrot's influence grew, all sorts of people joined. It seems a few of them got their hands on drugs. As you know, our mercenary group absolutely prohibits drugs."

When Marsha gestured, a dark-skinned man with broad shoulders approached.

It was Sake (Mouse, Tiger), the 3rd Squad Leader of the Parrot Mercenary Group.

"Nice to meet you. I'm called Sake."

After briefly introducing himself, he rolled up his sleeve to show the hieroglyph meaning 'mouse' tattooed on his left arm.

"I'm a warrior of the MunÊóè. Chosen warriors can tattoo two of twelve animals on their bodies."

It was a kind of shamanism.

"Specifically, one from six combat types and one from six support types. Mouse can activate Tunnel Site. It can bend the directionality of light."

Shirone thought it was incredible.

"For example, I can see inside this ceiling. It's not X-ray vision. I follow the cracks in that floor, go up through the drainage, and see through the ventilation system. Anyway, I carefully monitored suspicious subordinates this way. And I found the coins used by those dealing drugs. They look like this."

As soon as Sake took out the coin, Shirone recognized it.

"Gold Ring..."

He flicked the coin and caught it mid-air.

"You know it after all. It took a whole month just to find where this emblem was used. It's the symbol Fermi used at the magic school in Tormia, his alma mater."

It would be Fermi.

'It's not someone impersonating him. Only that guy could expand drug routes at this speed.'

Shirone clenched both fists.

"Fermi, you really..."

No matter how money-minded he was, she never thought he'd do business using drugs that lead people to ruin.

Marsha said.

"So our condition is this. Currently, neither the drug manufacturing factory nor Fermi's location has been identified. If you meet Fermi, arrange a meeting for me."

"What do you plan to do when you meet him?"

"Persuade him, or partner with him if he wants. Of course, not in the drug trafficking way... but Fermi is outstanding."

That was her impression from Undercoder.

"I understand."

Since Hexagon could exist because of Yorga, Shirone felt she needed to meet Fermi at least once.

"Then is it settled? Justin Mercenary Group, pack up. I have work I want to assign anyway."

Shirone stopped Marsha.

"Before that, there's unfinished business in Arachne. Let's finish that and then depart."

Although they had achieved their original goal of Beta Fish, they couldn't leave in the middle of the World Beauty Contest.

"Unfinished business? What business?"

Shirone sighed.

"Well..."

When Shirone arrived at the venue, there seemed to be more security guards than spectators around.

With the terrorist incident, the box office was essentially ruined, but they needed to complete the competition to hope for next year.

'That person came today too.'

The man she saw at the parade was doing volunteer work again today, handing out flyers.

"Barho Rangi representing Arachne! Please show your support! Rangi for champion!"

However, the slogan had changed.

'This isn't the time to worry about others.'

Early in the morning, the contestants had moved from the bunker to the competition venue, and their safety was now Shirone's responsibility.

'I have no talent for consoling people.'

She took a deep breath at the door and knocked, but there wasn't even a response to come in.

"Um, it's Shirone."

When there was still no response, she turned the doorknob and the door opened by itself, creating a gap.

"I'm coming in."

As Shirone peeked her face through first, numerous women were waiting in front of her.

"Surprise!"

Paper confetti exploded as paper scraps fluttered down onto Shirone's head.

"Were you surprised? This is the welcome party we prepared! Come in quickly!"

Miss Oldhill, with snow-white skin, grabbed Shirone and pulled her in, showing her teeth.

All the contestants were gathered, and some women were only wearing underwear.

"Uh, well..."

Pony, who made eye contact, sighed.

"Sorry. It's because of me. Yesterday when I was talking with Rangi, your story came up..."

Rangi approached with an apologetic expression.

"I guess we feel more at ease with you here. I spoke honestly."

"That's fine. Nothing's more important than safety. But this kind of thing is a bit..."

An official's voice was heard.

"20 minutes until the competition."

As soon as the words ended, several contestants began taking off their underwear and changing into swimsuits.

"Uwaaah!"

As Shirone, terrified by the enormous shock, hastily turned around, the women burst into laughter.

"Shirone is so innocent. You can be comfortable. This is our job, and there are many male designers too."

It wasn't only mages who didn't look at panties.

"Of course, not just anyone can enter. But Shirone isn't lecherous..."

Rangi turned around shyly and prepared to change clothes.

"I'm not okay with it! Hey! You get out quickly!"

Just as Pony, her face red as a persimmon, was pushing Shirone's back, it happened.

'Killing intent?'

When she hastily turned around, the energy disappeared like a lie.

"Hey, hey! How can you just turn around like that!"

'Pony didn't sense it?'

It was hostility directed only at Shirone, and the women who didn't understand just giggled and laughed.

"Hohoho! How is it? Now that you've actually seen, it's nothing special, right? Still, since you got a good look, you have to protect us until the competition ends, right?"

It was definitely not nothing special, but only one thought came to Shirone's mind.

"Ah..."

At Shirone's groan, Pony shouted even louder.

"Get out!"

Why hadn't she thought of it?

'I didn't confirm the terrorist's face. And if her Irregular is stealing parts of the body...'

That means she could also swap with her own face.

'Wouldn't there be traces left?'

She carefully examined the women's necklines, but couldn't find any sense of wrongness.

'Even mental changes...'

If only the face's appearance was swapped, the brain would be the terrorist's, but since she didn't know the contestants' personalities, confirmation was impossible.

'The killing intent was probably a mistake.'

If the terrorist was here, the danger would increase rapidly the farther Shirone got.

"Don't worry, Pony."

Shirone said seriously.

"Just because you see with your eyes doesn't mean you truly see."

The contestants turned their heads to Shirone, and Pony trembled with a blank expression.

"...What kind of crazy talk is that?"

Grabbing Shirone's ear, she personally opened the door and dragged her outside.

"Get out, you pervert! Get out quickly...!"

"Wait a moment."

As Shirone pulled her wrist and closed the door simultaneously, she whispered in her ear.

"Wasn't there any contestant who became a bit strange since this morning?"
