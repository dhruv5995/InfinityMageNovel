The Sun That Rose at Night (2)

Wanting to die would be anger, but not wanting to live would be closer to emptiness.

Shirone found himself thinking this as he watched the procession of people who had regained their minds.

'Which would be sadder?'

"Aaahhh! Why is this happening to me? Give it back! Give everything back!"

Those who had just said they wanted to live were now consumed by rage.

What exactly are humans?

"I don't know."

Untara said.

'Are there really people who truly want to live? Are we living, or are we being lived?'

"Yahweh, humans are obstacles. No matter how much you fill them up, it's like pouring water into a bottomless jar. They don't care about others' sacrifices. Because fundamentally, that's what they desire."

"I'm human too."

Otherwise, it would be nothing more than a signal.

"Of course you're human. A sacrificing human. That's what I'm trying to say. Are you really okay with this? If no one cleans up the trash, it'll eventually become a garbage dump... but wouldn't that be enough? We also have the option to let everything go to ruin."

Shirone knew it too.

What would return after this enormous sacrifice would be expectations for even more, and the disappointment and blame that comes from that, and perhaps even higher expectations.

"I have someone I love." 

Because once he finished all the homework given to him, he might be able to smile at least once.

"That's enough."

The same human.

'Let me think I'm fighting for myself.'

It wasn't pain and a role that could be endured with the thought of accomplishing something great.

Untara looked back at the people.

Those who had experienced countless futures in the wave of Yin, and ultimately felt the futility of life.

'Can they be restored?'

Even if they say they want to live, they would want to die.

Could they really embrace the anger of life again and give their hearts to reality?

"They can."

Shirone had no doubt.

"They'll live again. Even if they're being lived, they'll find it again."

Something to love.

"Let's establish a defensive barrier toward Delta first. When the thin ice burns completely, the other world and reality will merge into one. It'll be the full-scale collision of good and evil. And most importantly..."

An explosion erupted where Shirone turned to look.

"Ymir."

An indescribably massive monster was growing in size above the buildings.

Untara asked with a dazed expression.

"Ymir... you said?"

Rather than describing its form, it was a terrible feeling that brought despair the moment you saw it.

"Yahweh, tell me. Is that thing good or evil?"

"I wonder."

Shirone couldn't define it.

But perhaps that feeling... might be something closest to pure existence.

5 minutes ago.

Ymir wailed.

"Graaahhh!"

The tears shed by the king of giants felt different from those of other creatures from the very beginning.

To the point where not even a trace of sympathy arose, his temperament was turning violent.

"More..."

Ymir bent his upper body.

"Moooore!"

The two who collided again had their vision flash with each blow they received.

"Krrgh!"

Ryan also began to surrender his body to instinct in his semi-forcibly clouded consciousness.

"Aaahhh!"

As the great sword struck his side, Ymir simultaneously threw his fist.

"Huu!"

Ymir endured, and Ryan also turned his head back with the power of divine transcendence.

His face was...

"Krrgh!"

A demon incarnate.

Ymir felt both eerie thrill and pleasure simultaneously.

"Kekeke."

Enlightenment?

"What bullshit."

We're just fighting, that's all.

'Victory? What can you possibly gain by beating someone? Wealth? Power? Honor?'

For such trivial things...

"There's no need to become this strong, you idiot!"

The moment his fist crashed into the great sword, a shockwave spread in all directions with a clang.

"Kyaaahhh!"

As Ymir's consecutive attacks landed, Ryan began to be pushed back for the first time since the battle started.

'He's strong.'

In his confused mental state, the image of Ymir that came to mind was nothing but strength.

And from somewhere deep within himself that he didn't even know:

'It's okay.'

The voice of Yaksha, which might sound murky, was rising like a hallucination.

'I'm stronger.'

Divine Transcendence

Asura Balvalta.

The remnants of Asura that were being destroyed by Ymir's punches split into even greater numbers.

"Hehehe."

It was quite frightening.

And the next moment, tremendous consecutive strikes that blew away even fear came rushing in.

Ymir's vision went dark.

'Fun.'

What they had honed for this moment alone. What remained for them was supreme respect for an opponent who had reached the same level...

'I'm stronger.'

And nothing but the base biological desire to ruthlessly crush that great opponent.

'We're the same.'

Nothing but mere beasts.

Ymir thought this feeling he was experiencing now might be what others had spoken of.

Orgasm.

"Uhhhhh?"

Every time Ryan's great sword pounded his body from all directions, something condensed.

"Uhh... uhhhhhhh!"

Something was boiling up from the very bottom, foretelling a definite explosion soon.

'Divine Transcendence!'

Ryan spun and struck Ymir's bent right forearm with his great sword.

Crack, crrrack.

The sword that broke his arm bone sent Ymir flying while crushing even half his torso.

And Ymir...

"Graaahhh!"

For the second time, he burst out with a cry of ecstasy as he flew hundreds of meters and crashed into the ground.

Tess, who had been watching from afar, shouted.

"That's it! Ryan won!"

It should have been tremendous good news for humanity, but no one present opened their mouth.

Because they too were swordsmen.

"Is it really..."

Feeling the disbelieving gazes around him, Rye looked at Ryan.

'How does it feel?'

To be the best at something.

Klump said.

"Rye, everyone has their own life. Don't make yourself unhappy."

"Unhappy?"

Well, if anyone could become a great swordsman, then that wouldn't be a great swordsman either.

"Why, grandfather."

Rye asked.

"Why can't I even dream? Why was it Ryan and not me?"

Luck, effort, talent, limits?

"Well."

Since Rye was also precious blood, Klump carefully chose his words.

But no matter how much he thought, the remaining conclusion was...

"Love."

Rye turned around, bewildered.

"What?"

"You don't like swords."

"More precisely, you don't like fighting. Of course, there were many enjoyable moments, but now you're a bit gloomy. Why? Because you felt your limits? Because training is hard? Because luck didn't follow you? No."

Klump said.

"You're a little... tired of swords."

That's all.

"You've grown weary. Of your current position, of your current honor and people's attention... That's because you craved position, honor, and people's attention. The sword itself wasn't the purpose, but a means to achieve something of yours."

Klump pointed at Ryan.

"Look at that guy."

Even while breathing roughly, he wasn't taking his eyes off where Ymir had crashed.

"Talent? Effort?"

Klump raised the corner of his mouth.

"He looks like he's going crazy because fighting is so fun."

That is Yaksha.

Having heard Klump's words to the end, Rye turned his head with feelings still unsettled.

"Huh?"

And at that moment, ominous heat haze began rising from where Ymir had crashed.

"Graaaaaahhh!"

Ymir's roar flew through the air and pierced their eardrums sharply.

"Kugh!"

It was a kilometer away.

But the visual shock was even stronger, enough to forget even the pain in their ears.

"Wh-what is that?"

Ymir's body was rapidly undergoing cell proliferation, transforming into a bizarre form.

It certainly should have had some color, but it just looked black as if it were sucking in even light.

"...Is it the apocalypse."

That kind of feeling.

Ymir, growing endlessly, looked down at Ryan while trembling at this new境地.

'Thank you.'

The limit he had crossed for the first time in his life made him understand why humans train.

'That you can become stronger.'

Ymir, having finally found complete life, stopped his gigantification near the skyline.

"Huuuuuu!"

The next moment, his body rapidly condensed following the form of Idea.

"Here I cooome!"

The only part that didn't shrink, his right arm, came crashing down toward Ryan on the ground.

"Krrgh!"

Within the giant shadow cast on the ground, Ryan also raised his sword in the form of a demon.

Their gazes collided.

'Buddha of the Battlefield.'

Ymir acknowledged Ryan.

'Enlightenment reached after experiencing all battles. Yes, that would truly be wonderful.'

But.

'Has Ymir experienced this too?'

Because Ymir's strength, having transcended limits, would be unprecedented even for the Buddha of the Battlefield.

"I win."

Kuuuuuuuung!

The moment the giant fist struck down at Ryan, the ground rippled and split apart.

Rumble rumble rumble! Rumble rumble rumble!

As an earthquake struck Zybe city, citizens ran out carrying their belongings.

"Aaahhh! Someone save us!"

But they couldn't move more than a few meters and froze in place.

Thud. Thud.

Mountain-sized giants were entering the city, crossing human barriers.

"Huh?"

The moment someone was about to voice their impression.

Thud.

With one step, dozens of humans were crushed like ants, and screams erupted.

"Aaahhh! Save me!"

Under the giant's leg, Gir-shin, who was at least human-sized, thrust out his sword.

"Sweep them all away."

The contract Ymir made with Ruber was their share, and the giant instantly destroyed the city.

"Kgh!"

While stepping on people, they also pulled out buildings like toys and threw them at the crowds.

"Hiik!"

When people saw an entire house flying at them and froze in place.

'Hand of God.'

A hand made of light caught the building and threw it back at the giant.

Thud.

The giant who took a direct hit to the forehead frowned and finally looked down at the ground.

Shirone stood with the Southern Warriors.

"It's Yahweh!"

When a citizen who recognized his face shouted, everyone rushed to Shirone without exception.

"Get back! I was first!"

He understood their feelings, but in this situation, he couldn't properly protect the citizens.

"Stay back!"

The Southern Warriors shouted.

"Back away slowly! Being here won't save you! You need to run!"

"Shut up! Who are you?"

How could they run from giants that took dozens of meters with each step?

Most importantly, even in this chaos, Shirone was deflecting all the giants' projectiles.

"Yahweh."

Gir-shin's face crumpled.

Ymir said it wasn't fun, but amusement wasn't important to Gir-shin.

"I'll kill you."

As the only 7th-level giant began to gigantify, his body started growing endlessly.

The voices of the fighting citizens simultaneously quieted.

What they saw was a creature that had grown to a level beyond imagination.

Whooooooo!

In the surreal situation where just slowly moving his legs created a storm.

"Master Five Stars!"

A familiar voice was heard.

"Hm?"

Shirone hurriedly looked back but saw nothing but scenery.

"Here! Over here!"

When Shirone looked down again, his face lit up.

"Mini!"

Mini, small as a squirrel, was running over while waving one hand vigorously.

And the next moment, as she passed Shirone, her body began to grow.

"I'll handle this."

Ivory Tower 2nd-level resident Twelve Mini.

Nickname: Super Giant.
