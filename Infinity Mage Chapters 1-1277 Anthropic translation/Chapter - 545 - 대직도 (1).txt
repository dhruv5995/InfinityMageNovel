[545] Daejikdo (1)

Returning to the northwestern settlement, Shirone called for Priest Bebeto.

Since returning from the forbidden sanctuary, Shirone seemed to be in a foul mood, so Yo was carefully observing the situation while assisting from the side.

As the code intertwined with the temple, Bebeto appeared.

"Consul, did you call for me?"

"Prepare to leave the settlement."

At these words spoken without any context, both Bebeto and Yo looked at Shirone with surprised expressions.

"You're leaving the settlement? Then where are you going?"

"I'm not going anywhere."

Shirone spoke with conviction.

"I will change this world. I'll create a world where everyone lives together in harmony, without war or food shortages."

Bebeto wore a troubled expression.

When Shirone had proposed alliances with other settlements, he had thought it reasonable, but this statement was not something a sane person could think.

"What on earth happened?"

Bebeto asked Yo, but it was Shirone who answered.

"It's not yet time to speak of it. When those who left to propose alliances gather..."

"The Guardian has arrived!"

Before Shirone could finish speaking, the gatekeeper shouted.

As Shirone rose from his seat and headed toward the entrance, the door burst open and a group of people including the Guardian entered.

"What?"

While Shirone stared in bewilderment, Exer, who had entered flapping his bat wings, prostrated himself.

"Consul, as you instructed, we have formed alliances with the eastern and southern settlements. These are the guardians from each settlement."

This was what Shirone had wanted, but no matter how he thought about it, it was too fast and easy.

Since they were people who extremely disliked having two suns in one settlement, they would surely be wary even of alliance proposals.

"How did this happen?"

At the question filled with many doubts, Exer finally showed a troubled expression.

"Actually..."

"It's my work."

Sura, wearing a green dress, appeared, parting through the guardians.

"I've already eliminated the consuls of the eastern and southern settlements. In other words, you are the only sun in this world, Shirone."

Shirone unconsciously took a step back.

'Can no one else sense it?'

The serpentine aura emanating from the woman.

Though it wasn't visible to the eye, he could see a giant snake coiled and flicking its tongue.

It must be a specific frequency between Banyas.

"Who are you?"

"I am Sura. The person who will make you a god at Ra's request."

"Ra's request?"

"It seems there will be interference. You know about it too, don't you?"

Shirone thought of Miro's group.

"Are you going to harm them?"

"No, quite the opposite. They're coming to harm us. I'll do my best to prevent that."

Having reached the realm of Banya through Microcosm, Shirone belatedly realized how powerful a human Miro was.

If she set her mind to it, it would be all too easy for her to undo this entire affair.

'But... Miro said it was for my sake.'

Shirone, sitting powerlessly on the throne, asked.

"Perhaps this world might be false. What do you think about that?"

Sura, wearing a gentle smile, had somehow approached Shirone's side and bent her waist.

Poking Shirone's crown with her snake-like slender fingers, she whispered in his ear.

"There's no such thing as truth in this world, Shirone. Only what you believe is the truth."

"..."

Shirone remained lost in thought for a long while before raising his head.

"Then, what do you plan to do now?"

"We must perform the ritual to become the sun god."

As Sura placed her hand on Shirone's shoulder and looked around at the guardians, their shoulders flinched.

When she had first come with the title of Ra's wife, Shirone's mother, they had thought she was a mad woman.

But after witnessing Sura's abilities with their own eyes, no doubt was possible.

"Shall we move locations first?"

As Sura slowly closed her eyes, the surrounding scenery began to dissolve into code.

Bebeto, who was also a coder, trembled violently.

'The divine language itself.'

Sura was truly a god of this world.

"Where is this?"

All the guardians from the three settlements looked around in confusion.

Suddenly the scenery had changed and they found themselves in the middle of a desert outside the city.

"Hehe, do you like it, Shirone? This is the place where you'll become a god."

"Why did you choose this place?"

"Even I can't fully protect you against Miro. Above all, spectacular is better, isn't it?"

"What's spectacular about a desert..."

Shirone stopped speaking and stared blankly at the sky.

As Sura raised both arms and muttered toward the sun, rectangular stones weighing dozens of tons endlessly fell from the cloud-like tangled code.

Faced with work that would take years even if all the settlement residents rushed to help being completed in an instant, the children of the sun came to believe in the existence of god as reality.

Even Shirone couldn't help but feel fear before the massive pyramid reaching hundreds of meters in height.

'Who exactly is this woman?'

Sura pointed at the pyramid and said.

"This structure will protect you from interferers. All my abilities are concentrated in it."

To create a barrier powerful enough to block Miro's avatar, it needed to be at least this scale.

Also, though she didn't mention it, it was also a device for analyzing the code generated from tomorrow's union between Shirone and Ra.

"So that's why the desert? But you won't be able to unite with Ra here."

"We'll have to accept that it takes time. Ra will pull all the city's mucus here. It should arrive by noon tomorrow at the latest."

"I see."

Shirone looked up at the pyramid's peak.

'Tomorrow, from that place...'

He would save the ruined world.

'I'm somehow uneasy.'

Sura bit her nails, lost in thought.

It wouldn't end just by blocking Miro - Miro's companions would also deploy interference tactics in some way.

'Can't be helped. I hate borrowing help, but...'

Sura, who had been looking up at the sky, suddenly frowned and looked somewhere.

"What the hell is that monkey doing?"

"Yahoo! It's a hunt, a hunt!"

The underground combat unit that had given up entering the forbidden sanctuary discovered another human and cheered.

"Looks very delicious!"

Baknyo looked straight ahead, taking in the motorcycle unit passing through her field of vision.

Behind the encirclement, Taejang sat in a jeep with his arms crossed, wearing a fierce expression.

The motorcycle unit that braked in front of Baknyo all aimed their guns at her simultaneously.

"I'm too hungry to listen to last words."

Baknyo analyzed the emotions seeping into her chest.

'Hunger. Mockery. Death. Final opinion.'

The moment Baknyo's thoughts ended, thunderous gunshots erupted from the gun barrels with flashing flames.

Then their gun barrels trembled and pointed toward the sky.

"..."

Taejang stared blankly at the scene of his subordinates, their necks severed, convulsing while shooting rifles at the sky.

Shortly after, the motorcycles toppled left and right, and Baknyo climbed onto the jeep's hood.

"Not bad. What are you?"

'Recognition of me. Questions about the subject. Desire to understand.'

She was asking who someone was.

Though she had never learned the underground people's language, the meaning contained in Taejang's words was being transmitted through her entire body.

Baknyo.

Asura Yaksha, 11,200 years old.

Unlike most immortals who pursued something beyond human, her mind had instead delved into more animalistic realms.

After thousands of years passed this way, she could no longer find the boundary line between what constituted herself and nature.

The sixth sense developed in that process went beyond sensitive to what could be called 'monstrous perception' - a realm where she could predict instantaneous phenomena that logic couldn't penetrate with nearly 100 percent accuracy.

"I am your king."

At Baknyo's words, Taejang's expression crumpled.

He too possessed wild genes, making him extremely sensitive to signals that pressed down on him.

"How dare you disrespect me!"

As Taejang sprang up like a spring, Baknyo created distance.

As the positioned underground people opened crossfire, she landed on the ground, lowered her stance, and wrinkled her nose bridge.

"Grrrr!"

Axing

Nirvana E

Engine (Nirvana Power 8-cylinder).

With a bang, her body swept in all directions.

As if a blade wind was passing through, each time afterimages flickered, the underground people's bodies were sliced apart, and Taejang roared like a monkey while lifting the jeep high.

"Eat this!"

It was tremendous brute strength, but to Baknyo, the jeep's movement appeared slower as time passed.

'Cut.'

Her Axing Nirvana E-Engine pushes the cylinders of law with the power of nirvana.

Up to 8 cylinders can be arranged, with one action mounted per cylinder.

Inline 8-cylinder, 8-process 1-cycle mechanism.

The more the Nirvana E-Engine accelerates, the stronger the nirvana power becomes, the faster the cycle, with no limits.

'Accelerate!'

Baknyo, who had accelerated the nirvana power, swung her sword toward the jeep falling above her head.

Having mounted 8-directional cuts on 8 laws, her cycle had currently surpassed 80 rotations, fast enough to appear blurry even to Taejang's eyes with their remarkable dynamic vision.

The steel car body split like stars, then countless cuts followed.

When Baknyo passed through the jeep, the vehicle had already been shattered into thousands of fragments rolling on the ground as if disassembled into parts.

"Hoooooo!"

Her appearance with clothes fluttering from the heat rising from her body was the complete form of a yaksha.

"Ah..."

Taejang looked at Baknyo with eyes of shock.

Though language didn't communicate, wild physiology transmitted one emotion to his genes.

"Uooooo! Uooooo!"

A king!

The king who would rule this city's jungle had appeared!

Taejang, who had let out a roar, walked over with large strides and bowed his massive frame before Baknyo.

"My king, please rule over me."

Knowing that strength was everything in the wild, Baknyo naturally became their leader and gave instructions.

"Take me to the one who was your king."

Taejang still couldn't understand the words, but instinct reminded him where he needed to go.

As the sun set, Miro's group finally discovered the location where Sura would carry out her plan.

While Inspector Lian guarded the ground, the remaining three mages rose into the sky and looked at the massive pyramid standing in the desert.

"It's a structure not on the map. That must be the place."

"Right. Really fast."

"Are we too late?"

"There's plenty of time. It'll take at least until noon tomorrow for the mucus to reach there."

All the city's mucus was slowly extending toward the desert.

Though thousands of times faster than the average expansion speed, the distance was still far.

As it grew dark, Miro's eyes, gazing into the distance, emitted light.

It was telescope magic that refracted light to see greater distances.

"Hmm..."

The bluish hemispherical barrier surrounding the pyramid was certainly a law-based defensive barrier.

"Can't we just smash it?"

"Even with aunt's skills?"

Though Fermi had tried a subtle provocation, Miro surprisingly readily admitted it.

"If this were reality, maybe, but here..."

"Isn't there another way?"

"We have no choice but to infiltrate directly. Since it's a barrier that blocks laws applied from outside, it becomes useless once we get inside."

"What if there's defensive power inside too? For example, disrupting magic with anti-magic."

This time even Miro couldn't hold back.

"Are you joking right now? That's a barrier meant to stop me. No human would think to worry about that much when facing me."

"I see."

If it wasn't solid enough to block Miro's full-power attack, there would be no reason to install a barrier in the first place.

It was something only possible for someone like Sura, who was among humanity's strongest law users.

"Anyway, it's troublesome. It seems they've integrated the settlements too. Can we break through the mutants and get there?"

"Wait. Something's appeared."

Hundreds of headlights surged from across the desert.

The sight of underground people crossing the desert with their various means of transportation entered Miro's view.

"Underground people have joined in addition to the settlements."

Marsha said.

"To remove the barrier, we need to infiltrate inside. Those blocking us are executives of the Ten Commandments, guardians of the children of the sun, underground people, and mucus. Can you do it?"

Miro shook her head.

"No. The power of Banya is offset by the power of Banya. As long as Sura is active, leaving it to me isn't a good choice."

"Then what will you do? There's no way, is there?"

"Is that really so?"

Miro smiled as she looked down at the ground.

"We have a yaksha, don't we."

Everyone's gaze turned to Lian.

Unable to fly, he was sitting on the ground, leaning his tired body against his sword.

"Ah, I'm hungry."
