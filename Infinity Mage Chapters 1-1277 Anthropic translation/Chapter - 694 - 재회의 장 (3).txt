[694] Chapter of Reunion (3)

While admiring the beautiful winter garden scenery, Madeleine came running frantically from the direction of the royal castle.

"Lord Iruki! Lord Iruki!"

For a regular-level researcher of the Thunder Corps to miss a meeting was not just a work issue but a matter of attitude, and Shirone was worried about Iruki.

"Are you okay? You're not getting disciplined because of me, are you?"

"I'm fine. I just made an impression on someone a little while ago. Besides, this isn't school. If they don't use high-level talent like me, it's only their loss."

His confidence remained unchanged.

"What are you doing here right now? The Thunder Corps is in complete uproar!"

Iruki turned around and said.

"I'll attend now. It's not over yet, right?"

"No, it's not about the meeting!"

"Huh?"

Madeleine raised her rabbit-like eyes and shouted.

"Lord Albino ordered me to bring you back immediately and was furious! I've never seen him so angry in my entire life."

A shadow fell across Iruki's face.

"Sorry, but I should get going now."

"No, I'm the one who's sorry."

"Don't worry. If it's my father, there won't be any disciplinary action. Damn, I was hoping to rest comfortably for a few days with this opportunity."

Shirone's eyes narrowed.

This was Iruki, who would deliberately cause trouble at school to get suspended when classes were boring.

"Don't tell me you did this on purpose..."

Iruki cut him off and turned to look at Rian.

"It was nice meeting you. Please take good care of Shirone."

"Yeah. Let's have drinks next time."

Kido said.

"Take care, brother."

The fact that he was joking meant he had recognized Iruki's true nature, which made Shirone smile.

'I knew you'd like him.'

"Shirone, make sure you pass. I'll be keeping an ear out for good news."

Despite his relaxed smile, Iruki turned around and ran toward the royal castle as if his pants were on fire.

Shirone turned to Rian and Kido and said.

"Well, let's get going too. There's still a chance for a comeback. From now on, we'll be fast too."

Kido asked.

"You said you had something in mind?"

"Yeah. I'm thinking of going to Kashan."

"Kashan? That's the Empire, isn't it?"

Since the taste of memory didn't convey all memories, Kido didn't know about the relationship between Shirone and Kashan.

Rian said.

"You're planning to meet Theraze?"

"She's someone I'd prefer not to owe a debt to, but..."

Uorin was not someone to be taken lightly.

"Since the situation has come to this, I think I have no choice but to play that card. If it's Uorin, she should know about La Enemie."

"So our next destination is Kashan. Let me see..."

Rian unfolded a simple map.

"The routes out of Bashka are through the Kingdom of Kazra and the Kingdom of Akros. But since Kazra has closed its borders..."

They had no choice but to go through Akros, which ran parallel to Tormia along the coastline.

"Then we'd arrive at Kashan via Akros, Merhen, and Zaive. But is this map scale accurate? The distance from Kashan's border to the capital seems farther than crossing three kingdoms."

Kashan was the empire with the largest territory in the world.

"Will that be okay? Even traveling non-stop by carriage would take two months."

"No. We won't take the Akros route. Let's go to Kazra. We'll jump directly from there to Kashan."

"Hmm, that's one way."

Uorin was the daughter born between Kazra's King Orcamp and Theraze Mistra.

Although they had severed diplomatic relations with other countries after the paternity confirmation incident, that itself was proof that Kazra was under Kashan's rule.

"Kazra should have a direct channel established for spatial movement with Kashan. If we use that, we can save time."

"But approval won't come through. If illegal entry is detected, it could lead to international conflict."

"Orcamp will want to meet me."

Shirone's eyes filled with sadness.

"Because the queen's son died in my place."

Gefin had used Kazra's prince to eliminate the cause of Hexa.

"I see."

"Saving time is one thing, but I think I need to tell him that his son has died."

He would be tasting despair daily while hoping his child might still be alive.

"You were planning to visit Kazra from the beginning."

While he spoke of efficiency, the latter reason was probably greater.

'Is that why he's third place?'

Rian realized why Shirone had only received one vote in the Ivory Tower election.

Tsuoi hadn't revealed it, but she probably evaluated Shirone's karma like this:

Massive, but too slow.

'Because he tries to embrace everything.'

But it was precisely because Shirone was like this that Rian had decided to entrust his entire life to him.

'Whoever gave that one vote won't regret it.'

Having made his decision, Rian said.

"Alright, let's go to Kazra!"

Kido raised his hand.

"That's all well and good, but how are we going to get to Kazra? You said the borders are closed."

"Huh?"

Rian blinked.

"You want to go to Kazra?"

Aria, sitting at a desk in the royal castle's diplomatic department, asked back.

"Yes. The borders are closed, but I think there should be diplomatic secret channels."

"Hmm."

While it was true she had favorable feelings toward Shirone, there was no room for emotions when it came to work.

"Do you absolutely have to go through Kazra? If you're going to Kashan, I can send a cooperation letter to the nearest country."

"That would still be slow. If we can't jump directly to Kashan's capital, it would eat up time just the same."

And currently, the only way to reach Kashan's capital was through Kazra.

"If there were a channel connected to Kazra..."

Aria took off her glasses and placed them on the desk.

"I would have lied and said there wasn't one. That's my job. But the reason I don't need to lie is because there really isn't one. The channel has been completely cut off."

It was the most sincere answer a diplomat could give.

"Is there really no way?"

"There are three main ways to get to Kazra. First, cross the border. But the security will be ironclad. Second, use the Red Line's channel. Since Kazra is also a member of the Red Line, you can go through the Magic Association. However, in this case, all countries under the Red Line will be able to track your movements. Third and finally, go through the demilitarized zone designated by inter-kingdom agreements. Usually, there are secret meeting places between countries that aren't publicly disclosed. You probably came to me because of the third method, but currently even that is blocked."

"Hmm."

Shirone stared intently at Aria.

While saying there was no way, she had told him all the methods, but it was a matter she couldn't bring herself to voice.

"The location of the secret meeting place is only known to high-ranking nobles, so naturally the security is also lax. That's not to say there isn't any, but it's easier to break through than other places. However, if caught, Tormia would have to pay enormous compensation."

"Hmmmm."

As Shirone's contemplative humming grew longer, Aria's gaze became sharper.

"The location of the magic circle leading to the secret meeting place is confidential, but..."

Aria took out a pen and wrote 8 numbers sporadically as if doodling.

Then she wrote new numbers in between to complete pi.

Shirone imprinted the initially written numbers in his mind.

'XY coordinates. Underground mountain range, behind Crета royal castle.'

Aria put down her pen and clasped her hands again.

"Anyway, it's completely closed now so no one goes near it. Even if you went, it wouldn't work without knowing the security codes."

Shirone could decode all the codes.

"I see. I'll have to give up on that method."

When Shirone smiled, Aria's expression also relaxed.

"Good thinking. It would be better to go through Akros."

"Yes, thank you."

"Don't mention it for something like this. Just don't pretend not to know me when you enter the Ivory Tower later."

There was no way she would reveal classified information without any compensation.

"Of course. I'll definitely visit you again."

Shirone immediately turned around, took a carriage out of the royal castle, and got off at the outskirts of the capital.

After confirming the carriage had left, Kido looked at Shirone.

"Do you know where it is?"

"Yeah. The coordinates are precise, so it should be easy to find."

Rian asked.

"What are you talking about? Weren't we going to Akros?"

"..."

Kido's eyes crossed like a chameleon's.

"No, we're going to take the spatial movement magic circle and jump to Kazra."

Shirone explained while climbing the underground mountain range, and only then did Rian understand the situation.

"I see. So we're becoming spies of sorts?"

"If we get caught, yes."

The coordinates Aria had specified were in a dense forest.

When they pushed through trees that seemed artificially transplanted, a secret passage leading underground was installed.

The reason they couldn't readily enter was that the stairs were covered in dust since no one had used them for over a year.

"It seems better not to step on them?"

Shirone agreed with Kido's opinion.

"Magic using air currents would inevitably leave traces. Let's use instant movement."

Shirone grabbed Kido and Rian and transformed into a flash of light, leaping over the stairs.

Shirone descended the narrow, complex passages without a single mistake and arrived at a spacious area on the third basement level.

A massive magic circle was drawn there, and alchemical devices to control the magic circle were installed on the walls.

The generator started up and complex circuits appeared.

"Can you do it?"

"Yeah. I'll try."

As he carefully penetrated the circuits, he could see code combinations rotating in spherical form.

'This is the firewall.'

When he dismantled it piece by piece through the Ultima System, a single starlight appeared at the point that passed through all circuits.

'This is the core code.'

The moment he activated it, a magnificent sound echoed through the great cavity, and light shot up in a cylindrical form from the magic circle drawn on the ground.

"It's done."

Though it worked, no one could predict what might be in the space connected to the magic circle.

"The security on Kazra's side might be tight. The situation is different from Tormia."

Keeping the worst-case scenario in mind, they moved forward as Kido and Rian followed.

"Well then..."

Before he could finish speaking, white light surged up and transported everyone to the other side of the magic circle.

"..."

Though it was just an instant, Rian cut off his words and looked around.

It was a dark underground area no different from Tormia's side, except that it was inside a cave rather than an artificial structure.

"There don't seem to be any guards nearby."

Kido looked around.

"This is really Kazra? Hard to believe."

"More precisely, it's probably the border region. It would be jointly owned by Tormia. As evidence, there's no device to control the magic circle. They probably gather here and go to the meeting place. Let's get out first."

The cave was a natural maze, with magical and physical traps installed throughout.

"...We seem to have come quite far."

Calculating the coordinates, even though they had never gotten lost, the cave had been continuing for an hour already.

"Shh, someone's there."

At Kido's words, they crouched and approached to find a huge space 10 meters below.

Twenty people in identical clothing were bowing to a man at an altar, pleading.

"Great god Theraposs, please guide our path through your divine oracle."

'Heretics...'

And it was the Theraposs cult, called an evil god.

"The god gives me an oracle."

The 60-year-old man standing at the altar raised both hands, then showed the whites of his eyes while trembling his eyelids.

"Karomarofa, erodaimer, udiraknaom."

'Is that an oracle? Shirone should be able to interpret it.'

As Rian turned his head, Shirone was frowning.

"What's wrong? Is it serious content?"

"That's not an oracle. He's just spouting nonsense."

"Nonsense?"

The man's words were being interpreted through the Ultima System.

"Ah, how boring. That newcomer looks decent. Tonight I'll go with that woman." He was thinking thoughts completely unrelated to oracles.

Even among heretics, this was a fraud.
