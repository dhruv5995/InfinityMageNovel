Even If It's a Misunderstanding (4)

Sadia, a central city of Tormia.

This place, which has the kingdom's largest plains, is home to Nade's family estate, the West.

Once on the verge of ruin, it has now established itself as the strongest power in the central region as Nade Industries, the company founded by Nade, experienced explosive growth due to wartime demands.

Of course, this reputation is merely the assessment of gossipmongers who envy the Nade family.

The company, which initially focused on the munitions industry, expanded its business scope in all directions while taking charge of the core of the atomic bomb project, and has now become the world's strongest industrial conglomerate, truly deserving the name "group."

3rd place in global corporate rankings, with corporate assets totaling 780 trillion gold.

This was the current position of the Nade Group.

"Chairman, we'll arrive at the main house in 10 minutes."

The coachman opened the window of the carriage, which boasted the finest facilities and security, and spoke.

"Got it."

Nade, the young chairman of the Nade Group, pulled up his coat collar and buried his neck in his shoulders.

Liz, sitting on the bed across from him, quickly reviewed a pile of documents and said:

"The corporate ranking went up one level. Congratulations."

"It's not something I achieved. It's a money feast created by war, by blood and lives, by the demons."

Nade added:

"It was fortunate that I was Iruki's friend."

Liz knew what Nade wanted to say, but she didn't show it.

It was a battle of patience.

"Right. While supplying the holy war became the driving force for growth, Iruki is also a military officer overseeing the war. The weapons you developed were adopted because they had the best performance. And... it's entirely your capability that brought the Nade Group this far."

Normally, praise from the woman he loved would make his shoulders rise with pride, but this time his intentions were transparent.

"I know what you want to say."

In the end, Nade gave up.

"But Liz, I have to go."

He had to rise to those high skies above the capital Bashka and drop the atomic bomb at the precise time.

"Sigh."

Liz, barely suppressing her maddening anger, let out a sigh and said:

"I just can't understand it. You've led the Nade Group well so far. Countless people lived thanks to the weapons you developed. Why do you try to do everything? What are you, some kind of hero?"

"It would be fortunate if I were a hero."

Liz clutched her chest in frustration.

"You fool, think carefully. You'll die. It's not even dying in battle, it's a suicidal act."

"I'll escape the moment the operation ends. Theoretically, survival is possible."

"What if something breaks down? The equipment isn't even guaranteed to be 100% stable yet, is it? What if a more serious situation than theory arises?"

When Nade chose silence instead of the word death, Liz's face turned tearful.

"Don't do it. If you just don't do this, I'll do anything you want. Yes, let's give away all our money. I'll give you all the money we have, so let's find someone to do it instead. There must be someone."

Nade's eyes turned cold.

"Liz, human lives can't be bought with money."

"Then what about your life!"

Liz's voice boomed through the perfectly soundproofed interior of the carriage.

"And what about me! Your family! The thousands of employees who work believing only in you! Their families! Why are you so selfish!"

Liz, who had swept the documents off the bed with her hand, strode toward Nade.

"No! I won't let you go! Find someone else! If you can't, I'll find them!"

"You know. The aircraft is perfectly personalized. No one but me can pilot it."

"No, it's possible. Do you think you're the only wizard in the world who can handle electricity?"

"Liz."

Nade frowned as she hit the mark, but Liz had no intention of backing down.

"I know why you're doing this. Shirone, Iruki, you. The troublemaker trio from Alpheas Magic School. Do you think you owe your friends a debt? Do you think you're the only one living comfortably? Or do they shine so brightly that you want to shine too?"

Nade said nothing.

"Snap out of it, you fool. You've become the best in your own way. Even without fighting like Shirone, even without controlling wars like Iruki, you're playing a big role."

"It doesn't matter if I don't shine."

It was sincere.

"It's been like that since school days. We three knew what we had to do. I was never meant for a shining role. The one who shines is Shirone. Iruki knows it too."

"Then why are you trying to shine now? Leave it to Shirone. Leave it to Iruki."

"Light."

Nade smiled faintly.

"After you graduated, I became the president of the Supernatural Psychic Research Society. The only members were Iruki and Shirone."

Those were enjoyable times.

"We three once gave a presentation about supernatural psychics..."

"I know. I've heard it over a hundred times."

Without showing embarrassment, Nade was absorbed in reminiscing about his school days.

"That night, when everyone was asleep, we three lay in the central park looking at the stars, the North Star."

Nade burst out laughing.

"We were really childish back then. Talking about eternal friendship and graduation and all that... But in that moment, I really felt like I had the whole world."

Wiping his lips with his hand as if cutting off the lingering feelings, Nade smiled sadly and said:

"Why was that? Because we successfully finished the presentation? Because I could see hope for my future?"

Liz listened silently.

"No. Because it was the three of us."

The corners of Nade's mouth trembled as he recalled the thrill of that time.

"I don't know why, but in that moment I thought it was a miracle that the three of us were together. But now that friend is struggling."

As a participant in the atomic bomb project, Liz also knew how heavy Iruki's burden was.

"If I entrust this work to someone else, it would put an even greater burden on Iruki. Why me? Because I want to do it. But the real reason I have to do it is..."

Nade's eyes reddened.

"Because Iruki wants it."

Liz couldn't say anything.

"That guy is smart but a fool, trying to carry everything by himself. He can't say anything. He won't even ask for help. But I know. That's my role. In this situation, I'm the only one who can lighten his burden."

If only he had asked me to do it.

"But you want me to turn away? Because Iruki didn't ask, to pretend not to know his pain? I'd rather die. Liz, I can't do that. I love you too much, I could give my life for you, but..."

Nade had already made up his mind.

"I have to go."

Liz's shoulders dropped helplessly.

"Sigh."

She returned to the bed, sat down weakly, and swallowed her tears while brushing back her hair.

The window opened and the coachman spoke:

"Chairman, we've arrived at the main house."

Since they had bought all the nearby mansions and renovated them, they had to travel quite a bit more even after arriving at the main house.

Liz, having calmed her mind, turned her head and pouted:

"I heard someone even got married because of this incident."

Only then did Nade regain his smile.

"Haha, that was an unavoidable situation. You're also included among the survival targets."

"Who's talking about that now?"

"I love you, Liz."

It was like poking someone's ribs to get a bow, but hearing it didn't feel bad.

"Hmph."

When they arrived at the main mansion of the estate, Nade's parents, Vollum and Teria, had come out to greet them.

"Son."

The scary mother who had always frightened Nade with her constantly twisted face was gone.

Even the seemingly endless fighting spirit and envy were merely human emotions before wealth that transcended common sense.

Nade tried not to think about it.

"Yes. I'm back."

Whether money had changed her, or she had regained her true nature in prosperous life, he didn't want to dig deep.

Vollum offered a handshake.

"It's been a while. Are you busy with work?"

"Yes. I need to go up right away, I have urgent business. But Liz will stay here for a few days."

The survival targets of this project had the condition of maintaining secrecy, and Liz was an excellent actress.

"Hello, Mother. I should have visited you earlier, I'm sorry. Let's go to many nice places while I'm here."

"Hoho, of course. I've made reservations at the finest restaurants. Let's go together, just the two of us."

It was fortunate that Teria liked Liz.

"Then I'll be going. Liz, take care."

After about 10 minutes of conversation, Nade said his farewells and turned back toward the carriage.

"Mother, just a moment."

Liz hurriedly followed Nade and turned him around.

"Wait. Your coat collar is wrinkled."

Although he knew it was an excuse, Nade let her do as she wished.

"I'm sorry."

Liz choked up but soon smiled.

"Promise me just one thing."

"Okay."

She dusted off his coat to smooth out the wrinkles, then grabbed his collar firmly with both hands and said:

"If you're going to do it anyway, finish it properly. Shine as brilliantly as possible. Don't waver pathetically like in school days. Got it?"

Surprised by the unexpected words, Nade nodded firmly with strength in his eyes.

"Thank you."

For letting me leave without regrets.

After sharing a brief kiss, flames blazed in Nade's eyes as he walked toward the carriage.

'I'm coming, Iruki.'

The atomic bomb's code name was Lucky Boy.

Galfin and Ikael were spending time hidden in the wilderness using Hexa's power.

"Why isn't it working?"

As Galfin lay sprawled on a mat, muttering, Ikael came back with foraged fruit.

"Still worrying about it?"

Her subordinate Maras - 3-angled, 2-angled, and 1-angled - came running from all directions and knelt.

"I'll carry it!"

Ikael blinked as she stared at the six hands extended toward her.

Ashur of Signals, Rete of Enhancement, Lamus of Lightning Strike.

It was somewhat pitiful to see those called Ikael's three great guardian deities rushing to carry a basket.

'I am truly fortunate.'

Even direct subordinates of angels couldn't ignore Ankera's authority, but they had chosen Ikael.

"It's fine. Since leaving the white mirror, there's nothing to do. This is probably all I can do."

Ashur bowed his head.

"Just your existence is a blessing, Ikael. Your beauty cannot be recreated by any probability."

"Oh my, Ashur really."

As Ikael covered her mouth and laughed, Galfin rolled onto his side and scratched his belly.

'Cunning bastard.'

While there might be a bit of jealousy toward Galfin in that statement, this level was rather cute.

Rete of Enhancement extended both hands.

"Give it to me. I'll multiply it to 100 million so that Ikael never has to do such rough work again."

Rete could increase the numerical values or quantities of specific objects.

"It's fine. Galfin will eat it anyway. Honey, today's lunch is fruit."

Galfin, sitting up, said with hollow eyes:

"Today's lunch is also fruit."

"Should I give you something else?"

The moment Ikael's sacred light body showed signs of expanding, Galfin bit into an apple.

'Such is my fate.'

Still, his stomach felt cold.

"I understand not knowing the pleasure of eating. But really, how can I exert any strength eating this?"

"You manage just fine with it."

Although countless years had passed, there were still no children between Galfin and Ikael.

'The problem is that we're different. Completely different.'

It was fortunate that there was no morphological incompatibility, but the mechanism of birth itself was different.

"Are you that worried? About offspring, I mean. Of course I know what that means."

Everyone can become a god.

'Ikael is a mental entity. There are limits with just the physical body. I need to use signals.'

He had tried twisting the laws with Hexa, and Ikael had also made many changes, but the effect was nil.

'The connection point between Ikael and me would be the heart. But no matter how much I combine with Hexa, no change occurs. It's not that we don't earnestly desire it.'

Galfin, who had been blankly watching the Hexa spinning on his index finger, clenched his fist.

*Snap* - the Hexa shattered.

"Heart?"

Ikael, who had been preparing fruit, turned her head.

"Honey, what's wrong?"

"It's not the body."

Simply having their hearts connected and integrated into one signal wasn't enough.

"Let's go."

Galfin grabbed Ikael's wrist, who was kneeling and staring blankly, and pulled her along.

"What? So suddenly?"

"It's okay."

Looking back at Ikael, who was following along pretending to be reluctant, Galfin smiled meaningfully.

"You'll like it too."

The most noble love in the world. Agape.
