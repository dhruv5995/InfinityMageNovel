Breaking Boundaries (2)

'Idea.'

The ultimate realm that Ogent had reached.

The fact that he wielded concepts that existed outside the world was truly worthy of being called breaking boundaries.

It wasn't cutting with a sword, but rather forcibly injecting the concept of cutting into the world.

'But it's equally dangerous.'

It wasn't beautiful or cool.

It was only amazing because a human had achieved it, but ultimately, Ogent had ended his life as a living being.

'The body couldn't withstand it.'

As Rian's Idea replaced Ogent's Idea, Smille's hallucinations were no longer heard.

'Do I have that kind of will?'

Terrifying obsession had made Ogent immortal, but Rian had only inherited his genes.

'There's no reason to live that desperately.'

Rian was not Ogent.

'Honestly, I don't even understand it.'

The biggest reason he could come this far was actually because he resembled Smille's nature.

He didn't swing his sword to become the best?

'I will become the greatest swordsman.'

If that competitive spirit wasn't greater than Ogent's obsession, this single strike would completely annihilate his body.

'I'm grateful for what you passed down to me, but... does it matter?'

"I won't stop."

For a moment, Rian felt as if Ogent was smiling in his mind.

Faust approached.

"It's the fate of living beings to want to confirm the end."

Even when he was just a nameless bat.

"I witnessed the clash of the two strongest beings. Though it's nothing more than a primordial feeling without any real memory."

Faust's body, emanating intense killing intent, began dissolving into black smoke from his feet up.

"Where did we come from? What is this world we inhabit? There may be various ways to find the answer, but the simplest one is..."

Massive smoke rose like a burning mountain, completely covering the sky in darkness.

"To become strong enough to destroy that world."

This was why Anke Ra had forbidden breaking boundaries.

The smoke filling the sky twisted sharply and began rushing toward Rian.

Just looking at the size of this half-body, half-soul state, its power was incomparably stronger than a Lord.

"Rian!"

At the sight of all the world's darkness converging, Zenia screamed.

'Cut!'

Rian took one step forward and brought down his great sword.

The speed of movement at the realm of divine transcendence, Idea, was enough to burn his body.

His skin burned first, his muscles evaporated, and his skeleton glowed red-hot.

Movement that transcended the limits of what humans could achieve would melt even steel, but...

"Hiyaaaah!"

〈Idea〉 cannot be destroyed.

Rian's battle cry suddenly cut off as the massive smoke split cleanly in half.

"Graaaah!"

As the black smoke split in two in its half-body, half-soul state, a clear night sky spread out.

Zenia's eyes filled with shock.

"Th-this is..."

The sky cracked open, revealing another world with an eerie radiance.

'Where is that place?'

But the radiance disappeared before she could ponder the question, and realistic shock struck the world.

Kwarrrrrrr!

A shockwave with magic-level power that split the world in two continued endlessly forward.

When the sound of collapsing buildings could be heard faintly in the distance, Zenia pounded on the glass sphere.

"Rian! Rian!"

At the same time, the great sword fell from the hands of Rian, who stood with only bones remaining, clattering to the ground.

"No!"

Since the sword had stood upright even without arms, it seemed as if Rian's life had fallen.

Soon after, the blackened skeleton scattered in the wind, turning to ash and spreading out.

"Grrrr!"

Faust, split in two and returned to human form, fell to the ground.

'I saw it.'

There was light.

Though it was such intense light that nothing could be confirmed, that place definitely existed.

'How regrettable.'

He wanted to remain in the world a little longer to see the end, but now he only had a few minutes left.

"Rian! Rian!"

Hearing Zenia's cries, Faust slowly raised the head of his left body.

'Has he disappeared?'

If the light he had seen was real, existing in this world would be impossible.

'Now that it's come to this... I don't feel good about it.'

'How empty. In the end, nothing remains.'

The sound of wind could be heard from somewhere.

'I am Rian.'

His voice echoed throughout the universe, but no one could hear it.

'Yes, I am Rian.'

Because it had spread so perfectly that it couldn't be defined as sound.

But those faint waves were constantly forcing something upon himself.

'I know. I am Rian.'

But what meaning did that have?

His current state was so satisfying that he didn't want to think any more complex thoughts.

'The greatest single strike...'

Even recalling such memories was bothersome.

'I am Rian.'

Endlessly repeating only himself was all he could do.

Just as Arius had once used Apoptosis, Rian was merely in a conceptual state.

Therefore, he had no will.

He just needed to eternally repeat himself and exist by permeating this world.

'What?'

That's why it was almost miraculous that the current Rian had doubts about a specific object.

'Sword?'

One concept forcibly connected with him.

'I am Rian who possesses 〈Idea〉.'

Idea?

As information began to develop personality, one bothersome memory surfaced.

'Right, I delivered the greatest single strike with this.'

For what purpose?

'To become the greatest swordsman.'

It was such a wonderful feeling that he thought 'Should I go back now?', but it was far from reality.

It was as weak a will as lying in bed and thinking 'Should I try dying now?'

'Why?'

Among the six basic questions, the most unnecessary one, yet without it, nothing would remain.

'Why should I go back?'

Rian's concept changed direction at that point, looking toward the exact opposite of reality.

And he realized that a single ray of light from somewhere unknown was connected to him.

Though it might be incredibly far away, he thought it might also be right in front of him.

A signal coming from outside the world.

Therefore, even Rian's concept that was thinking now would be nothing more than the action of that signal.

What exists outside?

Rian tried to go toward where the light was coming from, but couldn't feel like he was advancing.

'I am Rian. I am Rian. I am Rian...'

The more he refused to give up, the stronger the feedback became, until he finally couldn't think of anything else.

'Rian! Rian! Rian! Rian! Rian! Rian!'

Though he feared losing even the self that was thinking, he advanced endlessly.

Ogent Rian.

Eventually, one concept flickered endlessly in his thoughts, becoming his everything.

As everything became clear, his perspective turned to the opposite side regardless of his will.

The shadow of a man holding a sword was spread across the end of a dark world, shimmering faintly.

'Do I look like that?'

There was no way to confirm, but finally the first will to execute something arose.

'Yes, I am Ogent Rian.'

Shadows cannot be destroyed.

"This is Sirone's sword."

When vocal waves defined as sound occurred, the world he was in exploded into paleness.

"Rian... If you die like this..."

Zenia collapsed helplessly against the glass sphere, shedding tears.

Though they had defeated the True Demon Faust, the hunters' feelings about losing a precious comrade were no different from hers.

"Z-Zenia."

Then Katein pointed forward.

The air where Rian had disappeared shimmered transparently before forming the shape of a human body.

As if filling an empty mold, colorful hues began dotting it bit by bit.

It was a human body.

Bones formed, nerves and muscles covered them, and finally even skin regenerated rapidly, revealing Rian's face.

"H-how?"

Rather than joy, the shock of disbelief seized the hunters' minds.

"Grrrrrr!"

As terrible pain rushed in from the realm of reality, Rian gritted his teeth and knelt down.

'What an awful feeling.'

Was this how Sirone felt when he returned from the limits of Immortal Function?

"Rian!"

Hearing Zenia's voice, Rian grabbed his great sword and slowly stood up.

His approaching figure was quite dignified, but being naked was a problem.

"Ah, no!"

Just as Zenia hurriedly turned her head away, a flash of light passed before her eyes.

As half of the glass sphere that had withstood any impact was cleanly cut away, she turned her gaze back.

What came into view was Rian already standing unconscious.

"Rian! Get a hold of yourself! Rian!"

Zenia ran over and shook him, but as if he were fixed to something, it was impossible even to knock him down.

"Free us!"

After releasing the lock on the Physics Machine, the hunters examined Rian's condition.

"H-how is this..."

The law that activated even while unconscious had the weight of lifting a ton.

Katein, who barely managed to lay Rian down, checked his condition.

"What happened?"

"Fortunately, he's breathing. But his pulse is weak. We'd better move him to the hideout quickly."

"Even if we move him quickly..."

With just the hunters present, they could barely handle Rian's weight.

"Over there! They're over there!"

Hundreds of security guards were running from the distance.

Only after confirming Security Captain Benoff's face did Zenia sigh and sit down.

'But such power...'

Every time she confirmed the scenery destroyed by Rian's sword, she couldn't think of him as human.

'The world's strongest swordsman.'

Though she didn't know what would happen next, when Rian opened his eyes again, everything would be different.

Niflheim. Deep in the world of the dead where everything was frozen, Ymir's eyelids snapped open.

That alone caused the massive ice sheet to vibrate.

'Has the time come?'

Through Suoyi, the symbiotic organism, he knew that Anke Ra had disappeared.

The reason he hadn't moved despite this was because there was no need to.

'Ogent.'

As promised 10,000 years ago, his bloodline would once again open the world of breaking boundaries.

"Rian!"

As his lips moved, the Suoyi quickly moved away through solid molecules.

Cracks began forming on the surface of the absolutely unbreakable ice sea.

"Let's settle this!"

After Ogent left the world, Ymir had also been imprisoned here for breaking the principles of boundaries.

"Talking about what's outside the world, about protecting this world, all scared out of their minds!"

As Ymir clenched his fist and rose to his feet, the surrounding ice evaporated into steam.

"Whatever it is, just smash it and be done with it!"

As his tremendous presence distorted gravity, the ice sea began churning chaotically.

"I am the strongest!"

Otherwise, there was no reason to exist.

"I am..."

Kugugugugugu!

Hundreds of tons of ice chunks rose into the air, shaking without direction.

"Ymir!"

As the shockwave spread and pushed away the ice walls in pure energy form, a thunderous roar shook all of heaven.

The Giant King Ymir. Main body resurrection.
