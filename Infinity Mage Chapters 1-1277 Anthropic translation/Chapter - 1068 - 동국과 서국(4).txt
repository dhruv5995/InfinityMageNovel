Eastern Kingdom and Western Kingdom (4)

The entrance to Atogram was an arched gate 30 meters high.

Despite its massive size, it didn't feel out of place—probably because the city walls were much taller.

User code confirmed. Entry permitted.

Unlike reality, everything here was automated, and the massive iron gates opened to either side.

Just the first sight alone was enough to make Sirone's head spin.

"Wow, there's so many!"

Various machines of all kinds traversed the cutting-edge city.

The neon signs on buildings flashed with so many colors it was dizzying.

"We're meeting Yolga's son in the evening, so let's hunt until then. We're the ones raising our levels anyway."

Death Princess said.

"How about we get some parts first? It's kind of annoying using just rifles."

A team passing by looked at Sirone's group and burst into laughter.

"Haha! Hey, look at those kids. Isn't that an old steel helmet? Those still exist?"

"Brings back memories. I used to wear those and catch Metal Rats. Are there still Ten-Men around?"

Destruction God 707 slapped the ground.

"Ugh, those guys! If I hadn't reset my code name, they wouldn't have dared talk to me."

Sirone asked.

"You said you were level 180, right? Maybe those users are even higher level. High-level players gather here too."

"No, you can tell just by looking—they're maybe level 100 at best. You can tell from their parts. That's made by Spread Company. They only deal in mass-produced products. If they're over level 100 and still wearing that stuff, it'd be really funny."

Ultimate Code Name said.

"When you reach Atogram, about 20,000 galactic credits accumulate. Usually buying package parts is the standard approach."

Sirone asked.

"What about selective options? The 'electronic store' keeps flashing that I can buy something."

Death Princess said.

"Turn off the beginner tips. They're inconvenient during hunting. I'll tell you. First, try going into selective options."

Following the instructions, one slot appeared with an 'electronic store' display below it.

"Selective option functions can be purchased from the electronic store. Of course, right now you'll only have 'communication.' That costs 20,000 galactic credits, which is less efficient than buying packages. Unless you're doing organized activities like the Ten-Men."

"True, we can just communicate by talking. But there's only one slot—do you add functions to this?"

"Yeah. You get 1 slot at level 20, and 1 more at level 30. You can equip three options total. And starting from level 40, new functions are registered in the 'electronic store' every 10 levels. From then on, you combine options based on your preferences, situation, and missions."

Ultimate Code Name said.

"If Yolga's son is going to support us anyway, we could buy communication, but it's a matter of pride. We have some time until evening, so let's buy packages and hunt."

Destruction God 707 turned to Sirone.

"Right, but are you sure Yolga's son will help you? Can you get galactic credits too?"

"Probably. I don't know how much he can help, but he'll have to give up everything he has."

Because the future of humanity was at stake.

"Really? You must be really close."

There seemed to be some misunderstanding, but there was no need for a long explanation.

"Haha! Well..."

Destruction God 707 pointed toward downtown.

"Let's go to 'Maron' then. Maron Company is the best for beginners to use."

When they entered the commercial district specializing in parts, it was packed with people.

"There really are a lot."

"In High Gear, the most important thing after level is parts. A total of 270 companies have shops here. Some are even run by users."

"By users?"

"Of course. Now users can exchange all kinds of items with each other. Some users sell parts from stalls, and others buy shops with galactic credits to open stores."

Death Princess added.

"You have to be careful buying parts made by users. They have many unique or excellent functions, but they're weak in terms of balance. If your right arm is a 'Megamix' company product but it's not compatible, then you're just throwing money away."

"That's your story."

At Ultimate Code Name's words, Death Princess got fired up.

"That's exactly why I'm telling you! If we had plenty of galactic credits, we could experiment with anything, but we're poor. We have to buy as carefully as possible."

When they arrived at 'Maron,' a humanoid machine with all its steel frame visible approached them.

"Welcome. How may I help you?"

"We'd like to buy parts. Maron package beginner level. It's still 20,000 galactic credits, right? When's the sale period?"

The guide robot kindly answered Destruction God 707's question and brought a box larger than a person.

"They put a lot of effort into the packaging, huh?"

Looking at the surface, a pretty girl was winking as if begging them to buy it.

"All commercial parts come in boxes. Once you open the box, no refunds. Even without using them, some users collect several of certain models."

"Then we can't check the contents. Well, since it's a program, there shouldn't be any defects, right?"

"No defects. But you can check the contents. Look for the artificial intelligence simulation mark on the box. Touch that and you can have a virtual experience."

Suppressing the thought 'This is already virtual,' Sirone reached for the box.

An electrical signal scanned Sirone, and before he knew it, he was equipped with the parts.

"Huh?"

The appearance was almost identical, but bearings were embedded at every joint, and connection surfaces were visible on his face too.

"Hehe! Amazing, right? Try various things and buy it if you like it. Oh, as Death Princess said, items sold by users don't have this function, so be careful."

'The joints...'

Sirone rotated his elbow 360 degrees and turned his neck joint to look behind him.

"This is really weird."

Death Princess said.

"It'll feel strange at first. But articulated joints are incredibly convenient in combat. Of course, durability becomes an issue later on. Anyway, let's buy it. We don't have the galactic credits to buy anything else."

Sirone, like his companions, placed his palm on 'purchase' in the box and paid the galactic credits.

"Choose immediate replacement. You'll experience it later anyway, but that's kind of weird."

Though he was curious about body exchange, he felt more repulsion for now.

"Yeah. Immediate replacement."

Once the transaction was complete, the replacement process was skipped and four people transformed into androids.

"Now let's hunt. If you play a little, you'll adapt to the parts. So, where should we start?"

Ultimate Code Name said.

"Since we don't have nationality, we have to go to the neutral zone. Of course, it'll be just as annoying there."

After exiting Atogram's north gate, there was an abandoned city 1 kilometer away.

Disgusting-looking creatures resided there, and several users were enthusiastically hunting.

Spatial Information: Destroy

033

"Destroy is the basic hunting ground in High Gear. Since you're level 10, let's catch War Robots first. See that one?"

A machine tapping the ground with triangular legs while looking around came into view.

When auto-aim locked on, Sirone's right arm underwent mechanical changes.

Ching! Ching!

In less than a second, his hand had transformed into a gun barrel a span long.

"Ugh!"

"It looks a bit weird, but bear with it. For beginner parts, this is pretty decent. Anyway, this part's main firepower is energy bullets. See the vertical gauge on the side of your vision?"

"Yeah. It says 1,000/1,000."

"Energy bullets use batteries. You can fire 1,000 shots with one battery. Other companies sell ones that use real bullets, but the galactic credits can't handle that. The efficiency is poor too."

"How much are batteries?"

"500 galactic credits. That's enough to afford even if you mess up hunting completely. Let's start now."

Gunfire echoed through Destroy-033.

The speed was incomparably faster than with Bio, and the firepower was tremendous too.

Bang! Bang!

Every time the four people's energy bullets concentrated, War Robots exploded with satisfying sounds.

"500 shots left."

"Still, we've already collected 2,000 galactic credits. If we catch a few more, our level will go up too."

Sirone was achieving the highest results.

"Over there! And over there!"

He was destroying War Robots while spinning not only his elbow joints but even his neck joints.

'...His adaptability is incredible. He was calling it disgusting earlier.'

Anyway, one thing was certain.

'He said this was his first time with High Gear, but this guy has fought a ton.'

He'd watched rankers' raids via satellite broadcast.

All the strategies and tactics, quick reflexes and judgment that made him realize functionality wasn't everything.

'His level is low, but...'

Watching Yahweh2's combat, the thrill he'd felt from them washed over him like déjà vu.

'What exactly does this guy do?'

For the first time he was curious about someone's identity, but Destruction God 707 shook his head.

He himself wouldn't feel good if someone was digging into his real identity.

'Let's just hunt.'

Just as he was renewing his resolve with that thought, Sirone suddenly shouted loudly.

"Get down!"

Sparks flew from Death Princess's body at the same time.

"Ugh!"

When the remaining three turned their heads, someone 250 meters away was grinning wickedly.

'User code name...'

Disaster5MinutesBefore.

'From the Western Kingdom.'

Through his spiritual sense, Sirone had sensed it in advance, but there was nothing he could do except warn them verbally.

Death Princess shouted.

"Hey! What are you doing? You want to die?"

"Haha! Sorry. It was a mistake. I was trying to catch a wolf on the other side and... Sorry."

Disaster5MinutesBefore apologized, but the group was still displeased.

'Talking nonsense about mistakes.'

Auto-aim wouldn't make mistakes, and looking at the parts covering his joints, he was level 20 or above.

'A level 20 hunting here?'

He considered fighting, but didn't want to lose the equipment they'd just bought, so he turned away.

"Don't mind him, let's go. That guy's doing it because he's bored. He picks on beginners to mess with them."

Sirone examined Death Princess's side.

"It's cracked."

"Yeah. Durability is 80/100. It's Maron Company's bolt gun. Let's just avoid him. His armor is probably better than ours too."

Since the person involved said so, Sirone also retreated for now while glaring at Disaster5MinutesBefore.

He smirked and waved his hand.

After hunting for another 10 minutes, Sirone felt that annoying sensation again.

"Get down..."

Bang!

Death Princess's left arm was destroyed.

'Penetration judgment.'

He'd definitely aimed on purpose, and Sirone's eyes widened as he turned around.

Disaster5MinutesBefore scratched his head.

"Haha! Sorry! I made another mistake. I'll really be careful from now on, so forgive me this once."

Sirone didn't believe him.

"Let's fight. That guy's a pest."

"If we fight back, it becomes a hostile act on our part too. If we die in that state, we lose our loot. That's what that guy is aiming for..."

Before he could finish speaking, Sirone kicked off the ground and fired his energy gun at Disaster5MinutesBefore.

"Hahaha! You shot! This makes it a hostile act!"

The level 23 AI was automatically dodging Sirone's bullets.

'Hehe, Maron stuff is easy.'

He didn't have much anyway, but he wanted to see the user's frustrated reaction.

"This is what you call a bolt gun."

Energy bullets shot out with a much heavier sound than Sirone's weapon.

And Sirone was...

"Huh?"

He was dodging the bullets raining down like hail while continuously attempting counterattacks.

As the distance closed.

"Huh? Huh?"

Disaster5MinutesBefore's evasion rate began dropping rapidly toward 0 percent.
