New Humanity (3)

A secret chamber.

In a space known to no one else, not even his closest confidants, Fermi opened the box that the Parrot Mercenary Group had excavated.

Inside were memo papers still covered with dirt and unidentifiable metal fragments.

It was the future from the past.

'The memory chips will take time to restore.'

Not only had they been buried for ages, but the hardware itself was severely damaged.

Fermi set the chips down.

'Careful, careful.'

Complete restoration would be difficult, but if even a single word could be deciphered, its value would be beyond imagination.

Using tweezers to pick up a memo, Fermi gently held it up to the lamp on his desk.

Someone's diary.

"Let's see."

Or perhaps it was a final record scrawled in desperation before death.

"New Humanity?"

Storing that term in his mind, Fermi used the tweezers to unfold the twice-folded paper.

It was an official document, half-torn as if destroyed, written in Eastern script.

"Politicians, really... even if the world ends, they won't hand over information to other countries. Such dedication."

With flexible thinking, he deciphered the text.

'Second Beast. The number of the beast 666. Three-stage filter leading to the end. Possibility of Argonese rampage.'

Setting down the document, Fermi rested his chin on his hand.

'As expected, the end cannot be avoided. Humanity's thinking upon reaching the singularity cannot ignore the outside world.'

That singularity was divided into three stages of filters.

'Stage 1 is awareness of the outside world. Stage 2 is contact with evidence from the outside world. And Stage 3 is... photonic system departure.'

According to Fermi's analysis, humanity was currently just passing through the second stage filter.

'And the beginning of that is the New Humanity.'

More excavation would be needed for detailed information, but it was clearly connected to the outside world.

'When Stage 3 is reached, the world ends somehow. But "somehow" is rather...'

In his thinking, the end was as difficult as humanity integrating into Ultima.

'Any event reaching an extreme is extremely difficult. Moreover...'

Hadn't Guffin already departed from the photonic system?

"Hmm."

Fermi tapped the tweezers rhythmically.

"Just because one departs the photonic system doesn't necessarily mean they've entered the outside world."

He wanted to fill the gaps in his reasoning even with such thoughts.

"Or... the concept of the outside world might be completely different from what Guffin or we think."

What is unknown cannot be guarded against.

'A perfect end? Compulsion that transcends causality? Is this world a system that allows such things?'

Even when Nane tried to close the world, didn't Sirone exist to defend against it?

'That is the rule. In this world, extremes must have corresponding extremes.' Therefore, the end would be something that transcends the world.

'Unimaginable. Beyond brain function, it would be something our brains cannot process.'

What form would it take?

"The end of numbers."

Whatever unimaginable form it took, it would ultimately be reducible to numbers.

With a click, the tweezers fixed on the desk, and Fermi's gaze focused on one of the memos.

'The Second Beast.'

An entity born first to welcome the First Beast and destroy the world.

'Where?'

Sirone would be there.

Picking up the official document with tweezers, Fermi carefully examined the seal stamped on the torn section.

"Bukjeon."

***

Having safely passed through Bukjeon's gates, Borbor and Tanjura entered a brewery.

A pale-faced young man with swords at both hips bowed his head.

"You've arrived."

It was Tanjura's satellite, Daeho.

"Where's Mika?"

The tent curtain of the inner room parted, and a bent-backed old man emerged carrying a jar.

After checking the stars, he spoke.

"A considerable number of residents have been replaced by New Humanity. This brewery's owner was also New Humanity."

Borbor's satellite Mika was an electromagnetic organism that could parasitize other bodies.

Having no emotions to begin with, Borbor treated Mika indifferently.

"The mechanism?"

"They use mental radiation to mutate surrounding organisms. It's similar to the technique used by the Five Great Stars. Turbid minds transform surrounding organisms into monsters."

"Quite dangerous. The naive thought that we only needed to seal areas where the demon realm opened."

"Mutations are unpredictable. Moreover, this one can control minds. This means it can cause mutations at will."

Tanjura's face twisted.

"The ability to cause organism mutation. Serious indeed. If we can't eliminate it in Bukjeon, the continent will be overturned."

Borbor shared the same thought.

"Where is the leader of the New Humanity now?"

Daeho replied.

"We searched the city's strongholds with Mika's abilities, but no one knows the location. There's a high probability it's near Bukjeon's governor Hwanggak. Or it might be Hwanggak himself."

"That would make sense. Then let's meet the governor and confirm."

Mika asked.

"What about the body?"

"Kill it."

The moment the order was given, Mika picked up a awl and stabbed his own heart.

Shortly after, an electric entity emerged from the corpse and infiltrated Borbor through electrical charges.

*I've taken control of the brainwaves. Shall I think?*

"No, process signals coming from outside. Report if you sense any unusual mutants."

*Understood.*

The two stars and two satellites who left the brewery headed straight for the inner castle gate.

Mika, who had been silent until now, sent a powerful signal to Borbor's brain.

*Not human.*

Though their appearance was identical to humans, the soldiers' eyes contained no emotion whatsoever.

"What's the matter?"

Looking at the spears pointed at them, Tanjura spoke.

"We've come to meet Governor Hwanggak. If you would kindly let us in, we're willing to have a conversation."

The moment he finished speaking, powerful auras began emanating from the soldiers' bodies.

*Please step back. Analysis is impossible.*

It was a qualitatively different sense of intimidation from any organism Mika had ever parasitized.

Borbor's gaze turned upward.

'If the intensity of mutation increases at close range... the leader of New Humanity is in the castle.'

Whatever the power of mental radiation, even stars of the Ivory Tower wouldn't be exceptions.

"Heh heh! These non-human things sure are impressive. What shall we do now?"

Borbor made his decision.

"Force our way through."

Simultaneously, the soldiers' skin tore, revealing forms that looked like a mix of humans and grasshoppers.

"Kieeeee!"

At the screech from their gaping jaws, Tanjura swallowed with excited eyes.

"Interesting."

"Above!"

The moment Daeho shouted, a swarm of grasshoppers that filled the sky descended from the castle walls.

Chewing sounds could be heard.

***

In front of Governor Hwanggak's corpse, a 17-year-old girl was tearing at and eating an arm.

She had an innocent appearance that seemed to know no darkness, but her eyes were not human.

"Delicious."

With a rip, she tore the arm muscle, exposing bone.

"Piri-nim."

It wasn't a name given by parents.

Having evolved into New Humanity, she had given herself a name meaning "deviation from reason."

"Badbelb, isn't there more like this? Strong human meat, I mean. I want to keep eating."

At the end of Piri's gaze stood a giant grasshopper-human over two meters tall.

Wings hidden within its carapace fluttered, and a scorpion's tail rose higher than its head.

"This is not the time to enjoy feeding. Quite powerful beings have come outside the castle gates."

Joy overflowed on Piri's face.

"Really? I can eat more delicious meat? What are you doing? Hurry up and go catch them."

"...Haven't you been here too long? We should destroy this city soon and leave."

"Haha! It's fine. We're strong. You know, right? No one in this world can beat us."

That was true.

Though they hadn't fought all of humanity, they understood themselves accurately.

Such abilities, such intelligence.

'Have we become gods...?'

Piri extended her hand.

"More. Meat."

The grasshopper's eyes stared at this, then spread its wings and turned toward the window.

"I'll bring it right away."

***

The grasshopper-humans filling the area in front of the inner gate surrounded Tanjura, their bodies trembling.

"Kiek! Kiek!"

The reason they couldn't move was because Tanjura had sentenced them.

"For the crime of causing disorder in the world, 600 years imprisonment! For causing serious damage to innocent residents' minds, 987 years imprisonment!"

The moment judgment was passed, legal binding force constrained the grasshopper-humans.

"Therefore, combining all charges..."

Tanjura's mouth stretched wide.

"Death sentence."

Simultaneously, Daeho flew in like wind, swinging the twin swords in both hands left and right.

'Guillotine.'

Like cutting through scenery with scissors, the grasshoppers' faces were cleanly sliced.

"Heh heh! Made an example of them today too."

The cutting power of the guillotine using leverage laws was theoretically limitless.

Tanjura stroked his beard contentedly.

'The same principle as being able to move a planet with an infinitely long pole and fulcrum.'

And that's why physical damage could be inflicted even in a 'confined' state.

Borbor approached.

"Don't let your guard down. The northern gateway of the Azure Dragon Mountains won't collapse from just this."

Daeho sheathed his swords.

"These must be Bukjeon's mutants. Are they qualitatively different from the Azure Dragon Mountains' mutants?"

Before he could answer, the castle gate opened.

When they saw a non-human being walking elegantly like a human...

*You must flee.*

Though Mika sent a warning, Borbor couldn't take a single step from that spot.

'I'll die the moment I move.'

Such a bizarre feeling surrounded the grasshopper-human that he was certain of this.

'Strong? So I can't win? No, this isn't that kind of temperament.'

He didn't understand.

Even without having explored the entire universe, why did he think such a thing couldn't possibly exist...

'What's the problem? The aura of its form? The bizarreness of evolution? No, these are all imaginable things.'

The only thing he couldn't imagine was...

'Numbers.'

The stark contradiction that arose when expressing the information comprising it mathematically.

'It has different numbers from us.'

Something that exists nowhere in the universe.

Her thoughts were transmitted to Mika, and judgment fell as quickly as electricity.

"Run!"

Tanjura and Daeho left their positions, and Borbor charged forward.

'Dying doesn't matter, but...'

The situation where everyone here would be annihilated and unable to report to the Ivory Tower had to be avoided.

*I'll do it.*

When he handed brain control to Mika, Borbor's body bent like rubber.

His limbs flew like whips to wrap around the grasshopper-human's body, but then...

*Unrecognizable.*

The enemy's form evaporated, and a powerful impact struck the back of Borbor's neck.

"Kuk!"

Mika transmitted:

*89 percent of brain function is paralyzed. Entering coma state temporarily.*

'No. Stall for as much time as possible.'

*I refuse.*

The grasshopper-human, carrying the unconscious Borbor at its waist, looked toward the castle gate.

"Should I chase them?"

Though it hesitated briefly, the image of Piri waiting eagerly came to mind.

"It tastes better when eaten alive."

The inner gate closed.

***

Tanjura's eyes blazed red.

"Arrrgh! Those bastards!"

Though fleeing frantically, in his heart he tore the grasshopper-human apart a thousand times.

"Calm down. Reporting takes priority."

When Daeho's guillotine ability split the outer gate, an open field came into view.

"Huh?"

Tanjura's eyebrows twitched, and both men hurriedly stopped.

"Lord Ogseong?"

Sirone was walking toward them with two apostles.
