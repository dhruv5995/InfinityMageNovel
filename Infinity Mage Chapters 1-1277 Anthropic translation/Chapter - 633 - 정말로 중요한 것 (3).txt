[633] What's Truly Important (3)

Amidst the endless criticism, the participants looked back at Nade, who still showed no will to fight.

'I knew it would come to this.'

Frings vividly remembered the terror he had experienced from Nade during the Scramble Royale.

He too wasn't exactly normal in personality, so he had gotten over it before long, but it was an incident he never wanted to experience again.

'He's definitely a time bomb that's better left untouched.'

But now the final 10 had been confirmed, and if there was nothing left to lose anyway, confronting him would be advantageous for the scouts' evaluation.

"Come at me. There's nowhere left to run, is there?"

Frings gestured provocatively with his hand, but Nade only stared helplessly at the sky.

'Me, graduate?'

What would be the point anyway?

Even if he graduated like this, no organization would call for someone who had done nothing.

Just as certified and uncertified were different, even among mages, the treatment received varied drastically according to society's recognition.

If he dropped out like this, it would properly fulfill his original plan to give his mother disappointment.

"I won't fight."

Fighting with Shirone was unimaginable.

"This is ridiculous."

Dante had never seen Nade's true nature, but he wasn't unaware of the atmosphere that several skilled fighters avoided.

"Just because you say you don't want to fight, should we accept that?"

"I don't care what you think. I won't fight."

At his arrogant response, the audience's voices grew even louder.

"Such a coward doesn't deserve to be a mage!"

"Hey, just crush him! Show him what's what!"

The reason he didn't move despite the audience's clamor was because it wasn't as simple a problem as it seemed.

Iruki stepped toward Nade.

"How about dropping out? It's a meaningless fight for you anyway."

He recalled the resolution Nade had made the night before the graduation exam.

At least if he dropped out now, there might be lingering unpleasant memories, but they wouldn't become enemies.

"......"

When Nade remained silent, Iruki pointed with his index finger.

"See, you want to fight too. You don't want to drop out, do you?"

'Mother.'

Though the audience seats were packed with people, finding Teria was easy.

Her face, not noble but still beautiful, was uniquely twisted like a demon among hundreds of faces, pressuring Nade.

'That terribly hateful face.'

Yet a face he had no choice but to love because she was his mother.

"Get lost! You're a disgrace to mages! Don't lower the school's dignity!"

Teria's face reddened at the people's criticism.

"This is so embarrassing I could die. What kind of disgraceful behavior is that?"

Ballroom scolded his wife.

"Stop it. You should at least cheer him on."

"Look at the other students. They're all fighting so hard to bring honor to their parents. How can he be so selfish?"

Lycan approached from behind Nade.

"This is annoying. Just die."

Grabbing Nade's neck, he applied electricity and hurled him to the end of the colosseum.

The electricity that gathered before his eyes then flew in a huge parabola and struck where Nade had fallen.

'You idiot! Electricity is...!'

Frings' face turned pale, and everyone who knew about Mana Assimilation stiffened as they watched Nade.

"What?"

But Nade was just lying there, sending a mournful gaze toward Teria.

It was three days after Nade's mind had been destroyed, unable to endure the torture of the Chicken Head Bandit Group, that the Gasols came to rescue him.

Among the charcoal-burned corpses, young Nade could only cry like a fool, and despite the enormous sum spent on treatment, the seizures wouldn't stop.

"Why are you crying! Why are you crying! Do you know how much loss Mom suffered because of you?"

Her heart burned as she had spent the money borrowed from relatives on her son's treatment.

"Mom, Mommy......"

Nade desperately held back.

What was more frightening than the monster inside was his mother's pain, and gradually the convulsions began to subside, passing through hiccups.

'What... did I do wrong?'

Once, he had gotten angry.

"It's not like I wanted to become like this! What have you ever done for me!"

Ballroom threw a bottle at Nade.

"You bastard!"

He was probably annoyed at his son for touching his frightening wife's nerves, but Nade felt nothing but wronged.

"Aaaaah!"

When Nade charged at the wall to smash his head, trying to destroy the body they had given him.

"Aaaaaaah!"

Teria clawed at her face with her nails.

"Honey!"

Ballroom ran to her in shock, and Nade stared blankly at his mother's face covered in blood.

And then.......

"Kill me! Just kill me instead!"

Teria unhesitatingly slashed her wrist with a knife.

"Damn it! Someone quickly! Call a doctor!"

"M-Mom......"

While all the household members moved busily, only Nade watched her as if time had stopped.

"I'm sorry......"

Nade sniffled with a foolish face.

'Don't be angry. It's my fault.'

No child in this world can overcome their parents.

"Beyond recovery. It's completely over."

As Nade just kept crying, the remaining eight participants ignored him and clashed in the center of the colosseum.

While everyone was captivated by the spectacular display of magic, only Nade and Teria exchanged glances.

"Too pathetic to watch."

When Teria stood up from the audience and turned away, Nade's fists clenched roughly.

'Yes, go ahead and leave. I'll never become a mage! I'll never give you the life you want!'

It was the situation he had so desperately wanted.

But why did it hurt so much?

Why was he falling endlessly into the abyss?

'We'll be ruined together! We can all just die together!'

The moment Teria disappeared beyond the shadows of the exit.

"Aaaaaaaah!"

Nade rose with a scream.

"What exactly did I"

Electricity bloomed all over his body.

"Do so wrong!"

The moment the Speak occurred, Nade flew behind Shirone and swung his arm.

"Gah!"

At a speed that allowed no reaction, Shirone rolled across the ground as the participants turned their heads in surprise.

"Hrrrrgh!"

There was something eerie about Nade grinding his teeth and convulsing, as if he might explode at any moment.

"What's the mana reading?"

Baikal asked, but Elizabeth couldn't even think to answer and just blinked.

"What's wrong? The mana reading!"

"......I'm sorry. Let me check once more."

When Nade took one step, everyone stepped back ten.

"Why? Why exactly?"

Nade's question arose from an unfathomably deep hatred whose basis couldn't even be guessed.

"Whyyyy!"

As electricity shot up through the colosseum's sky, the Lee Cheon system sounded an alarm.

Data capacity limit exceeded. Activating emergency system. Opening Second Core.

The colosseum's lights flickered.

Data capacity limit exceeded. Opening Third Core. Opening Fourth Core.

White lightning stood like pillars, racing across the ground before splitting into hundreds and swirling chaotically.

"Opening the Fourth Core?"

As far as Baikal knew, this was unprecedented in history.

Activating final stabilization device. Opening Fifth Core.

Only after all five emergency systems were activated did Lee Cheon operate normally, and the same blue light lit up in all the analysts' eyes.

"What is it?"

"......1.48 billion magicles."

Baikal's head turned as if it might break.

"1.48 billion? Is that even a possible reading?"

"The problem is......"

Elizabeth continued with a trembling voice.

"It's still rising."

Iruki, who had been checking on the fallen Shirone, frowned with displeasure.

"What about the promise you made with me? You said you wouldn't fight Shirone, but you backstab like this?"

"It's okay."

Shirone slowly got up.

"This is a test. He wasn't trying to kill me."

Iruki wanted to believe that too, but all that remained in Nade in his Mana Assimilation state was purposeless killing intent.

"Grrrrgh!"

Watching Nade's grotesquely distorted face, Shirone smiled sadly.

"At first I thought it was a scary face."

Because his heart was so tender and kind, he couldn't even get angry without hating someone.

"But it was actually a face in pain, wasn't it, Nade."

That's why he couldn't destroy anything without first destroying himself.

"Graaaaaaah!"

"Final mana reading 1.86 billion magicles! It's Mana Assimilation! He'll die if we leave him like this!"

"Indeed, perfect chaos. So this is what they feared."

Nade's condition, with not a trace of reason remaining, was violently different in dimension from what Shirone had experienced before.

Kurrrrrrrrr!

Pure white electricity, pale in its purity, spread from Nade as the center, growing large enough to engulf the entire colosseum.

"Gah!"

Like a moth touching an electric fence, the moment Fiord touched the white light, he collapsed, letting out a death cry.

"Uuuuugh!"

All participants pressed against the walls waiting for the power to subside, while the audience was stunned by Nade's transformed might.

"What is that? It's more serious than Infercus!"

Teria was equally bewildered.

Though Mana Assimilation occasionally occurred and blew up the warehouse, she hadn't known such terrible power was contained within.

"It has... nothing to do with me."

As Teria turned toward the exit, Ballroom grabbed her wrist.

"Where are you going? The test isn't over yet."

"Is the test the problem right now? If even the machine breaks, they might demand compensation from us."

"Is that all you can see? Can't you feel Nade's pain?"

"Just kill me instead! I don't want to live like this either!"

Ballroom gritted his teeth and dragged her back to her seat.

"Sit! At least today, watch your son properly!"

The electricity that had been swelling into a sphere around Nade stopped expanding and shot up in the form of a pillar.

"Now! Attack!"

As the electricity disappeared, as if by agreement, everyone rushed at Nade and unleashed their magic.

'Damn! This is Lee Cheon!'

In real combat, there would be damage to the body, but depleting 1.86 billion magicles with Anti-Magic was a pipe dream.

'Idiots! Just go and kill him.'

Lycan cast Spark magic to subdue Nade from behind and grabbed his face.

Just as he was about to twist his neck completely, sparks flew and Nade's form disappeared, then emerged from all directions throwing punches.

"Aaaaah!"

When the final blow was delivered, Lycan's nose bridge collapsed and Nade's wrist twisted.

"The moment you're caught, you're eliminated. It's like divine lottery."

While electricity that couldn't even be called technique rampaged recklessly, Shirone flew up into the sky.

"Nade!"

The Avatar of Light Angel rose enormously, and as the right arm lifted, tremendous energy gathered in the spear.

'Angel's Punishment!'

The moment the flash struck down at tremendous speed, Nade's body disappeared as if evaporating.

"He dodged?"

Even ultra-high-speed projectiles would only look slow to Nade, who had the same nerves as electricity.

'Then......!'

When Shirone's body multiplied into hundreds through Quantum Superposition, the scouts' eyes widened in amazement.

Quantum Superposition
300-fold Overlap
Avatar Technique
Angel's Punishment.

"This... isn't graduation exam level."

Three hundred angels raised their arms in unison and struck down spears of light toward Nade.
