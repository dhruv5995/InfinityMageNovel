Another Space (1)

When dozens died from Chagall's attack, those who remained hurriedly stopped in their tracks.

Behind them were demons, and ahead was a fiend who stabbed and killed indiscriminately.

"Why, why?"

As Chagall approached, those who had fled for their lives slowly backed away.

"Why are you killing us? You're human too...!"

Before the words could finish, a throwing knife mercilessly pierced the woman's abdomen.

"Aaaahhh!"

In that moment, the people realized exactly where they needed to go.

"Run!"

The fact that the man in front was far less human than the demons behind them.

"Grrrrr!"

Chagall bared his teeth and swung his arms wide, hurling a massive bundle into the sky.

The leather tore, and hundreds of throwing knives spun as they poured down like rain.

Kicking off the ground and charging forward, Chagall caught the falling daggers and began an indiscriminate massacre.

The harbor instantly became a sea of blood from those pierced by the daggers.

"Kekeke! What an interesting human!"

Though the magic came from a human, it was pure evil that even Della had never experienced.

As she crouched low to face the charging Chagall, steel claws extended from her fingers.

Her mouth tore grotesquely, and her beautiful face quickly transformed into that of a vicious beast.

Among the people frozen in terror, Ethella bit her lip.

'Not yet, not yet.'

In the realm of slaughter that couldn't even be called technique, Chagall had reached his peak.

Perhaps this sequence had been predetermined from when La Enemie mocked his fate.

'It's not madness. Definitely some kind of ability. There's no chance of winning in a direct confrontation now.'

During their life on the run, they had fought seven times, and each time Chagall's power had grown stronger.

'One chance.'

Even if it meant sacrificing everyone here, she had to seize that opportunity.

"Not bad!"

While Della and Chagall circled each other, demons and people continued to die.

"How about this?"

As Della increased her speed, her body disappeared and a storm-like wind sound arose.

In the speed where moments stretched like eternity, Chagall couldn't even twitch.

'Hehe, just a human after all...'

Orbiting around her target, she suddenly changed direction sharply and aimed for Chagall's flank.

'I'll play with you to my heart's content.'

She extended her sharp claws to their limit and swung at Chagall's shoulder.

'Huh?'

Chagall's pupils moved to the side.

'He saw me.'

Just as she hastily stopped her attack and tried to lean back her upper body, a resonating vibration was heard.

'What?'

As Chagall's arms moved, the seesaw of time reversed and Della's movements froze.

Dozens of throwing knives still falling like rain moved simultaneously and burrowed into Della.

Thud.

Starting with the first strike that hit her collarbone, knife blades dug in at one-centimeter intervals.

By the time Della's face had transformed into that of a perfect demon, she had already been stabbed over seventy times.

"Kyaaaaa!"

Staggering backward, her eyes widened as blood spurted from all over her body.

"Hurrgh!"

Chagall charged again.

He knew from experience that powerful demons wouldn't perish from just this much.

"Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!"

Stab, stab, and stab again.

With half-lidded eyes as she received the attacks, Della suddenly witnessed a strange sight.

'What is that?'

Around Chagall's body, something that wasn't the color of reality was writhing grotesquely.

And in the next moment, he began stabbing his throwing knives not at Della, but at some other place entirely.

'There's nothing there?'

But amazingly, as if he were really stabbing something, the blades of the throwing knives were disappearing.

'The other side world?'

He was killing beings from another space.

"Kekeke! Kekekeke!"

Even while being annihilated, she felt good because Chagall's situation wasn't much different.

Della embraced Chagall.

"Stab me all you want. I'll wait for you in hell. When that time comes, I'll repay you billions of times over."

Chagall paid no heed and spun her around.

Then he continued stabbing her abdomen where there was nowhere left to stab as he advanced.

The sensation of hands tearing through flesh.

Like someone with obsessive-compulsive disorder, what drove Chagall was only that brief moment of impact.

His consciousness grew distant.

'Tia.'

As his consciousness faded, the countless anguishes that had tormented him in reality scattered like smoke.

"Tia!"

The last throwing knife he had saved for the final blow drove deep into Della's forehead.

With a squelching sound, her eyeball popped out of its socket...

'Now!'

Ethella's fist aimed for Chagall's ribs.

The pupils of Chagall, who turned his head, were so murky and dark they couldn't be thought of as human.

'Master's enemy.'

And now he was also the enemy of the 6,000 people he had killed while chasing Ethella.

Chagall, having used up all his throwing knives, swung his fist, but Ethella was prepared.

Taking the blow on her shoulder while twisting her body, she drove her fist into his ribs.

"Grrrrr!"

Chagall's face contorted, and Ethella quickly withdrew her fist and launched another attack.

'Just once more.'

If she could create interference waves, even a master of Schema would have their organs torn.

"Graaaaa!"

As Chagall let out a roar and straightened his upper body, a strange light appeared in Ethella's eyes.

'How is this possible...'

Chagall was somehow holding a throwing knife.

"Ugh!"

She barely avoided the attack, but dozens of daggers began materializing in mid-air.

'Matter manifestation?'

That wasn't it.

The uneasy energy she had felt every time she clashed with Chagall had finally taken form.

"Uaaaaa!"

The sight of blades rushing in so densely there was no room to dodge was chilling in itself.

Though she retreated with all her might, Ethella was ultimately struck once in the thigh.

"Hngh!"

The moment she looked down at the blade embedded in her thigh, a fountain of red blood shot up high.

She grabbed the handle of the throwing knife with her hand, pulled it out, and tightened her muscles to stop the bleeding.

"Tia."

Every time Chagall took a step, heat shimmer rippled and countless throwing knives clattered down.

Ethella didn't know the reason either.

But she guessed that Chagall seemed to believe perfectly that the throwing knives actually existed.

'Is that possible? No matter how much you believe...'

Ethella realized.

"Ah."

The limits of perception.

Chagall was someone who had already experienced the overlap of virtual and reality once, thanks to La Enemie.

Just as he believed what he saw existed, for Chagall, the throwing knives were like that.

'This is bad. I can't stop him now.'

After seven battles, the strategy Ethella had devised was to wait for the throwing knives to be depleted.

But now the number of weapons was infinite.

"Why?"

Ethella shouted.

"What do you want? If you want to kill me, just kill me. Why are you tormenting me?"

Though they had fought fiercely, she hadn't thought there was never an opportunity against Chagall.

"Because I hate you."

When he learned that his life, everything that happened within it, was nothing but a dream.

"You're not Tia."

What remains for a human?

"I'm going to torment you. Until you cry out in despair, no, even then I'll torment you! Continuously! Forever!"

Everything had been a lie.

The only target Chagall could direct his anger at after awakening was Ethella, who had been Tia.

"I sympathize with your life. But you've already reached an unforgivable state. You've killed far too many people."

"Still not enough."

Chagall smiled bitterly.

"I'm going to kill them all. Kill and kill and kill again, until finally I'm the only one left in this world."

When that time comes.

"I'll know. What's real and what's fake. What my life was."

The fact that it wasn't empty talk made it even more chilling.

"Go. Go anywhere. I'll chase you. I'll kill everything connected to you. You'll experience the exact same pain I have."

Ethella thought of suicide.

If she took her own life here, would Chagall stop his meaningless slaughter?

'No.'

Taking Chagall's life with her own hands was the only path for her master, the sacrificed people, and humanity.

While the two glared at each other, the few people who couldn't escape quietly rose to their feet.

With just that brief movement, Chagall's hand moved and throwing knives pierced through everyone's skull.

"Keke. Kekeke."

Around Chagall, who swayed with his shoulders shaking, the scenery warped once again.

Landscapes and colors not of this world, and the faint screams of the dead leaking out.

Ethella's eyes sparkled.

'I see.'

The boundary between delusion and realityâ€”Chagall was already in a state of being neither dead nor alive.

Ethella, who had been glaring fiercely at Chagall, turned around and quickly left the harbor.

'This is the end.'

It wasn't running away, but the intention to stake everything and settle things with Chagall.

'Don't worry, Master.'

Ethella's eyes, having realized her mission, burned powerfully with righteous will unlike before.

The chase that continued through the night ended in the morning.

At the peak of the Ardos Mountains, Ethella knelt neatly and fell into meditation.

The refreshing birdsong suddenly disappeared, and an tremendous aura of evil was felt.

Slowly opening her eyes, Chagall was climbing up with heat shimmer rippling even larger than the night.

"You're mistaken about something."

As Chagall spoke, the translucent face of a demon intermittently overlapped his face.

"Isn't this the method you used before? If you hide in a place without people, you'll just die."

"I went to countless places fleeing from you."

The times she had fallen endlessly downward to fight evil flashed by like a panorama.

"Beast cages, brothels, sewers... My soul's light was extinguished, my body became filthy. The Ethella you first chased no longer exists."

Chagall's brow furrowed.

"What are you talking about?"

"Though I was disgusted with myself for being mad with revenge and losing my righteous will, I understand now."

Ethella smiled.

"The true meaning of what my master said. Sacrifice. The courage to embrace evil."

"I'll kill you."

Ethella was no longer afraid.

"You don't need to chase me anymore. Because..."

She only smiled gently and spread her arms toward Chagall, who was striding closer.

"I forgive you."

"Uaaaaa!"

Chagall knocked Ethella down.

"Shut up! Stop spouting nonsense! Die!"

Even as fists swung wildly, Ethella didn't move a muscle.

'It's sacrifice, Master.'

Before her eyes as she awaited life's end, she saw Chagall, half-transformed into a demon.

"Why! What are you! What are you supposed to be!"

Tia.

Half out of his mind, he bit Ethella's nape and made bestial sounds.

"Grrr! Grrr!"

Ethella embraced Chagall's back with both arms as he moved with animalistic urges.

'I won't let go.'

By transgressing good, evil reached its maximum.

As good and evil amplified each other, creating extreme emotions humans couldn't reach...

"Uaaaaa!"

Finally the scenery changed horrifically and they began falling into hell in their living flesh.

The final moment in reality.

Looking up at the sky over Chagall's shoulder, Ethella parted her dry lips.

'Ahh...'

She saw a sky filled with clouds of fire.

'The other side world.'

It was the soul purification system where emotions that couldn't be processed in reality flowed.
