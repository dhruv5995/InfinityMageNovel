Dark Organization (2)

The administrator said:

"Administrators belong to the non-players. We're just part of the upper system. Therefore, emotions are also part of the system. If you gain the upper hand in Crime Dice, you can persuade me."

If human hearts were probability, then an administrator's heart was the probability of law.

"However, the method of persuasion varies depending on the administrator's personality. There are various personalities like stubbornness, coldness, positivity, criticism, and so on. In my case, I belong to the positive type. If your Crime Dice number is high, I will be persuaded."

"Do we only need to win once?"

"Even with the same personality, there are degrees of difference. In my case, one defeat causes a 40 percent emotional change. If it exceeds 100 percent, persuasion is complete."

Simply put, three consecutive wins would end it.

'Shirone will at least achieve a draw. Then the remaining two people are the key.'

Shirone asked:

"What parts are we responsible for?"

"When attempting persuasion, 1 million Crime Points are deducted each time you roll the dice. Also... your Crime Points are continuously decreasing right now."

Iruki confirmed:

"About 10,000 points have been lost. It seems like a device to prevent hiding strategies on the inner track."

"That's part of it, but this is a place where criminals cannot enter. Still, the reason I'm accommodating you is because Crime Points are being deducted. If your Crime Points reach zero, my personality will change to hostile and I'll call security."

The administrator added:

"This rule applies to all administrators under the royal castle in Melchidus. If you encounter security on the outer track, your Crime Points will be deducted."

Shirone asked:

"The Crime Points needed for persuasion, that is, the points for rolling dice, would be different for each administrator, right?"

"Yes. The points deducted vary according to personality and the degree of that personality."

Shirone turned his head:

"Got it. Let's go out for now."

After leading his friends out of the System Affairs Department, Shirone suddenly stopped walking.

"I think I get it."

"What?"

"The hidden mission. I think I have a grasp of how the bribery program works."

Shirone raised his index finger:

"You change the administrator's emotions with dice. This is called persuasion. And each administrator requires different Crime Points. What bothered me was this: Why did Curtis say we need at least 50 million? At first, I thought it was a condition for acquiring some item, but it wasn't."

Eden said:

"It's persuasion. We need to persuade someone in the government office. The cost for that is at least 50 million."

"Right. The rules would be different depending on what personality they have. Anyway, if we win in one go, 50 million would be enough, but if the match drags on, we'll need more points."

Nade stuck out his tongue:

"Even if it's 5 consecutive wins, it's 10 million per dice roll, right? Can we really do this?"

Iruki said:

"On the other hand, since the units are large, there's no confusion. We don't have enough points to try twice anyway. Plus, if it's a dice match, dice enhancement is absolutely necessary. Let's first find out the types and prices of items. Points are being deducted even while we're doing this."

Since time was literally points, they quickened their pace toward the shopping corner.

Vending machines were scattered about, and there were three shops run by non-players.

Eden examined a vending machine:

"Looks like we can change the type of Crime Dice here. Shape, color, material, pips. There's a variety of designs, and some have gems embedded in the pips. But they're pretty. Crystal dice with sapphires."

"How much?"

Eden read directly:

"3.7 million points. Additionally, persuasion not possible."

"Al-right! Let's work, work."

As Nade turned toward the shop without looking back, Eden chuckled:

"Who asked you to buy it?"

When they entered the first shop, a man in his mid-thirties wearing glasses greeted them:

"This is a dice enhancement specialty item shop."

Instead of goods, cards were displayed, and items related to dice pips were abundant.

"Unexpectedly many."

"That's how it is for beginner items. To buy advanced items, you need to be at least in the 100s sector."

"Don't they sell beginner items there?"

"That's right. We have business ethics here too, and it wouldn't be right to do business that way."

Though that was the setting, everyone knew it was to prevent fast-tracking.

"In the end, we have to buy something. Since we can't purchase them later." Muttering this, Nade examined the items:

"Grit. Full Sprint. Runner's High."

The effects were +1 to one die face, +1 to all dice faces, and +3 to one die face respectively.

"Full Sprint looks good. Actually, one-time items have a high probability of failure due to the nature of dice. In that sense, Full Sprint is more stable than Runner's High."

The price of 800,000 points was also reasonable.

Shirone asked:

"Do you only sell dice enhancement items here?"

"Yes. The shopping corner is broadly classified into four categories. Items that enhance dice faces. Items that enhance dice calculations. Items unrelated to dice, usually movement items are mainstream. And finally, vending machines."

Besides what Nade had examined, there were quite a few more items, but Shirone wasn't interested.

"Can I persuade you?"

"Haha! Of course. If you persuade me, I'll give you a 5 percent discount on item prices. My personality is critical, and I compete with odd and even numbers. It's 100,000 points per attempt."

The discount rate seemed to vary according to the administrator's personality, but it wasn't the answer Shirone wanted to hear.

"No, not that."

"Huh?"

"The dark organization. I heard there's a bribery program to enter Melchidus's core."

The friends who had been scattered examining items simultaneously turned to look at Shirone and the merchant.

The merchant, who had been deep in thought for a moment, burst into a chuckle and shrugged his shoulders:

"Well, would I really know? To find out, you'd have to persuade me."

Shirone was certain:

'Persuasion applies to all cases. It's not just used to discount items.'

The merchant said:

"I have a critical disposition, and the rule is odd and even numbers. 20 million points per attempt."

The group's eyes widened:

"What? 20 million points?"

They had to bet 20 million points in a situation where they couldn't even be sure if the information existed.

'So this is how it was. Not just anyone can open the back door. At this rate, we'll lose points quickly. Curtis probably obtained information this way too.'

The result was bankruptcy.

As the group hesitated, the man pointed at Eden and said:

"But if it's that cute young lady, I'll give a 10 million point discount. Want to try persuading me?"

Shirone blinked:

'Wait a minute. This...'

"Think carefully. You won't get another chance like this. To persuade me with just this many points..."

"We'll come back next time."

While the merchant stared blankly, Shirone pushed his friends' backs toward the exit.

"What? Why? We just found a hint."

"I was mistaken."

Shirone said:

"I thought it was just a system. The persuasion thing. But that merchant has emotions just like us. It's just that those emotional changes are governed by law."

"So?"

"Let's go to the next shop."

When they entered the shop next door, a woman with a tattoo on her right arm greeted them:

"Welcome. This is a calculation enhancement item shop."

When young people entered, younger than Melchidus's average age, she smiled:

"Hi! Having fun?" 

Shirone said:

"Oh, so-so."

Inside the glass shelves were items that could change dice calculation symbols.

'Bonanza. Death Gross. Accountant's Mistake.'

They weren't as reliable as Pyeongsin, but they were items that could shine depending on usage.

After checking the prices, Shirone asked:

"We're looking for a bribery program to enter Melchidus. Can I persuade you?"

"Oh my."

She didn't even think about it:

"If it's something like that, you should definitely come to me. My personality is hot-tempered, the rule is designated numbers. 20 million points per attempt."

Shirone said cheekily:

"That's too expensive, so I'll have to think about it. Instead, I'd like to become lovers with you."

"Hey, hey."

His friends looked at him with bewildered eyes, but the woman grinned as if amused:

"Hoho, you want to seduce me? Well, there are bigger discounts between lovers. So... you?"

Shirone clenched his fist:

'Got it.'

If it was just mechanical emotion, it would be advantageous to increase the ratio of reason for the match.

"Well. I think all three of us like you. The points needed per attempt would probably be different too, right?"

"Of course. Let me see. If you want to become lovers with me, you blond-haired one are 1 million points."

She pointed at Shirone and recited the points for Nade, Iruki, and Eden in order:

"You're 4 million. This one is 2 million. This kid is 3 million."

Nade raised his hand:

"Wait a minute. Shirone aside, how can I be more expensive than Iruki? Eden is even a girl, but 3 million makes sense?"

"Hoho! So what? Preferences are free."

Even Shirone hadn't expected this.

While Nade was speechless, Iruki stepped forward:

"I'll do it."

Since Shirone had to make the final match, they needed to take turns before then.

"I love you. Please accept my heart."

The merchant nodded:

"I'll use 2 dice. I'll say four numbers from 2 to 12, and whichever side it lands on wins. If it doesn't land on either, it's a loss. If both are the same, it's a draw and we go one more time. Of course, points are deducted."

Iruki pursed his lips:

"You go first."

Since they'd have to pay an extra 2 million points in case of a draw, it was better to avoid the same numbers.

"Hmm. I'll choose 4, 7, 9, 12."

"Then I'll take 3, 5, 8, 11."

The scenery disappeared and a phase space for dice judgment spread out vastly.

'No hand techniques are possible here.'

Except for Shirone.

"Here I go."

When Iruki made his move, the merchant also threw her dice high without waiting.

The merchant's dice showed 6, Iruki's showed 3.

"I won."

As Iruki's victory was confirmed, the phase space disappeared and they returned to the shop's scenery.

A blush appeared on the merchant's face:

"My heart was pounding from the moment I first saw you. Alright, let's date."

A terrifyingly quick attitude change.

'If you win at dice, everything is possible. On the inner track, dice really are king.'

She said with a happy face:

"Where shall we go on our date? I can close the shop."

Since points were decreasing even at this moment, they couldn't afford to waste time.

"Before that, let me ask you something. We should at least know each other's names and ages, right?"

"Oh my, you're right. I'm Kara. I'm twenty-eight years old. I'm older than you, but... we're lovers now."

Iruki's eyes turned cold:

'Once persuasion succeeds, this level of information is provided. Well, it wasn't an easy match.'

Iruki was rather lucky considering the probability of a draw was higher.

"Good, then let me ask one more thing. About that bribery program you mentioned earlier..."

Kara's face hardened.

"I'm not asking you to tell me about it. I just want to know if you definitely have the information."

"Haa. What should I do... really."

As the group watched, she who had been sighing suddenly raised her head:

"Yeah."

And said clearly:

"I have it, the information."
