The End of History (2)

Kido spoke.

"Stand back."

Having consumed Havitz's legs, he could understand.

'Everything is a game to this guy.' However.

"From now on, this isn't a game."

He was truly intent on destroying something. In a sense, he had thrown his heart into this world.

"Uorin."

The coal-black human raised both eyes. The chaos that always swirled in his pupils had been compressed and compressed again, hardening into the most extreme malice.

'Satan has no Vanishing. But perhaps such things are no longer necessary.'

Whether others perceived it or not, Havitz would accomplish what he desired.

"Huuuuu."

As Havitz exhaled, his body caught fire and the surrounding landscape began to burn away.

The terrible scenery of the reverse world, made of biological entrails and refuse, unfolded.

Kido blocked Uorin's path.

'He burned the thin skin.'

Havitz's fire had gone out, but embers continued burning in the cracks of his flesh.

"I'll give you a chance."

Though no such thing actually remained.

"Hand over Uorin. Then I'll kill you without pain. I guarantee this time it's not a lie."

"It's really going to hurt."

Those who heard these words imagined the maximum amount of pain that could be inflicted upon them.

Kido said.

"I can't do that."

Since Havitz's chaos had been broken, humanity now had means to oppose Satan.

'He'll need History Search. Probably to find that child from before.'

To find the Wizard of Super Gap, future sight was necessary.

'The only empty place among all the timelines depicting human possibilities. That's where he is.'

The Wizard.

"Choose."

Every time Havitz took a step, the shape of his soles transformed into entrails.

The thought of grotesqueness was brief - Kido made his decision and charged forward, kicking off the ground.

'Vanishing.'

Though it was difficult to maintain the state of chaos, Havitz had now lost his ability.

'I'll kill you in one blow.'

When Kido's spear struck Havitz's neck hard, the steel spear burned up with a crack.

'What?'

The spear tip that had turned to charcoal continued burning like a wick, reaching his hands.

"Aaaaah!"

Vanishing was released, and Kido, feeling tremendous pain, trembled and stepped back.

Uorin's face turned pale.

"Ki, Kido."

Tears welled up in Kido's eyes as he examined his hands that had hardened black.

'This is terrible.'

It wasn't a bearable level.

But the frightening thing about pain is that it doesn't consider the position of the person suffering it.

"Heuuuu!"

His hardened hands hurt so much he couldn't move them, but Kido forced strength into them.

"Aaaaah!" With a crack, the shell peeled off and raw flesh emerged.

"Haak! Haak!"

Even that wasn't bearable pain.

"Damn... Satan."

As everyone felt the severity of the situation, Havitz spread both arms.

As fire ignited on his body again, even the landscape of the reverse world burned black.

"This world."

Kyaaaaaaaa!

Amid the screams of the dead, Havitz spoke.

"Will turn to ash."

The supreme law of evil, Death Field.

Where his hands touched, where his feet tread, only death would exist.

"Only pain."

This was the world that evil had defined in Omega's final moment.

Tess's eyes welled with tears.

"A, Amy."

In the place where the incarnation of Dainichinyorai had disappeared, not even a single strand of hair remained.

Complete annihilation, emptiness.

"...There would have been no pain." Two streaks of dried blood remained on Nane's cheeks as he raised his head.

"Since this world is pain, it is proper to close it. I will save all beings and achieve rebirth in paradise."

Evil leads to pain, and pain leads to emptiness.

"I am."

A brilliance bright as the sun spread from behind Nane's back.

"Buddha."

A true Buddha.

By abandoning Amy, the only attachment remaining in this world, he had become perfect.

And Sirone.

"What?..."

Rising with eyes that weren't sane, he shouted toward the sun.

"You bastard!"

In the silence where no one could speak, the man's voice echoed widely.

"Aaaaah!"

Sirone, flying alone, rushed toward Nane at maximum speed.

"I'll kill you!"

In his eyes full of murderous intent and rough speech, the former Yahweh could not be found.

"Sermon."

Nane scolded.

"Half."

The moment the red sword flew like lightning and pierced his solar plexus, Sirone's eyes widened.

"Huk!"

Even as he fell with all strength leaving his body, he still didn't understand.

'...Why?'

Why isn't Miracle Stream activating?

"Sirone."

Nane spoke with a calm expression.

"You are not Yahweh."

When there's no one in this world you love more than yourself, how could you love anything else?

Sirone finally realized, but had no desire whatsoever to regain his composure.

"Don't make me laugh."

His expression twisted venomously again, and Immortal Function shattered Buddha's sermon.

'Yahweh or whatever.'

Nane, I will definitely kill you.

"Sirone! Don't!"

Miro shouted, but Sirone, already consumed by hatred, charged again.

"Photon Cannon."

Thousands of light spheres were born and all fired toward one location.

"Foolish sentient being." Looking at the flashes converging like a vanishing point in perspective, Nane took the stance of half-palm.

"Free yourself from attachment."

Kwarrrrrrung!

A tremendous explosion shook the atmosphere.

"What's that sound?"

Shiina, hiding in a cave, looked outside again. Two types of magic were crossing in the sky bright as midday.

Sphere and sword.

Being a mage herself, she realized there could be no magic greater than that in the world.

"...Shiina."

At the suddenly heard voice, she turned to see Quan approaching with a disheveled expression.

"I... will protect."

Hearing those words, Shiina no longer hesitated and smiled.

"It's okay. It has nothing to do with us. Sleep a little more. You must be tired."

Shiina pushed Quan away.

Of course, she couldn't help but feel uneasy about the world she turned her back on, but taking Quan, who couldn't do anything, to join the battlefield would be crazy.

"Shiina, protect."

Quan was stubborn.

No matter how much she pushed, he kept returning to the cave entrance, making Shiina feel something was strange.

"What's wrong?"

The next moment, she felt space trembling, and a completely different landscape from the forest was born.

It was some underground dungeon.

'Space magic.'

And at a difficulty level that only first-class mages could handle.

"Success."

What emerged from there, speaking lightly, was something in human form.

'Human... no, is it even a living thing?' A body white as if covered in plaster, muscular but without even genitals.

"Unnamed."

Shiina's voice trembled.

The feeling was different from when she saw him in heaven, but rather it seemed like even his remaining biological tendencies had been removed.

"Haha, found you."

With such a bright smile, Unnamed approached Quan.

"Don't come!"

Shiina activated Spirit Zone, but bad memories suddenly came to mind.

'This guy steals opponents' abilities.' No, more precisely it would be learning, but she didn't want to call it that.

"It's okay. I'm not interested in you." Unnamed's gaze was only on Quan.

"I don't need to beat everyone."

Because defeating those of high rank meant beating all beings in between.

"This time will be different."

Unnamed's arms stretched like meteor paint and transformed into two swords.

Seeing Quan show no reaction even in the face of his opponent's hostility, Unnamed tilted his head.

"Strange."

According to his past life's memories, this should be an unreachably high realm.

"There's nothing to learn."

Dull and clumsy, he seemed more suited for the very bottom of combat rankings.

"You've become incompetent."

Shiina's pride was hurt more than Quan's.

"Don't speak carelessly! This person sacrificed himself to protect me!"

"Protect?"

Unnamed recalled when his mother gave birth to him.

"...I don't understand. That guy has a higher rank, so why would he sacrifice for you?"

'We can't communicate.'

But she couldn't fight either.

Considering that Armin barely blocked him with Stop magic, even running away was impossible.

"Anyway, since I'm here, I'll at least break you."

When Unnamed's sword turned toward Shiina, she felt chilling murderous intent.

'I can't win.'

As assumption became reality, Quan showed his first reaction and moved.

"I... will protect." Unnamed said.

"Move aside. I don't need to kill you. With skills worse than the guys I just killed..."

"Shiina... protect. I will..."

Though the fool's stubbornness made him frown, Unnamed changed his mind.

"Fine."

A revenge match against the one who had pushed him outside the hierarchy of life would be acceptable.

"Your intelligence seems to have dropped too, but watch carefully. This is the realm that has surpassed your former self."

Unnamed, spreading ether waves, disappeared, and white swords appeared sporadically from all directions.

"How's this?"

The voice heard from the left.

"I've completely dominated space. Now where will you run?"

Continued from the right.

Quan, who had been watching the scene with a blank expression, limped forward.

"No! If you go in carelessly...!"

When Shiina grabbed his shoulder, Quan turned his head.

"Shiina."

The corners of his mouth turned up broadly.

"Smile."

Unnamed's twin swords rotated in spiral form, pressuring the space where the two stood.

Pierrot the Clown.

Idiot.

The next moment, Quan, somehow in a different space, swung his sword out of habit.

No blood was spilled, but Unnamed's neck, standing behind him, had been severed.

As Shiina trembled, the head rolling on the floor opened its mouth.

"H, how? There was nowhere to escape." "That's..."

Chuckling briefly, Quan said.

"Your assumption."

'Really?'

Unnamed blinked.

'I don't understand.'

What exactly did that guy... see?

In the final moment that came again, the only memory Unnamed could recall was just one.

A being born from the union of Garas, whose everything was reproduction, and Adio, the angel of achievement.

'Mom, I'm sorry. This time too...'

I couldn't be first.

No one told him it was okay.

Perhaps that hurt more than becoming the best, Unnamed thought.

Shiina, who had been stunned by the brief battle, hurriedly came to her senses and ran over.

"Quan! Are you okay?"

"Hehe."

Quan seemed to be in a good mood.

"Protected. Shiina."

At that moment she realized.

'He's not an idiot.'

What realm.

She had thought she was protecting him after he became disabled, but it was actually she who had been protected.

"Thank you."

In a situation where the world was perishing moment by moment, Shiina was the safest person.

'Together until the end.'

With that thought, she took hold of Quan's body to lead him when applause came from the forest.

Clap! Clap! Clap!

Where Shiina hurriedly looked, a woman with elven characteristics was smiling.

"That was a moving battle. Really good material."

"Who are you?"

If she was an elf, she should be on humanity's side, but madness flickered in her eyes.

"Well. How should I introduce myself?" A masculine way of speaking?

"Illuminati."

The body's name was Erin, and the name of the one aboard her brain was Crown.

"By the way, that thing..."

Crown pointed at Quan and asked.

"It seems like there's no occupant?"
