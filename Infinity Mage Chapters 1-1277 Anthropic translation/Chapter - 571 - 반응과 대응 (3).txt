[571] Reaction and Response (3)

A closed training ground in the southwest of Alpheas Magic School.

Though it was a training ground no longer in use, the battlefield's boundaries were based on 30 years ago, so it wasn't a position that would result in disqualification for going out of bounds.

When Iruki stopped at the place where conventional training equipment was piled up, his team members arrived one by one.

Amy, who had been chasing Frings, walked over fuming.

"Ugh! He really slips away like an eel! Did he oil up his body or something?"

Iruki greeted her and said.

"Good play. Thanks to you, I was able to stop Eden."

"I went after catching the three of clubs. If we're at a disadvantage, we could face a counterattack."

Dorothy said.

"I collected the Scrambles that Iruki gave up."

Though they had no means of communication, they moved organically just by looking at coordinates and current situations.

"So Dorothy collected four cards?"

"Yeah. I'm holding the three of clubs, and the last card hasn't been opened yet."

"Try it now. We need to see our hand first and set up a strategy."

Dorothy took out a random card and said.

"Open."

Black came out, completing the 4th stage strongest hand ○●○● (Democracy).

"Nice. This should work. Dorothy's status will show as ⓡⓡ●ⓡ on other participants' master cards. If she matched the strongest hand with three random cards, we can actively call a Kong."

Sabina said.

"The problem is Eden. She seems to be trying to create Infinity."

"That's why I called this meeting. From the next round, give up on Scrambles and find Eden. When you find her, signal me her location with Shining."

"Will that be okay? That's too much of a loss for us."

"I know. But let's endure just today. Since Dorothy got Democracy, if we call Kong, we can at least crush one of the enemies. That way we won't lose too much in terms of card count. Besides, Shirone probably also has Democracy..."

Iruki looked around.

"Hasn't Shirone arrived yet?"

"No. Based on coordinates, she seems to be on the complete opposite side from here."

"But she learned the hideout's terrain in advance. If she casts spatial movement..."

Just then, footsteps were heard from outside the training ground.

Everyone turned around on guard, and Shirone appeared looking exhausted.

"Shirone? What happened to you?"

Her face was red with blood flowing from her forehead, and her body was covered in dirt and dust.

Shirone silently passed by her friends and collapsed onto the pile of equipment, breathing heavily.

"I'm late, right? Sorry."

"What happened? Did you fall off a cliff or something?"

"Cayden... won't call Kong."

When everyone couldn't understand at once and looked at each other, Shirone raised her head with hollow eyes.

"I think he's crazy. He kept fighting for 6 hours straight."

Her friends made bewildered expressions.

"You kept fighting this whole time? What about Scrambles?"

"I steadily collected them. But somehow he found me right away."

"That's Hercy's ability."

Sona's location tracking could be called the strongest among the series.

"So... how was it facing him? You seem injured."

Shirone touched her forehead.

"At first I was flustered because he was a swordsman. But after that, it seemed manageable. Of course, it was just a probing battle, so I'd need to fight more to know for sure."

Since Cayden using a sword was something that couldn't be seen even in graduation exams, they couldn't get a feel for it just from Shirone's words.

'Fermi's group are all professional-level mages. If he only fought with a sword, there's room to observe a bit more.'

Shirone raised her head.

'By the way, how did it go? What about Eden?'

Shirone was also guessing the enemies' strategy.

"I stopped her. And I need to keep stopping her. First, Dorothy completed Democracy."

Iruki explained the operation.

"Eden currently has Saint (○○). If she only has three cards on our side, we'll definitely win unless it's a perfect hand. But don't call Kong. She won't fight anyway."

If she broke her non-violence principle, her powerful defensive omnipotence would actually weaken.

"From the next round, their movements will become complex. Conversely, Hercy will figure out our positions."

Dorothy said.

"When we're gathered like now, even Hercy can't know exactly. But we can't assemble every round, right?"

Iruki nodded and looked at Shirone.

"In that sense... how did that turn out?"

Shirone took out cards.

"Currently holding three cards. I chose all random, and my current hand is three of clubs (○●○)."

Nade raised the corner of his mouth.

"How many times did you roll?"

"Three times at the end. Black came out twice in a row."

This confirmed it.

Supernatural Observation could turn confirmed cards back to random.

"Come to think of it, 1 second is quite a long time."

"Right. Originally, judgment happens in 0 seconds. Anyway, if we can just collect Scrambles, we can hold the strongest hand."

Sabina asked.

"What are you talking about? Is something wrong with your heads?"

Nade patted Sabina's shoulder.

"I'll tell you later. We still have the advantage. Let's block Eden's solo run today and prepare countermeasures from tomorrow."

Iruki said.

"Since we can't collect Scrambles, Shirone and Dorothy should actively call Kong."

"Got it."

Lulu's voice was heard.

"10 minutes remaining until 4th Scramble summon."

"Headmaster, this is Pandora."

After knocking on the headmaster's office door and waiting, Alpheas' voice was heard.

"Come in."

In the headmaster's office were Alpheas, Vice-Principal Olivia, and even Collie, the senior class head teacher.

Though it was unusual, Pandora guessed it was related to the students' mass absence today.

It was also not unrelated to the reason she had come.

"Thank you for making time for this meeting."

"Of course. So, what did you want to see me about?"

Pandora took a deep breath and approached the desk.

"I request a complete review of the fairness of senior class evaluation."

The teachers fell silent.

Pandora, who majored in fragrance magic.

She was once a promising student who competed for 1st and 2nd place with Boyle in the advanced class, but with the addition of Shirone's team and Dante's team, and strong senior class competitors, she was currently struggling at 23rd place.

"I have no complaints about my low ranking. It's because I'm inadequate. But... how can this be?"

Her question was valid.

"I spent vacation time doing research. I also collected data from the kingdom's five prestigious schools."

"Pandora..."

Olivia tried to speak but closed her mouth.

"Do you know what the numbers showed? The average ability of Alpheas Magic School's senior class is 3.8 times higher than the average of the other five prestigious schools. The average is 3.8 times higher."

The faculty was already aware of this situation.

"This is unreasonable. Alpheas Magic School is facing much more difficult competition than even the Royal Magic School, which has 20 graduation slots. Either increase the slots, or..."

"It's not that simple a problem."

Alpheas said.

"Slots aren't decided simply. Every school has years when talented students cluster together."

"You know it too, Headmaster!"

Pandora's voice rose.

"This isn't just this year's issue. Fermi's team, Frings, Anchal, Eden and others all have skills that should have made them professionals already. Last year, Anchal didn't even unseal his Demon Eyes. He has no intention of graduating."

Collie said.

"But that's for individuals to decide."

"Of course. But I believe it's definitely problematic that such skilled individuals accumulate in the senior class year after year. If you investigate Alpheas Magic School's records, the graduation rate of those positioned in the upper ranks has been below 30 percent for the past 7 years. It's definitely an abnormal figure, meaning the circulation structure of graduate production has collapsed for whatever reason."

"That's certainly true."

Alpheas said.

"But Pandora, there's a logical leap in your argument. You shouldn't combine the low graduation rate of top-ranked students with this year's high average skill of graduates. The reason this year's senior class has high ability is rather because the new students' skills are formidable. The new students who were on the same level as you."

Indeed, sophistry wouldn't work.

Weren't Dante, Amy, and Iruki actually competing in the upper ranks?

Realizing this, tears welled up in Pandora's eyes.

"Honestly, it's too... difficult."

The teachers' eyes became pitying.

"You might think I'm being cowardly, but I really don't feel it's fair. Is wanting at least the same competition as other prestigious schools such a wrong thought? At this rate, no one will want to enroll in Alpheas Magic School."

Though that was also a matter of individual judgment, Olivia kept her mouth shut again.

A student who had steadily followed the elite course, competing for top positions from the lower classes.

Senior class rank 23 would be the first such number she'd ever received in her life.

"Alright, Pandora. I'll bring it up in the faculty meeting..."

"There is a problem."

Alpheas cut off Olivia's words.

"Always, everywhere, there are problems."

Pandora raised her glistening eyes.

"Alpheas Magic School might be wrong. But Pandora, that wouldn't be the problem with your graduation. Because all senior students are competing under the same problem. In my opinion, your problem is just one thing."

Alpheas sighed and said.

"In the year you're taking graduation exams, there are simply too many who are superior to you."

True competition begins the moment you accept that reality isn't fair.

That's why everyone except Pandora was fighting in silence.

"It may be cruel words, but you know it too, don't you? The world that grants what you want just because you ask for it exists only in dreams. Organizations cannot move for individuals. It's not that they won't, but that they can't. Therefore, to enforce what you want, you must choose. Either fight the school representing the majority, or fight yourself. Other than that, any resolution is nothing but delusion. You understand, right? You're a mage too."

"...Yes."

She had to overcome it.

Because someone was overcoming it and racing toward success.

Looking at the sorrow-stricken Pandora, Collie thought.

'A disgustingly cruel, damn competitive system.'

"Thank you for your time. I'll be going."

After her dejected farewell, Pandora left, and the three teachers finally revealed their true thoughts.

"Pandora has a point too."

Olivia voiced her opinion first.

"I also think this year's senior class is too overheated."

Collie, who was in charge of the senior class, said.

"It's because skilled students kept accumulating. Though we say it's by individual judgment, honestly, at this point even that's ambiguous. What about the faculty meeting?"

"They know but are turning a blind eye. They wouldn't want to drag it to the surface."

"Estas."

Alpheas said.

"Professional-level skilled individuals are staying at school targeting Estas. The skilled ones accumulated layer by layer, and it exploded this year. With major newcomers flocking in droves. It's natural for Pandora to feel deprived."

Olivia sighed.

"Knowing that, you spoke so cruelly? You could have consoled her before sending her off."

"If there was room for improvement, I would have done so long ago. But you know, right? The faculty won't change their minds."

Olivia sighed.

"The labyrinth has already emerged into the world. We need to close Estas now."

"I was thinking about it. But the students were one step faster."

Collie said.

"Scramble Royale has begun. The 12 people I reported during the day are currently participating."

"Those troublemakers."

Alpheas stood up and looked out the window.

"What would happen if we stopped Scramble Royale?"

"It would get quite complicated. The faculty would definitely side with the students and the school would close. This is a matter involving world politics. Kashan, theYor Cult, Tormia Kingdom, especially since it's almost certain that Anchal is a spy from the Jincheon Empire, the right answer is to stay quiet and close it next year."

Collie rubbed his throbbing head.

"Fermi's Ardino family is also a problem. Anyway, we have to endure until graduation exams."

Alpheas let out a hollow laugh.

"It'll be the greatest graduation exam in school history."

Olivia added.

"Or, it'll be the worst graduation exam."
