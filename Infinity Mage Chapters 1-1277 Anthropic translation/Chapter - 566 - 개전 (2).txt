[566] Declaration of War (2)

"Aha, this is it, right?"

Amy lifted her chin and boldly accepted everyone's gazes, then sat down next to Shirone and crossed her legs.

"Alright, from now on I'm joining the Scramble Royale too. Rankings, whatever—I'll make sure you can't even attend school anymore."

"That's what I was hoping for."

Hercy responded with a smile, but she couldn't hide her bitter expression.

"Amy..."

Seeing Shirone's dazed expression, Amy gritted her teeth and whispered.

"Let's settle this after it's over. Be prepared."

"Yeah, I understand."

Just having Amy here made it feel like he had gained a thousand troops.

With all 12 participants gathered, Hercy took out the Judge.

"First, let's decide on the competition format."

The rules would activate the moment they were input into the Judge, so it was important to properly lead the preliminary discussions.

"First, I propose 'Black and White' as the competition."

Nade nodded.

"No objections. But shouldn't we start with explanations first? From the side that proposed it."

Though it was a question to gauge what the opponent knew, Hercy readily agreed.

"The Judge was last used 7 years ago. The result of that Scramble Royale was the dissolution of the underground research group 'Strange Taste'. What I know is that it involves finding tiles summoned at specific times and places to engage in battles."

If what Nade knew wasn't different, then their information quality was essentially equal.

"Then let's begin. Who will activate it?"

Nade extended his hand as if passing the responsibility.

"Alright, then..."

When Hercy pressed the Judge's button, the side with the pen opened and a sheet of paper emerged from the bottom.

Taking out the paper and pen, Hercy wrote "Black and White" and showed it to Shirone's team.

"Confirmed."

When the paper was inserted into the Judge's slot, it made a mechanical sound as it was sucked back into the device, and a hemispherical lens popped out.

Light shot toward the ceiling from there, and a small human woman like a fairy appeared, spinning as she floated up.

"Hello, students of Alpheas Magic School. I'm Lulu, and I'll be introducing the rules of the Black and White game."

The Scramble Royale had a 30-year history, and though it used Heaven's technology, the technical skills of their distant predecessors were admirable.

"Black and White uses the territory within Alpheas Magic School as the battlefield, and spaces not input into the Judge will not be judged. Unless specially agreed upon, the competition period is 7 days, with battle time from noon to midnight each day."

Lulu raised her palm as if holding a tray.

"When the Black and White game begins, light spheres equal to the number of participants are generated. These are called Scrambles."

A small sphere of light appeared above her palm.

'A luminous body. It'll be easy to find at night.'

While everyone was thinking similar thoughts, the explanation continued.

"When you collect a Scramble, the light disappears and transforms into a card."

When Lulu grasped the light sphere, it transformed into a card densely engraved with henna on both sides.

"This is called a card in its pure state, or a Pure Card. The important point here is that the pure state only lasts 1 second based on the photon system."

'Based on the photon system...'

If there was room for relativity theory to be applied, it wasn't absolute time.

"The pure state is important because you can only choose black or white in this state. Let me show you a demonstration. White."

The henna disappeared from one side of the card, transforming into a clean white surface.

"This is a White Card. Also, I've suspended time for the demonstration, but in reality you must make your decision within 1 second, so please be careful."

Iruki asked.

"Do you have to speak the keyword out loud? When choosing black or white, I mean."

Lulu's liveliness disappeared.

"...An answerable question has been input. You do not necessarily need to speak the keywords for black and white out loud. However, you must be in the Spirit Zone."

Like the Cube, it was a system that detected mental changes in the cardholder.

"I'll continue the explanation. If 1 second passes in the pure state, it's considered forfeiting the choice between black and white, and it automatically converts to a Random Card."

Lulu's white card turned gray with a black 'R' engraved in the center.

"This is a Random Card. In this state, if you input the keyword 'Open', you can obtain either a black or white card. Let me demonstrate. Open."

The 'R' disappeared and it changed to a card painted black.

"This covers the basics of handling Scrambles. Additionally, multiple acquisitions are possible in the Scramble state, but once you enter the pure state, transfer becomes impossible."

Shirone's mind raced.

'One person can collect multiple Scrambles, but they become bound at that point. So what needs to be considered are the variables of black versus white, or random.'

Amy asked.

"How is the impossibility of transfer verified? Depending on the situation, you could exploit loopholes in the rules, right?"

"...An answerable question has been input. What I'll explain now is the 'Master Card'."

A card with an LCD-like form and red border appeared in Lulu's hand.

"Master Cards are given to all participants at the start of the war. It's a card that can provide various information such as Scramble coordinates, other participants' card status, and your own card status."

If other participants' collected cards were recorded, deception would be impossible.

"Please manage it well. If you lose or destroy your Master Card, your participation qualification will be revoked."

Anchal asked.

"You could steal and destroy them too, right?"

Lulu immediately replied.

"That's possible. Scrambles are summoned once every 2 hours when the game starts, and you collect them to create high-ranking hands for battles."

Shirone began calculating.

'Summoned once every 2 hours. With 12 participants, the total number of Scrambles summoned per day would be 72.'

Theoretically, one person could collect all 72 Scrambles.

Of course, that would only be possible if the other 11 were scarecrows.

"Now that I've introduced the general rules, I'll tell you about the priority of hands you need to collect. The maximum number of cards you can collect in Black and White is 6 per person. If you collect a Scramble while already possessing 6 cards, it will be automatically destroyed."

Iruki nodded.

'You can't gain cards, but you can prevent opponents from collecting them, so it's not a meaningless rule.'

Lulu continued her explanation.

"Strong and weak hands are divided according to black and white combinations. Hands outside the predetermined combinations are meaningless, so you must think carefully when collecting. Let me show you meaningful hand combinations starting from Level 1."

One black and one white card appeared on her left and right.

"There are two meaningful hands at Level 1: Black and White."

When Lulu pointed to the air with her right hand, a diagram made of symbols appeared.

(Evil) < (Good).

"This is the Level 1 priority order, with black called Evil and white called Good."

'Good has priority? Are ranks divided from Level 1?'

It was unexpected that superiority was determined from the start.

"Moving to Level 2. There are three possible combinations, but only two meaningful ones."

(Saint) < (Heretic).

Everyone's eyes changed.

'It's reversed.'

While white hands had the advantage at Level 1, black hands had the advantage at Level 2.

Since the ○● combination was a meaningless hand, simply grabbing white at Level 1 wasn't the complete solution.

'Realistically, when 12 initial Scrambles appear, we should assume all 12 people get one each. Even if you gain advantage with white hands, you'll be pushed back by black hands after 2 hours.'

"Level 3 combinations."

●●● (Apostasy) < ○○○ (Religion) < ●○● (Republic) < ○●○ (Three Estates).

There were 4 meaningful combinations, with Three Estates being the strongest at Level 3.

'Another reversal.'

Three Estates was a hand that could only be formed if you had grabbed two white cards at Level 2—the Saint.

"Level 4."

○○○○ (Pope) < ●●●● (Demon) < ○○●● (Monarchy) < ●●○○ (Dictator) < ○●○● (Democracy).

'Hmm, an equal ratio of white and black is the strongest at Level 4.'

From now on, there were too many variables to immediately analyze advantages and disadvantages.

"Level 5."

●○●○● (Revolution) < ○○●○○ (Emperor) < ●●○●○ (Conviction) < ●●●●● (Demon King) < ○○○○○ (Holy Mother).

Shirone realized a major change.

'Mixed black and white combinations are weak, while single patterns have risen to the top. But to create Demon King or Holy Mother, you'd have to accept considerable losses from Level 1.'

He could guess the personality of whoever created the Black and White game.

"Finally, Level 6."

○●○●○● (Chaos) < ○●○○●○ (Amplification) < ●○●●○● (Annihilation) < ●●●●●● (Void Kalpa) < ○○○○○○ (Infinity).

Again, single patterns were strongest, but just creating a meaningful combination up to Level 6 with Random Cards would be considered success.

"These 23 types of hands are meaningful combinations, and all other hands have no meaning. Meaningless hands are called 'Dead Hands'."

'Even if you're holding dead hands, up to Level 5 you could potentially create meaningful combinations by acquiring the next Scramble.'

Lulu erased the diagram as she spoke.

"You've all memorized this clearly, right? Then I'll erase it."

Everyone was absorbed in their own thoughts, so no one answered.

"Now that you know the hands, I'll explain the battle method. When you collect Scrambles, they're displayed on each person's Master Card as one of these symbols: White (○), Black (●), or Random (ⓡ). Random Cards naturally can't have their hands confirmed, and even if the holder has opened them, they still display as random on other participants' Master Cards."

"So they become hidden cards."

"Correct. If you want to check an opponent's hidden cards, you can call Kang."

"Kang?"

"It means to challenge to a match. I'll summon Lily for demonstration."

When an identically twin-like woman appeared, Lulu showed her Master Card.

"My hand recorded on my Master Card is White 2, Black 1—Three Estates. Also, checking Lily's combination..."

Lily's status showed ●●ⓡ symbols floating above.

"Black 2, Random 1—a combination that can't be seen. It might actually be in random state, or Lily might have already opened it. Let's try Kang. Lily, Kang."

Lily's Master Card glowed red.

"When an opponent calls Kang, the receiver must choose either Kang or Pao within 1 second based on the photon system. Kang means accepting the match, while Pao means refusing. If you can't decide between Kang and Pao within that 1 second, all cards you possess are destroyed. This is called 'Fold'."

Iruki asked.

"If Kang is called when the opponent hasn't opened their Random Card, does the Random Card automatically open? Or is it not included in the combination?"

Lulu's liveliness disappeared again.

"I cannot answer that question."

'Hmm, so we have to figure out the applications ourselves in actual combat.'

"First, the case where Lily accepts Kang. Lily."

When Lily called Kang, the random display disappeared and showed ●○● (Republic) combination.

"I have Three Estates, Lily has Republic. So I win. At that point, all of Lily's cards are folded."

Lily's status was erased from Lulu's Master Card.

'If you lose, all cards are destroyed. You have to be careful about accepting Kang.'

"The range for calling Kang matches the Spirit Zone area. Also..."

Lulu continued with a meaningful smile.

"The person who loses in a Kang battle cannot inflict any harm on the winner until the next Scramble summoning."

"What?"

For the first time, the atmosphere among the 12 participants listening to the rules became restless.
