Final Chapter (3)

How many regressions had he repeated? Shirone no longer counted the numbers.

As the attempts piled up, the rising numbers seemed to prove his impossibility.

'I'll save Amy.'

That was his one purpose.

He repeated it mechanically, trying every method imaginable to humanity...

"Nane!"

He twisted history.

"Na. Mu. Gwan. Se. Eum."

And Nane, with spirit and effort rivaling Yahweh, inevitably fixed the future.

'I'll save her!'

Shirone charged.

"Amy!"

Shirone raged.

"You bastard!"

Shirone pleaded.

"Please, please stop! That's enough!"

And to all those Shirones, Nane shed tears of blood and said:

"Namuguanseum."

"Ahhhhh?!"

Like his spine had been severed, Yahweh collapsed.

From there again, probably after as many attempts as all the previous repetitions combined.

"Amy. Amy."

Shirone trudged toward Nane, who was 100 kilometers away.

"Amyyy."

Whether flying or crawling, distance and time no longer mattered.

"Namuguanseum."

"Stop!"

Shirone covered his ears.

"Namuguanseum."

"Stop it! I said stop!"

Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum. Namuguanseum.

"Ahhhhh...!"

The memories of countless regressions tangled together, making it impossible to distinguish present from past.

"Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!"

Was he fighting Nane now, or fleeing from him?

"No! Stop!"

Was Amy really alive, or was he going insane?

I...

The only thing he realized was:

'I can't escape from Nane.'

No matter how he changed history, he was still in Buddha's palm.

Namuguanseum.

"Stop! Shut up, you bastard!"

Shirone, lying on the ground screaming, trembled with unbearable rage.

"Try blocking this!"

He began strangling himself with both hands.

"Grrgh!"

As if his death could be some revenge against Nane.

"Grrk. Grrk."

Shirone didn't release his grip.

'Ah...'

In the distant end of his fading consciousness, Shirone suddenly remembered something.

Vanguard's astrologer.

A great enemy will ensnare you. And eventually... you'll strangle yourself to death.

'It was true.'

And the fact that the prophecy was fulfilled meant he was still under God's dominion.

Shirone died feeling bitter defeat.

Another regression.

"Hmm."

Sitting under a tree, Shirone bit into an apple and fell into thought.

'It's an unwinnable game.'

Suicide hadn't cleared his mind, but realizing a new fact was progress.

'The fact that even my death was realized means I can't change the future by any method.'

What was the problem?

'We use the same tachyon. But Nane always prevails. The reason is...'

The difficulty of implementation was different.

'I try to save, Nane kills. Even with just Amy, the dimension is different...'

That meta carried the weight of all humanity.

'The direction of thinking is different. It doesn't matter at first, but as history progresses, this slight difference in thinking creates an enormous gap.'

That's why he lost.

'Then what? Should I create variables by killing someone like Nane? But then my thinking might lean toward Nane's side.'

Love and hate were separated by a hair's breadth.

At that moment, one person flashed through Shirone's mind.

'Ms. Minerva.'

He seemed to hear her voice, telling him not to save her no matter what happened.

'No.'

He couldn't do that.

'It's not about whether I can or can't. How can I say such a thing? To die for the world...'

I would gladly do so.

Until nightfall, Shirone agonized and reached a conclusion.

"Let's at least talk."

There was no other way, and his mind was exhausted enough to need something to rely on.

'To the time after I made the bet with her.'

The scenery changed with a new delusion, and Shirone found Minerva in the Ivory Tower.

"Ms. Minerva?"

Opening the door, she was looking out the window and hastily wiped away tears.

"Hm? What is it, at this hour?"

She tried to smile brightly, but couldn't completely hide the sadness in her eyes.

'She was crying like this.'

It was probably a real event, but it was Shirone's first time experiencing it.

"I came from the future."

"Huh?"

"It's a long explanation, but Ms. Minerva told me to come if things got difficult. So I came."

Since this was before the world's secrets were revealed, Minerva was bewildered.

"Pff. Are you hitting on me right now?"

"About your wish."

Despite the lack of context, her expression became serious because it was in her heart.

"I haven't said it yet, but I know. Absolutely don't save yourself, right?"

Minerva pulled out a chair.

"Sit."

From then until dawn, Shirone explained the events that would befall humanity.

Minerva asked a few questions but remained silent most of the time.

"I understand."

She exhaled deeply.

"The perfection of the law. To break Nane's thinking, we need variables on our side too. That variable is me."

"Yes. B-but! I don't really want such sacrifice. Actually, I was so frustrated..."

Minerva embraced Shirone.

"Thank you for giving me the chance."

"Hehe, don't worry. I have an idea. From now on, go back to the past and meet me before Nane became Buddha. And tell me this."

"What should I..."

"To meet Nane someday. Buddha is compassionate, so he won't turn away. I'm not bragging, but I'm probably the person who's lived the most miserable life in the world."

Shirone knew through Omega too.

"Nane will come to love me, not Amy. So at Omega's final moment, it'll be me who dies. History might twist quite a bit, but it works because it's a change that even the Twelve Apostles can't stop. Besides, we can't be picky about scraps."

Of all the attempts so far, this was the strategy with the highest probability, and Shirone trembled.

'No, it's more than that.'

It really seemed like it would work.

"But."

Shirone turned his gaze away.

"Ms. Minerva's life disappears. For a human life to be consumed like this..."

"Hehe."

Minerva turned his head back toward her.

"I know you're sincere. This is for humanity. Amy must live so everyone can live. And this is the only way I can atone. No, honestly speaking..."

To change Shirone's mind, she revealed her most hidden secret.

"I want to end it now."

The shame of her body that could never be washed away, and the disasters she had caused in her rage.

"Let's do it. Leave it to me."

Shirone shed tears silently.

Day 4 of battle.

Grrrrrrrr.

The clash between two beings always mentioned when asking who was strongest reached its climax.

The earth, carved into a radius of 120 kilometers and depth of 3 kilometers, had become a colosseum itself.

"Hehehe."

Ymir, with 2 of his 6 arms broken, let out a tired laugh.

"You're really strong, aren't you?"

Uriel's holy light body had also weakened.

"I don't think I've had such a strong enemy. Do angels also have awakenings? No."

Ymir's gaze turned to Ikael.

"Can't you retreat? You've been fighting while protecting that archangel."

Sadness filled Ikael's eyes.

'Uriel.'

Among the archangels of Paradise, the one with overwhelming force who was always dependable.

But for that very reason, she was also the angel who felt the most difficult and distant of all in Paradise.

'Uriel, do you...'

Did the heart exist even before angels believed they could have hearts?

To ignore that fact, Uriel had desperately maintained neutrality.

Perhaps even now.

"Come at me."

Only repeating her essence.

Four Laws of Light.

Ragnarok.

White lightning falling from the sky wrapped around Uriel's body with the concept of destruction.

Ymir tore off his broken arms and took a stance to receive it with his remaining four arms.

"Kekeke! Magnificent."

Rumble!

With the thunder of lightning, a flash of light pierced through the earth.

Shirone met Minerva from the past.

Proof was easy.

"At that time, you..."

He listed traumas that only she knew, ones that could never be erased.

Past Minerva was convinced.

"What should I do?"

Time passed, and after several trials and errors, Nane eventually...

"Minerva."

Shed tears at her fate.

Of course, the law doesn't make someone a witch or make someone unhappy.

But someone becomes a witch, and someone becomes unhappy - that's the world's logic.

'Passing around pain. If not her, someone else would have been sacrificed.'

What was truly infuriating was the world itself.

'To understand emptiness.'

Through Minerva, Nane understood love and became Buddha again.

In that changed history:

'I can do it.'

For the first time, Shirone felt certain.

'I've completely twisted history. Now Nane's obsession is with Ms. Minerva, not Amy.'

He had deceived God.

But the price to pay was the life of one person who didn't need to die.

'Damn it!'

Shirone bit his lip.

'There's no choice! If it were just for Amy, I wouldn't do this! The future of all humanity is at stake.'

Endless self-rationalization.

'Ms. Minerva wants this too. Amy can live. I finally did it! Amy! Amy!'

Before Omega's final moment, Nane was surely trying to kill Minerva.

Tears welled up in Shirone's eyes.

'I did it!'

Through his blurred vision, he saw Amy fighting enemies, unaware of history's change.

She hadn't met Nane or realized the Fire Avatar, but what did that matter?

'Amy.'

Diane's words came to mind.

You're not going to retrieve a lost object. You're going to meet a living person.

I wish you would respect what Amy thought, what Amy chose.

He wanted to ignore it.

But what about Amy's heart, changed by Minerva's sacrifice?

'There's no choice.'

If time and space alignment was everything, then where was the heart contained?

'There's no other way!'

A lost object.

"Huuuh..."

Not going to retrieve an object.

"Na. Mu..."

Nane was trying to erase Minerva's body as the avatar of Dainichi Nyorai.

If he could just hold on for a few more seconds, Fermi would connect this moment to the future, but...

"Ahhhhh."

Before that irreversible eternity, Shirone finally had no choice but to make a decision.

"Sorry, Amy."

Before Nane's next incantation could continue, Shirone returned this moment to delusion.

The space of infinite nothingness.

"Huuu. Huuuu."

In the loneliest darkness, Shirone's sobbing echoed mournfully.

Day 5 of battle.

"Grrr!"

Lanctin, fighting desperately in the Arctic, played his guitar with a pale face.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

The number of Anticells had risen beyond millions, billions, trillions, to astronomical units.

They covered the planet with gray organic matter, even stacking layers to increase thickness.

Lanctin suddenly realized:

'I can't do this anymore.'

Four Gates - controlling the crowd as one and inscribing the code of death into all of them.

Surely the natural enemy of Cell Buster, but Lanctin's body was human after all.

Sizzle!

His guitar-playing fingers were each shortened by one joint.

Even in the pain of nerves being directly scraped, the reason he wouldn't stop playing:

'Don't mock me.'

If he gave up even this, he'd truly become worthless.

'I'm a guitarist!'

He could feel Lynn's voice trembling as she sang while coughing up blood.

'Isn't this enough?'

Having lasted five days against this enormous enemy, he wouldn't be criticized.

But there was no longer humanity left to blame him.

"Hehe."

Was he fighting illusions?

Perhaps more than anyone, he wanted to belong among people?

Lynn's song cut off.

'She's reached her limit.'

The Anticells with astronomical mass began descending, overcoming the Four Gates.

'Why live like this?'

People said that man became insane from guilt over losing his daughter.

'Daughter, daddy...'

When your mother left home, when you, so precious, left my side forever.

'Honestly speaking...'

I felt a little relieved?

Because I no longer had responsibilities, because now I could do art as I pleased.

'Yes, daddy...'

Something people could never understand.

"I'm such trash!"

With his five completely split fingers, Lanctin roughly plucked the steel strings.

"Huuuuu!"

As the Anticells were pushed back by the guitar waves, Lynn began singing with fierce eyes.

'Daughter. Honey.'

Bloody tears flowed from Lanctin's eyes.

'I'm sorry. I abandoned you both. I couldn't take responsibility. But I just can't give up.'

'I shouldn't have picked up this damn guitar from the start. But still, I love it so much...'

Even if life becomes a complete mess.

"I want to do it."

Lanctin cried out with a distorted face.

"I want to play guitar!"

Divine Transcendence.

Before his already blunted fingers could touch the strings, the instrument began playing itself.

Sizzle! Sizzle!

Tremendous waves pushed back the Anticells, and the planet's gray surface swelled like a balloon.

48 hours until the promised seven days.

Nane, Amy, Minerva.

"Hahaha!"

Shirone was going insane.

Anyone who kept repeating something impossible would become a madman.

"Kill! Kill!"

Following his evil-possessed voice, Dainichi Nyorai's avatar gently pressed its palms together.

And caught between them was:

'Minerva.'

No, it was Amy.

"Hehehe!"

During his countless obsessive charges at Nane, Amy and Minerva hadn't separated.

Sometimes she looked like Amy, sometimes like Minerva...

"Who are you!"

Now the two women's faces overlapped.

"Huuuu."

Sadness welled up again.

'Yes, I'm going insane. Knowing I'm going insane while going insane is proof.'

He thought it was the manifestation of desire.

If only he had sacrificed Minerva, if everything had ended that way.

'No!'

His only remaining sanity refused.

"Shirone."

Kneeling and weeping, Shirone looked up at Nane's voice.

"Free yourself from obsession."

Buddha's eyes were resolute and compassionate.

Day 7 of battle.

The altar that had served as a windbreak had completely turned to dust.

"Execute the humans! Kill! Kill!"

The demons closed their encirclement from all sides, expressing targetless rage.

"Hah. Hah."

Looking at the approaching demons, Shura and Fuuma knelt side by side.

"This is as far as we go."

Lasting seven days after Omega closed was miraculous in itself.

Fuuma said:

"I've lived long enough, but dying is still annoying. What about you? Do you feel relieved knowing the world's secret?"

"The world's secret?"

Shura scoffed.

"Hmph! Who knows until they've seen it?"

"I suppose."

Lost in thought with a heavy expression, Fuuma bared his shark teeth.

"Shall we go see?"

If an immortal's end was merely death, that would be too sad.

"Hehe."

Following Shura's laughter, both simultaneously charged into the demon horde.

CRASH!

A powerful shockwave reached where the Iron Pole stood.

Around them lay the corpses of countless demons who had broken through the perimeter.

At the center sat a white-haired old woman who looked over 100 years old.

'This is bad.'

Uorin realized time was running out.

'I can't hold on anymore, Shirone. You don't have many chances left.'

Hit by time waves, her body and mind had weakened, but she didn't feel entirely bad about it.

'When did I last experience aging?'

She had desperately maintained her youth. Now that this had happened, her obsessions and regrets felt infinitely lighter.

"Hehe."

A plant-like peaceful life wasn't bad either.

'I'm paying the price. It's the only thing I can do for this world.'

What remained in her heart was:

"Kido."

In the distance, she saw a hunchbacked goblin walking over after defeating demons.

He was wrinkled all over, with a white beard beneath his green chin.

"I defeated them. They won't come for a while."

They had aged together.

Seeing herself as Kido must see her made her feel a little embarrassed.

"Don't look at me."

Understanding, Kido nodded and sat at a distance, but Uorin said:

"What? Come here."

As the weakened goblin sat beside her, Uorin rested her head on his shoulder.

The battlefield was quiet after the great explosion.

"Kido."

Uorin asked:

"Am I hideous?"

With a calm expression, Kido quietly answered:

"...Beautiful."

Another time wave rushed in, and their bodies began withering like corpses.

"Kido."

Uorin said:

"Don't go anywhere now. Stay by my side."

"Alright."

They had finally come to be together, but now only separation awaited them.

'I feel like I heard words like this before, but the memory is so faint I can't recall clearly. But if this really is the end...'

"Uorin."

I should say it now.

"I love you."

The wave of time swept over the Iron Pole.

"Siena!"

Finally a voice burst out audibly.

Crown felt Quan's will taking control beyond mental control to even his body.

'I see. This guy...'

Because he couldn't protect Siena, because of such impossible law.

'Breaking the system's symmetry.'

The totality of abilities that exploit that gap to make the impossible possible.

'Heart.'

The pole of asymmetry.

The hidden code completed by abandoning half of himself overturned the world's axis.

Rumble!

As Terraforce ships fell below the atmosphere, Quan kicked off the ground with all his might.

"Siena."

External gravity spewed in all directions, hurling Quan upward as if drawing him in.

Enemy detected. Intercept.

Terraforce aircraft emerging from ships fired vibration energy beams.

'Fool Pierrot.'

Universal symmetry broke, creating a third direction the law couldn't define.

He disappeared! Report requested!

Behind! Behind!

Vroom!

As aircraft collided and disintegrated in mid-air, Quan landed on the ship.

'Keke.'

Crown was pleased.

'Disappeared?'

No, they couldn't imagine it.

Entering through gaps in the deck, he found purple-metallic corridors.

"Siena..."

"Stop."

Crown seized the vocal cords.

"Don't handle it carelessly. It's mine now. I want to watch until the outcome is decided."

Quan frowned.

"G-get away..."

Exhausted from days of pursuit, Crown now had the upper hand.

"You've done enough, haven't you?"

The mixed expressions unified, and Crown hunched over with a pained face.

"Ow!"

His muscles screamed and he felt severe motion sickness.

"How foolish. If we keep fighting like this, we'll die first. Just rest for a while."

Crown limped forward.

"I'll give it a try too."

Not knowing the real situation, Shirone intuited:

'There are no more chances.'

The thought that this might be the last time restored his sanity from madness.

'But there's no method either.'

Though frustrated, he had tried everything possible to the point of having no regrets.

'Is this defeat?'

He thought that for the first time.

"No."

It wasn't a contest.

"It would be good if everyone could be happy."

Having already received more than enough chances for humanity, now it was time to give back.

'Let's accept it.'

Accept the life Amy chose, accept the fate of fighting Nane.

'Then I won't lose Yahweh's realm.'

Though he was a Hexagon and couldn't meet her in the outer world.

"Amy."

Shirone could shed tears of joy.

"I'm coming to see you."

And the next moment.

Throughout all regressions, the greatest delusion Yahweh ever harbored embraced the entire universe.

'So that everyone in this world can be happy.'

I forgive your sins.

Riding imaginary time, tachyon particles carried his love throughout the universe.

Rumble!

Uriel's Ragnarok pushed Ymir to where the original sanctuary had been.

Finally stopping, they...

"Magnificent."

Uriel knelt heavily below Ymir, who had lost his arms and only had shoulders remaining.

Ikael and Ashur, arriving late, saw the Angel of Destruction's defeat.

"Uriel!"

At Ikael's voice, Uriel's shoulders flinched, then spoke quietly:

"...Finish it."

Though she would perish soon anyway, she couldn't show Ikael her collapse.

"I'll do at least that much."

As Ymir regenerated his arms:

Sizzle! Sizzle!

Intense heavy metal sounds preceded Satan's approaching army.

"Grahhhh!"

Satan at the center was 20 meters tall, with a horse-like elongated face and centipede-like dozens of legs moving on his body.

It hurts! It hurts!

"What is that thing?"

At the appearance that seemed to combine everything that looked strong, Ymir frowned.

"Tsk tsk."

Nane, watching from the sky, clicked his tongue.

"...Pathetic fool."

Anyway, it was karma created by humans.

Of course, when the world closed, Habitz would pay his own price outside.

The human army arrived next.

'Air Press!'

As Gaold, with rolled-back eyes, pressed down the atmosphere, the demon remnants were crushed flat.

In the intense explosion that followed, Ymir's eyes found someone.

"Keke."

"Hyaaaah!"

Ryan, charging with his great sword in his mechanical arm, rammed straight into Ymir.

"Gahahaha!"

Ymir's voice faded into the distance as fast as he flew.

"Dharma teaching."

Nane raised his index finger.

"Myo."

A pink sword twisted like a fish and shot toward Gaold.

'Air Press!'

Thud! Thud! Thud!

The dharma teaching swam around the atmospheric pressure striking everywhere, aiming for Gaold's heart.

Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara.

Annihilation.

Rattle!

Ten million afterimages per second of Avalokitesvara's hands gently struck and deflected the sword.

"You're being annoying."

Miro and Nane's gazes crossed, and Ymir and Ryan glared at each other.

"Gahaha! You're all dead now!"

Realizing the forces were dispersed, Habitz raised his massive body again.

String.

Seventy-two transformations.

Thousands of Son Yujin came running from all directions on clouds, pummeling him.

Grahhhh! It hurts again!

"Whoo."

Son Yujin, having erased his clones, exhaled steam and spun his staff behind him.

In the agreed-upon lull, Nane calmly identified friend and foe.

'Good. Evil. Emptiness.'

Love wasn't visible yet.

Ikael, who had moved away from Air Press's explosions, laid Uriel down.

"Are you okay?"

Did she know?

How faithful he had been to his essence to avoid showing this state.

"Sorry, Uriel. Actually, I..."

"I still don't understand."

Uriel interrupted.

"I'm a being with the concept of destruction. So I thought I had to destroy you. That's why I was born. But I couldn't destroy you. Is that what heart is?"

Is it what humans call love?

"Well, there must be a reason. The reason I didn't annihilate you. If you change something in the future, it will be the continuation of my will. It would be my complete choice, not God's dominion. Maybe that's why I didn't destroy."

"That's not it."

You stubborn archangel.

"The reason you didn't destroy me is..."

Tears of light flowing down Ikael's cheek dropped onto Uriel's chest.

"Because you're kind."

Is that so?

Looking at the sky briefly in thought, Uriel smiled awkwardly.

"Perhaps."

The holy light body grew weaker.

In his fading consciousness, he captured the sparkling Ikael in his eyes.

'Beautiful.'

Whatever it was, the most beautiful in the universe.

'Hehe, yes.'

The fact he realized at the last moment of existence:

'...How could I destroy?'

Right, Kariel?

The archangel's holy light body disappeared.

Ikael frantically embraced the body turning to light, but he was already drifting up to the sky beyond her arms.

"Ahhh?!"

Ikael hit the ground.

"Uriel!"

Another archangel had departed.

Nothing had changed.

Shirone's mind, racing through the original history, was filled only with love.

'I'm going.'

Because now he could see Amy.

"Nane!"

Arriving at Omega's final moment, he charged at Buddha with all his might.

He couldn't prevent Amy's death.

'If that's your choice...'

Tears at the corners of Shirone's eyes were swept back by the wind.

'I'll also fight according to your will.'

Dainichi Nyorai's avatar, repeated countless times, began pressing its palms together.

"Na..."

Amy was there.

'...mu...'

If he had love for all humanity, he wouldn't lose Yahweh's realm.

'One last time.'

He wanted to see her face.

"Shirone!"

It was such an impossible voice that Shirone didn't want to turn around.

But his entire consciousness made him turn his head, and there was...

"Huh?"

Amy, the Fire Avatar, was there.

"Huh?"

Without time to understand anything, Shirone looked at the one in Dainichi Nyorai's center.

It was Miracle Minerva.

"H-how?"

Was he still insane?

Was he unable to let go of his attachments, confusing Amy and Minerva?

As if denying such doubts, Minerva knelt as a child.

Dainichi Nyorai's palms gradually closed.

"Na. Mu."

She, facing Shirone, smiled with such pretty eyes and said:

"Gwan. Se. Eum. (I take refuge in Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.)"

Palms together.

And annihilation.

Seeing the bloody tears from Nane's eyes, Shirone quickly surveyed his surroundings.

'It worked.'

For reasons unknown, an event that had never occurred in eternal regressions.

He felt spacetime vibrations.

'We're separating.'

Through the Iron Pole, the spatial coordinates were the same, but they would fall into a universe with different temporal coordinates.

"Fermi! Quickly!"

Beep! Beep!

Specific history detected! Synchronization rate 100%!

In the planet's depths, the recorder Richard's eyes flashed frantically.

'Found it!'

The event Shirone caused was deposited in Apocalypse and inherited by final recorder Richard.

Information transmission.

And that signal headed to the sanctuary through information mage Chong Yi.

Fermi saw it.

"It's here!"

A butterfly made of light becoming a flash, circling at the sky's peak.

'Got it!'

Depreciation Deal.

Time Vibration.

Upon implementation, Fermi, having swallowed the chip, instantly reached the realm.

'Maximum power...'

Time bomb!

Though time's barrier was intangible, Fermi clearly heard chain explosions.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Time walls kept breaking, and past and future between them were defined as present.

"Wow?!"

In the desolate ruins, grass and trees grew, and all human civilization - artificial structures, roads, facilities - began spreading throughout the world again.

And within that civilization, humans who had suffered the Great Earth Annihilation Wave were also appearing.

"Huh?"

Dante in Delta blinked.

'What?'

He had definitely died.

"Dante?"

Lilia beside him also looked around strangely.

"What happened?"

Going to the window and looking out, the landscape was changing at tremendous speed with successive time waves.

Into humanity's brilliant and diverse world.

"...I don't know either."

Shirone.

Yahweh's emotion, like being contained in the first time, remained in his heart.

1 second. 1 second. 1 second. 1 second.

Chain time waves kept sending intermediate history to the present.

Nade trembled all over.

"Huh?!"

New information was accumulating in real-time over existing information.

'Shirone left.'

Accumulation.

'Did Shirone leave?'

Another accumulation.

'No, Shirone is...'

Where Nade turned his head, a very familiar figure flickered.

"He was next to me?"

With spacetime coordinates completely merged, Shirone arrived at the present.

"Shirone!"

Nade embraced him, and Iruki and Dorothy high-fived in the distance.

"Huh?"

Shirone was bewildered.

With time waves still incoming, everything was mixed, but one thing was certain.

'Everything's returning to normal.'

Civilization, precious people, more humanity - everything was finding its place.

"Where's Amy?"

She wasn't visible.

Since it was truly a miraculous event, Shirone felt sudden anxiety.

Had something gone wrong?

"Amy!"

The moment he made eye contact with Fermi, he smiled and pointed somewhere with his index finger.

"Ah..."

Shirone's body trembled.

In that place, in that form he had seen in the past, the Fire Avatar was appearing.

'She's coming.'

Like magic.

'She's coming.'

Born before Shirone's eyes, transcending eternal time's repetitions.

"Whew."

Fermi exhaled.

"One problem solved."

Since past and future were fully integrated, the current time was still Omega 999.

'I've reversed it to before the end.'

And now if events were changed, it would be humanity's future, not God's calculation.

"Well then..."

Fermi turned with a bitter expression.

"Shall we begin?"

Since they were in the same spacetime, Shirone's current abilities were transferred to Fermi.

To face tachyon rather than Time Vibration, he had to release the ability.

'Normally three months. But...'

Fermi charged.

'There's always a way.'

He just had to eliminate the ability called Depreciation Deal from the world.

"Fermi!"

Seriel, having received most of the time waves, finally realized and followed him.

"That idiot!"

Why hadn't she thought of it?

"You promised! You said there was no future where you die!"

Looking back, it was true.

"You..."

There was no future where he died.

"But you had to die!"

Because it was a decision made by his own heart, not the world's law.

Fermi was calm.

'Mother.'

Yorga, who left for the world's sake.

'How do I look?'

The son who always missed his mother had one wish in his heart:

'Did I make the right decision?'

To see her face smiling proudly from the sky's end.

And now, Fermi saw it.

"Ah..."

Tears he had never shed poured down his cheeks.

"I did it, Mother!"

With his sobbing voice, enormous catharsis filled his heart.

Depreciation Deal, annihilated.

"Dharma teaching."

Nane spoke to the charging Fermi.

"Bi."

Seeing a dagger rushing at terrible speed, Fermi cast magic.

'Air Shield!'

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Countless air layers were pierced, followed by intense atmospheric explosion.

"Grk!"

"Fermi!"

Following Fermi's body flying like paper, Seriel changed direction.

His chest was covered in blood from sharp air cuts.

"Fermi! Fermi!"

With healing magic, wounds gradually closed and bleeding stopped.

"What a fuss."

Fermi spoke with a pained expression.

"Just skin tears. The organs aren't damaged, so it's fine. Anyway, this transfers the magic."

Seriel was dazed.

"Why didn't you die? No, that's not it. So, you planned this from the start?"

"I told you I wouldn't die. Did you think I'd charge without thinking of a way to survive?"

Fermi winked.

"I'm not as stupid as Shirone."

"Haha."

How annoying.

'But still...'

Seriel embraced Fermi to her chest.

"I'm so glad."

The time waves finally ended.

"Hah."

Shirone's final past and humanity's future integrated into the present remained in his mind.

It was like all humanity casting Time Vibration, but...

"Shirone."

Two people handling imaginary time with tachyon knew all the erased history.

"Nane."

Yahweh and Buddha faced each other.

"You finally came."

"Give up now. We came this far through many people's sacrifices. I'll protect this world."

"...That's right."

Nane looked around the battlefield.

Humanity was still divided, fighting with their good and the evil they created.

"But how many will there be? 100? 1,000? Shirone, to me they're just sleeping files. When they wake up, they might all hate you. For being mere..."

Puppets dancing to signals.

"I don't care. Of course you're probably right, and that's why you want to close the world, but the right to choose is ours. If they say they'll stay, they stay."

"Yes. Law and heart - no room for compromise."

Nane's eyes darkened.

"Now the situation is equal. Just you and me. Let's make the decision in our perfect states."

Shirone nodded.

And the next moment, Yahweh and Buddha slowly began rising into the sky.

It was the final confrontation between emptiness and love.

Iron Pole.

While everything else had returned to its place, only the Iron Pole's space remained empty.

Desolate wind blew, leaving only a goblin and a woman's corpse leaning on his shoulder.

Hum. Hum. Hum. Hum.

Like string vibrations decreasing from outside, the time waves here still operated.

Time accelerated.

Crack. Crack.

The goblin and woman's bodies, drying like mummies, twisted and began intertwining.

10 years, 20 years...

In rapidly progressing time, they gradually shrank into the earth.

Another 30 years, 40 years...

A small sprout emerged and began growing as if inflated with wind.

50 years, 60 years, 100 years passed.

At the Iron Pole's location stood one magnificent, lush tree.

It wasn't language.

Kido.

Hm?

Plant communication method, Small World Creation.

Seems like we've reincarnated as a tree. We'll have to stay here a while longer.

Haha. Indeed.

What's that reaction? Don't you like being one with me?

No. I just remembered something. I'd forgotten, but it suddenly came back.

What?

When I was a goblin, I met an astrologer. Know what my future was? He said I'd wither from love, twist and rot.

Haha! He saw the future.

But thinking about it now, that astrologer was completely wrong.

Why? It's somewhat similar.

Well... that's true.

Fruits began forming on the tree of life one by one.

I'm not thirsty anymore.
