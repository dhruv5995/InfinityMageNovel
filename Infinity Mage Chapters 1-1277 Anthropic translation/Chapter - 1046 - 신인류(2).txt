New Humanity (2)

A straight groove was carved long through the city of Raviet, like the track left by a rolling snowball.

RUMBLE!

With a roar like thunder, Son Yu-jeong flew from one end of the city to the other.

"Ugh, damn..."

Stuck between the ground and wall, she glared forward with her neck bent at a vertical angle.

A red-skinned demon was walking toward her with hands clasped behind his back.

"This is so annoying I could go crazy."

The image of Sirone reflected in Son Yu-jeong's Hwaan Geumjeong seemed like a massive truth bearing down on her.

"Kiiiii!"

As she twisted her face and made threats, Sirone clicked his tongue disapprovingly.

"Still haven't come to your senses?"

"What did I even do wrong that you're making such a fuss! I said I'd live doing whatever I want, so why are you all going crazy! I came to save my friend! I don't care about hell!"

"That's exactly the problem. You keep making trouble without thinking, so the situation keeps getting worse."

"What? You do whatever you want too! Nane too, Ymir too - everyone lives wielding their own power, so why can't I!"

"Whatever I want, huh."

Sirone stopped walking and looked down at Son Yu-jeong.

"It's not that you don't know what you should do, is it?"

"You have no convictions. You're a bomb. A bomb that neither good nor evil wants to keep by their side."

Her power was enough to destroy a grand duke's city.

"Because you lack convictions, you're easily swayed by others' emotions. Whether they try to use you or control you, your surroundings will always be crawling with such people."

Richera, who had been silent during the overwhelming battle, suddenly showed a guilty expression.

"So you're different? What makes Buddha special? Even now I have a Geumgo-a around my neck, so what's with the lecture?"

"You might think that way now. Help me purify hell. If you can understand through that process, you too will gain true freedom."

Son Yu-jeong flared up defiantly.

"I'm already free! I can do anything! If only it weren't for this damn golden band!"

As her hostility revived and her body glowed red hot, Sirone sighed.

He understood Nane's feelings.

'If someone with malicious intent tries to use her, she could cause a fatal variable. I need to restrain her now.'

Son Yu-jeong bared her teeth.

"Graaah!"

Her attack preparations were complete, but she wondered what more she could do against Yahweh.

'What should I do? He really uses strange techniques. Honestly, this is more annoying than sermons.'

In her eyes flashing with Hwaan Geumjeong, there was something watching from the darkness.

'Hm?'

The 7th Corps generals Ilgak and Baeksa.

Ilgak was a goblin with a long horn protruding, and Baeksa was a woman with white snake skin.

'So those were the ones giving me that strange feeling. If they're going to fight, then fight - why do they keep watching?'

After confirming even Sirone's troubled expression, she discovered hope for escape.

'Right. I was wondering why Yahweh was disguised as a demon - he's being conscious of them.'

According to Richera, the being demons hated most was Yahweh.

'I can't recite the Geumgo incantation.'

Having made her decision, she got up from her fallen position and flew toward the sky.

"Hahaha! Try to catch me!"

Even as the sound rapidly faded, Sirone's expression didn't change.

"Come back."

The moment he spoke quietly, smoke shooting out like a meteor crashed to the ground with a thud.

Then a scream was heard.

"Aaaah! You bastard! Damn Yahweh!"

Son Yu-jeong, caught by the Geumgo incantation around her neck, was rolling on the ground clutching the golden band.

"What's wrong? Why, why?"

Richera, who had been rolling on the ground with her, felt chills seeing Son Yu-jeong's face.

All the blood vessels in her face were visible, and massive shock was swirling in her two eyes.

Sirone muttered again.

"Son Yu-jeong."

"Aaaah! Stop! Stop it!"

His voice was small, but to her ears it felt like the entire world was vibrating.

"I'll give you 3 seconds. 1 second, 2 seconds..."

"Eeeek!"

The moment the pain disappeared, Son Yu-jeong sprang up and flew toward Sirone.

Landing roughly with a thud, she knelt on one knee and exhaled.

"Haa! Haa!"

In her eyes, she saw Sirone's true form having reached 100 percent Yahweh.

"...You weren't trying to hide it?"

Sirone made a bitter expression.

"Right. You ruined everything. You always do. So now you need to help me."

"I don't want to... I said I don't want to!"

When Sirone narrowed his eyes, Son Yu-jeong flinched.

"Hii-ik!"

The Geumgo-a was a sacred tool that responded to the sincere heart of one who had reached deep enlightenment.

Even without Buddhist law, every word Sirone spoke was itself law.

Son Yu-jeong held out her hand.

"Don't! I clearly told you not to!"

"Then listen. Will you restrain your indulgent behavior from now on and help with my work?"

Sirone surveyed the dark corners.

'They've already left.'

When he revealed 100 percent Yahweh, an unconcealment killing intent had dominated the city.

But the presence disappeared instantly.

'Not stopping me immediately must be a strategic decision. Still, if I can keep Son Yu-jeong by my side, it's not a loss.'

The moment his thoughts ended, Son Yu-jeong with rolled-back eyes charged at terrifying speed.

"Fine! Let's die together!"

"Tsk."

With just one click of his tongue, the Geumgo-a tightened, and her eyes widened greatly.

"Heo-ok!"

Throwing away even her Yeoui staff while grasping her neck, she fell backward to the ground.

"Aaaah! I hate it! I absolutely hate it! Take this off! Just kill me instead!"

As Sirone watched impassively, she finally couldn't endure it and shed tears.

"Alright. I was wrong. I'll do whatever you tell me, so please stop."

On one hand, he felt pity.

"You're different from Harbitz. You're still a blank slate that hasn't decided anything. That's probably what makes Nane feel sorry for you too."

If it had been determined there was no hope for rehabilitation, Nane would have already eliminated her.

"Stand up."

As Son Yu-jeong stood with a tearful face and wiped her tears, Sirone admonished her.

"For now, do what I tell you to do. Try to understand for yourself why you must do it."

"I understand. So what should I do now? Should I take off my clothes first?"

As Son Yu-jeong made motions to undress, Sirone raised one eyebrow and said,

"You little..."

"Hii-ik!"

Feeling the Geumgo-a tighten, she was startled and knelt on one knee.

"Where did you learn only bad things? You have a mission to change the flow of the times. Don't turn away from responsibility."

"Tch!"

Son Yu-jeong looked dejected.

'I was going to take it easy after being thoroughly cooked. Yahweh is just the same as all those Buddha middle-pieces after all.'

Sirone turned his head toward Magritt's castle.

'It must have already reached Lete's ears. Then the most dangerous thing is the old castle.'

Behind him, he could feel Son Yu-jeong sneaking away like a cat.

"Son Yu-jeong."

Her shoulders jerked.

"Yes? Yes!"

"Come to that castle you see there. Don't fight the demons and follow me directly."

"I understand."

As Son Yu-jeong answered glumly, Sirone spread his light wings and flew up.

'Wait for me, Lian.'

As Sirone flew away with a roar, Richera hanging from Son Yu-jeong's waist shouted.

"Now's the chance! Quickly run away! Since it's come to this, let's go to hell's fire and purify me... Aaaah!"

As if venting all the humiliation she'd suffered, Son Yu-jeong grabbed his nose and twisted it.

Blood flowed down.

"If I could run away, I would have run long ago. He'd kill me even from 108,000 li away."

In the end... she had been caught.

"Aaaah! So annoying! I'm really going to go crazy!"

Behind Son Yu-jeong who leaped toward the sky, a cloud of smoke trailed long like a tail.

Meanwhile, the command barracks was in a state where one couldn't even breathe due to the killing intent emanating from the 7th Corps.

Execution Commander Itaka asked back.

"Yufi was Yahweh?"

Her pupils completely absorbed light, and her hair writhed like a living thing.

Ilgak said.

"I saw it myself. We wondered why there was no news after entering the city - turns out he was pulling such tricks."

Moonom glanced at Oris, who sat dazed in the corner.

"But what's the reason? Why would Yahweh bother disguising as a demon to fight intruders?"

"Probably... it's the Grand Duke's orders."

Gimara said.

"Currently, the president of Hwagong Corporation is staying in the city. But the Grand Duke seems to be taking a position of supporting Yahweh."

"Lady Lete?"

Itaka's hair rapidly extended, rushing toward where Magritt's castle was located.

Her eyes widened greatly, and for the first time, she stood up from the executor's desk.

"We pay respects to Hell's Mother."

As everyone turned their heads, Lete appeared, lifting the tent flap of the barracks.

With all of the 7th Corps taking the same posture, Lete first assessed the atmosphere.

"The killing intent is abundant. Is there something that would cause you seven generals to gather and emit such energy?"

Everyone waited for Itaka's response, but she kept her mouth shut, accepting the rudeness.

'The Grand Duke is...'

He seems to be taking a position of supporting Yahweh.

Lete, who had already anticipated the 7th Corps' attitude, spoke with a cold expression.

"Explain. I've already spoken to the Grand Duke before coming, but there will be no more mercy."

'She's serious.'

Gimara trembled, feeling completely different energy from when they met at the castle.

"Fine. I'll have to eliminate the execution commander first."

As Lete raised her hand, hell's fire that purifies all demons blazed hotly.

'Hell's Mother.'

If all demons are born with Satan's characteristics, then Lete returns all demons to their original state.

"Yahweh..."

Before her elbow could even fully extend, Itaka prostrated herself and looked up.

"Yahweh deceived us."

The hell's fire disappeared.

Lian screamed.

"Aaaah!"

Gehenna's chains that burst from his entire body burrowed into his body as if they would devour him.

"Endure it. You chose this. This is the fastest method we can choose."

To bind Gehenna's chains to <Idea> through normal methods would take a full three days.

Therefore, random numbers.

Randomly spinning karma codes and extracting chains until a connection formed.

"Huuuu..."

Realizing that Lian's groaning was subsiding, Magritt purely thrilled.

'Truly an incredible body.'

The pain Lian was enduring would be greater than anything he'd experienced even after falling to hell.

'Humans really are a strange species.'

How could he not hate Sirone, who imposed such unreasonable pain?

'Wait! I'm coming, Sirone!'

Lian's eyes blazed as chains wrapped around his entire body as if devouring him.

This time, he couldn't hold back his scream.

"Aaaah!"

With the sound of sliding metal, the loosened chains burst from Lian's palm.

And climbing up the handle of the great sword he was holding like a twisted rope, they combined information.

Seeing <Idea> glow red hot, Magritt exclaimed.

"It worked!"

An ordinary sword would have melted in less than a second, but <Idea> remained intact.

"It won't break."

That was Ogent's conviction.

Gripping the great sword's handle tightly, he felt blazing fire explosively.

Magritt held out both hands.

"Wait! Not here!"

Before the words finished, <Idea> shot out and crashed into the laboratory wall.

"Whoa!"

Lian's eyes bulged wide, and tremendous energy rushed through the connected chains.

"Hyaaaa!"

The wall that had been glowing like lava completely evaporated, obliterating the underground scenery entirely.

'Incredible purification ability.'

Magritt trembled.

'It works. With this, it's possible. I can purify all authentic negative karma.'

Translated into other words...

'The spirit realm opens.'
