[582] In the Name of God (1)

As the sixth day of Scramble Royale passed well beyond its halfway point, darkness was beginning to fall.

Amy, who had been returning to the hideout after confirming Iruki's assembly signal, stopped in her tracks when she spotted Cayden sitting on a rock.

His body had completely recovered after two days of rest following his injury from Shirone, but his atmosphere was different from before Scramble Royale had begun.

"Cayden."

"Go away."

Cayden spoke without even looking at Amy.

'Cayden has no cards.'

He had participated from the beginning today, but had collected zero cards in Scramble Royale.

This could also be part of Iruki's predicted strategy to concentrate cards on Hersy, but there had been no activity at all for that to be the case.

"You're just going to let me pass?"

"Yeah. I don't care if you try Kang either. It would be annoying though."

Being ignored didn't feel very pleasant.

'What is he thinking about?'

Cayden gazed at the stars floating in the night sky.

"I keep my promises. I'm just waiting for Scramble Royale to end."

He had realized that killing Shirone was impossible in a team battle where card combinations mattered more than force.

"I'll admit I underestimated him. It's my complete defeat. But will the next result be the same?"

If Shirone could identify his opponent's capabilities and find a solution in the shortest time, there was no reason Cayden couldn't do the same.

"Shirone is impressive. The ability to control time. But now I know too. The real match will be when Scramble Royale ends."

"If you do something like that, your life will be over too."

"It's already over."

Cayden looked at the Cross Sword stuck in the ground.

"Maybe this cursed fate began when I abandoned the sword. What's so different about magic? I'll just find something new again."

Amy sighed and walked to face Cayden, leaning her back against a tree.

"Come to think of it, this is the first time we've talked alone in the graduating class."

The Karmis family's Red Eyes and the Cross family's Cross Star were symbolic bloodlines that elevated the Kingdom of Tormia's prestige, regardless of political capabilities.

Even if they were fierce rivals domestically, they often joined hands when confronting other nations.

"I did see you at banquets when we were young."

Cayden recalled those times.

From the perspective of Kaizen Sword School's youngest student, Amy was nothing more than a pathetic girl wandering back alleys with nothing to do.

"Hehe, but to think we'd meet at magic school. Is this also a strange fate?"

"Confess to Maya."

Amy stepped away from the tree and said.

"Someone like you would be fine. If you approach her with sincerity, she might change her mind. Do you really have to vent your anger like this?"

"If I win Maya's love, would that be good for you too?"

Amy frowned.

"Why are you so twisted? When someone speaks with good intentions, can't you just listen favorably?"

"If it sounds unfavorable, then it probably wasn't good words to begin with. Especially words coming from the Karmis family's mouth."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

Cayden gripped the Cross Sword's handle and stood up.

"The Cross family's Cross Star allows one to develop fate-given talents to their absolute limit."

"I know it's amazing."

"Amazing?"

Cayden's lips twisted.

"To put it another way, it means you can't do anything except the talents fate has determined."

"......"

"Right. The Karmis family's Red Eyes. The ability to back up your self-image and immediately correct errors requires effort. But Cross Star requires no effort. You're born to do it. But you know..."

Cayden smiled self-deprecatingly.

"Being able to do something well doesn't mean you're happy. Even if it's something trivial, doing what you want is what brings happiness."

"That's an arrogant thought."

Amy recalled her childhood when she couldn't figure out what she should do.

"Right. Some would call it the complaints of the well-fed."

Cayden stood the Cross Sword vertically.

"At first I thought it was a blessing. Being born different from other Cross Stars. I could become the best at anything I wanted."

That was the Red Cross Star.

"But there's a price to pay. Sacrifice. Do you understand, Karmis?"

Cayden's face contorted.

"If I truly want something, I cannot become the best at it."

He had wanted to become an artist.

"The woman I truly love!"

The pupils disappeared from Cayden's eyes.

"Will never love me back!"

'Killing intent...!'

Amy quickly created distance between them.

"I am fate's bastard child! Born with a cursed destiny to never be happy! So I'll kill him! I'll kill Shirone who stole the woman I love!"

Cayden bent his body like a demon and spread his killing intent.

"Do you know what it feels like to merely be good at something? Do you know the misery of actually being unable to do anything?"

Amy shouted angrily.

"How would I know! You live your own life!"

Cayden's brow furrowed.

"If you're just venting your frustrations, I'd listen all night, but someone who ruins other people's lives has no right to whine!"

"...Move aside. This is your last chance."

"I won't move. There's no need to even reach Shirone. I'll personally punish any unsightly person who meddles in my love life. That's how I live."

"You'll regret challenging a Cross, Karmis."

Blue lightning coiled around the Cross Sword.

"I'll never regret it. If there's something I want to do, I have to do it to feel satisfied. That's what it means to be a Karmis."

Flames of a thousand degrees blazed around Amy.

The gazes of the magic swordsman who could operate both magic and schema simultaneously and the gunner collided...

'Lightning Impact!'

Without hesitation, they charged toward each other.

'Flame Strike!'

Two of the kingdom's most renowned bloodlines clashed head-on.

* * *

The fifth Scramble Royale had been summoned.

While Anchal's retirement was good news for Shirone's team, Amy's absence from the mid-assembly was worrying.

Moreover, Ned's whereabouts remained completely unknown.

With mysterious incidents occurring one after another, no one could gauge which way the scales of victory were tilting.

'I'll do what I can. Let's keep Fisho in check!'

Sabina, tasked with disrupting the allied team's card collection, immediately infiltrated deep into enemy territory.

'What's this?'

She felt an ominous, chilling coldness from all directions.

'It's Frings!'

Since the plan was to avoid him if encountered, Sabina immediately cast teleportation.

"Ugh!"

But the escape route was already completely blocked.

'Enormously vast coldness. Where did he start pushing in from?'

"Got you, Sabina."

Frings appeared, breaking frozen leaves with his face.

Could such malicious emotion really show on a human face?

The moment she saw him, clearly not in his right mind, Sabina cast Shining magic without thinking of anything else.

'Distress signal!'

Three flares that shot into the sky collided with the dome already blocked by ice walls and scattered chaotically.

Within three seconds of spotting Frings, the air had completely frozen.

"Don't worry. I won't make you angry anymore."

Frings had changed his method of satisfying desires.

"I don't care about your emotions anymore. Whether you're displeased or pleased."

Now, to him, humans were nothing more than dolls that screamed when buttons were pressed.

"I'll twist you apart."

The moment he finished speaking, Sabina began rotating explosively.

'Air Flower.'

Forty air cuts per second spread in all directions, scraping the dome's inner walls, but Frings threaded through those dense gaps to close the distance.

'Got him!'

Sabina's eyes flashed as the rotation suddenly reversed and air rushed toward her.

"Suction?"

Air Crash!

The atmosphere rotated like a giant propeller, grinding the dome from the inside.

"So you do have one trick?"

Ice Break!

Ice shot up like blades from beneath Frings' feet and struck Sabina.

Crack crack crack crack crack!

Even as the ice shattered against the atmospheric propeller, Frings didn't stop his magic.

"Ugh!"

As the battle shifted from technique to raw magical power, Sabina's rotation speed gradually began to decrease.

'I'm freezing.'

Frings' magical power, now showing its true nature, soared limitlessly.

Five minutes later.

Sabina was struggling with both legs buried in risen ice, twisted like a pretzel.

"Ugh!"

"You held out quite well, but..."

When Frings stepped on the air, ice pillars rose to create stairs.

"It only made my thirst worse."

"Ugh!"

Reaching Sabina's height, Frings grabbed her face with his hand.

"Are you afraid? What do you think I'll do to you?"

Suddenly realizing something, he removed his hand from Sabina's face.

"Right. What if I just let you go? Wouldn't that be interesting too?"

When Sabina glared at him, Frings' mouth twisted grotesquely.

"Of course, that won't happen though."

"You pervert!"

"You haven't seen a true pervert yet..."

Ice crystallized at Frings' fingertips, curving like beast claws.

"Stop."

As Frings, who had been about to grab her slender nape, stopped moving, Sabina turned her head.

"...Ned?"

Ned, who hadn't been seen since yesterday, stood in the forest shadows with his head deeply bowed.

"Finally, the hero's entrance? But what to do? Even if someone like you comes, Sabina is already finished."

Rumble rumble rumble rumble!

Feeling vibrations through the ice pillar, Frings looked down to see blue electricity rippling across the ground.

'Ice doesn't conduct electricity.'

After all, magically created water was also a non-conductor unless imbued with ionic potential from specialized hydro power systems.

His puzzlement was briefâ€”metal fragments buried underground began rotating and completely ground down the ice pillar.

'Now's my chance!'

Seizing the opportunity, Sabina cast teleportation and escaped Frings' clutches.

"Ned! How did you...!"

"Don't come!"

Ned shouted without raising his face.

"Just go. And never come here again."

Knowing Ned's secret, Sabina couldn't bring herself to turn away.

"But Ned..."

"You promised. Please."

Ned was still Ned, no matter how he changed.

It was precisely because it was Sabina who knew this that he could come to save her even with his true face revealed.

"Alright. You need to be careful."

Sabina turned away from Ned and quickly left the battlefield.

"Hmm."

Frings, who had been watching while blinking, twisted his mustache.

"This is interesting."

"...Is it?"

"Do you know why I let her go? I've been curious for a while. So basically, you're going to sacrifice yourself for a woman. Then what would happen if I reversed that?"

Ned still didn't move.

"I'll torment you to the brink of death. And make you beg. To torment Sabina instead. Hm? That would be fun, wouldn't it?"

"...Kang. Won't you do it?"

"Kang?"

"Because of that... collecting cards... I was late."

Frings checked his master card and confirmed it was the same as Ned's.

"Yeah, I won't. So you wasted your time. Hahahaha! This is completely hilarious!"

"That's a relief."

Frings' laughter stopped abruptly.

"I hate causing trouble for my friends."

Finally, Ned stepped through the forest darkness toward Frings.

"Hehe, how pitiful. You're about to cause tremendous trouble for your friends..."

The moment he saw Ned's face, Frings' expression hardened.

"You..."

"Well then, let's begin."

RUMMMMMBLE!

A tremendous roar shook the mountain.

"Ned!"

Sabina, who had been going down the mountain, hurriedly turned to look at the peak.

"Oh my god..."

Gigantic bundles of electricity were shooting up like hair, devastating the entire area.
