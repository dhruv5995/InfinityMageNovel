**Infinity (5)**

The Rami Church paladin recalled the ancient ruins he had witnessed during his holy pilgrimage.

Traces that humans could not have created, yet too artificial to be considered natural.

'Who are these people?'

The paladin looked back at Shirone's group.

"I am Seina, a senior holy knight belonging to the Oracle Management Division of the Rami Church. Who are you?"

"I'm Iruki."

Currently unemployed.

"I'm Nade."

Same here.

However, to several holy knights lined up behind the paladin, those names sounded familiar.

"Iruki? Nade? I'm sure I've heard those names somewhere..."

They were key figures involved in the World War, so they couldn't help but hear about them through rumors.

"That's the Valkyrie General!"

Upon hearing this, Seina squinted one eye while another subordinate spoke up.

"Then Nade is... Nade Groom?"

Realizing they were bigger shots than expected, the holy knights' swelling momentum subsided somewhat.

Seina turned to look at Shirone.

"Then who are you?"

Nade stepped forward, thinking this was his chance.

"Hmph! Speaking of this person, they are my friend, one of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars, and of our era..."

"My name is Shirone."

That alone was sufficient, and the murmuring that had been going on until then disappeared in an instant.

They were clearly surprised, but when Nade examined their reactions specifically, it was different from what he had expected.

'What? Why is there hostility...'

Shirone knew the reason.

'The Rami Church, the world's largest religious order. They wouldn't welcome me fighting alongside Zion.'

When Miro established Zion, great spiritual seekers from religions around the world all gathered together.

Many figures from the Rami Church also crossed over, but the Pope did not welcome this fact.

Setting aside their pride as the world's largest religion, Zion's philosophy didn't align with the Rami Church.

'Miss Miro believed that the ultimate truth was universal regardless of which god one believed in. But the Rami Church is different. They consider any religion that believes in gods other than the monotheistic Cria to be heretical.'

"So you're the Yahweh who created the religion of universal love?"

As expected, Seina's tone was not pleasant.

"It's not a religion. I simply want to let people know that this world has value worth existing."

"Hmph, all charlatans enter sacred sanctuaries with such pious words. But no matter what plausible words they carry, without God's blessing, they are nothing but empty shells."

Seina's lips curved upward as if struck by a sudden thought.

"Look at Zion. Didn't it collapse while pursuing only the depth of enlightenment and purity? Those who don't hold God in their hearts are destined to fall to evil."

Iruki asked.

"Are you saying you're different?"

Seina proudly drew her holy sword Astacia.

"Behold."

As divine power was infused, a clear blue light that couldn't be found in any other sword definitely emanated from it.

"To fight as God's messenger requires not just will, but the appropriate force. Sacred weapons, powerful divine power, and a systematically trained organization."

In some ways it was utterly human, but Shirone didn't criticize others' religions.

For now, the feeling that they were comrades facing the same enemy was stronger.

"Fine. We'll be leaving now. Please take care of those remaining here."

From a civilian standpoint, it would be better to enter a systematized system.

"Don't worry about that. But first, I'd like to hear about what happened here. And..."

If possible, she wanted to take Shirone to the Vatican for heresy trials.

'If only it were possible.'

She had heard rumors of Yahweh's military power, and now she had confirmed it with her own eyes.

'It's impossible for me alone. Unless the Church's highest holy knights step forward...'

She suggested an alternative.

"How about following God's expedition force? If you have a mission to purify the world's evil."

With the Rami Church's help, the efficiency of the Ultima Project would increase, but Shirone shook her head.

"I'm sorry. We'll go separately."

What Shirone sought to achieve was grand unification, not cramming everyone into one single concept.

'Even if our interests align now, we'll diverge at the very final point. It's better not to get entangled from the beginning.'

Seina asked with displeasure.

"What's the reason?"

Feeling she needed to answer well, Shirone explained as diplomatically as possible.

"The reason we travel is simply to help people who are suffering. That's enough."

Love is giving without expecting anything in return.

Looking at the unwavering eyes of Shirone's group, Seina fell into deep thought.

At the center where the Hand of God had struck the earth, Prejudice of 5 o'clock lay sprawled out in a large character.

Of course, the space was not reality but the other world.

"Kiek. Kik."

Countless demons were gathering, climbing over the lava-flowing rocky terrain.

As they began to reveal themselves one by one, in an instant countless demons surrounded her.

"Food... food..."

Though Siok was Satan's apostle, the starving demons would devour anything edible.

"I'm going to eat!"

The moment the demons rushed in like water, an elderly man with sagging cheeks appeared beside Prejudice of 5 o'clock.

"Back off."

Sloth of 4 o'clock.

Unwanted things do not happen.

"Kieeeee! Kieeeee!"

The demons that had been pouncing on Prejudice of 5 o'clock began biting each other while ignoring her.

Though they knew they were of the same kind, what Sloth of 4 o'clock didn't want should not happen.

"We, we were wrong!"

The demons that came later scattered in all directions like cockroaches and disappeared.

"Tsk."

Clicking his tongue, Sloth of 4 o'clock put his hands behind his back and poked Prejudice of 5 o'clock with his foot.

Only then did she grimace and stir, and Sloth of 4 o'clock smiled and asked.

"Are you conscious?"

Prejudice of 5 o'clock, who had bolted upright, saw the sinisterly smiling old man and realized.

'I almost died.'

"You got properly beaten. By Yahweh, no less."

"What?..."

Prejudice of 5 o'clock, who had been grinding her sharp teeth, screamed so loud her eyeballs seemed ready to pop out.

"I'm going to kill herrrrrr!"

Even as hell resounded thunderously, Sloth of 4 o'clock showed no particular emotion.

"Don't be too upset. It's impossible alone. Yahweh, wasn't she one who had mastered the mind?"

Prejudice of 5 o'clock shot up.

"I'll kill her. Where is she?"

"She seems to still be around. Mixed in with those parasite-like holy knights."

"Huhu, what a delicacy has come."

Though ordinary humans were fun too, nothing was as thrilling as corrupting holy knights.

"Let's go. I won't make mistakes this time."

As Prejudice of 5 o'clock began walking, Sloth of 4 o'clock looked back with his hands behind his back.

"Are you really going to do it? The opponent is Yahweh."

"Why? Not confident?"

Sloth of 4 o'clock, who smiled knowingly, slowly began walking to follow her.

"...As if."

Seina made her decision.

"I refuse."

The Rami Church fundamentally fought evil, but had a history of judging numerous heretics.

"Why? Is helping people wrong?"

"Because there's no God in your decision."

Seina's sword glowed even more bluish.

"Do you know the difference between sacred doctrine and heresy? Heretics always try to become gods themselves. Your current thinking is extremely heretical."

Feeling the killing intent, Shirone said coldly.

"Stop it. There's no need for us to fight each other."

"I know you're strong. But this is God's command. And God's command..."

The moment all the subordinates raised their weapons, Seina kicked off the ground and charged.

"...is everything to us."

"Tch!"

Just as Nade and Iruki took combat stances, screams came from behind.

"Kyaaaaa!"

The battle stopped and everyone turned to look, where Ravika was writhing in pain.

"What's happening!"

Faster than anyone, Seina ran over.

"It hurts! My body, my body... Kuaaaa!"

As Ravika let out violent screams, her facial bones began to twist.

"Kkeok! Kkeok!"

Her face twisting left and right began to resemble someone, and then even her body's bones began to change.

Seina's eyes widened.

"Physical possession phenomenon?"

Human emotions also affect the body, leaving traces of time on the face.

But for such sudden, extreme emotions capable of twisting even bones to dwell in someone, within her doctrine, only Satan was possible.

"Just what... what evil was here?"

Siok.

The twelve abilities that support Satan's chaos.

"Kueoeoeoeo!"

Ravika, who arched her upper body like a bow and roared, was no longer the woman they knew.

When the sound ceased and she returned her upper body, her face had become that of Prejudice of 5 o'clock.

"Who are you?"

Seina's sword, pointed forward, trembled.

"Siok."

Shirone said.

"I don't know what enemy the Rami Church fought, but it's probably on a different dimension from the evil you know."

"Siok..."

Just as Seina was muttering, Prejudice of 5 o'clock moved.

"Kill Yahweh! They are ones who blaspheme and mock your god, and will harm you!"

"Kuk!"

As the hidden code activated, light flashed in the eyes of the holy knights behind Seina.

This was a phenomenon called holy eye, a technique to automatically respond to demonic temptation through brainwashing from childhood.

"Kill! If you don't kill now, you'll be the ones to suffer!"

"Uaaaaa!"

Several subordinates whose eyes blazed as if about to explode drew their swords and gripped them in reverse.

"We're sorry, Lady Seina!"

Then they lifted their heads and precisely stabbed the swords into the gaps in their necks.

As about twenty collapsed with thuds, Nade opened his mouth in bewilderment.

"What? Why so easily..."

Seina wrinkled her nose bridge.

"Damn it!"

When evil that couldn't be blocked even by the power of holy eye dwelt within them, they were designed to choose suicide.

They had trained their entire lives that way, even having the will embedded in their unconscious through brainwashing.

'They're absolutely not weak. They're the finest holy knights.'

It was just that the power of the evil shaking their hearts was of unprecedented intensity.

"Oh God!"

Seina's holy eye spread in golden light and began burning the evil dwelling in her heart.

Ehihihihihi! Ehihihihihi!

But all that could be heard was mocking laughter, and her heart was invaded by even more powerful desires.

"Ahhhh? Ahhhhh?"

She who had been shedding hot tears slowly raised her sword with a despairing expression.

'I must die. I cannot be used.'

The years of being baptized from birth, maintaining faith in Cria and training flashed by.

"Destroy evil!"

Just as she closed her eyes tightly, shouted, lifted her neck and was about to stab the sword in.

"Kuk!"

Suddenly feeling something catch, the blade stopped right in front of her neck.

"Don't give up."

Opening her eyes, she saw Shirone gripping the sword's handle tightly and holding on.

'What strength...'

Though she prided herself on being as strong as any knight, her arm wouldn't budge even a centimeter.

It must be because smoke of light rising from Shirone's hand was wrapping around the blade.

"Let go! I'd rather die than become a minion of evil!"

"You can do it. Don't set limits for yourself!"

'How foolish.'

Wasn't it because she couldn't overcome those limits that the martyrdom code in her unconscious was activating?

"Heuuuu!"

As she used all her strength to pull the sword inward, her arm began to bend little by little.

With the will befitting a senior holy knight, Shirone's eyes flashed fiercely as she raised her other hand.

'I have no choice.'

Shirone, who flew forward while gripping the handle, struck her forehead with her palm.

With a ringing sound, an endless tidal wave of light rushed into her mind.

"Heok!"

At the same time, ink-like black droplets seeped out from the back of her head.

'Ah, ahhh.'

As her heart, freed from evil, filled with emotion, her shoulders trembled.

'The human heart is...'

Even the tears flowing down seemed to be made of light.

'...infinitely vast.'
