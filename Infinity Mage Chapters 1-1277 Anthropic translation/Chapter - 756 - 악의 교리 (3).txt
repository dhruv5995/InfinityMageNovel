[756] The Doctrine of Evil (3)

"Get in there quickly! Do you want to die!"

At the core of North Eimond's 48th Military Facility, a group of soldiers had drawn their swords and were threatening the workers.

"I-I went in yesterday! Please have mercy!"

"If you were picked in the lottery, that's final! Are you going to defy the Republic's orders right now!"

Only after the sword was pressed to his throat did the man resignedly bow his head and grab a sack.

If he resisted, he would die now, but if he went into that warehouse, there was still a possibility he could survive.

Out of 10 people who went in, 8 came back alive - quite high odds.

But the problem was that the fate of the remaining 2 didn't simply end in death.

"Next. Who drew the X mark?"

"That's me."

Baseto, Verdi's father, approached showing the X mark carved on his stick.

"Go in."

Knowing that resistance would be useless, he too dragged the remaining sack toward the warehouse.

"H-hey, Baseto. Who should go first? Huh? Me first? Or you first?"

His colleague, alone and terrified in the same situation, was annoying, but this too had become routine by now.

"Do as you like."

The man rolled his eyes and spoke with a servile smile.

"T-then you go first. Got it?"

Out of 10 people, 8 survived, but of the 39 who had died so far, 30 had been the first to go.

"...Fine."

The moment the warehouse door opened, an irresistible, impulse-triggering smell pierced his nose.

It was such a nauseating smell that burying your face in a corpse would be better than this.

"Grrrrrr."

Inside the cage installed in the warehouse, silhouettes of monsters larger than humans passed by.

Each had different forms, personalities, and habits, but the soldiers called them all by one name: 'Garas.'

'Stay calm. Just put down the sack and come out.'

As he opened the cage door and entered, the monsters simultaneously turned their heads and slowly backed away.

"Kruk. Kruk. Kruk."

Hearing sounds like laughter, Baseto dragged the sack without even breathing.

'Don't provoke them. Can't make any noise.'

Dragging the sack with enough force to dislocate his arm was the only skill he had learned in this place.

"Kiiiiiii."

The moment something sharp like a fingernail poked his side, Baseto involuntarily let out a small gasp.

'Damn it! Is it me?'

It wasn't time to give up yet.

"......"

His extremely heightened senses detected the Garas backing away without even turning his head.

'Damn bastards! Are they toying with me?'

The reason the Garas didn't tear through the cage and come out was because the 48th Military Facility provided them with the finest materials.

'Feel like emperors, do you?'

Igor was prepared to pay any price to satisfy the sexual desires of Garas, who were 100,000 times more powerful than humans.

'To create the strongest army.'

Whether they could actually control the Garas was uncertain, but just reaching a compromise to get them into cages was already an achievement.

'I'm going to return to my family.'

The ones in the warehouse were well-fed, and unless something particularly caught their interest, they wouldn't even look.

'Done!'

He put down the sack, but some who had run in their eagerness had been caught by the Garas.

'Slowly. Even slower.'

Repeating the phrase "those who seek death shall live" dozens of times, he finally escaped the cage, and the Garas sent their congratulations.

"Kuk! Kuk! Kuk!"

Just the thought that he was alive made everything feel wonderful, while conversely, the man whose turn was next turned pale.

"C-congratulations. Really amazing."

No answer came back.

"R-right. You can do it. Please, I'm begging you. Please take mine too..."

When Baseto's eyes filled with intensity and he glared as if ready to kill, the man weakly dropped his head.

"Well... no one wants to die."

Baseto's heart softened momentarily, but he soon regained his composure and pressed himself against the warehouse wall.

Creak. Unluckily, the lock mechanism that had been fine until now made noise as it opened, and from that moment the man's sanity was paralyzed.

"Haa. Haa."

Baseto frowned at the rough breathing but couldn't bring himself to speak.

'Calm down. Do it like usual and nothing will happen.'

"Huuuuu."

At the sobbing sound, a Garas in the corner showed interest and stuck out its tongue.

When something wet wrapped around his neck once and squeezed tightly, the man's hands lost their strength.

"Please save me."

Baseto's eyes widened.

'You idiot! Just stay still! Don't say anything and just stay there!'

"Please save me. I'm begging you. I came in yesterday too. I can't die like this... AAAAAH!"

The tongue quickly dragged the man away, and Baseto kicked off the ground and ran toward the exit.

"S-save me! AAAAAAAAH!"

Without even glancing in that direction, Baseto pounded on the warehouse door.

"Open up! Open the door quickly, you bastards!"

A window showing only eyes opened, and cold gazes quickly swept the interior of the warehouse.

"Open it! I carried out the mission properly!"

"The cage is open. Close it."

"Damn it...!"

Curses came out automatically, but before his desire to survive, his anger quickly cooled.

Pushing the door with both hands, he ran to the cage where the man pinned under a giant Garas reached out his hand.

"Please! Help me... AAAAAAAAH!"

After confirming that the man's eyes had rolled back, Baseto closed the cage and lowered the lock.

"KYAAAAAAH!"

When the excited Garas pushed forward with black shadows, his mind went dizzy.

Without knowing how he backed away, he was pressed against the warehouse wall, and snake-like things were writhing outside the bent cage bars.

"Grrrrrr!"

Gritting his teeth and running sideways, the warehouse door opened and his vision filled with light.

The light of life.

"AAAAAAAAH!"

Worried the door might close, he used all his strength to kick off the ground, came out, and rolled on the floor.

'Please, please someone save me! Honey, Verdi!'

At the terrible screams of his colleague coming from inside the warehouse, Baseto covered his ears and wailed.

"Huuuuuk! Huuuuuk!"

Another victim had emerged.

Major Jessie, who had escaped the 48th Military Facility, arrived deep in the Galchen Mountains that surrounded Pasia, the capital of North Eimond.

'Not here yet? It's 5 minutes before the appointed time.'

Though active as a North Eimond officer, she was actually a spy who had infiltrated from South Eimond six years ago.

'I endured just for today.'

It would have been an impossible mission without being an unofficial 3rd-grade great mage specialized in espionage.

"Jessie!"

Three soldiers emerged from the bushes.

The leader was Jessie's husband.

"Why are you so late?"

"Sorry. Breaking through the border took longer than expected. I'm glad we made it across safely."

After ending a brief kiss, Jessie searched through her belongings and spoke.

"There's no time. Two days ago, the North succeeded in controlling Garas for the first time. If we don't establish countermeasures quickly..."

"Damn them! They really succeeded?"

"Fortunately, they're not yet at the level of taming higher creatures. But the fact that they succeeded is what's important."

As time passed, the technology would inevitably advance.

"Deliver these documents to the royal castle. This is all the information I've collected about Garas. I'll cross over in three days."

If she deserted the army now, a national emergency would be declared and even her husband might be caught.

"The place for you is the torture chamber."

When North Eimond soldiers walked through the bushes, Jessie's eyes shook with shock.

"How..."

She thought she had kept it thoroughly hidden.

"The world has changed, hasn't it? You should know that there are eyes even in places you don't know about."

The hidden world.

'No, impossible. The residents of the hidden world would never compromise with humans.'

"Don't think about being dragged away quietly. I'm in quite a foul mood right now."

When the military police commander drew his saber and approached, Jessie cast invisibility magic and shouted.

"Scatter! Get out!"

When she concealed herself and fired an electric bolt from an unexpected location, the military police threw themselves aside.

'So she's not complete trash?'

Invisibility was lightning magic, specifically the highest level of illusion magic.

"...The situation is getting interesting."

As the spies fled, the military police commander gave orders.

"Call the Beast King Unit."

A signal flare was fired, and three minutes later, 20 soldiers came dragging dogs that were 2 meters tall.

Grrrrrrrrr!

Dogs whose entire bodies were covered in iron armor, dogs with hundreds of holes in their bodies, dogs with deadly poison flowing from their teeth...

Monsters created using Garas were moving in perfect unison according to hand signals.

Garas Heteromorphic Poisonous Dogs.

'Certainly remarkable results.'

What North Eimond's biologists used to control Garas was dog genes.

Though still in early stages, if training was possible, they would soon possess military power that even the Empire wouldn't fear.

"Do they really obey? If we trust only the dogs and let the enemy escape, our necks won't be safe either."

The Beast King Unit's captain spoke confidently.

"Don't worry. They're the Republic's dogs who faithfully carry out even dangerous tasks."

"How's their performance?"

"So excellent I can't describe it all. You'd better see for yourself. Just give the order."

The military police commander surveyed the forest with angry eyes.

"Find and capture all the southern trash."

Twenty minutes later.

Desperate screams echoed from the middle of the Galchen Mountains.

"Nooooo!"

The heteromorphic poisonous dogs' sense of smell quickly found the spies, and Jessie's husband had his throat cut by the military police commander's saber.

"You evil bastards! Kill me! Kill me too!"

Jessie, affected by a heteromorphic poisonous dog that relaxed major muscles, missed her chance for suicide.

"Unpleasant. To be called evil by a thief trying to secretly steal another country's information."

"Shut up! Even in war, there are human rights! Do you know what you're doing right now?"

"Of course I know. We're at war."

The military police commander stepped on Jessie's face.

"Urgh!"

Even with her cheek pressed down, her fierce glaring expression displeased him.

"You should know well enough how the Republic interrogates criminals, right? You'd better confess how far this conspiracy reaches."

"Kill me."

Without this level of resolve, she couldn't have infiltrated enemy territory and endured for six years.

"Kicking human rights away with your own feet."

When the military police commander turned his head, a black-furred heteromorphic poisonous dog approached, drooling.

"You'll experience hell for the next 10 minutes. After that, we'll talk again. Now is the only time to stop this."

"...Kill me."

The Beast King Unit's researcher opened a file folder.

"Experimental data 38-7. Test sample Vestark Jessie. Age 36. Beginning record."

"AAAAAAAAH!"

Just as Jessie squeezed her eyes shut and screamed, the military police commander, sensing a presence, quickly turned around.

Even he, who used sensory schema, couldn't detect the identity of someone who had approached so close...

"...What are you?"

It was a young girl wearing a wide-brimmed pointed hat and holding a broom in one hand.

"Human, human."

At the adult woman's voice that disrupted the harmony, the military police finally realized and stepped back.

'Was I dreaming?'

As if the scene up until now had been an illusion, the child's appearance vanished and a bewitching face struck their gaze.

"Why do you people never end, no matter how many times we kill you?"
