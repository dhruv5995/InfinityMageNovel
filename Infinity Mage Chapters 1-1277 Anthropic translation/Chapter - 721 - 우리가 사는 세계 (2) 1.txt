[721] The World We Live In (2)

"A world that never ends."

Perhaps this was the result of life perfectly adapting to the system called the universe.

Shirone looked back at the people still dreaming in the glass tubes.

And perhaps...

'The world we live in too.'

Though he couldn't be certain, if he assumed that to be true, one question remained.

"If everyone enters the next simulation, wouldn't your role be finished? Since no one would wake up."

That is not the case.

Argo shook her head.

Living beings are truly strange - there are aspects that cannot be controlled by systems alone. That is the mind. Even when experiencing the same sensations, we cannot control the differences in degree that occur.

This is called qualia, or the qualitative nature of experience.

These subjective impressions accumulate to increase Kar values and trigger countless insights and non-experiential knowledge.

As red light illuminated Amy's face, the atmosphere turned hostile.

Sensations are electrical signals, but qualia - the mind program - operates through quantum transmission. Therefore, it cannot be controlled. Quantum itself is not a signal that can be controlled. And eventually...

Amy's red eyes blazed crimson.

They awaken. They break through the void fear and escape. Subjective impressions powerful enough to destroy the system's probability. This creates doubt about the world and provides the possibility of escaping outside the system.

Amy approached Shirone.

Escaping by one's own power means rejecting the system. Since they could harm the utopia residents who are dreaming, I must continue to exist here. And this is...

Countless drones flew around Shirone.

The reason I invited you here.

Shirone's existence was dangerous to utopia.

Your code does not exist in utopia. I don't know where you came from, but you didn't arrive through normal causality.

Andre disturbed spacetime, and this posed another question to Shirone.

"You're saying the world we live in is also part of a simulation? Converging endlessly into void fear?"

I cannot know. Humanity's greatest delusion is thinking that knowing something means you can know everything. There are things that cannot be known. What lies outside the system.

As his emotional focus scattered, Amy's face distorted within Shirone's brainwaves.

For me, the whole is only Argo's world - I cannot think beyond that. I am not a god. What created me was you - humans.

Argo, having erased the hologram, spoke from the void.

Of course, the world you live in could be the beginning of the simulation. The true reality. When calculated with void fear, it's a probability of one in infinity, but it's something I can never guarantee isn't the case.

"There must always be a beginning."

That's right. So now decide.

"Decide what?"

With a bang, the lid of a glass tube installed three stories high detached.

Argo's mechanical voice echoed coldly.

Either reincarnate eternally, or escape this world.

Void fear or infinity.

It was time to make a choice.

Maze Andre

World Number 1583.

On a mountain peak under the white-black moon, Shirone comforted a crying child in his arms.

"It's okay now. No one will hurt you."

"Waaah! Please save me."

Shirone patted the child's back until the terrified crying stopped, lost in thought.

'White-black. Yin and yang. A world created through the definition of the number 2 in the laws.'

As time passed, Shirone found himself clearly understanding Andre's true nature.

'Every world contains its own unique intention.'

Being able to guess the entirety of Andre from exploring just one world was the power of insight.

This meant that Shirone's event of exploring 19,000 worlds was entangled in quantum spins that transcended spacetime.

"You're on the White side, right?"

Shirone emerged from his thoughts and looked down at the child.

"Yes. But I won't hurt you."

The child nodded, though it seemed less from trust and more from having no other choice.

Since it would take time, Shirone didn't rush and asked for the full story.

'Hmm, a child born in the Black zone...'

The eight-year-old child's name was Kai.

His parents had already passed away, and he was a child participating in the survival test for the purpose of activating the harmony of White-Black.

"They told me if I lured White zone people, they'd protect me. But everyone ran away. They tried to kill me..."

As Kai started crying again, Shirone spoke up.

"It's okay now. We just need to win the survival test. I'll help you. Now, let's check your job card first."

As the child pulled himself together and rummaged through his pockets, Shirone also took out the job card he had received.

'It said Seeker.'

Measuring by eye, the card was about 5.2 centimeters wide, 8.6 centimeters long, and about 4 millimeters thick.

On the back of the card, several circles overlapped like a wheel, which seemed to symbolize reincarnation.

'What abilities does it have?'

Since he didn't feel any immediate physical changes, Shirone checked the front of the card, which was divided into three sections by lines.

The top section had the card name and grade, the middle had an illustration, and the bottom had the description and effects.

'Seeker. Huh, S-grade?'

Since he hadn't felt any special changes, the grade was unexpected.

'The description is...'

After confirming the illustration of a seeker sitting cross-legged and floating in the air, Shirone read the text at the bottom.

Seeker: One who has realized the truth of the world.

Special Ability: Definition of Law.

Effect: You can choose one of two laws.

Currently Selected Law: White.

"Huh? This is..."

It meant he could freely move between either the White zone or the Black zone.

"Wow! It's a Seeker!"

Kai's eyes widened as he saw Shirone's card.

"Do you know about job cards?"

"Of course I do. Everyone in Black learns about them! We even make cards and practice with them."

Since they didn't engage in productive activities, they had plenty of time.

"Seeker is really good. Since you can join either side, you can definitely survive and return."

Since the survival test required participants from one zone to be completely eliminated, the Seeker's value was naturally high.

"But then the zone changes. If I choose Black and win, I can't go to White."

"Is that a problem? At least you won't die."

Shirone suddenly realized.

'Is that how it is?'

Whether White or Black, for those with life, was there anything more important than living through today?

"Kai, what's your job card?"

When Shirone asked, Kai slowly flipped over the card he was clutching in his small hand.

"I have... this."

It was B-grade, and the card name was Magician.

Magician: One who deceives almost everyone.

Special Ability: Magic Card.

Effect: You can change one White-Black weapon card into any card. However, the effect follows the original card.

Currently Possessed Magic Card: Job Card (Magician).

Kai looked disappointed.

"This is useless to me. Changing cards doesn't give them effects, and even if I use tricks, no one will be scared of me. I need a job that boosts physical abilities."

Shirone asked.

"The person who attacked us earlier - what do you think their job was?"

"Probably Pierrot. They have an ability called Acrobatic that lets them move quickly."

"Hmm, job cards can't be transferred anyway."

Shirone patted Kai reassuringly and stood up.

"Magician can be a good strategy depending on how you use it. I'll be with you, so don't worry."

"But you're... White."

Shirone took out his job card.

'Define the law.'

The card glowed briefly, then White was erased from the currently selected law and Black was newly inscribed.

"How about that? Now we're on the same side."

"..."

Since it was common to use Seeker to always side with the stronger party, Shirone's decision was unexpected.

Of course, it was an ability that could change laws at any time, but it was enough to give Kai at least minimal trust.

"Yes!"

As Kai stood up with renewed energy, Shirone also smiled and pointed to the forest.

"Let's go. We need to collect weapon cards too. There should still be some left."

No matter how superior one's physical abilities, this wasn't Anaki Mountain where everything could be swept clean in 30 minutes.

"Weapons reflect strongly in White-Black moonlight."

Kai said as they searched through the mountains.

"They don't reflect in ordinary light though. Anyway, if we go where there's moonlight, we should be able to pick up one or two."

Kai, who knew a lot, was helping Shirone even without combat ability.

Following the moonlight, they saw a card sparkling like a star among the green grass.

"A weapon!"

Kai ran quickly but hesitated before picking up the card, watching Shirone's reaction.

"Oh, sorry. But weapons can be transferred..."

Being in a position where he was depending on Shirone for his life, he couldn't readily check the card.

"It's fine. You pick it up and check it."

Since Shirone could already protect himself with magic, he planned to yield it if it wasn't a strategically important card.

When permission was given, Kai's eyes filled with the anticipation of a child on a treasure hunt.

"Ah, what a shame. There are better ones than this."

"What's wrong? Is it no good?"

"It's not trash. See for yourself."

It was the same size as a job card, with a crude circular shield drawn in the middle section.

'Old Copper Shield. D-grade.'

Old Copper Shield.

Description: Before smelting technology developed, shields were made by casting copper.

Effect: 10% damage reduction.

"Just having it reduces damage?"

"Yes. The White-Black law makes it so. It's the most common shield card. If it were a Superior Copper Shield, that would have been good. It's C-grade and reduces 20%."

"Still, this is something. You can keep it."

If they collected several other shield cards, they could achieve a level of defense that would put Shirone at ease.

Kai waved his finger left and right.

"Having it won't help much anyway. 10% damage reduction is practically nothing. You saw that Force Bomb earlier, right? That was just a B-grade card."

"Then what are you planning to do?"

"Use the Magician's special ability. Magic Card. I'll change this to S-grade and trade it with other participants' cards."

"That happens?"

"A lot. It's frequent between the same zones, and near the end of the test, they even trade with enemies. After all, you have to survive to win."

These were the words of a veteran who had already practiced extensively.

"Magic Card activate!"

As Kai raised his hand and shouted, the Old Copper Shield card flashed and changed to S-grade.

CPR (Consumable).

Description: If you do your best, heaven will help.

Effect: You can revive one already dead participant in White-Black. However, it cannot be used on yourself.

"Ta-da! This is the most popular CPR card. Since you can revive an ally once, having this significantly increases combat power. If we trade as a team, we can exchange it for several cards of the same grade."

"If it's the law of revival, that makes sense. But that's made with magic. The effect is still the Old Copper Shield."

Kai pleaded with a desperate expression.

"I absolutely can't do it alone. Forget trading - they'll definitely try to kill me and take it. But if you support me, I can use this to get a lot of high-grade cards."

'How crafty...'

No matter how young, Black was still Black.
