[510] The Backlash of Evil (4)

"There exists a concept that corresponds to the Akashic Records, which I thought was everything. A concept beyond the law. In other words, perfect chaos."

"I see."

The smile on Uorin's lips disappeared.

"Because we failed to understand that chaos, Ra reset everything."

When Kando looked puzzled, Uorin walked to the table and pulled out documents.

A thick file was placed in front of Kando.

Anke Ra Erasure.

Probably one of the most highly classified secrets in the world, passed down only to the official successors of Theraze.

As Kando hesitated to even look at it, let alone touch it, Uorin gestured for him to proceed.

"Read it. I'll need your help with something."

"Yes, then..."

Kando didn't have the ability to absorb the entire contents of a 200-page document at once.

"Just read the last 3 pages or so."

As Kando obediently followed her words, each letter struck his eyes like a shockwave.

He gulped and his hands trembled.

"This is now..."

"Yes. This is the full account of the incident where Anke Ra tried to reset the world and erase herself."

"But Ra still exists, doesn't she?"

"That's where the variable occurred. Unless Satan is eliminated, no matter how many times we reset, only the same result will repeat. Therefore, the implementation of Anke Ra Erasure would come after Satan's annihilation. That's why Ra decided to repeat the world once more, even after winning the final war."

Uorin continued her explanation.

"Even ordinary humans retain traces of the reset, albeit faintly. That's déjà vu. As the mitochondrial Eve, Theraze can restore that déjà vu almost perfectly."

"You call it the underlying incident."

"Right. Based on analysis of those underlying incidents, we're currently living in a world after the second reset has been implemented. In other words, we're at the midpoint heading toward the time when the second reset was implemented, repeating all processes identically."

Kando conceived a hypothetical timeline in his mind.

Once a reset occurs, the world enters an 'off state.'

Then something amplifies to open the world, and when it returns to the point of reset, one cycle is completed.

'Currently, we're at the midpoint of that cycle. In other words, we haven't yet reached the point when Anke Ra performed the second reset.'

That point would probably be just before the end of the final war.

But with Theraze's intervention, the future is changing.

"Originally, when would the final war have occurred?"

"The time when the final war occurred during the first reset period, the Guffin Erasure period, is six months from now. Originally, by now the archangel Kariel would have destroyed Miro's space-time and Miro would have died. But as you know, the second reset, the Anke Ra Erasure period, is different. Because I added variables."

One of those variables was Kando himself.

The reason he was created in Mistra's womb during the Anke Ra Erasure period, and the reason he was taken from his mother's arms at birth to be raised as a spy in Tormia, was precisely...

"To send Gaold to heaven. By sending him to heaven, you created a different future from the Guffin Erasure period."

"Right. After Ra attempted the second reset hoping for Satan's annihilation, Theraze pondered this for hundreds of years. Then my predecessor Mistra recalled an incident from 20 years ago during the Guffin Erasure period."

The memory of that time surfaced in Uorin's mind.

Gaold's appearance, his hair turned white from forcibly breaking through the law's formation to avoid sending Miro away.

The monstrous scream he had let out still seemed to ring vividly in her ears.

"That's when I realized it. This is it! If this man who could sacrifice everything for Miro might bring us a special variable."

Uorin snapped her fingers and smiled.

Of course, it wasn't something she had experienced directly.

Satan's endlessly growing face pierced through the sky.

Even heaven's highest mountain range only reached his shoulder height.

"Uooooooh!"

If a mountain moved with life and will, how much destruction would this world have to endure?

Satan truly felt like he had become Mount Tai.

Everything spread below his eyes looked utterly insignificant.

Kururururung!

Every step Satan took caused Zebul's structures to crumble like sandcastles.

Etela, who was now delivering rapid strikes from 700 meters above, was no longer even visible to him.

"Huk! Heuuuk!"

Cold tears flowed from the eyes of Etela, who was floating with external gravity and rapidly throwing both fists.

Helplessness.

She was putting all her strength into pushing waves of force, but as Satan's body grew larger, the shockwaves only spread out futilely.

'I won't give up! No, I can't give up!'

Her resolve, strengthened after losing to Arcane, was to never again submit to the power of evil.

Crack! Crack!

After thousands of punches, her bones began to break, but even so, she didn't stop attacking.

More frightening than her body breaking was her conviction breaking.

"Why, whyyyy!"

Why does evil grow endlessly stronger?

Is this world truly a place ruled by evil, not good?

If everyone were good...

She heard her master's voice.

"There would be no chaos in the world. But someone tries to use that chaos to break the tranquility. Evil's methods are easy, pleasurable, and efficient."

Etela, who had been kneeling and listening attentively, raised her head.

A fourteen-year-old child.

A girl who looked like a bookworm with large glasses on her youthful face, but whose eyes shone sacredly with the will of good.

"But there's another major reason they choose evil."

"What is that, Master?"

"Because it looks strong."

Etela blinked at the unexpected words.

"Yes, you wouldn't understand. But that's because you are truly strong. Strong people aren't swayed by evil. They seek other methods because they're weak. So remember this always, Etela. If one good can stop a hundred evils, then good is stronger than evil."

"Hyaaaah!"

The speed of the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara Thunder Strike increased further.

The moment her fists were smashed beyond use, a strike backed by evil struck Satan's body hard.

'Strong Thunder Palm!'

Zzzzzzzing!

Satan's skin rippled like waves and spread out.

But those ripples rolled back in as if time had reversed, and with a bang, they expelled the impact and pushed Etela away.

"Why...!"

Etela's body fell from hundreds of meters high.

"Whyyyy!"

Faced with an unacceptable reality, Etela trembled with extreme helplessness.

'I'm sorry, Master. I'm not strong.'

In the terrible feeling of her conviction collapsing, Etela's body was accelerating toward the ground at a frightening speed.

Iron Wheel Eye.

Equilibrium.

The air's resistance became tremendous, significantly reducing her falling speed.

Etela crashed into the ground with a thud, sparks flying in her eyes, but it wasn't enough impact to tear off her limbs.

'How?'

Unable to understand the situation, she waited briefly, then Sein ran from far away and looked down at Etela.

"Are you okay?"

"Sein."

"Sorry I'm late. I had business in Ingris."

Turning her body, Etela supported herself with her elbow and stood up.

Pain from her fists came rushing in belatedly, but she wasn't in a situation to worry about such things.

"Ingris... wasn't Armin supposed to go..."

"Right. But we went for a different reason than the coordinates."

"We?"

Only then did Etela look beyond Sein's back.

Arius, with his eyes covered in bandages, was crawling over with his tongue hanging out like a dog, and a woman holding the leash attached to him was walking over.

"Miro."

"That's Satan? He's really ugly."

Miro, shading the sun with her palm, looked up at Satan with an expression like someone viewing animals at a zoo.

"Anyway, the designations of good and evil are nothing more than boundaries defined by humans."

Uorin turned from the window.

"Even before humans called it evil, it already existed. As some kind of energy? Or as the concept of chaos."

"Satan is the materialization of that chaos."

"Right. A life form born from the Akashic Records defines what lies outside the Akashic Records. That's why Anke Ra cannot defeat Satan, but humans can. However."

Uorin returned to her seat and sat down.

"Only when the power to define good is stronger than the power to define evil. What will humans ultimately define as right between good and evil?"

"If evil wins, there would be no reset and no future for us either. Was Gaold the variable Your Majesty planned to eliminate Satan?"

Uorin shook her head.

"Heaven isn't that easy. Though they made mistakes in terms of alliance, they ultimately lost even when the holy war's full power was deployed. Of course, Gaold is an excellent mage. But he's not an irreplaceable mage. Gaold is merely a catalyst for creating variables. The variable that can truly cause ripples in heaven is separate."

A person's face surfaced in Kando's mind.

"Then..."

"Adrias Miro. She died futilely during the Guffin Erasure period, but I thought Gaold could save her. I tried to change the future through her."

"Can she succeed?"

"I don't know. I can only believe. But if she can't do it, no one can. Anyway, Miro is..."

Uorin smiled, bathed in sunlight.

"The strongest 'Prajna' our humanity has produced."

"What business did you have in Ingris?"

To Etela's question, Sein answered briefly.

"To understand Ra's will."

This morning, after assigning individual missions to party members, Sein reunited with Miro, who had dismantled the bomb in her head.

Before coming to heaven, precisely when he entered Miro's space-time at Alpheas Magic School's Estas, he wanted to confirm the identity of the discomfort he had felt.

When Sein learned that Miro wasn't there despite entering with anticipation of reunion, he detected a strange distortion.

A nagging feeling that nothing he chose seemed to be true.

At the time, no one could explain that sensation, but he thought Miro would be different.

As expected, Miro immediately intuited something upon hearing Sein's words, and they immediately investigated Ingris's Akashic Records.

Thus, they finally realized the true meaning of this war and what flow they were caught up in.

"It's the second reset. After the Guffin Erasure, another reset occurred, and we're currently placed on that timeline. This is the true identity of the discomfort I felt at Estas."

Miro added.

"Sein adjusts physical and emotional factors with his Iron Wheel Eye. That's why he could sense this world's subtle discrepancies more clearly than others."

Sein continued.

"The problem is that the world of the first reset and the current world might be completely different. Why Estas specifically? Because in the first reset's world, the incident of us visiting Estas never happened. In other words, an event that didn't exist in the previous world is currently occurring. What this means is..."

Miro picked up the thread.

"Someone intentionally triggered the event of sending Gaold to heaven. To liberate me, that is. I can roughly guess. There aren't many with the ability, power, and brains to calculate this far."

"Theraze."

Etela had also heard about Theraze's secrets from Gaold's group before coming to heaven.

"Right. They probably planned everything from the Day of Judgment of the Twenty. The purpose is singular."

Miro looked up at Satan, who was destroying the world.

"To defeat that monster. Anke Ra gave humans a chance through reset, and Theraze created that possibility. So I'm really pissed off."

Miro pursed her lips and started walking.

Miro, stop now... let's go back.

As a man's face briefly flashed through her mind, Miro's eyes turned fierce.

"These bastards are playing with me?"
