[666] To Radoom (1)

A place everyone knew about but not just anyone could enter—a feral-looking man was approaching the back gate of Radoom.

"Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff."

No, Chagall, who was wandering about following the scent of an incident, could truly be called a stray dog.

His genius physical abilities, capable of operating a full seven schemas, rivaled the mobility of a giant from the 1st stage of the Art of Anecdote.

The schema base he was currently operating was sensory-type, specifically a primal sense build that enhanced sight, smell, and hearing.

After amplifying his senses sixteen-fold through four 'folds,' and adding 'grounding'—folding parts of the schema to enhance specific abilities—he began to clearly sense the scent of Rai Enemy.

'Is it here?'

"Stop. This is a restricted area for civilians."

The royal guards protecting Radoom's back gate thrust their torches forward and stopped Chagall.

As Chagall approached closer as if he hadn't heard them, the guards, sensing the severity of the situation, drew their weapons.

"Stop! Identify yourself."

"Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff."

His dog-like sniffing behavior made them initially think he was mentally unstable.

The way he dragged a large bag behind him, and above all, even with his long hair covering his face like a veil, his clearly unhinged eyes were distinctly visible.

"Kill him. I'll take responsibility."

At the captain's order, the soldiers leaped over the barricade and lunged at Chagall.

The captain's eyes widened as if they would pop out when over ten of his subordinates passed right through Chagall and collapsed to the ground.

"H-how...?"

Being not weak himself, he could tell that this madman who had just appeared was a supreme master of schema unlike any he'd ever seen.

'Reinforcements...!'

Abandoning any thought of counterattack, the captain put a whistle to his lips and blew hard.

Chagall launched his body forward, extending his arm first to thrust a dagger, and with swift whooshing sounds, three cuts entered the neck almost simultaneously.

Before breath could reach his mouth, it leaked out through the blade embedded in his neck with hissing sounds, and with a thud, the captain's body toppled over, spewing tremendous amounts of blood from the hole.

The heavy bag containing daggers fell to the ground with a thump, but it didn't disturb Radoom's silence.

"Rai Enemy."

The being who had taken everything from him.

"I'll kill you. Over and over again."

Radoom's back gate was breached.

Just before midnight, the twenty members of the Shirone Mercenary Corps gathered in Silvering Guild's courtyard.

Befitting their carefully selected status, it was a sight that radiated the kind of presence that could survive even if thrown into hell.

Lufist and Jane still wore their masks, with no intention of revealing their identities until they entered Radoom.

Since Shirone was the captain anyway, there was no particular problem commanding the troops.

"I'm Shirone, captain of the Shirone Mercenary Corps. Before we depart, let me explain the mission our mercenary corps must carry out."

The members perked up their ears, curious about what mission carried a reward of 10,000 gold.

"From now on, we will infiltrate Radoom."

No one was disturbed yet.

"What exactly will we be doing?"

Wig of the Gale raised his hand and asked.

After losing his duel with Rian, the hierarchy had been settled and he had accepted it, but it was true that he had become more dejected than before.

"We are..."

Shirone paused to consider the appropriate words before speaking.

"We intend to conquer Radoom."

"What?"

Finally, several members showed shocked expressions.

Radoom was Bashuka's underworld that even the kingdom was reluctant to touch.

While it was openly said they avoided it because it was dirty, if it were just a place where riffraff lived, they would have swept it clean long ago.

"Conquer Radoom? What are you talking about?"

Even though it was a mercenary corps sponsored by Brooks Mercenary Agency and led by an Ivory Tower candidate, it was ultimately a private military organization—conquering Radoom with just twenty people was impossible.

'How should I convince them?'

The fact that Magic Association President Lufist was included in the mercenary corps was known only to a few, and the existence of 'Biomass,' the core of Radoom's Iron Tower, was classified national intelligence that absolutely could not be disclosed until the final mission was completed.

"I've been to Radoom a few times."

Kargin, the healing mage who had joined the mercenary corps, spoke up.

Despite being in his seventies, he was a lecherous mage who made passes at the women in the mercenary corps.

"Radoom is roughly divided into three zones. The outermost slum district, the inner concealment facility district, and the core district said to exist in the center. There are theories that the rulers of the sub-races live in the core district, but no one has ever been there. That's because countless organizations' concealment facilities surround the core district."

The concealment facility district was a mix of sub-race organizations fleeing the kingdom's pursuit and human organizations that had infiltrated for civilian investigation purposes.

Their technology turned the concealment facility district into a maze, serving as a natural defensive barrier that blocked access to the core district.

"Conquering Radoom ultimately means entering the core district. Is there a way? There must be over a hundred concealment facilities to break through. The bigger problem is that all those security devices operate on completely different systems. No information specialist could break through all of them."

Detecting the smell of danger from Kargin's words, Vaikon jumped to his feet.

Equipped with heavy armor, he was an orthodox swordsman who used a longsword as his main weapon and a skilled fighter capable of operating three schemas.

"Right! This isn't just about fighting and dying! How can we charge in without properly knowing the enemy? You're not seriously thinking of breaking through the security facilities one by one, are you?"

"We'll break through them one by one."

Shirone confessed honestly.

"It'll take some time, but that's the only way to reach the core district."

"Hmph! What about the security devices? Who's going to disable all of them?"

"Number 29 and I will handle it."

At Shirone's words, Kargin looked back and forth between the two.

"Just the two of you? Magic?"

"Yes. I can decode any security device."

It was the power of the Ultima System.

"Once I decode them, Number 29 will disable them. We have sufficient chances of success."

Vaikon, left speechless, quietly sat back down, but not everyone was convinced.

"Who are they? Those two people, I mean."

Bromark, a survival and trap specialist, pointed at Numbers 28 and 29.

"It's not my style to nitpick after agreeing to do something, but I'm uncomfortable. A mercenary corps has been formed, so why hide your identities?"

Everyone waited for an answer, and Shirone realized this couldn't be brushed aside.

'Well, it's a matter of risking our lives, so being suspicious is natural.'

"I'll pay 100,000 gold."

At Number 28's sudden proposal, the entire mercenary corps turned their heads.

"You can take it in cash or have it deposited in the guild's bank."

Con, the mage from Silvering Guild, frowned.

"Wait a minute. What kind of business requires 100,000 gold..."

"If you don't want to do it, get out."

Number 28 looked around at the group.

"On the condition that Number 29 and I wear masks, I'll immediately pay 100,000 gold to every member of the mercenary corps. If you don't agree, you can't stay in the mercenary corps. This matter has been discussed and agreed upon with the captain."

Everyone's minds began racing.

"Hmm, someone from the royal castle."

Kargin narrowed his eyes and examined Numbers 28 and 29.

Though he couldn't be certain, the skills of those two were definitely on a different level from the others, including himself.

'Conquering Radoom, masks, Teshia Aria, 100,000 gold. Now it's all falling into place.'

Most of the mercenaries were thinking the same thing.

'This is an unofficial mission from the royal castle. Something we don't know about is happening inside Radoom.'

So they intend to shut it down.

'But they're also considering the possibility of failure. That's why they're hiding their identities?'

If it were proven that the royal castle had moved, they would certainly suffer astronomical losses at the secret negotiation tables that must exist, and in serious cases, the capital could be terrorized.

'This isn't something a mere bureaucrat could take responsibility for. And a man and woman. Those are Lufist and Jane.'

The Association President and the Secretary General had deployed simultaneously.

While mercenaries by nature disliked the rigid thinking of the royal castle, in situations like this, it could actually provide a sense of security.

'If it really is the Association President, he would already know that we've caught on.'

Even so, they couldn't remove their masks.

In the realm of information, circumstantial evidence and physical evidence had as much difference as fake and real, and for the members, it was the difference between being eliminated without anyone knowing versus being eliminated legally.

'It would be better not to remove the masks.'

"I'll do it."

Everyone focused on Bromark.

"If you deposit 100,000 gold to my family by today, I don't care who's behind the masks or what we're doing."

Bromark spread both arms and addressed the group.

"Do you all need to think about it? When have we ever worked based on judging people? The moment they pay us, the masks become our employers too."

If they were going to enter a deadly situation anyway, it was better to avoid weakening their forces.

Though they weren't persuaded by Bromark, there was no one who couldn't calculate the balance between money and survival.

"I agree too."

A woman carrying a quiver raised her hand.

She was a woman named Joshua, the mercenary corps' only archer, renowned for her swift and accurate shooting and eye techniques.

"But I'll take it in cash. Right now."

Kargin asked.

"100,000 gold? Even at the highest grade, that's a hundred pieces."

"I don't care. I can put it in my Kubrick."

Joshua showed her ring.

"Kek kek, a woman who doesn't trust people. You'll get your finger cut off that way."

"Try it if you can."

Joshua's eyes gleamed like a cat's.

It was an eye technique called Cat's Eye that allowed her to identify objects even in darkness.

"I'll chase you to the ends of hell and kill you."

"Tsk tsk, such a temper..."

Kargin clicked his tongue but seemed inwardly pleased.

'I like her attitude.'

Lufist spoke.

"I'll proceed assuming everyone agrees."

There were no objections, and Shirone stood up.

"Then let's meet again after the 100,000 gold payment is completed. We plan to depart at midnight, so please handle it as quickly as possible."

Through Jane, Lufist paid 100,000 gold to all members except the core members in their preferred methods.

Those with families wanted bank deposits, while those who were alone preferred Kubricks like Joshua.

When the bell from the royal castle announced midnight, the Shirone Mercenary Corps left Silvering Guild in carriages.

After traveling for about thirty minutes to reach Radoom's back gate, Joshua was the first to notice.

"I smell blood."

As everyone prepared to jump out, Rian opened the window and climbed onto the carriage roof.

'It's quiet.'

Joshua, who had somehow arrived beside him, activated her Cat's Eye and scanned all directions.

"No ambush. There are fourteen corpses."

The members got out of the carriage in perfect order, and Shirone approached the crime scene.

The back alley of the slums was the only passage into Radoom, and guards lay fallen in the narrow pathway.

"This is..."

The killer's signature.

Now Shirone could tell who the culprit was.

"As expected, he entered first."

Lufist approached behind Shirone.

"The fact that he entered means Rai Enemy 'was' here. We might be able to catch a big fish."

If Meirei could determine Rai's purpose through voice, Chagall could detect Rai's traces.

While shuttering Radoom was the core objective, they had to consider cases where priorities might change.

'What is Rai Enemy?'

To some members, it was incomprehensible, but no one bothered to question it now.

The deposits had already been completed.

"Shirone, there's tremendous bloodlust."

Sensing the murky desire rising from the other end of the narrow alley, Rian gripped his sword handle.

"They've caught the scent of food."

Shirone looked back at Lufist.

"Food?"

"Corpses."

Lufist pointed at the guard's body.

"The finest food containing all the nutrients humans need. Because they're human. That's why outsiders call Radoom's residents this."

Lufist's gaze targeted the darkness.

"Ghouls."
