Legal Murder

"The winner of the World Beauty Contest is!"

When news spread that the terrorist had been captured, the contest resumed with great success.

"Miss Arachne! Barho Rangi!"

The crowd filling nearly every seat in the audience jumped to their feet applauding, and Rangi shed tears of joy.

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Having experienced all the bitter hardships of the world to reach this moment, her tears were genuine.

"Congratulations, Rangi."

That Pony, Tormia's representative, had placed second was also an honor for Shirone.

'Good for you, Pony.'

Having achieved her own measure of success, she would return to her homeland to focus on her magical training once again.

"Is it over now?"

Marsha and Jaystin approached Shirone, who was standing at the back of the audience.

Though the Jaystin mercenary group had already departed after merging with the Parrot mercenary group, Shirone had wanted to see the contest's results.

"Yes. We should head out now too."

Marsha narrowed her eyes and exhaled cigarette smoke.

"Going to cause more trouble, I suppose?"

Shirone smiled instead of answering, and as the applause died down, Rangi began her acceptance speech.

"Thank you, everyone. First, I'd like to thank the director of Beauty Style Hair Salon who made me who I am today, and..."

A contest official approached Shirone.

"Mage of the Ivory Tower, I should have told you earlier, but with the terrorist incident, things were so chaotic..."

He handed over sheet music for "Light Rain" with Maya's signature on it.

"Maya asked me to give this to you personally. She said just giving it to you would be enough for you to understand what she meant..."

Maya had said she would stay until the contest ended, but her agency would never have allowed that.

"I see."

Shirone nodded as he took in the lyrics filled with her heartfelt emotions.

"Yes, Maya was right. Thank you."

The reason she had left only her feelings behind without meeting face to face was her wish not to decide anything definitive.

'We'll be able to meet again.'

At an even higher place than now.

"Let's go. You said you were busy, right?"

After exchanging farewells with Marsha, Shirone left the capital with Jaystin.

The strange bird Kaidra, which had been circling in the sky, let out a cry and landed in front of them.

"We're going to ride that?"

Jaystin's eyes widened.

"Yeah. I rode it here too. It's the Kaidra that the Empress of Kashan rides personally. Its name is Ratussa."

Ratussa gently stroked Shirone's cheek with its beak.

'That's a Tier 3 monster.'

The strongest monster the Jaystin mercenary group had ever defeated was only Tier 5.

Though it was specialized for flight and might be overlooked, it was a powerful creature that could peck apart ordinary monsters like bugs.

"It doesn't eat people, right?"

"Haha! Of course not?"

Since even if it did eat people, it couldn't eat Shirone anyway, he had never actually confirmed this.

As Jaystin stared in terror, Shirone, who had mounted the Kaidra, beckoned temptingly.

"It's your first time, right? Come on up."

To her eyes, the Kaidra looked like a giant monster with Shirone riding it.

Arriving at the hotel and finishing packing, Rangi sat on the sofa sipping alcohol while waiting for her bodyguard to arrive.

"Sigh, anyway, it's over."

The joy of victory was brief, as all her past hardships flashed through her mind like a panorama.

'Shirone.'

At the end of the panorama remained the afterimage of the world's strongest mage.

Rangi, who had been looking at the "Archmage Who Defeats Dragons" that Shirone had left behind, shook her head.

"Idiot, what are you thinking?"

They lived in different worlds.

'It's not about being strong or weak, that's not the reason.'

What mages pursued was not material things but the spirit, and Rangi would never be able to understand them.

"Miss Rangi, I've brought Mr. Bernie."

"Please come in."

A man with messy hair and a sparse beard entered with timid gestures.

"Is it really Miss Rangi?"

Bernie seemed moved to tears at the sight of Rangi sitting on the sofa, his body trembling.

"Please sit. I wanted to personally express my gratitude, so I asked them to call you."

Having gone from being a World Beauty Contest enthusiast to a Rangi enthusiast, this was the greatest honor of his life.

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Rangi smiled with her eyes.

"Rather, I should be thanking you. You saved me back then."

When Meka's explosive rounds came flying at the mountain, he was the only one who jumped onto the stage.

"Did I really help at all?"

Since it was actually Shirone who had stopped the terrorism, he sat down with an awkward expression, but Rangi leaned forward.

"I'm sorry, but I don't have much time. I have to go to the royal palace for a congratulatory performance."

"Haha! Yes, of course. Just seeing Miss Rangi this close is enough for me."

"So if you have something to say, say it now."

"Pardon?"

Rangi's lips curved upward.

"Since you risked your life for me, I'll grant you a wish unofficially. You can ask for anything."

When he reached the one thought that came to mind, Bernie swallowed hard.

"Really?"

"Do you think I called you here to joke around? Tell me."

"You might think I'm strange, but if I'm really supposed to make a wish, tonight..."

Rangi nodded.

"Yes, tonight?"

Bernie squeezed his eyes shut and shouted.

"Please have dinner with me just once!"

"Yes, dinner... what?"

Rangi blinked.

"And, and I'm really sorry, I know it's shameless but it's my lifelong dream! Please, just once..."

Bernie hurriedly rummaged through his backpack and pulled out an optical camera he had bought for a fortune.

"If you could just take one photo with me..."

Seeing Rangi's stunned expression, he finished in a shrinking voice.

"Would that be okay?"

Rangi had no choice but to ask back.

"What? That's your real wish?"

Bernie was completely deflated.

"A photo together... to brag to my friends..."

"Haha, hahahaha!"

Rangi, her tension released, leaned back on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling, bursting into laughter.

'I see. That's what it was.'

Mages.

She felt she could understand their lives a little better now.

Imperial Palace Aganos.

"If you want to know about someone, take the most humble posture in front of them."

Uorin said.

"Humans want to feel superior, so they'll eventually reveal their true nature. But if someone still doesn't change even then..."

Gando answered.

"They're someone you can trust."

"No. You keep maintaining that humble posture until that person reveals their true self."

"It's a matter of who can endure longer. Some people easily waste their emotions. Criticizing and putting others down might make you seem a little superior, but there's nothing left, right?"

When emotions are revealed, desires disappear.

"The heart's sense of superiority is just an illusion. True superiority is visible to the eye."

Uorin spread both arms.

"The palace adorned with jewels, armies stretching to the horizon, vast amounts of gold coins. All things that could only be obtained by giving up the heart's sense of superiority."

This would be the philosophy of an emperor.

"So don't sell your emotions cheaply. Hide yourself and use others' thoughts. That's the whole game."

"I have a question."

Gando interjected.

"According to Your Majesty's theory, wouldn't revealing imperial techniques to me now also be taboo?"

"How perceptive."

Uorin walked to the window.

"Gando, by any chance, don't you want to become emperor?"

Now he understood.

"Mother."

"This is truly the great purification period. I have no more precedents left. In this completely unknown world, the person I've chosen is Shirone."

She had no intention of bearing a daughter.

"That's an extreme decision."

"It's an extreme world. Havitz's chaos is the natural enemy of logic-based Theraje."

"There's also the option of forming an alliance."

From Gando's perspective, Kashan and Gustav dividing the world wouldn't be bad either.

"You can't give up on Shirone."

"Haven't we been running for countless years? If now is the only opportunity to let Theraje's life bloom..."

They had endured eternity because someday they had to bloom.

"Master Shirone has arrived."

When the guard announced from outside, Uorin's face brightened like a young girl's.

"Let's go, Gando."

Watching her figure rushing toward the door, Gando let out a long breath.

'Emperor? Me?'

Gando was Theraje's son, though he had borrowed a womb, his genes weren't mixed.

'What are you seeing?'

He couldn't understand her giving up eons of history to live a lifetime with someone she loved.

'She's not someone who moves on emotion alone. Perhaps...'

We might have already reached the end of an era.

"Your skills have improved since before."

Gustav's military strategist Balkan said, looking down at the dozens of chess boards laid out in front of him.

"Really? I don't even know the rules properly."

Havitz had no interest in chess and simply placed pieces wherever he felt like it.

'That's what makes it bizarre.'

It seemed like he was playing randomly, but his win rate against Balkan, a genius strategist, was nearly 50%.

'He's not reading military tactics either. He just keeps fighting to create interesting situations.'

Because he didn't obsess over winning or losing, his win rate was 50%.

'If he decided to win, no, that also wouldn't suit chaos, would it?'

Balkan asked.

"What is Your Majesty's philosophy for ruling humans?"

Havitz's imperial theory was.

"There's no such thing. It's too simple. No matter how you classify apples, they're still apples in the end."

"But aren't there people like strawberries and people like pears in the world? All different types."

"I'm telling you there aren't."

Havitz looked up.

"Everyone thinks they're the best. But what if you lock them in a warehouse and beat them with clubs for three days?"

Havitz pretended to be in pain.

"Oh no, I'm dying! Yes! I'm an apple that's a pear! You're a god! I'm a dog!"

Balkan blinked.

"How strange. If they were really the best, they should remain the best whether beaten with clubs or having their organs pulled out, but they always change their tune."

"Hehe."

Havitz stroked his mustache.

"Then why do they think they're right in the first place? Must be some kind of disease."

"Puhahahaha!"

Balkan slapped his knee.

"Brilliant insight! Your Majesty!"

It was an uncommonly hot summer.

Record-breaking heat waves raged, and the border between Kashan and Gustav reeked of blood.

"With this, all preparations are complete."

To Uorin's left sat the Iruki team handling the Ex Machina, and to her right sat the Shirone team in charge of <Legal Murder>.

"This is the only chance to kill Havitz."

Minerva looked back at Abella, who stood at the center.

'Both Abella and Jaystin are in perfect condition, but the one with higher probability is actually Alpha Fish.'

During the six months staying at the imperial palace, Abella and Jaystin never once encountered each other.

Considering their respective connections, it was natural, but in reality, it was a strategic decision.

"Yous Abella. Now countless lives depend on your hands. You know this, right?"

"Don't worry. I won't make any mistakes."

There was no trace of tension on Abella's face after repeatedly analyzing and studying with top experts.

'Uncle Havitz, I'm coming. To kill you.'

Since the emperor had a brutal personality, it was natural for servants to flee and for him to suffer from labor shortages.

"I'll depart now."

Alpha Fish's first mission was to enter Gustav Empire as a maid and have an audience with Havitz.
