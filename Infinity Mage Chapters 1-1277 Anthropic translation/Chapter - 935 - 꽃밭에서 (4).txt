In the Flower Garden (4)

Though Ymir couldn't annihilate Guffin, merely delaying his movements for a considerable time was enough to achieve its initial purpose upon creation.

On that day when tragedy began, Ikael held the child in her arms and fled with all her might.

Ankera used the Akashic Records to strip Ikael of her authority, and countless angels and maras attacked.

Ashur, Lete, Ramus.

The three great guardian deities who served under Ikael fought fiercely, but with Ikael's authority gone, they had no means to endure.

In the fierce battle, two maras were annihilated, and even Ashur, the sole survivor, suffered fatal wounds.

Ikael and the child were imprisoned in Heaven's jail, and soon after, the day of execution arrived.

Countless subjects gathered in the square pointed fingers at Ikael and shouted.

"Punishment for the fallen angel! Pain! Annihilation!"

Even while being humiliated by those she once ruled, Ikael worried only for the child.

"Please! Just kill me instead! Please, spare our child!"

The maras shouted back.

"Shut up! What kind of angel are you! Noble spirit? You're nothing but lewd!"

Sirone shed tears.

'Ikael.'

Though this was his second time witnessing this process, he couldn't suppress his emotions upon seeing Ikael's sobbing figure.

Everyone was looking at her with contempt.

"Kill her! Kill her! Kill the fallen creature!"

Particularly Kariel glared at Ikael with eyes filled not just with contempt, but hatred close to loathing.

'She bore a human child?'

He didn't even want to know how that was possible.

'The archangel I considered most noble... harbored bestial desires.'

"Please, please just spare the child... I beg you."

Ikael looked around at the archangels with a desperate expression, but they all averted their gazes.

Only Kariel met her eyes, his halo trembling violently.

'So why did you do such a thing?'

Why?

What could that lump of flesh possibly offer to the most powerful, noble angel who monopolized God's love?

'Then what am I? Ikael, what are we angels to you?'

Though to varying degrees, all the angels must have been thinking the same thing.

"Waaah. Waaah."

The child cried miserably.

Though it seemed like animal instinct sensing death, Sirone knew better.

The child was simply responding to Ikael's voice.

"Begin the execution!"

The triangular mara of Odel, the Angel of Punishment, approached with a massive axe.

When flames shooting from its nostrils touched the child, Ikael lost all composure.

"No! Stop! Aaaaah! Aaaaah!"

Though her amplification ability was sealed, her screams carried far across the heavens.

"Hnngh..."

In Satiel's quarters, huddled in a corner, she clutched her head upon hearing that sound.

"Aaaah! Aaaah!"

Each time Ikael's screams reached her, it felt like her halo was being shattered to pieces.

"How long are you going to keep whimpering?"

Methiel, the Archangel of Union, entered.

Seeing Satiel crouched half-mad, her expression immediately turned fierce.

"You got what you wanted, didn't you? But now you're acting weak? Don't tell me you're feeling guilty?"

"Get out."

Satiel's voice was bitingly cold, but Methiel grew even angrier.

"You really don't suit being an archangel. Too weak. You used to follow Ikael so devotedly, then you betrayed her, and now you're playing the victim. What kind of angel are you really..."

Methiel stopped speaking.

Satiel had risen, and in her eyes burned an untouchable killing intent.

"What did you say? Say it again. I'll kill you."

"Did I do something wrong? No, Ikael committed the sin. She bore a human child. Yes, I did what I had to do as an angel. Lord Ankera even praised me. So what's the problem?"

Satiel found a way to escape the pain.

"Right, humans are the problem. Those worthless lumps of flesh are the ones disrupting the world."

In Satiel's eyes, once thought to resemble humans most closely, now dwelt only a cold pride like law itself.

"Right."

Methiel could only answer thus.

Provoking her further might cause her to break even the taboos of angels.

"Beheading!"

With someone's shout, the triangular mara's axe severed the child's neck.

"Aaaaah! Aaaaah!"

The sound of half-mad Ikael shrieking was torture even for the archangels.

"My baby! Our baby!"

Ikael, shedding tears of blood and wailing, contorted her face in agony and screamed.

"You bastards!"

At this madness of a different sort, not just the archangels but even the subjects turned to look at Ikael.

"What sin have I committed! Open the White Mirror! I'll reveal the whole truth myself!"

"White Mirror? Hehe, do you still think you're an archangel?"

At the mara's mockery, Ikael grew even angrier, her eyes bloodshot as she continued.

"I am without sin! The one who sinned isn't me but Ankera! I'll expose exactly what he did!"

'She's completely lost her mind.'

All the angels thought so.

"Listen carefully! Ankera is not God! Ankera, in his meeting with Guffin..."

Time stopped.

And memories began to be erased from the minds of all beings, including the angels.

At this point, Sirone realized.

'When I first met Ikael in Heaven.'

She was imprisoned in Arabot for committing a great sin, but all beings had forgotten what that sin was.

'It wasn't Ikael's sin.'

What Ankera truly wanted to erase was his own sin of breaking his promise with Guffin.

'God broke his promise. He lied.'

Could there be clearer proof that this world was unstable?

Having reached the worst situation due to Guffin, Ankera couldn't reset.

'If he resets, it's also an opportunity for Guffin.'

So what he chose was to erase only specific events from the Akashic Records.

This type of erasure would cause cracks throughout the whole, but leaving it alone would destroy everything entirely.

Sirone gently stroked the face of Ikael, who slept peacefully having lost her memories.

'Forget it all.'

Perhaps this would be her only respite.

Humans who had lost their memories continued living as busily as ever.

Angels too faithfully performed their duties while harboring unease about their empty memories.

'I have sinned.'

Only Ikael remained trapped in her quarters in Arabot, unable to take a single step outside.

'I caused Lord Ankera an unforgivable wound.'

Only guilt remained.

'What kind of sin was it?'

Currently, the other archangels were tracking the last remaining Gaian, Mclain Guffin.

As long as even one individual existed, complete dismantling of the Ultima System was impossible.

'Guffin. I definitely know him, but I can't remember.'

It felt like information that had filled her halo had disappeared, leaving only feelings behind.

Fighting, conflicting, shouting.

'That kind of feeling.'

But on the other hand.

'Was I... happy?'

If so, it didn't make sense.

The only thing she could guess was that she had known him from very long ago.

'Anyway, I'm not an archangel. I don't need to worry about it until I repent for my sins.'

On a night with a crescent moon.

Ikael rose from her bed.

"Who's there?"

Beyond the curtain of darkness where moonlight didn't reach, a human as tall as an angel stood.

"It's me."

The moment she saw Guffin's face, Ikael was stunned.

"A Gaian? How are you here?"

As Ikael tried to rise, Guffin smiled and extended his hand.

"It's okay. Just stay sitting."

As if by magic, she found herself passionately wanting to remain still.

"I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I couldn't protect you."

When Guffin knelt on one knee and grasped her wrist, Ikael hastily shook him off.

If the being before her was the only Gaian, there was no need to even ask his name.

"Guffin, do you know where you are? I'll capture you right now and present you to Lord Ankera."

At her cold voice, Guffin's heart crumbled.

'You are my everything.'

He wanted to cry out that they had loved each other, that they were connected with all their hearts.

Guffin wiped away tears and said.

"I came to say goodbye."

Only Guffin knew how sad Ikael must have been after losing the child.

'You don't need to remember. Forget it forever.'

If this could keep Ikael from hurting, Guffin was willing to leave.

"Are you saying you'll give up your life voluntarily?"

Not understanding Guffin's words, Ikael suddenly asked as if something had occurred to her.

"No, rather, why are you saying such things to me?"

Guffin couldn't bear it.

"Because I love you."

"Nonsense! This is ultimately a trick to humiliate me! Even now I should... Huh?"

Ikael, who had been furiously angry, suddenly stopped speaking when she felt something flowing down her cheek.

"Why?"

Tears of light were flowing down like a waterfall.

"Why am I crying?"

Watching her, Guffin smiled sadly with moist eyes.

"Even if memories disappear, emotions remain."

That is what the heart is.

"So even if you don't remember, I'm not sad. I'll take your heart with me."

Ikael's tears floated through the air and settled on Guffin's palm.

"Emotions remain?"

Ikael was still confused.

'Why won't the tears stop? Why does it hurt so much? What could I have done with this human...'

"You don't need to struggle. As long as the heart remains, someday you'll know everything. And then..."

Guffin caressed Ikael's cheek.

"I hope you won't be sad."

He rose and gently kissed her halo, making Ikael's body tremble.

'This feeling. This sensation.'

It was definitely familiar.

No, not just familiar - her mind felt comforted as if she had repeated this for a lifetime.

"Farewell, Ikael."

Ikael could only watch as Guffin's body transformed into light and disappeared.

The room fell silent again.

"Ah. Ahhhhh."

As if something in her mind had broken, Ikael's tears didn't stop all night long.

The place where Guffin fled to escape the archangels' pursuit was where Sojeonghwa's ark had arrived.

It was Sirone's planet.

'It's changed a lot.'

The humans born from the giant's body looked different from Guffin, but their direction in life was similar.

They too were descendants of the Gaians.

'Is this still the primitive age?'

Communities that had achieved early civilization were appearing one by one, but reaching truth was still far off.

Guffin turned his back on civilizations where only bloody wars continued for accumulating more wealth.

'It's not time to intervene.'

Even if he told them the world's secrets, nothing would change.

"What should I do now?"

Civilization occupied only a tiny area, and Guffin walked through the planet's great nature while thinking.

Though he had captured Ikael's heart in Hexa, the sense of loss from losing the child was great for Guffin too.

"How futile."

Perhaps this was what the world was like.

Feeling he needed time to reflect on everything, Guffin stopped walking for the first time.

Walking on two feet across the surface of a vast lake, he sat cross-legged on a lotus flower.

"Well then, I'll be in your care for a while. Please take care of me."

Though it was just a plant that could neither hear nor speak, it was Guffin's only companion.

"My heart is badly wounded, you see. Even if I wanted to lament my fate, there's no one to listen."

Going back in time, Guffin recalled when everything began.

"Long, long ago, there was a race called Gaia."

It was a story spanning forty thousand years.
