[693] Chapter of Reunion (2)

The king and high-ranking officials had anticipated the Ivory Tower's appearance, but the pressure of having success or failure thrust before their eyes was overwhelming.

King Adolf broke the silence that was heavier than steel beams and spoke.

"For what reason has the Ivory Tower visited the Kingdom of Tormia? The kingdom has never done anything harmful to humanity."

The corners of Tsuoi's mouth curved coldly upward.

"You know things get complicated when I have to hear it directly from my own mouth, right? It would be best to confess obediently."

The System Inspection Department was the division within the Ivory Tower most closely connected to the political situations of various nations.

As they dealt with diplomatic difficulties, famine and refugees, and wars, meeting kings of various nations was commonplace, and they knew how to handle them accordingly.

"Of course there was a major incident recently, but we only eliminated the terrorist organization that threatened the kingdom."

Tsuoi lifted her skirt.

"How rude. Peeping at a lady's underwear."

King Adolf didn't even lower his gaze.

"This is your last chance. Mock me one more time and I'll grab you by the collar, king or not."

The pupils of King Adolf, who kept his mouth firmly shut, wavered.

'What exactly does she want me to do?'

The high-ranking mages and royal guard soldiers protecting the king were equally burning with anger inside.

'Damn it! Does she think we're holding back because we're afraid?'

No matter how strong an Ivory Tower mage might be, if they died fighting, so be it - there was no need to endure such humiliation.

But this wasn't a matter of personal feelings; it concerned the entire kingdom.

A single wrong word choice could result in losses amounting to billions of gold, and if the Ivory Tower residents backing the castle decided to deny the Kingdom of Tormia itself, everything would be over.

Adolf spoke in a somewhat gentler voice.

"We have nothing to hide."

Tsuoi's eyes turned cold.

"You persist in your pretense. Let's see if you can maintain that even when kneeling before me."

At that moment, the doors of the Grand Hall burst open urgently as a group entered.

"Sorry for being late, Your Majesty."

Magic Association President Rufist offered a brief bow, and Shirone's group, who followed behind, looked around nervously.

'That woman...'

The first thing that caught Shirone's eye was undoubtedly Tsuoi.

A woman with dark skin and curly hair tied up with hundreds of rubber bands, standing up like horns.

Even if he had encountered her anywhere other than the royal castle, her aura was powerful enough to be suffocating.

"What are you?"

"I am Magic Association President Rufist. I'm also the person in charge of the Radum incident. If you have something to say, say it to me."

Tsuoi snorted.

"This place is also full of idiots. The Ivory Tower is not subject to compromise. Confess obediently and you won't suffer humiliation."

"What should I confess?"

"These kingdoms really..."

As Tsuoi lifted her skirt, Iruki, Kido, and Rian wore blank expressions.

"What's with those polka-dotted panties? What are we supposed to do about it?"

Though Kido pointed directly, Tsuoi didn't react and stared intently at Rufist's face.

"..."

Then she suddenly turned around and waved her hand at the officials.

"See? There you go. You can do it if you try."

The officials, unable to find any difference from Adolf's reaction, frowned in displeasure.

'What's supposed to be different? Is she just ignoring us?'

"But..."

Tsuoi turned around again and pointed at Shirone.

"Who are you?"

Among all the people in the Grand Hall, only Rufist and this boy hadn't looked at her panties.

"I am Arian Shirone."

"Shirone? Ah, so you're Shirone?"

It made sense if he was an Ivory Tower candidate.

'I heard his combat ability is decent. He's gone quite deep into this territory.'

Not looking at something is much more difficult than it seems.

Even the act of not looking at something is merely one methodology of looking at something.

Therefore, one must forget completely.

Just as one wouldn't know gold coins existed under the beautiful tree behind the mountain until hearing about it.

"Arian Shirone?"

The officials murmured, and even King Adolf showed interest as he examined Shirone.

'That boy...'

The student who graduated from magic school with the highest score in the kingdom's history, and the talent he had let slip away.

The fact that Tsuoi, who even pointed fingers at the king, moderated her tone with Shirone added to his regret.

'An Ivory Tower resident. I thought she was just being unreasonable, but she knows how to acknowledge someone.'

There was probably some realm that Adolf couldn't enter, but since being king was simply a governing profession, it wasn't something to hurt his pride over.

"Good, I'll give you special human treatment."

Tsuoi turned completely toward Rufist.

"Bring the Creature's seed immediately. I'll destroy it personally."

Rufist shook his head.

"Was that it? But the Kingdom of Tormia doesn't have it. We never collected it in the first place."

Shirone's mind became complicated.

'Didn't collect it?'

After La Enemy was destroyed, hadn't Rufist definitely gone to the fallen Creature to collect the seed?

"Then where is the seed now?"

"I don't know. Either it never existed, or if it did exist, it's with whoever has it."

Tsuoi chewed her lips thoughtfully.

'Are these guys getting cocky?'

Of course Rufist was telling the truth, but such psychological traps were exactly the kind of fraud used against the Ivory Tower.

"You really won't regret this? You know this isn't something that ends just by avoiding the immediate storm, right?"

"Of course."

Rufist bowed his head.

'This is a matter I can't even report to the king.'

When Grand Judge Terraforce destroyed La Enemy, many people began losing memories of specific periods.

Due to the worldwide phenomenon called amnesia disease, it was obvious that the Ivory Tower's attention would focus on Tormia.

Therefore, the plan was to endure by giving up ownership of the Creature until the storm passed.

"You've been scheming. I hope today's decision doesn't become a disaster."

"It won't come to that."

Tsuoi also suspected there was a way to retrieve it, but from now on it was a political matter.

"Let's go, Musso."

As Tsuoi left the Grand Hall with Musso, Iruki addressed the king.

"Sorry for the commotion, Your Majesty. We'll also withdraw now."

The officials, who no longer feared anything, shouted.

"What? Is the royal castle your playground? Where do you think this is, barging in and out as you please!"

"We apologize. But the association president here..."

"It's fortunate that the Ivory Tower matter passed safely, otherwise we could have suffered great losses! And what's with that goblin?"

The stress they'd received from Tsuoi seemed considerable.

"That's enough."

Adolf raised his hand.

"Didn't they come running to help me anyway?"

Iruki chimed in.

"Exactly, Your Majesty. Don't they say it's better when several people get beaten together?"

The color drained from Shirone's face.

'Please stop, you crazy bastard.'

Though it could be taken as a rude joke, Adolf laughed pleasantly.

The talent who would become the successor to Albino as head of the Thunder Dragons.

Someday, he would have to stake the nation's fate on this young man.

"Right. You and Shirone are from the same school?"

"Yes, we're irreplaceable friends. Today he came looking for me with an urgent request. In that sense, may we withdraw first?"

Adolf looked back and forth between Iruki and Shirone.

'Friends...'

He hoped Shirone would become a star of the Ivory Tower.

"You may withdraw."

"Thank you."

As Iruki turned to leave, Adolf added.

"Ah, before that, I have something to tell Shirone."

Shirone spoke respectfully.

"Yes, Your Majesty. Please speak."

"Regrettably, I failed to recognize your true worth."

Though he had once been frustrated by social barriers, it had ultimately been his own choice.

However, hearing such words from the person involved made him feel a pang inside.

"Your Majesty, I..."

Adolf spoke first.

"On behalf of all citizens of Tormia, I sincerely apologize for wounding your heart."

The atmosphere in the Grand Hall stirred.

Though they knew it was political rhetoric, something warm rose in Shirone's heart too.

"Thank you, Your Majesty."

Iruki and Rian, who were watching, felt even happier than Shirone.

'Finally getting recognition, Shirone.'

Of course, Rian knew better than anyone that Shirone wouldn't stop here.

After leaving the Grand Hall, Shirone's group rushed down the corridor, worried that Tsuoi might have already left the castle.

They could see two figures leaving the castle in the distance.

"Wait! Please wait a moment!"

"What?"

As Tsuoi turned with an annoyed expression, Shirone ran faster toward her.

"I have something to ask. About the Ivory Tower test passing criteria."

"Ivory Tower test? Ah, La Enemy? Why ask me? You should inquire with the Human Safety Enforcement Department or the Balance Department."

Even though the world had nearly headed toward catastrophe, the Ivory Tower still maintained strict departmental divisions.

"Still, something..."

Since Shirone was probably the only one among the three candidates to have encountered the actual La Enemy, he thought special rules should be added by the Ivory Tower.

"I really don't know. The test criteria are in the domain where Taeseong's Kar operates."

Tsuoi hesitated for a moment, then spoke.

"I'm only telling you because you asked, but I heard the other two competitors are already close to passing."

"What? Already?"

It hadn't even been a month since the test began.

"Why so surprised? It's not particularly difficult, is it? Just find La Enemy and come to the Ivory Tower."

'I can't let my guard down.'

Perhaps because the Radum incident was so significant, had he thought he'd accomplished something?

The ground task was ultimately about meeting the standards presented by the Ivory Tower.

"I think you'll receive the title of Star."

Though she spoke honestly on impulse, Shirone only felt bitter inside.

"Why do you think so?"

"First, you're overwhelming in combat ability, and above all, your judgment has destructive power. Some residents point to Jinseong-eum, but I think that kid's Kar is a bit lacking. He's upright but feels a bit hasty."

Just from the description of Kar, he could roughly guess what kind of person it was.

"Do residents also predict who will pass?"

"Of course. We even conducted a survey targeting the Stars recently. We're busy to death."

"A survey? What were the results?"

Tsuoi pursed her lips.

"Do you really have to hear it?"

"Yes. I want to hear it."

Though anxious, he couldn't not hear it after coming this far.

"27 people voted total, and you came in first place. A whopping 17 people supported you."

"...I see."

"Second place was Jinseong-eum. 9 people supported him."

Shirone's eyes became hollow.

"Then I... received one vote?"

Tsuoi patted his shoulder, consoling him like it was someone else's problem.

"Don't worry too much. We're not prophets or anything, we just think this person will make it. Kar is about asserting yourself, right?"

Though he wasn't hurt, he did find the vote distribution strange.

"So one of the Stars thinks I'll make it?"

"That's right. But I don't know who. It was anonymous voting. However..."

There was such a rumor.

The rumor that the person who voted for Shirone was the greatest Star in the Ivory Tower, Taeseong.

'Is it true? But that person rarely has different opinions from the Five Great Stars.'

"However what?"

'It's not certain anyway.'

Tsuoi shook her head.

"Nothing. Anyway, work hard. I kind of like you."

She detested people who looked at her panties.

"I'll cheer for you. Though the voting is over, of course."

As Tsuoi and Musso flew away through spatial movement, Iruki scratched his head and approached.

"It seems like among us, you're number one in extreme jobs?"

"It's fine. I gained as much as I lost."

Though he might be behind his competitors in progress, Shirone's Kar level had risen higher than before.

Rian gripped his shoulder and said.

"We're going to win, Shirone."

Tsuoi's words were no longer in Shirone's mind.

"Of course."
