Groggy (2)

The man managing the unnamed shelter was a mage named Veterus.

He revealed nothing beyond his name, but there was a military scent about him as he commanded the shelter.

'Veterus.'

If he were a famous mage, Rian would have heard of him, but he never had.

Even Shirone, who was more well-versed in the mage community than Rian, showed no particular reaction, though it would have been the same even if he had known.

"Come on, come on! Hurry up with the tent work. It's going to rain tonight."

The person who actually led the survivors was a woman named Marine, the shelter's second-in-command.

She was also a soldier, but judging by her relationship with Veterus, they didn't seem to have known each other from before.

'A deserter, perhaps.'

Hell's army was truly powerful, so running away wasn't something just anyone could do.

It would be reasonable to think they had left their unit before battle broke out.

"Hey, newcomers! You guys hurry up and help too! Unless you want to sleep outside!"

Whether it was the aftermath of the typhoon that had hit the Gustav Empire, it rained frequently in the central continent.

Having already given up their horses, Rian decided to stay at the shelter until the rain stopped.

"Move aside, I'll do it."

With only 100 survivors, they were overwhelmed just clearing corpses and collecting food from the vicinity.

The shelter was still a mess, and above all, heavy building debris was hindering their work.

When Rian easily lifted a rock as big as a person's torso, people's eyes changed.

"Wow."

When Rian casually threw the rock he had shouldered, it flew several meters and crashed down with a thud.

Marine, sensing the power of Schema, asked.

"You're pretty strong, huh? No wonder you carry such a big sword around. Who taught you?"

Though he had been influenced by countless swordsmen, there was no one he could specifically call a master.

"Well. If I had to say, from everything?"

Even after saying it himself, Rian chuckled, thinking it was an unsuitable philosophy.

Marine also seemed to think he was being cocky, slightly frowning as she asked.

"What's your name?"

Rian looked back at Shirone.

Despite receiving people's stares, Shirone seemed unconcerned, just lost in thought.

'He needs time.'

Leaving quietly would be the way to help Shirone.

"Just..."

When Rian trailed off, Marine became even more displeased.

"Fine. Acting all high and mighty."

Since he was someone who would leave once the rain stopped anyway, she didn't press further.

"Hey! You, kid over there!"

A man in his mid-forties who had been clearing debris from the floor couldn't stand it anymore and pointed accusingly at Shirone.

"Don't you see everyone working! Do you think you're still nobility? Hurry up and help!"

Shirone showed no reaction.

'Nobility.'

Memories flashed quickly through his mind, from being born the son of a mountain hunter to becoming one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower.

'What am I, really.'

A self-deprecating smile formed, and that expression came across as an insult to the man.

"This bastard really..."

Thud.

The ground shook as a massive rock crashed down.

As the man looked back in surprise, Rian, who had thrown a rock twice as large as before, said.

"Leave him alone. Can't I just work twice as hard to cover for my friend?"

"Eeeek!"

The man clenched both fists but cooled his anger after seeing the size of the rock Rian had thrown.

"Tch! Damn annoying bastard!"

Even after being cursed at, Rian continued working without complaint, so Marine approached.

"What's wrong with your friend anyway? Did he lose his mind from the shock of war?"

It wasn't entirely wrong.

"Something like that."

The woman clicked her tongue.

"It's impressive he survived. Being so weak and pathetic, how does he plan to live from now on."

Rian was worried about that too.

'He's very tired.'

He had been beaten down by the world.

Just because he had endured to the end without kneeling didn't mean the places where he'd been hit didn't hurt.

Would Shirone be able to love the world again?

"Utterly pathetic."

Veterus, who had been directing and supervising from afar, passed by Rian and quickly approached Shirone.

Rian said in a low tone.

"Hey."

But Veterus paid no attention and conjured flames in front of Shirone.

At the same time, the killing intent rising from Rian froze Marine's body beside him.

"Huh."

When the scream rising from her belly got stuck in her throat, her chest felt like it would burst.

When Veterus cast a fireball not at Shirone but outside the shelter, Rian's killing intent disappeared like a lie.

"Haaaaah."

The feeling of tension disappearing was like an orgasm, making her moan involuntarily.

'What was that? That feeling just now...'

It was a stimulus and sensation that exceeded what she could imagine based on experience.

Rian's gaze was fixed on Veterus.

"See that? This is what magic is."

Shirone didn't even turn his head.

"What kind of effort do you think I made to gain this ability? I trained my mind every day, practiced without rest."

Veterus's eyes held disgust.

"It was agony beyond what someone like you could even imagine. But I gritted my teeth and endured. Even in a world like this, I struggle somehow to live."

For the first time, Shirone's gaze turned toward Veterus.

"Do you know why I hate you? Because you're selfish. If I were you, no matter how hard it was, I would have gotten up! I would have done anything!"

"I'm sure you would. But..."

Shirone said weakly.

"You're not me."

Veterus, his temper flaring, grabbed Shirone by the collar and dragged him.

"Get up! Nothing is impossible! You can't do anything because you're soaked in defeatist thinking! Don't wait for someone else to do it for you, grit your teeth and move!"

"I don't want to do anything."

Shirone's body seemed stuck to the ground, and Veterus roughly threw away his grip on the collar.

"Tch! You think the world is easy? Where is there anyone here who isn't struggling? You should at least pretend to try."

Shirone pulled his legs closer and fell into thought.

'I see.'

No matter how hard he tried, no matter what bleeding agony he endured, no one would acknowledge Shirone's life.

What reaction would Veterus show if he heard the words "Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower"?

'Words! Words! Words! I'm sick of it.'

Shirone was also human, so he couldn't help but resent the demons who massacred people.

But on the other hand, he wondered if we humans, who define the whole based on seeing one aspect of a person, were really so great.

'If you're not going to live in their place...'

Humans need to be a little more silent about others.

"Pathetic fool. I'm only putting up with this until today. Get lost as soon as dawn breaks tomorrow."

Veterus still wasn't appeased, but Marine finally felt the seriousness of the situation.

Rian's killing intent had lasted only a moment, but it was enough to change the mind of someone who had survived by reading the atmosphere in the army.

"Veterus, look at me for a moment."

"What is it?"

Just as he was thinking that Marine's complexion didn't look good, the sound of flying objects came from outside the shelter.

"Kahahaha! Found them! Humans, humans!"

When the survivors looked up with pale faces, they could see red things flying around outside the unfinished tent.

"De-demons."

It was unexpected that demons had come to a place where barely over 100 humans lived.

"Damn it! Everyone take defensive positions..."

Before Veterus could finish giving orders, dozens of fireballs fell and devastated the surroundings.

"Aaaaah! Someone save us!"

In the shelter that had become hell on earth, only Shirone and Rian remained motionless.

"Don't burn them! We have to eat them!"

Seeing the number of demons that landed with folded wings, Veterus trembled.

'Too many...'

There were easily over thirty of them.

But that was by Veterus's standards - to Shirone and Rian, it might as well have been nothing.

'It's not an army. They're deserters too.'

For the two who had faced opponents numbering from thousands to tens of millions, there was no emotional disturbance.

The demons, over two meters tall with spear-like long tails, rubbed their bellies and spoke in human language.

"I thought this place would be another bust, but there are humans here. I thought I'd starve to death, but this worked out well."

"Oh? There are women here too! Kiki ki!"

Veterus realized that the fireball's timing had been very unfortunate.

'Damn it! Because of that bastard...!'

When he turned his head with sharp eyes, Shirone's still indifferent face looked even more hateful.

"Quite a lot of people. I'll give you a choice."

As if enjoying entertainment after a long time, the demons leisurely pointed at the people.

"First, only half of you get eaten by us. Second, each of you cuts off one arm and one leg to offer us."

Whatever they chose would be enough quantity for thirty demons to eat.

"Give us time. We need to coordinate opinions..."

"What's so important that you need to coordinate? You seem to be the leader, so decide for yourself."

Veterus swallowed hard.

If he chose the first condition to sacrifice only half, he could definitely survive.

'I just need to endure momentary shame.'

Marine's eyes conveyed the same meaning.

"We'll save half."

"Puhehehe! Good, that's interesting too. Then could you quickly select who gets eaten? We're very hungry."

It would probably be a difficult decision, but choosing the first victim was all too easy.

Veterus pointed at Shirone.

"That one."

"Wow, this guy is completely cold! He didn't even hesitate! Anyway, good. Hey, you're the winner!"

Shirone didn't move.

"Hey! Come over here! The leader here sold you out!"

"Puhehehe! Completely paralyzed with fear. Good, if you're escaping reality, I'll have to wake you up to it."

A demon standing behind stomped its reptilian claws on the ground as it approached Shirone.

"Hey, hey, kid! Snap out of it."

The demon with protruding laugh lines shook his shoulder, but Shirone didn't even turn his head.

"Kuku, completely out of it..."

The demon bent 90 degrees to the side to peer into Shirone's face and stopped speaking.

A very long silence followed.

"What are you doing? Hurry up and bring him. We're hungry."

The demon's lips parted slightly.

"Uh..."

He seemed to be choosing his words, but in reality, no thoughts came to mind.

"Uh, uh uh..."

The demon slowly backed away with a terrified expression and fell on his behind with a thud.

"Uah... uaaaah..."

The survivors - no, even Veterus and Marine who had served in the army - had never seen a demon terrified before.

'Why is he acting like that?'

As if unaware of falling, the demon's legs were still making backing-away motions.

"Run, run away."

"Run? Why would we run..."

Before the words could finish, the demon in front of Shirone crawled on the ground with both hands and screamed.

"It's Yahweeeeh!"

Shirone turned his head.

The moment they confirmed his face, the demons recalled the downpour of light that had fallen on the Gustav Empire.

"Kieeeee!"

With souls drained from their faces, they shrieked and spread their wings in unison.

"Stop."

"Kie??????!"

The screams cut off abruptly and the demons' movements stopped.

"You guys, come over here for a moment."

Before Yahweh, who had blown away an entire empire, they couldn't even think of running away.

As thirty demons walked over glancing at each other nervously, Veterus's face went blank.

'Yahweh?'

The mythical story he had heard countless times in the army.

"The Infinite Mage?"
