The Beron Problem (4)

The ability name is Image Copy.

It's magic that can output and extract what's memorized in the mind, belonging to the irregular category.

"This is quite expensive stuff. Because..."

As Fermi activated the magic, the documents he had been holding just moments ago were perfectly replicated.

"It can revolutionize labor reduction. Once you memorize everything, you can keep printing it out." That was why time had been so pressing.

"So? What are you planning to do with that?"

"Information entropy. The value of information changes depending on how many people know it. For example..."

Fermi leaned his face forward.

"Our mutual tastes. That absolutely cannot leak out, right?"

Seriel's face flushed slightly.

"Want to die?"

"Anyway, that's how it is. Currently, the people who know information about the future are me and Syura. Probably the King of Iron will know too..."

Fermi handed over the documents.

"Here, take one."

Knowing the value of the documents, Seriel had no choice but to accept them even though she knew it was a joke.

And then she realized.

"You, don't tell me?"

"That's right. Information that everyone knows has no value. From now on, I'm going to send these documents as official correspondence to all 12 Holy Empire nations. In other words, this information becomes worthless."

"But is it really okay to do that? Once everyone knows, it'll become uncontrollable from that point on. Unless there's a way to update the information."

"That won't work." Now that they'd reached the end of Omega Year 999, going back to Apocalypse would be impossible.

'Even if we went, mining would be impossible.'

Divine intervention was almost certain.

"There's no particular need to update it. What's contained in the documents is information about the Holy Empire's leadership. I didn't include anything truly important."

Of course, they probably wouldn't be interested anyway.

"Important information?"

As Fermi thought of Amy's death and closed his mouth, Seriel also stopped asking.

'I'm sorry, Sirone.'

The reason for apologizing to his eternal rival was that Sirone was the only one who had accepted his way of thinking.

'No one else...'

Would try to erase their memory even knowing about their loved one's death.

Leaving Seriel behind, he opened the window and watched the countless events occurring outside Delta.

'The time of the end.'

Feeling as if the world's compass was spinning wildly, Fermi raised his hand.

'Image Copy.'

Holding dozens of documents with the same content, Fermi asked in a quiet voice:

"How far can humans see?"

He would not run away.

'I am Yorga's son.'

One who sees far.

No, to become one who sees the end.

Turning his head again, Fermi scattered the bundle of documents toward the window all at once.

As white papers flew around like butterflies, everyone outside headquarters turned their heads.

"What's that?"

Fermi looked back at Seriel and smiled.

"Entropy zero."

Therefore... the future was back to square one.

Meanwhile, Syura, having received information from Fermi, walked down the corridor with cold eyes.

Though she had quickly skimmed through the documents, she didn't really care about something like the World Leadership.

Rather, what filled her mind was the topic Fermi had raised.

'He calls it the Beron Problem.'

It was the story of the iron pole that Beron, first in the Council of Ten's hierarchy, had planted in the Iron Kingdom.

'His will is still imprinted in that time and space, transcending the law.'

An iron heart planted in the world.

'Can humans truly change the future?'

Even if one knew the future and took different actions, what if that too was already a predetermined future?

'Beron wanted to push that problem to its limit. It's not just a philosophical pillar. Even now, the iron pole stands there, withstanding divine law.'

If God pulls out that pillar, it would be God's victory, but if God cannot pull it out...

'Humans can change it.'

They would create a future completely different from God's will.

'I wait.'

Syura gripped the documents in her hand.

As long as the iron pole exists in the Iron Kingdom, she would grant what the king desires.

'Until the true king returns.'

Sirone's face was pale as he climbed the Ivory Tower.

'There's no end.' The demons were divided into 1st, 2nd, and 3rd corps, occupying key positions on each floor.

"Kill Yahweh...!"

The demons caught in Miracle Stream's flash screamed and rolled on the floor.

"Kraaaah!"

Normally they should have been purified long ago, but only half their bodies had melted.

'They've gotten stronger.'

More than anything, the question was how much stronger Baal, the 1st Corps Commander, had become compared to before.

"Kill! Don't fear annihilation! The more we resist, the more Yahweh will suffer!"

The demons had lost all fear.

'It's not courage.'

The fact that making others unhappy is more important than one's own happiness...

'Ataraxia.'

Was it the inevitable nature of demons?

"Kraaaah!"

Before the amplified power, this time even the demons couldn't maintain their form.

Where the flash had passed, only a pair of demon ankles remained forlornly.

"Haa! Haa!"

Sirone recovered his mental strength again.

'They're buying time.'

The strategy was to tie Sirone down here while Baal eliminated Taeseong.

Of course, the stars of the Ivory Tower were also guarding the upper floors, so he wouldn't reach easily.

But now he couldn't be certain.

Passing between the demons with only ankles remaining, Sirone felt his emotions surge.

"There are no humans who rejoice in others' misfortune."

Simply because they're not happy now, because they have no other means of happiness besides that.

"They just follow the methodology of evil." He wanted to believe that.

Sirone also hated evil and thought one should take responsibility for results, but...

'I want to believe they can change.'

If good and evil were simply determined by causes, what could humans actually choose?

Shagar screamed.

"It won't change!"

His mind was half gone from Etela's pain transmitted through Taegeuk's chains.

"What do you know?"

Blood tears flowed from Shagar's eyes as he killed the demons blocking his path indiscriminately.

If all the past was just memories manipulated by God...

"You haven't lived like me!" Would anyone become like Shagar?

"I am evil! Absolute evil! I'll kill everyone! If I kill them all and only I remain..."

Would this resentment disappear then?

"Uaaaah!"

In tremendous pain, Shagar fell to his knees.

Etela's sorrowful emotions fueled Shagar's rage, and that rage went back to Etela again.

Thus Taegeuk grew without knowing limits.

Remaining purification time: 82 years, 873 kyung, 7,601 trillion... Haah...

The Informator's sigh could be heard.

Though it was clearly a broadcast accident, Riona, the Informator from Hwagong Company, didn't care.

'Four years of time evaporated at once.' Such enormous karma.

Of course she had known, but when they first came to this world, Riona couldn't have imagined.

Just how this karma could be purified.

'Such a result.'

At the conclusion of two people who seemed like they would be in hell until the universe ended, her thoughts deepened.

Vivian, who was in charge of Lian, asked.

"Riona, what are you doing? You need to give the guidance accurately. What if the boss finds out?"

"Well. I suddenly had this thought. What's the point of all this? Maybe we too..."

Since they too were administrators, they knew.

"This would be the last place."

The fact that not much time remained until God closed the world.

"We had fun, didn't we?"

Stroking Vivian's hand on her shoulder, Riona turned her gaze back to the vision.

"Humanity's final evil."

As the responsible Informator, she felt a sense of duty to witness Shagar's end.

Sirone was certain.

'If there's no choice, there's no integration either.' That's why the Gaians who reached an integrated mental system were those who had mastered the mind.

'I saw their world.' Since everyone understood each other, it was a realm where it didn't matter what happened to this universe.

'Toward that realm...'

Arriving at the 23rd floor, Sirone took in the desolate scene waiting for him.

3-star resident Arte and satellite Tokay lay on the floor with their necks severed.

'The Balance Department is annihilated.'

On one side lay the Law Department's Heukgangsi and Chief Justice Tanjura, along with his satellite Daeho.

"Kkeuk!"

Just as he confirmed Heukgangsi's breath had stopped, Tanjura made a rough groaning sound.

"Tanjura!"

Sirone rushed over and cast Miracle Stream, but it was useless.

'He's already dead.'

Tanjura, with only his upper body remaining, barely managed to lift the corners of his mouth.

"The Chief Justice's verdict: suspended execution. I've maintained this wretched mind until the Five Great Stars arrived."

Only his brain was functioning while his heart had stopped.

"What happened?"

"As you can see... we were annihilated by Baal. That guy has become a monster. A monster created by humans."

Sirone gritted his teeth.

"We did our best to hold out. If you chase quickly, you should make it in time."

Though he wanted to head to the top floor immediately, he couldn't abandon his attachment to Tanjura.

Tanjura shook his head.

"It's fine, since I'm dead. If there's one regret, it's leaving without hearing the answer."

Is Ting right?

"I think no one can know another's truth. That would be the limit of my intellect. But..."

Tanjura gripped Sirone's shoulder.

"I must be wrong, right?"

At the last moment of his life, the answer Tanjura wanted to hear seemed different from his intellect.

"I..."

Sirone didn't know either.

Suppressing his rising tears, what he could utter was just enormous hope.

"I believe so. I'll definitely prove it." Tanjura smiled broadly.

And as if not wanting to burden him further, life quickly drained from his pupils.

"Huuuuu."

Sirone's chin trembled, but his eyes glaring upward were filled with killing intent.

"Demons."

The righteousness everyone knows crumbles like a sandcastle before murky desire and anger.

'They... wanted to protect until the end.'

The light of intellect was fading.

Ivory Tower 21st floor.

The 1st demon corps that followed Baal was slowly killing the Ivory Tower's residents.

"As expected, it's worth getting stronger. Intelligence or whatever, in the end they're no match for us." The demons who had been spending time that way suddenly turned their gaze toward the stairs.

"Hoh?"

Sirone was walking toward them, looking as if he was soaked in blood.

"What? Why so late? Now that I see it, Yahweh is totally lazy too? And yet what..."

Light smoke swirled around the demon's body, then flesh scattered as if exploding.

Finally grasping the atmosphere, the demons wiped away their smiles as Sirone spoke.

"I believe nothing cannot change."

"Hey, the lecture is..."

"But you guys don't change."

The demon closed his mouth.

"Just don't change. Stay evil in front of my eyes. For just the next few seconds."

"Isn't that obvious?"

Sirone desperately suppressed his heart.

"Still, I have to believe you can repent. I really wish you would. But... I hope you don't."

"Pupu..."

The demons burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! What is he saying right now? Mr. Yahweh, have you been drinking? Why are you rambling like this?"

"Why?"

Sirone's eyes widened.

"Because I'm really angry."

The moment Yahweh's rage exploded, blinding light filled the entire 21st floor.
