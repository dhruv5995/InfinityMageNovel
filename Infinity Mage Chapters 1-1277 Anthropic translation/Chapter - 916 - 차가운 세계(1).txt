A Cold World (1)

A photon signal not bound by law.

The archangels assessed the situation as Garfin demonstrated transcendent time dilation at faster-than-light speeds.

Metiel's brow furrowed.

"Tch, a mere human."

If he could deflect Uriel's destruction and evade Rayel's light speed, he would be difficult to suppress through close combat.

'It's not over yet.'

She moved her eyebrows as she sensed the massive energy stirring beyond Garfin.

'He's only broken through each individual concept.'

The world would only be complete when the concepts of all eight archangels were unified.

"Heeyaaah!"

As Uriel charged forward with a battle cry and spun his Paradise Club, Garfin twisted his body and extended his hand.

'Deflect.'

Simultaneously, Metiel activated Union.

'Fusion!'

Explosive materials were synthesized with the spinning Paradise Club, transforming it into a powerful killing weapon.

Garfin smiled with a hardened expression.

'Combining concepts...'

The moment the Paradise Club struck Hexa, a massive explosion erupted, obliterating everything within the radius.

"Over there."

The archangels' gazes moved simultaneously, and Garfin was buried in the ground several kilometers away.

KWAAAAANG!

Satiel, who had been watching from afar, quickly flew over to check on Garfin's condition.

'Metiel's strong fusion.'

As the opposite concept, she knew best what kind of destructive power that held.

'Is he dead?'

Just as she thought that, the ground stirred and Garfin's upper body slowly rose.

"Ugh..."

Though covered in dust, he only had blood flowing from his mouth and didn't seem to have any fatal injuries.

"Raising the difficulty level, is that it?"

If it comes to this, the story changes again.

"Hmm, a combination of eight concepts."

As Garfin, lost in thought, raised his head, Satiel hastily took a fighting stance.

"If you dare to att—"

Garfin extended his hand.

"Pretty angel lady over there, could you help me up?"

As Satiel stared blankly, Garfin struggled, pressing his hand against the ground.

"My legs won't work properly. Seems the shock is still lingering."

If so, this was an opportunity.

"Why?"

But Satiel instead lowered her hostility and asked.

"Why are you asking for help? We're enemies blocking the Gaians' purpose."

The strongest enemies, at that.

"Because I can't do it alone. But if everyone joins forces, is there anything impossible?"

"That's exactly why I'm asking why you want to join forces!"

Satiel shouted.

"You people look down on us! You treat us as nothing but tools needed to use this world, so why are you talking about going together?"

"Tools, huh."

Garfin, recovering from the shock, stood up limping and brushed the dirt off his pants.

"Do you happen to have any good memories? Like precious memories you'd want to cherish for a lifetime?"

Satiel raised one eyebrow and answered.

"Of course I do."

"Then nothing is worthless."

Her holy light body shook greatly.

"You were born. That's why you live. There's no reason for our existence, but..."

Garfin said with a gentle smile.

"But it's real, isn't it? Like me, like other Gaians, you too have been living."

"I've been... living?"

Garfin extended his hand again.

"Life is just one method of progressing through existence. You too are alive. So let's go together. Whatever kind of place the outside world is, I'll never let go."

Satiel's gaze turned toward Garfin's hand.

'God is indifferent.'

Because He must be perfect.

That's why the world is cold and the law is mechanical, but if God had a heart...

'Nothing is worthless.'

She thought He might say the same thing as Garfin.

"Right."

Feeling the warm light dwelling in her holy light body, Satiel clasped her hands together and smiled brightly.

"You're right."

At that moment, the archangels flew down from the distant sky.

"There!"

As Cariel flew at the front and expanded his judicial halo, the other archangels added their concepts.

'Simulacre!'

The concepts of amplification, destruction, light, existence, combination, and annihilation were integrated, creating a spherical machine with complex mechanisms.

'An omnipotent machine that absolutely cannot be avoided, absolutely cannot be destroyed, and will definitely annihilate!'

The sphere, integrated with almost all the technology that makes up the universe, was fired at Garfin.

'This ends it!'

The moment Cariel was certain, Satiel took a step forward, her eyes shining as she turned her judicial halo.

'Nostalgia!'

Physics collapse.

Thirty thousand cracks appeared on the sphere's surface as it separated, and 2.4 billion nano-mechanisms decomposed.

"Hnnngh!"

As Satiel gritted her teeth, the mechanisms broke down into components, components into molecules, and then into atomic units.

"Huh?"

As the machine disassembled before his eyes, a cool breeze swept across Garfin's face.

"Satiel!"

Metiel roared in fury.

"How dare you betray us! Taking the human's side—can you still call yourself God's servant!"

The omnipotent machine's only weakness was that while destruction was impossible, 'disassembly' was possible.

'Damn it! If only we had added Satiel's concept too!'

But instead she was taking Garfin's side, which was infuriating.

"It's not too late even now! If you admit your mistake and help us fight, we'll forgive you."

Satiel smiled.

"Who's forgiving whom?"

Combination and decomposition were twin concepts, but she had indeed been intimidated by the flashy and grand Metiel.

"Nothing is worthless."

Only after hearing Garfin's words did she finally gain confidence.

'I wasn't wrong.'

She boldly extended her hand and declared.

"Satiel, Archangel of Decomposition, has decided to consider the human's proposal based on my own judgment."

Metiel ground her teeth.

"That thing..."

"Stop it."

Icael, stopping the internal conflict, looked around at the Gaians filling the ground.

'There are no openings.'

To break the Ultima System, they needed to suppress Garfin, but Satiel's joining was essential.

"The eight archangels hold equal status. We cannot change Satiel's mind right now."

Metatron asked.

"Then what do you plan to do?"

"We'll hold a meeting at Baegyeong. All angels under my command, return to Arabot immediately."

Icael's voice spread across a wide radius.

"Today is a ceasefire. Garfin, you too must persuade the Gaians to stop their advance."

Garfin spun Hexa on his fingertip and asked.

"What about the reset?"

Probably Angke would give up on the reset, but Icael didn't want to say it out loud.

"It will be done according to God's will."

Seven archangels retreated toward Arabot, and Satiel belatedly took flight.

Garfin asked.

"Will you be okay? Seems like you'll get in huge trouble."

"Hehe, probably so, right?"

She had no regrets.

"See you again, wonderful human."

As Satiel disappeared drawing a beautiful trajectory, Garfin scratched his head and headed toward the Gaians.

"Phew, I managed to stop it for now, but... this looks like it'll be a much longer war than expected."

Holy War Command Valkyrie Unit.

Having arrived in two hours following the General's orders, Ruptist and Flu waited in front of an iron door that wouldn't open.

Magic Association Secretary General Flu checked the time.

"The handover procedures seem to be taking a while."

The moment she finished speaking, footsteps echoed from deep in the tunnel, and Dante appeared.

After confirming Ruptist and Flu's faces, he calmly approached and bowed his head.

"Sorry for being late. National Intelligence Service Deputy Director, Dante."

Code Black.

In the Kingdom of Tormia, besides royalty, Dante was the only person who could access Black clearance.

"Right. We've met before, haven't we?"

They had become acquainted at a palace-hosted party, but this was their first actual conversation.

"Yes. I apologize for not greeting you first. As you know, security is important in my profession."

The moment he had even a brief conversation with the Magic Association President, countless rumors would be generated.

"No. But before that." There was a time when students from the five prestigious schools gathered at the Magic Association before the graduation exam supervised by Red Line.

"Ah, yes."

Dante responded bewilderedly to the sudden reference to their school days.

"Alpheas Magic School is particularly memorable. Those students have become professionals and are fighting hard for us."

'Was he always this type of person?'

Dante grasped the real intention.

'Iruki.'

Though Sirone, humanity's strongest mage, was also there, Iruki's reputation was publicly the highest.

"The Magic Association President and Code Black. I can guess why the General summoned us. It won't be good news for the kingdom."

It was silent pressure to reveal any relevant information in advance.

Dante remained silent.

From experience, he knew there was nothing more perfect than silence when it came to maintaining security.

The iron door opened and a guide said.

"Please enter."

While heading to the underground bunker, Flu positioned herself next to Ruptist and offered a handshake.

"Nice to meet you. Magic Association Secretary General, Flu. You're Sirone's friend, right? I'm also close friends with him."

"Yes. I've heard a lot about you."

"Hoho, really? By the way, the Intelligence Service must be busy too, right? I heard that Zion's monks are in Tormia."

That was Code Black.

'Still, they make a well-matched duo.'

Flu, who knew how to speak indirectly, was a necessary talent for the cold-natured Ruptist.

In the end, Dante remained silent again, and the three arrived at the end of the bunker without conversation.

"Please enter."

Iruki, sitting on the sofa covered with a blanket, smiled faintly and said.

"I've been waiting."

Dante took in Iruki's face.

'His complexion has gotten even worse.'

Ruptist politely bowed his head.

"Tormia Magic Association President Raphael Ruptist. It's an honor to meet you."

After Flu and Dante finished their greetings, Iruki gestured to seats and said to Aromie.

"We don't need tea."

It was a signal not to let anyone in.

"We don't have time, so let's proceed quickly. This concerns humanity's critical affairs. We need the Kingdom of Tormia's cooperation."

Iruki explained the strategy to be carried out in secret.

"Bashka...?"

The plan to blow it up with an elemental bomb.

"What's the current population of the capital?"

Flu, swallowing with a pale face, hastily collected herself and recalled the information.

"Approximately 6.5 million. The floating population fluctuates wildly due to the war, but it should be close to the average."

"6.5 million."

All those lives would turn to ash and disappear.

"As you probably already guessed, security is key to this operation. We'll lure the enemies to the capital and annihilate them all at once."

While there were no objections to the strategy itself, the fact that the kingdom's capital would be destroyed was still shocking.

"First, the three of you here can live. Making people die even after knowing would be a serious loss of human resources."

The three had no response.

"That's why I want to leave the judgment to you. After calculating all night, the limit of people we can extract from this plan while maintaining security is..."

Iruki held out both palms.

"100 people."

100 people out of 6.5 million.

"Please select 100 people from Bashka who absolutely must live. Of course, I won't criticize whatever choices you make. Family is fine, people necessary for society are fine. If you prepare the list now, I'll handle it."

Ruptist looked down at the blank paper Iruki had offered.

'So that's what it was.'

He realized why they hadn't called the royalty despite planning a strategy that would blow up the capital.
