Another Space (4)

Imperial Capital Yeom-ra.

Sirone, accompanied by Earth Dragon Gaitan and White Dragon Asraiker, knocked on the gates of Yeom-ra.

Even before confirming their identity, the gatekeeper soldiers wore blank expressions as if their souls had left their bodies.

'In this world, such a beauty exists...' White Dragon Asraiker.

At her appearance, which had reached the pinnacle of allure among all living beings, not only the soldiers but even the officials stood agape.

"I am Sirone of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars. The Emperor of Jincheon..."

When everyone's gaze remained fixed on Asraiker, Sirone cleared her throat awkwardly.

"Ahem, excuse me, I've come to see His Imperial Majesty."

No answer came.

As Sirone sighed at this already familiar situation, Asraiker spoke up directly.

"This person is one of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars. May we have an audience with His Imperial Majesty?"

"What? Ah, yes! Please wait just a moment!"

Even Yeom-ra's gatekeepers, famous for their rigid adherence to protocol, willingly complied - such was the power of the White Dragon's allure.

Three minutes later, royal guards arrived at the castle gate with a small but luxurious carriage.

The exact same situation as three minutes prior unfolded, and even the ladies-in-waiting had their souls captivated by her.

'...I shouldn't go to crowded places.'

A few words of conversation were fine.

But if Asraiker conversed with a specific person for more than five minutes, the situation would become serious.

'They'd risk their lives for it.'

Throughout history, countless kings, leaders, artists, scholars, and clergy had died suffering from lovesickness.

Even more frightening were the last words of a king who took his own life 1,400 years ago.

'He said it was better to die now knowing her than to live eternally without knowing her.'

Such was the terror of the White Dragon who dealt with souls.

Upon arriving at the inner palace, Jincheon's Five Dragon Generals were displaying martial arts on a high platform.

They were Yucheong, called the incarnation of the sword, and Hwang Iseong, nicknamed the demon of tyranny.

'It's neck and neck.'

Sirone briefly admired the martial prowess of the two men brilliantly wielding sword and axe.

Not stopping their martial display even for a visit from one of the Five Great Stars was typical of the Jincheon Empire's characteristic boldness.

"Taha!"

As Hwang Iseong raised his axe and charged forward, it felt as if waves were rising from behind him.

When Yucheong thrust his sword forward and charged like lightning to shatter the waves, a fierce wind swept through.

Gaitan remained indifferent with his arms crossed, but Asraiker's expression grew increasingly displeased.

'These bastards...'

Weren't they intentionally ignoring the Messiah who had come to save the world?

She turned to look at the official and said:

"Are all of Jincheon Empire's generals so rude? I find it rather disappointing."

"Ah, my apologies!"

Though they weren't just any generals but the pinnacle of military might - the Dragon Generals - the official responded immediately.

'She's counting on me.'

Showing an unseemly appearance in front of Asraiker was worse than death.

"General!"

Making his voice thick unlike a typical civil official, he cupped his hands and shouted loudly:

"Sirone, one of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars, has arrived! You should show proper respect!"

The movements of Yucheong and Hwang Iseong came to an abrupt halt.

'Have they gone mad?'

They already knew of Sirone's visit.

But it was protocol that even the Emperor didn't stop the martial displays of the Five Dragon Generals, which symbolized Jincheon's strength.

"To interrupt a warrior's martial display is..." Hwang Iseong, resting his axe on his shoulder, frowned arrogantly, but soon his expression softened.

"Hm?"

The moment he saw the woman staring intently in this direction, he felt as if his soul was ascending to heaven.

'Who is that woman?'

Hwang Iseong had an upright personality.

Moreover, his wife was Princess Yeon, the greatest beauty of the Moon Kingdom, yet he couldn't ignore the feeling of ultimate allure.

'I'd like to have even a brief conversation with her.'

He swallowed his saliva, and Yucheong beside him also couldn't take his eyes off her.

"Ahem..."

Hwang Iseong belatedly showed respect.

"I was engaged in wholehearted combat and failed to notice. I am General Hwang Iseong."

Not to be outdone, Yucheong cupped his hands while still holding his sword.

"I am Yucheong of Jincheon's Five Dragon Generals. Please forgive my rudeness. When it comes to the sword, I make no compromises..."

Sirone simply wanted to enter the inner palace.

"No, it's fine. I've come because I have urgent matters to report to His Imperial Majesty."

Asraiker added:

"Thank you for the kind welcome. Please don't mind us and continue your training."

"Ah, yes. Then..."

As the two generals resumed their martial display, Sirone walked toward the inner palace.

Perhaps conscious of Asraiker, the clashing sounds of their weapons rang several times louder than before.

'She's watching.'

As Asraiker passed by the side of the platform, she slowly turned her head to observe the martial display.

'She's looking at me.' Having the same thought, both Yucheong and Hwang Iseong drew out all their strength.

A thunderous roar echoed throughout Yeom-ra.

"Hiyaaah!"

Yucheong's face turned red to his ears as he was pushed back by Hwang Iseong's strike.

'Urgh!'

He could still feel Asraiker's gaze.

'What humiliation is this!'

Thinking of how lowly she must regard him made him feel he could die of mortification.

"Hwang Iseong! Do you take me lightly!"

Killing intent emerged in what should have been a skill-testing martial display, and Hwang Iseong also used his most cherished secret technique not to be outdone.

In a situation where either could die, Sirone abruptly stopped walking.

Though she didn't turn around, she could visualize the martial scene just from the sounds.

"Here I come, Yucheong!"

Asraiker watched with indifferent eyes as a lethal strike aimed at a comrade.

'I will win! The one she'll love is...'

Just as the cold weapons were about to destroy each other's bodies, a blindingly powerful light exploded.

"Kugh!"

The hearts of everyone nearby were drawn by an unknown force and settled calmly.

"Huff! Huff!"

The two generals who barely stopped their swords gasped for breath with vacant expressions.

'What? Why was I...'

Trying to kill a comrade?

As the two men who suddenly realized this turned their heads, they saw Sirone facing forward.

"Asraiker."

Her shoulders flinched at the cold voice.

"Yes, Messiah."

"I clearly told you, didn't I? Never stare at specific individuals for long periods."

The White Dragon was a weapon in itself.

Just staring intently at someone was enough to make their hearts boil over.

"I apologize. Not knowing how much the Messiah sacrifices, I let my pride..."

He understood her feelings, but if this continued, uniting humanity would become difficult.

"People nearly died. If you think being strong gives you the right to do whatever you want, you don't need to be by my side."

Asraiker's face went pale at Sirone's harsh words.

"I'm sorry! I won't do it again!"

"Let's go."

People stood agape at her dejected figure following behind.

A similar situation occurred in the inner palace, but she didn't make eye contact with anyone.

Upon arriving at the imperial audience chamber, Jingang spoke:

"You've come?"

'Emperor Jingang of Jincheon.' His steel-like gaze remained unchanged, but everything else about him seemed precarious.

Setting aside his gaunt appearance, he lacked the vitality natural to any human being.

"I have something to tell you."

"If it's about the demon realm, I've already received reports. The Empire's doctors are working with full effort to devise countermeasures."

Jingang's gaze swept over the two apostles flanking Sirone.

Though Asraiker met his eyes, no emotional change could be detected in Jingang.

'What a soul this is.'

She felt pity.

'He's alive but not truly living. There's nothing more that can be squeezed out.'

Any parent would be the same, thinking their child was writhing in eternal torment.

"I'm going to the other side world."

A light briefly flickered in Jingang's eyes.

"If I purify hell, the demon realm will be destroyed. I'm currently preparing in the Kingdom of Tormia."

"...I see."

The reason he didn't ask about Seongeum was probably because he was still Jincheon's Emperor.

"I can't save her. However, if hell is purified, I should be able to free her from suffering."

Jingang's eyes reddened.

"The mage Jin Seongeum is someone who saved humanity from the swamp of despair. Because she existed, we could fight this far. If I meet her in hell, I will take responsibility and kill her myself."

Jingang struggled to contain himself.

What Jincheon wanted was an emperor who ruled all people as the Son of Heaven, not a human bound by family love.

"I'll be entering the other side world soon. Before that, I've come to seek permission for Seongeum's destruction."

He knew the reason for specifically seeking permission.

"...If my daughter is destroyed, the spirit realm will open again."

"Yes. Of course, if hell is purified, there won't be a problem. But if a situation comes where I must choose between the two..."

Hell's purification and Seongeum's destruction.

"I will choose to liberate Seongeum. Even if the spirit realm opens again."

Now it was the Emperor's turn to answer.

"Then Jincheon will be defeated. And humanity as well. Are you telling me to abandon the Empire and save my daughter?"

"It depends on Your Imperial Majesty's heart."

Heavy silence flowed.

"Seongeum's fate - you knew and still chose it. Do you regret sending your daughter like that?"

"Regret...you ask?"

Jingang turned his head and recalled the emotions of that time, but his mouth would no longer open.

"If you cannot choose, I will."

Just as Sirone was about to lead her apostles out of the audience chamber, a hoarse voice was heard.

"If it were me..."

Jingang stood up.

"If it were me, I couldn't have done what my daughter did."

And he cupped his hands respectfully, bowing deeply toward Sirone.

"Please liberate Jincheon's hero."

"I will do my best."

Leaving those words as she headed for the door, all the ministers bowed in unison and shouted:

"Please liberate Jincheon's hero!"

Isn't a living human burning more beautiful than any flame...

"Whooooo!"

For a moment, such an insane thought occurred.

"Rian!"

If life were visible, wouldn't it be burning in such a form?

Whether standing and breathing or crawling on the ground, the flames always pointed upward.

'I've caught fire. What do I do now?'

While endlessly repairing a body that was nothing but pain, Rian walked aimlessly around.

'This is much harder than I thought.'

The thought that it would be better to die instantly grew and overwhelmed his mind.

"Krrrrrr!"

He would not scream.

Rian made that resolution and thought he kept his promise to the end.

Even as Tess shed tears watching him writhe on the ground screaming for three hours.

"Rian, Rian!"

Even two more hours later, when Clump bit his lips until they bled.

"Aaaahhh!"

Rian thought he absolutely never screamed.

"Sirone! This is the limit now. He'll go insane at this rate! Let him rest even briefly."

Sirone coldly shook her head.

"If we stop now, we'll have to repeat this whole process from the beginning. This is the best way."

Tess covered her ears at Rian's shouting.

"Please! Please stop!"

"Heh heh."

At Rian's laughter, she turned her head to see he had somehow stood up.

"Hehehe! Hehehehe!"

At first, she thought he'd gone mad.

But his voice, clearly staring at something, was unwavering.

"I can see it, Sirone."

Each time the flames flickered, countless landscapes that weren't of reality overlapped.

"Ah..."

In Tess's retinas, demons screamed.
