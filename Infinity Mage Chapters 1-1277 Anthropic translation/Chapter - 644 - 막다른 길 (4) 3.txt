[644] Dead End (4)

"Wait a minute! Wait, just wait!"

While Arte's answer had yet to come, Amy hastily stretched out her hand.

"Sirone, what's really wrong with you? Are you doing this because you don't know what situation you're in?"

"I know. But just because my situation isn't good doesn't mean I want to do something I don't want to do."

"You don't want to? It's the Ivory Tower. The place every mage dreams of."

"Even so, I can't follow something that isn't right."

"Not right..."

Arte lowered her fan and revealed her face.

"An interesting opinion. What are you thinking?"

"Kar represents perfection. But what you, who speaks of perfection, ultimately did was suppression through force."

He couldn't understand Arte's judgment in blowing Lyman away simply because there wasn't enough time.

"Hmm, you seemed to dislike it."

"I did dislike it. But it's not a matter of emotion. If might makes right, then how is the White Line any different from other lines?"

Tokei's shoulders shook.

"Keke, didn't I tell you? Different from the profile."

Arte, convinced, snapped her fan shut and drew an imaginary vertical line on the table.

"Good. Let me explain it this way. Humans belong to the number 3 of law in that they choose between good and evil. The pinnacle of this 3 could be called the seeker. But Sirone, we are not seekers. We are intellect, beings corresponding to the number 4 of law. In other words, we are not beings who choose between good and evil."

"Then what kind of existence is the Ivory Tower?"

"Beings who distinguish between the good and evil of good and evil itself. Is good truly good? Is evil truly evil? In other words, the most essential thing in the number 4 of law is endless criticism. And what this means is..."

Arte stood up from her seat and offered a handshake.

"Congratulations once again. Sirone, you are more than qualified to take the Ivory Tower's test."

His friends asked back with bewildered expressions.

"Huh?"

On the other hand, Sirone stared intently at the hand Arte extended, then raised his head as if unconvinced.

"If I had obediently agreed to take the test from the beginning, would the opportunity not have been given?"

"In my case, that's right. As I said earlier, Kar doesn't have any special standards. Candidates who received notifications from other residents besides me might not have had to take such a test."

Arte smiled.

"That's what the Ivory Tower is like. Becoming a star means being able to criticize anything, and I simply tried to criticize Sirone in my own way. Just as Sirone criticized me and the Ivory Tower a moment ago."

'Ah.'

Amy began to understand a little about what Kar was.

"Therefore, the residents of the Ivory Tower support the stars' judgments. Even if their opinions differ, they believe it's a conclusion reached after harsh self-criticism. Is might right? If a resident concluded so, that too is close to perfection."

Arte personally grasped Sirone's hand and shook it.

"Receive the title of star. The Ivory Tower will not force any ideology upon you. It's simply about sharing what Sirone has criticized through his intellect with the world."

Sirone's heart began to beat roughly.

Only the thought of wanting to move toward 100 percent Kar—critical conclusions drawn solely through intellect—filled his mind.

"Wait. What we need to address here is..."

Iruki stepped forward.

"Anyway, since he's become an Ivory Tower candidate, we can consider that Sirone has the necessary qualifications, right?"

"Of course. Even if Sirone refuses, the doors of the Ivory Tower are always open."

"Then what about the contract conditions? We can't just accept the proposal without knowing such things."

Tokei said,

"If you're talking about salary, the Ivory Tower has no compensation. However, we can provide unlimited funding for whatever is needed to carry out missions."

Even Amy was surprised this time.

"Really not a single penny in compensation?"

"Because there's no need. Having the trust of Ivory Tower residents means being able to criticize anything, and by agreement, we already have full access rights to public facilities of all countries worldwide. If you're hungry, go to a public institution and eat. If you need something, grab a king or bureaucrat and talk to them. They'll supply it through the fastest route."

"Wow, that's really insane."

Hearing about the practical privileges, Nade could feel what kind of place the Ivory Tower was.

If such an offer had come to him, he might have been able to revive his dream of becoming a mage.

'Well, that's exactly why it's impossible.'

Nade's Kar was nowhere near sufficient compared to Sirone's.

"Of course, this is only after receiving the title of star. We don't provide any privileges to candidates. Building the residents' trust in Kar before becoming a star comes first."

Naturally it would be so, but Iruki wanted to gain at least some benefit from this opportunity.

"Do you happen to know the situation Sirone is currently in?"

"No, I don't."

A 3-star resident didn't need to know about a candidate's circumstances.

"The Kingdom of Tormia has framed Sirone to prevent him from graduating. What do you think about this?"

"Then he shouldn't graduate. The Ivory Tower cares about nothing except Kar. Sirone just needs to find Ra Enemy and come to the Ivory Tower."

Amy said,

"But that's too much. The 3rd place is royalty so they'll have tremendous connections, and the 2nd place, whoever they are, will at least have a mage license. At this rate, Sirone will have to travel as a civilian. I won't say it's unfair, but you could help him obtain the qualifications he could have had originally."

"Hmm."

Arte tapped her head with her fan, lost in thought.

"Fine. He just needs to graduate?"

Sirone nodded obediently.

"Yes. Even just having an unofficial mage license would make traveling much more convenient."

It wasn't that he was getting greedy now, but he wanted to have at least the diploma from the magic school that held so many memories.

"Understood. I'll have a word about it."

As Arte stood up and Tokei climbed onto her shoulder, he looked back at Sirone.

"Make sure to become the 28th star. Wouldn't it feel good if the person we notified became one?"

"Yes, I'll work hard."

As Arte and Tokei went outside, the students who had been whispering outside the building all shut their mouths at once.

The teachers also had tense faces, but as if such situations were familiar, Arte calmly looked around.

Then she fluttered her fan at Lyman, who was sitting like a refugee receiving treatment, signaling him to come over.

"Y-yes!"

Though his body wasn't well, he moved as quickly as possible and prostrated himself at Arte's feet.

His sense that had temporarily departed due to greed over his daughter's study abroad fees had returned after being hit by Arte's magic.

"Did you call for me, Penetrator of Intelligence?"

"From now on, Sirone will take the Ivory Tower's test. Make sure there are no obstacles to his graduation."

"I will convey your will to the king. The star's will shall be smoothly fulfilled."

When drinking with foreign officials, one could often hear anecdotes about kings who had been grabbed by the collar by stars, and what they all commonly said was exactly this.

If a star wants something, just give it to them.

'It's already a matter that's been criticized.'

It was the Ivory Tower's work manual.

"Let's go, Tokei."

Tokei waved his hand to the crowd.

"Well then, everyone live happily until we meet again."

A band of light began swirling from beneath Arte's feet, becoming a massive whirlpool that shot up into the sky.

'So this is the Ivory Tower.'

As the students stared blankly, Lyman glared at Sirone, who belatedly emerged from the building, grinding his teeth.

He had planned to make him wet himself, but now he had become someone even the king couldn't touch.

'Endure it. Nothing good has ever come from being marked by the Ivory Tower.'

Since there were said to be 3 candidates, Sirone's probability of becoming a star was a whopping 33.3 percent.

The price he'd have to pay later if he touched him on a whim would be too great.

"Arian Sirone."

Lyman forced a smile and said,

"By royal decree, all crimes are pardoned. Please become an excellent mage who raises the kingdom's reputation."

Though no royal decree had actually been issued, it was a foregone conclusion anyway, and at Lyman's declaration of defeat, the students cheered.

"Waaaah! Senior Sirone, congratulations!"

"This is really incredible! The Ivory Tower!"

Since just being an Ivory Tower candidate was an honor for their school, it was natural for the students to rejoice.

'Find Ra.'

On the other hand, Sirone found the probability of one-third thrilling.

A problem of a completely different dimension from what he had solved so far.

Moreover, the competitors' Kar levels were slightly but definitively higher than Sirone's.

'Who could they be?'

Setting aside competition, Sirone was purely curious.

The imperial capital of the Jincheon Empire, Yeomra.

Befitting an empire with over 200 million people, the scale of Yeomra, where the emperor resided, was by far the most vast among the Three Imperial Worlds.

The number of guards equaled a nation's military force, and the number of sorcerers alone exceeded 2,000.

Overwhelming superiority in quantity, though falling behind in qualitative aspects was unavoidable, and currently they were in the process of recruiting skilled individuals from countries around the world with astronomical funding.

"Princess, His Majesty the Emperor is looking for you."

The moment the maid finished speaking, the eyes of a woman who had been immersed in meditation in an octagonal pavilion snapped open.

It was Jin Seong-eum, the thirteenth daughter of Jincheon's Emperor Jin Gang.

Her gaze looking straight ahead was as solid as steel, and her stubbornly closed mouth was as red as flames.

"I shall go now."

As Seong-eum prepared to depart, the maids each distanced themselves according to the numbers carved on their jade necklaces.

The predetermined distances from 10 steps to 1,000 steps represented the authority to approach Seong-eum, and if they came even one step closer, they would be executed that very day.

Upon arriving at the imperial palace with its eaves soaring toward the sky on both sides, the guards raised their spears in unison.

Guard Captain Oh approached with the sound of iron armor and bowed his head.

"Princess."

Seong-eum's brow twitched.

"23 steps. Step back."

"..."

Though Seong-eum assigned distances to everyone she met, as the captain of the guards, leaving his post was impossible.

"Hmph, is that so?"

The moment Seong-eum snorted, Oh realized he was somehow already 23 steps away from her.

'...There's really nothing I can do about this.'

Her obsession with space stemmed from a special enlightenment that had made her Jincheon's greatest sorcerer.

The reason the emperor called for her today was also because the Ivory Tower, which only the world's best could enter, had designated Seong-eum as a candidate.

"110 steps. 230 steps. 87 steps. 433 steps."

Seong-eum assigned distances to each guard soldier as well.

Though the basis was unknown, listening to it gave a strangely convincing feeling, suggesting there was definitely some standard.

When the soldiers, like Oh, didn't leave their posts, Seong-eum showed her anger and glared.

"These fools...!"

The maid who was uniquely allowed 10 steps hurriedly reported,

"Princess. Today His Majesty the Emperor has specially..."

'Ether Wave.'

As Seong-eum concentrated her mind, all sounds disappeared and even the shapes of the scenery were pushed beyond perception.

In a world of only darkness, countless tremors were transmitted like raindrops falling on a water surface.

If gravity occurs because matter presses down on space, then even empty space must be filled with something.

What she had realized as an Unlocker was the base that constitutes space itself—ether.

'Shrinking Earth.'

As she cast magic after sensing the emperor's wave, the 4-kilometer distance crumpled and the scenery of the Hwangryong Hall rushed in.

With different landscapes unnaturally adjoining each other, Seong-eum's legs crossed the boundary of space.

"Father."

With just one step, she had come to an audience with the Emperor of the Jincheon Empire.
