[415] The Second Purgatory (2)

Sirone's group headed toward the mainland.

While riding Zulu's summoned creatures would be faster, it wasn't a good choice given their current lack of knowledge about the conflict situation in Purgatory.

Especially since Heaven's skies were dominated by angels, Maras, and drones, they wanted to avoid being detected from distances beyond Ethella's Spirit Zone radius as much as possible.

But contrary to their expectations, the Forest of the Profane was far too quiet.

It was unexpected for those who had imagined scenes of angels patrolling the skies and eliminating heretics and rebels.

Kang Nan asked.

"How should we interpret this? An unexpected change? Or evidence that the rebels have been annihilated?"

"Either is possible."

At Sein's words, Flu tilted her head.

"Is it possible for the forest to be quiet even if the rebels haven't been annihilated?"

"Logically, it's impossible. But if you think about it that way, the maze's disappearance is the same. Anything can happen. We have to see it that way for now."

Sein was feeling the same unease he had experienced in the maze's space-time.

No, the fact that even Purgatory's situation differed from expectations was making his anxiety even worse.

'This was something I planned for 20 years, holding my breath. But why is everything going wrong like this?'

Could he really trust his current instincts?

Perhaps this too was just a coincidence. Anyone could confirm results and then fit causes to match them.

Sein came to a simple conclusion.

'Let's not overthink it. I just need to calculate for both situations. I can do that.'

"Someone's there."

Ethella stopped walking and looked to the right.

Of course, she hadn't sensed them nearby. Various information was flowing in from her Spirit Zone covering a 2-kilometer radius.

About 20 people were moving, displaying mobility beyond normal parameters.

Sounds of weapons clashing and explosions were transmitted through synesthesia.

"They seem to be in combat. About 800 meters away."

Flu glanced sideways at Gaold and asked.

"Should we investigate?"

She meant they needed approval to increase mobility.

Since the forest's current situation differed from expectations, staying hidden could be one approach, but Gaold chose the direct method.

"Investigate."

The moment the order was given, the entire team transformed into flashes of light and disappeared.

Zulu handled Quan and Kang Nan's movement, and except for Sirone, everyone was a professional, so navigating the complex forest posed no problems.

Sirone had also conquered master-level movement control in his graduating class, but there was definitely a difference in skill level based on rank.

Particularly, the movement of Gaold, Sein, Zulu, and Armin leading the way was ghostlike as they navigated the complex terrain, reminiscent of mechanical precision.

'How much training does it take to achieve movement like that?'

When they arrived at the scene, the previous silence had vanished and noisy sounds filled the forest.

"Chase them! Rip out their hearts!"

"Kiyaaaaaaaa!"

Kergo tribesmen in black armor were pursuing Mecha tribesmen while letting out their characteristic war cries.

Their movement, becoming one with their horses, was like a gale, but the Mecha tribe wasn't moving at a speed that could be easily caught either.

'What is that?'

The Mecha tribe's mobility came from mechanical devices connected by skeletal frames mounted outside their bodies.

The frame crossed the shoulder line behind their backs, connecting to both arms, then descended from the neck along the spine to extend to both legs.

Matching the wearer's movements, the joint connections rotated with sharp clanking sounds, and with each ground strike, their leap distance extended 5, 6 meters at a time.

"Strength assistance device Piper. They're Mecha tribe combat soldiers."

The Mecha tribe flew around the forest as if they had springs attached to their feet.

But the Kergo tribe were also excellent hunters.

One of them, having unknowingly driven the Mecha tribe into an encirclement, burst from the forest like an ambush and swung his sword.

"Hup!"

A Mecha tribe member thrust out an X-rod.

A hologram shield spread out, creating a shockwave, but the Schema's brute force was slightly superior, and he staggered and fell to the ground.

The Mecha tribe soldiers gathered around their fallen comrade and looked around.

Kergo tribesmen who had blocked their retreat route were surrounding them from all sides, revealing themselves one by one.

The short-haired female squad leader of the Mecha tribe whispered into a drone mounted on her wrist.

"This is reconnaissance team 2. Currently surrounded by Kergo tribe. Request support."

No response came.

But given the nature of radio communication, they couldn't be certain the support request hadn't gone through.

'Please, please...'

From 20 meters away, Sirone's group was watching the situation.

The Kergo tribe's excellent tracking skills were their pride, but they were powerless before Sein's Equilibrium.

With even their breathing cut by the Iron Wheel Eye and reduced to silent levels, their five senses were useless.

Kang Nan looked back at Gaold and asked.

"Which way will you go? Kergo? Mecha?"

This was the first crossroads they had encountered since coming to Heaven.

The divine people were classified into three races: Kergo, Mecha, and Nor, each with different combat methods, cultures, and ways of thinking.

The process of reaching the maze would be completely different depending on which race they started with, so they needed to be careful.

Rustle.

The bushes shook, and a Kergo warrior patrolling the formation's perimeter appeared.

The warrior's eyes widened with a heart-stopping expression.

Even with sensory Schema, nothing had been detected, yet suddenly 10 people were standing there—it was natural to be surprised.

His head turned toward where his comrades were as if it might break, and he inflated his lungs to shout.

"The..."

Gaold's hand swung quickly.

"Ene..."

With a thud, the Kergo warrior's face flew off.

Sirone and Flu stared blankly at the muscular body trembling without a face before coming to their senses.

If suppressing emotions and making rational judgments before acting was a normal human response, then Gaold's reaction just now had been extremely mechanical.

"In any situation, if you think you need to kill someone based on your own judgment, kill them. I'll handle the consequences. Even if it was the wrong choice, I'll consider it that there's no worse situation than a team member dying."

It was essentially Gaold's version of issuing a license to kill.

It was a thoroughly correct approach for team member survival, but saying he wouldn't even question the rightness or wrongness of judgments was something only Gaold, who could crush any situation with force, could say.

And this was virtually the only reason he had been selected as the team's commander.

Kang Nan glanced sideways at Gaold and asked.

"Given this situation, should we choose the Mecha race?"

While humans could have many values more important than others' deaths, the Kergo tribe was an organization bound by divine law.

Having already killed one, the barrier to compromise had become higher than with the Mecha.

"For Ankera!"

Gaold's eyes twitched with displeasure.

"We go with Mecha."

The moment he finished speaking, Quan shot out. This kind of work was perfect for a hitman.

"Squad leader! If this continues, we'll be annihilated!"

The Mecha tribe was barely holding on while being beaten.

While the Piper corrected muscle strength, it was only a function limited to major muscles, so defeating Kergo warriors—whose entire bodies were weapons—in close combat was nearly impossible.

"Retreat! I'll handle this place!"

The squad leader leaped into the deadly situation.

She knew what happened to people caught in heretic hunts, but she needed to buy even a little time to hope for reinforcements.

"Cut off that woman's limbs and bring only her torso!"

Just hearing it made her teeth chatter.

She wanted to run away right now, but Kergo warriors had already leaped above her head and were swinging their swords to cut off her arms.

Whiiiiing!

Then a powerful gust arose, and a faint afterimage swept past the Kergo warrior.

"What...!"

The woman's eyes shook with shock.

The Kergo warriors' faces were separating from their bodies and falling away as if corks were being pulled.

'Seven left.'

Rotating in mid-air, Quan identified the positions of the remaining enemies.

He had killed six with one slash, and no one knew that there had been twelve minute changes in the process of that slash.

"Enemy! Kill him!"

Only after losing half their force did the Kergo tribe notice the attacker's presence and launch themselves.

Quan's body continued strange movements while bound by threads of external gravity extending in three directions.

Oscillating like a pendulum, he suddenly shot out, and blood sprayed from the bodies of four men who passed by him.

'Three ahead.'

Another warrior's neck was severed.

'Two.'

The enraged Kergo vice-captain's eyes bulged.

They too used external gravity, but it was merely an auxiliary means for cutting enemies. This was the first time they had encountered such bizarre movements that even made them feel mocked.

"Don't mock Kergo techniques!"

When the vice-captain swung his crescent blade, Quan's trajectory curved like magnets of the same pole meeting, and he flew past the vice-captain.

"Haha! Got you!"

The basic Kergo tactic of setting traps.

A warrior with a ponytail who had been lying in ambush brought his sword down on the approaching Quan.

"Huh?"

But there was no feeling of contact.

Looking up, Quan, who should have been within the sword's radius, was floating motionless in the air.

Quan glared irritably at the ponytailed warrior, then slowly turned his gaze to the side.

Simultaneously, his body spun like a top and was pulled toward where the vice-captain was, as if thread was being wound.

"Captain! Behind you!"

Before the vice-captain could react, Quan's sword severed his neck.

As the external gravity disappeared and he landed on the ground, he spun and threw his sword.

Flying faster than an arrow, the sword pierced through the falling ponytailed warrior's solar plexus and embedded in a tree.

With the Kergo tribe annihilated, the forest was enveloped in silence.

It had been a dazzling battle, but it had all happened in just about 5 seconds.

Sirone's group finally entered the scene.

While they were inwardly admiring Quan's skills, which they had only heard about in rumors, the person himself had an irritated expression on his face.

'Damn it! Just how much of a piece of trash have I become?'

In the past, he would have cut down everyone before one breath of external gravity ended.

But now, one person remained, and even the final disposal was just improvisation using a thrown sword.

"Quan, are you alright? Are you injured by any chance...?"

When Shiina approached, Quan hastily erased his expression. He had no desire to receive sympathy from her.

"I'm sorry. It seems my balance isn't perfect yet."

Shiina tilted her head.

What Quan had done wrong was something she, as a mage, could never understand.

After thinking for a moment, she just said what she had prepared.

"That was really amazing. I haven't encountered many swordsman techniques, but I feel like I've broadened my perspective this time."

To Quan, these were rather embarrassing words.

He just smiled bitterly and passed by, causing Shiina to look back.

'Did I make some mistake?'

Meanwhile, when Gaold approached, the Mecha tribe gripped their weapons with tense expressions.

While they had saved their lives thanks to these people's appearance, it was difficult to clearly identify friend from foe in current Purgatory.

Most importantly, if one swordsman had annihilated a Kergo unit, they were definitely outmatched in terms of skill.

"Who are you people? Are you heretics?"

Gaold looked back at Sein.

While some team members had learned Heaven's language, more than half needed translation.

When Sein's mental magic finally made the woman's words understandable, Gaold took another step forward.

Simultaneously, the Mecha tribe flinched back.

The Pipers mounted on their bodies made clanking sounds and narrowed the angles of the joint connections by the distance they had moved.
