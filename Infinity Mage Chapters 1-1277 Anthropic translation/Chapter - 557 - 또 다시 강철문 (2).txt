[557] The Steel Door Once Again (2)

Shirone had returned.

It was a fact that brought ecstasy to some and despair to others.

Most of those who had fiercely competed in the first half felt the pressure of being pushed out of the mainstream just from seeing Shirone pass through the steel door.

"Shirone!"

Nade ran over with tears welling up in his eyes and pulled Shirone into a tight embrace.

"What happened! Do you know how shocked we were? I really...!"

His voice choked up and he couldn't speak.

After all, this was Shirone who had written a farewell letter and suddenly vanished without a trace.

"I'm sorry. I'll tell you everything soon."

"What do you mean soon! Tell us right now! What happened?"

Iruki grabbed Nade's shoulder and stopped him.

"Calm down. Look behind you."

Turning his head, Nade realized everyone was staring at him blankly and stepped back with a cough.

"Right, let's talk about it later."

Shirone lightly patted Nade's back and walked toward Collie.

On his way, he glanced back at Amy with a small smile, but she coldly turned her head away.

'Well, I'll have to explain slowly.'

He couldn't blame Amy for feeling betrayed, as he would have felt the same if he were in her position.

Approaching Collie, Shirone bowed his head in greeting.

"I've arrived. I apologize for causing you concern."

"Hmm..."

Collie didn't know why Shirone had refused evaluation.

But from the ominous atmosphere that had circulated the school at the time and Ethella and Shiina's sudden business trip, he could guess it wasn't just personal matters.

Furthermore, if he were to speculate a bit more, it might be related to the Day of Twenty Judges that had occurred when he was a young teacher.

"Yes, I'm glad you returned safely. Will you resume evaluations from the second half?"

The competitors' gazes focused on Shirone.

If Shirone joined the already fierce competition, it would be like another predator entering the world of survival of the fittest.

"No. I will refuse evaluation in the second half as well."

The atmosphere stirred.

While it was fortunate for the competitors, it was an unexpected decision for Shirone.

As Amy looked at Shirone for the first time, Nade asked.

"Shirone, are you really going to take the graduation exam like this?"

Once back at magic school...

Instead of answering, Shirone recalled Miro's advice.

"Go to Teacher Collie and tell him you'll continue refusing evaluation. You already have a gap of over 100 points from going to heaven. Even if you catch up as much as possible in the remaining time, it's impossible to turn things around. That's how the system works."

Except for major specialty enhancement or group evaluations, you had to accumulate small points day by day, so an absence of several weeks was a serious loss.

"But will it be okay? If you refuse evaluation, you can't even enter the evaluation hall."

"You have friends. Even though they're competitors, they'll help you. Factions naturally form during graduation exams, so there's no reason to abandon connections."

Though it negated friendship, having a give-and-take relationship made Shirone feel lighter too.

"And most importantly, it's about you. It's much more efficient to not reveal your abilities than to gauge your competitors' skills."

Shirone couldn't deny that point.

"If the exam proceeds normally, you'll definitely be able to place in the top 10. But to survive, that alone isn't enough. Remember this for sure. From now on, it's politics."

'From now on, it's politics.'

Breaking from his thoughts, Shirone said.

"I want to try on my own. It's difficult to catch up on points anyway."

Collie respected Shirone's opinion.

"I understand. Then Shirone, go to the dormitory and the rest of you... Hm?"

As Collie looked up, the students followed his gaze.

A woman with brown skin and a slim figure was entering through the steel door.

As students stared mesmerized at the beautiful woman with her hair tied back, revealing her crescent-shaped forehead, someone's voice suddenly blurted out a name.

"Maya?"

Starting from that, students began murmuring, and Shirone also looked at Maya with a dazed expression.

She was from the Mystic Tribe, majored in sound magic, but had consistently ranked last in the graduating class.

While she had always been naturally pretty, having lost weight, she looked completely different from before.

"Is that really Maya? Crybaby Maya?"

For Screamer, who didn't know Maya before she had gained weight, it was unbelievable even seeing it with his own eyes.

They say a woman's beauty is power, don't they?

Though they had an almost hostile relationship - clashing in strategic tactical evaluations and fighting during hill occupation - faced with her transformed appearance, he couldn't treat her carelessly like before.

"Um... sorry, but could you move aside? The path is blocked..."

Her weak personality seemed unchanged as Maya's voice trembled.

"Oh? Ah, sorry."

As Screamer hurriedly cleared the way, she walked to Collie and stood beside Shirone, bowing her head.

"Teacher, I've arrived."

"Yes. You've gotten quite thin since I last saw you."

"I don't need to build up my vocal power anymore."

Though she had sought technical changes after receiving Iruki's advice to abandon vocal techniques, that couldn't be the only reason.

Collie recalled Maya visiting him on a stormy night, crying uncontrollably while saying she couldn't forget Shirone.

It was clear she had lost her appetite due to heartbreak.

'Has she sorted out her feelings?'

Looking sympathetically at his personally recruited student, Collie soon regained his composure and spoke.

"Right, you'll still refuse evaluation, I suppose?"

"Yes..."

"I understand. Go in and rest."

As Maya headed to the dormitory past Collie, she hesitated for a moment, then gathered courage and looked back.

Among the gazes of numerous male students, she accurately found Shirone and smiled slightly, replacing a long-overdue greeting.

Nade, who had approached, poked Shirone's side.

"Hey, hey! She's become incredibly pretty, hasn't she? But she still has feelings for you, right? Lucky bastard, I'm jealous."

"What's there to be jealous about?"

Though Shirone responded seriously, Amy had already left for somewhere out of sight.

"We've been delayed. Let's go to the lecture hall now."

Except for Aider who was in the hospital, all graduating students had arrived.

"Shirone, don't go anywhere and stick close to the research society. I'll beat you until you cry."

"Haha! Got it. I'll be waiting."

Watching the graduating class rush off in a group, Shirone left through the steel door and headed to Estas, the magic warehouse.

As expected, without the nagging person around, even more dust had accumulated than before.

Familiar scenery, familiar smell.

But now he knew what kind of place Estas was.

"It's finally hitting me that I've returned from heaven."

Though he hadn't gotten a definitive answer from Ikael, there had been some results.

Shirone recalled the time spent with Miro the night before descending the mountain.

'The meat was really delicious.'

Following the delicious smell wafting from the cabin for the first time, he came out of his room to find Miro grilling meat she had bought from the village.

Perhaps to create a lively atmosphere, strong alcohol was prepared on one side as well.

"What's all this?"

"We need to have a descent commemoration party. Of course, it won't taste as good as the porridge I made."

"Ah, of course not."

Shirone immediately answered, worried the story might change, and sat at the table as Miro placed the grilled meat and opened the bottle.

"Come, drink. You're old enough to drink now, right?"

"Yes, I am, but..."

As Shirone hesitated while holding the glass, Miro aggressively toasted.

"Come on! Drink, drink! We're going all the way tonight!"

One hour later.

Having emptied all the bottles, the two sat on a hill looking down at the mountain scenery.

After the hellish schedule ended, the long-awaited peace felt like their whole bodies were melting.

"Shirone, do you regret going to heaven?"

Knowing she had something she wanted to say, his answer came naturally despite the sudden question.

"No, there's no way I would. I came back alive."

Miro smiled sadly.

"You wanted to ask Ikael something, didn't you?"

As the silence lengthened, Miro asked again.

"Do you think she's your mother?"

"Yes. Though I didn't get an answer."

"Then you must have some guess about your father too?"

Since Shirone didn't know who Ikael had fallen in love with, Miro's question was a bit more difficult, but he could feel the presence of someone dwelling within him.

"Why are you asking such things?"

"Aren't you resentful? Your biological parents abandoned you."

It felt like he should answer before hearing the answer.

"My parents live in Creas. I have no other parents."

Shirone looked up at the night sky.

"I just thought I should know. Who they are, and what reasons there were."

After hearing that much, Miro was lost in thought for a long time before slowly opening her mouth.

"Shirone, perhaps I am..."

At the heavy voice, Shirone turned his head, but Miro suddenly changed her expression and playfully leaned against his shoulder.

"Never mind."

"Why, why are you doing this?"

Though Shirone shuddered, Miro stubbornly wrapped her arms around him too.

"Stay still. Why? Are you embarrassed?"

"Don't change the subject. You had something you wanted to say, didn't you?"

Still leaning against him, Miro slowly shook her head.

"It's nothing. I just felt I should say it. But if you really think of your current parents as your real parents, it doesn't seem like something that should come from my mouth."

Staring intently at Miro, Shirone seemed to reach some conclusion and turned his gaze forward again.

"Yes. I have only two parents."

There are some stories that shouldn't be heard through others.

"Ah, but this feels good. Leaning against a young man's shoulder like this. Is this why people date?"

"The Association President thinks about you a lot, Miro."

Miro just laughed like a girl.

"It's going to be busy from now on. Both you and me. Even if it's just because I regret the youth I've wasted for 20 years, I have to live earnestly."

"Thank you. You gave me new hope."

"Thanks for what. This is all preparation for my old age too. Someday I'll benefit from my student."

Miro looked up at the full moon floating above the mountain.

"...Let's keep in touch."

Shirone laughed, his shoulders shaking.

"Yes."

Breaking from his reminiscence, a gentle smile formed on Shirone's lips.

'Thanks to that, I got to know many good people.'

But that was now in the past.

Even Estas, which had drawn the world's attention, was just an ordinary research society.

'There are no more secrets. From today, it's training again.'

As if wary of the relief from escaping the competition, Shirone straightened his posture and entered the sequence formula.

The difficulty of going from hundred million to trillion versus trillion to quadrillion was like heaven and earth.

Therefore, it was impossible to even predict how long it would take to reach the next stage, the realm of sea.

'I believe in the power of each day. I'll build it up day by day.'

As the sequence raced and entered Photon Angel mode, the incarnation of light seeped into Shirone's body.

Though he felt no special changes, perceiving three seconds in one second was a given.

'Like this, the wall of time...'

At that moment, Shirone's face suddenly hardened.

'What? What is this?'

An incomprehensible voice flickered in his ears like a hallucination.

"Who's there!"

Feeling like something had passed behind him, he turned and shouted, when a blood-curdling scream came from outside the door.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

"Chase it! Don't let it escape!"

Just from the sounds resembling a battlefield, he could tell what was happening in the corridor.

"What's going on?"

Shirone rushed out of the research society with an urgent expression.

"..."

But the corridor scene he looked at was as quiet as ever.

'No one's there? Then what did I hear?'

Realizing Photon Angel mode had been released, Shirone entered unity of mind and matter again.

'Time Stop Slow Motion.'

As the incarnation seeped in, he again heard the sound of people running on the ceiling with thudding footsteps.

"Don't let your guard down! The opponent is the strongest Asura!"

"Reporting! Squad 1 annihilated! Squad 1 annihilated!"

As Shirone listened to the hallucinations with a stunned expression, one thought suddenly flashed through his mind.

"Maybe..."

Something more might still remain here.
