[557] The Steel Door Again (2)

Shirone had returned.

It was a fact that brought joy to some and despair to others.

Most of those who had competed fiercely in the first half felt the pressure of being pushed out of the mainstream just by seeing Shirone pass through the steel door.

"Shirone!"

Nade ran over with tears welling up in his eyes and pulled Shirone into a tight embrace.

"What happened! Do you know how shocked we were? I really..."

His voice choked up and he couldn't speak.

It wasn't just anything - Shirone had written a farewell letter and suddenly disappeared without a trace.

"I'm sorry. I'll tell you everything soon."

"What do you mean soon! Tell us right now! What happened?"

Iruki grabbed Nade's shoulder and stopped him.

"Calm down. Look behind you."

Turning his head, Nade realized everyone was staring at him blankly and stepped back with a cough.

"Right, let's talk about it later."

Shirone lightly patted Nade's back and walked toward Collie.

On the way, he glanced back at Amy with a small smile, but she coldly turned her head away.

'Well, I'll have to explain things slowly.'

He couldn't blame Amy for feeling betrayed, as he would have felt the same if he were in her position.

Approaching Collie, Shirone bowed his head in greeting.

"I've arrived. I apologize for causing you concern."

"Hmm..."

Collie didn't know why Shirone had refused evaluation.

But from the ominous atmosphere that had circulated around the school at the time and Ethella and Shiina's sudden business trip, he could guess it wasn't just personal matters.

And if he were to speculate a bit further, it was probably related to the Day of Twenty Judges that had occurred when he was a young teacher.

"Well, I'm glad you returned safely. Will you resume evaluations from the second half?"

The competitors' gazes focused on Shirone.

If Shirone joined the already fierce competition, it would be like another predator entering the world of survival of the fittest.

"No. I'll refuse evaluation in the second half as well."

The atmosphere stirred.

While it was fortunate for the competitors, it was an unexpected decision for Shirone.

As Amy looked at Shirone for the first time, Nade asked.

"Shirone, are you really going to take the graduation exam like this?"

Once he returned to magic school...

Instead of answering, Shirone recalled Miro's advice.

"Go to Teacher Collie and tell him you'll continue refusing evaluation. You've already lost over 100 points due to going to heaven. Even if you try your best to catch up in the remaining time, it's impossible to turn things around. That's how the system works."

Except for major specialty reinforcement or group evaluations, you had to accumulate small daily points, so several weeks of absence was a serious loss.

"But will it be okay? If I refuse evaluation, I won't even be able to enter the evaluation hall."

"You have friends. Even though they're competitors, they'll help you. Factions form naturally during graduation exams, so there's no reason to abandon connections."

Though it was a statement that denied pure friendship, having a give-and-take relationship made Shirone feel lighter too.

"And most importantly, it's about you. It's much more efficient to not reveal your abilities than to gauge your competitors' skills."

Shirone couldn't deny that point.

"If the exam proceeds normally, you'll definitely be able to make it into the top 10. But to survive, that alone isn't enough. Remember this for sure. From now on, it's politics."

'From now on, it's politics.'

Breaking from his thoughts, Shirone said.

"I want to try it alone. It's hard to catch up on points anyway."

Collie respected Shirone's opinion.

"I understand. Then Shirone, go to the dormitory and the rest of you... Hm?"

As Collie raised his gaze, the students turned their heads to follow.

A woman with brown skin and a slender figure was entering through the steel door.

While the students stared mesmerized at the beautiful woman with her hair tied back, revealing her crescent-shaped forehead, someone's name suddenly popped out.

"Maya?"

Starting from that point, the students began murmuring, and Shirone also looked at Maya with a dazed expression.

She was from the Mystic Tribe, majored in sound magic, but had consistently been at the bottom of the graduating class.

Though she had been naturally pretty, the weight loss had made her look completely different from before.

"Is that really Maya? Crybaby Maya?"

For Screamer, who didn't know Maya before she gained weight, it was hard to believe even seeing it with his own eyes.

They say a woman's beauty is power, right?

Though they had an almost adversarial relationship - clashing in strategic tactical evaluations and confronting each other in hill occupation - now that she approached with her transformed appearance, he couldn't treat her carelessly like before.

"Um... sorry, but could you move aside? The path is blocked..."

Her weak personality seemed unchanged as Maya's voice trembled.

"Huh? Oh, sorry."

As Screamer hurriedly cleared the way, she walked to Collie and stood next to Shirone, bowing her head.

"Teacher, I've arrived."

"Yes. You've gotten quite thin since I last saw you."

"I don't need to build up my vocal capacity anymore."

Though she had sought to change her technique after hearing Iruki's advice to abandon vocal techniques, that couldn't be the only reason.

Collie recalled Maya visiting him on a rainy night, crying her heart out saying she couldn't forget Shirone.

It was clear she had lost her appetite due to heartbreak.

'Has she sorted out her feelings?'

Looking pitifully at the student he had personally scouted, Collie soon regained his composure and spoke.

"Right, you're still refusing evaluation, I suppose?"

"Yes..."

"I understand. Go in and rest."

Maya, who had been heading to the dormitory past Collie, hesitated for a moment then gathered courage to turn around.

Among the gazes of numerous male students, she found Shirone precisely and smiled slightly, replacing a long-overdue greeting.

Nade, who had approached at some point, poked Shirone's side.

"Hey, hey! She's become incredibly beautiful, hasn't she? But she still has feelings for you, doesn't she? Lucky bastard, I'm jealous."

"What's there to be jealous of?"

Though Shirone asked back with a serious expression, Amy had already left for somewhere out of sight.

"We've been delayed. Let's go to the classroom now."

Except for Aider who was in the hospital, all the graduating students had arrived.

"Shirone, don't go anywhere and stick close to the research group. I'll beat you until you cry."

"Haha! Got it. I'll be waiting."

Watching the graduating class rush off together, Shirone left through the steel door and headed to the magic warehouse, Estas.

As expected, without the nagging caretaker, even more dust had accumulated than before.

Familiar scenery, familiar smells.

But now he knew what kind of place Estas was.

"It's only now hitting me that I've returned from heaven."

Though he hadn't gotten a definitive answer from Ikael, there had been some meaningful results.

Shirone recalled the time he spent with Miro the night before descending the mountain.

'The meat really was delicious.'

Following the delicious smell rising from the cabin for the first time, he came out of his room to find Miro grilling meat she had bought from the village.

Perhaps to create a festive atmosphere, she had even prepared strong alcohol on the side.

"What's all this?"

"We need to have a descent celebration party. Of course, it won't taste as good as the porridge I made."

"Oh, of course not."

Shirone immediately agreed, worried the statement might change, and sat at the table as Miro placed the grilled meat and opened the bottle.

"Come on, drink. You're old enough to drink now, right?"

"Yes, I am, but..."

As Shirone hesitated while holding the glass, Miro aggressively toasted.

"Come on! Drink, drink! We're going all the way tonight!"

One hour later.

Having emptied all the bottles, the two sat on a hill looking down at the mountain scenery.

After the hellish schedule ended, the long-awaited peace felt like it was melting their entire bodies.

"Shirone, do you regret going to heaven?"

Knowing she had something she wanted to say, his answer came naturally despite the sudden question.

"No, how could I? I came back alive."

Miro smiled sadly.

"You wanted to ask Ikael something, didn't you?"

As the silence lengthened, Miro asked again.

"Do you think she's your mother?"

"Yes. Though I didn't get an answer."

"Then you must have some idea about your father too?"

Since Shirone didn't know who Ikael had fallen in love with, Miro's question was a bit more difficult, but he could feel the presence of someone within him.

"Why are you asking such things?"

"Aren't you resentful? Your birth parents abandoned you."

It seemed like he should answer before hearing the answer.

"My parents live in Creas. I have no other parents."

Shirone looked up at the night sky.

"I just thought I should know. Who they are, and what reasons there were."

After hearing that much, Miro was lost in thought for a long time before slowly opening her mouth.

"Shirone, perhaps I am..."

At the heavy voice, Shirone turned his head, but Miro suddenly changed her expression and playfully leaned on his shoulder.

"Never mind."

"Why, why are you doing this?"

Though Shirone shuddered, Miro stubbornly wrapped her arms around him too.

"Stay still. Why? Are you embarrassed?"

"Don't change the subject. You had something you wanted to say, didn't you?"

Still leaning against him, Miro slowly shook her head.

"It's nothing. I just felt like I should say it. But if you really think of your current parents as your birth parents, it's not something that should come from my mouth."

Shirone stared at Miro intently, then seemed to reach some conclusion and turned his gaze forward again.

"Yes. I have only two parents."

There are some stories that shouldn't be heard through others.

"Ah, but this is nice. Leaning on a young man's shoulder like this. Is this why people date?"

"The Association President thinks about you a lot, Miss Miro."

Miro just laughed like a girl.

"It's going to be busy from now on. For you and for me. Even if it's just because I regret the youth I've wasted for 20 years, I have to live earnestly."

"Thank you. You gave me new hope."

"Thank you for what. This is all preparation for my old age. Someday I'll benefit from having a student."

Miro looked up at the full moon floating above the mountain.

"...Let's keep in touch."

Shirone's shoulders shook as he laughed.

"Yes."

Breaking from his reminiscence, a gentle smile formed on Shirone's lips.

'Thanks to that, I got to know many good people.'

But that was now in the past.

Even Estas, which had drawn the world's attention, was just an ordinary research group.

'There are no more secrets. From today, it's training again.'

As if wary of the relief of escaping the competition, Shirone straightened his posture and entered the sequence ceremony.

The difficulty of going from hundred million to trillion versus trillion to quadrillion was like the difference between heaven and earth.

Therefore, it was impossible to even predict how long it would take to reach the next stage, the realm of the sun.

'I believe in the power of each day. I'll build it up day by day.'

As the sequence raced and entered Photon Angel mode, the incarnation of light seeped into Shirone's body.

Though he didn't feel any special changes, perceiving three seconds in one second was a given.

'Breaking through the wall of time like this...'

At that moment, Shirone's face suddenly hardened.

'What? What is this?'

An incomprehensible voice flickered in his ears like a hallucination.

"Who's there!"

Feeling like something had passed behind him, he turned and shouted, when a piercing scream came from outside the door.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

"Chase them! Don't let them escape!"

Just from the sounds reminiscent of a battlefield, he could tell something had happened in the corridor.

"What's going on?"

Shirone rushed out of the research room with an urgent expression.

"..."

But the corridor scene he looked at was as quiet as ever.

'There's no one here? Then what did I hear?'

Realizing that Photon Angel mode had been released, Shirone entered unity of mind and body again.

'Shibuisangpokmaek.'

As the incarnation seeped in, he again heard the sound of people running with thuds from the ceiling.

"Don't let your guard down! The opponent is the strongest Panya!"

"Reporting! Squad 1 annihilated! Squad 1 annihilated!"

As Shirone listened to the hallucinations with a dazed expression, one thought suddenly flashed through his mind.

"Maybe..."

Something more might still remain here.
