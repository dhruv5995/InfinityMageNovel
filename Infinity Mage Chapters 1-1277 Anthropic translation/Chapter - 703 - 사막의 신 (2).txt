[703] God of the Desert (2)

"Did you say... Yaksha?"

The Maga Bandit Group consisted of only S-class criminals even within the Empire - there was no way they wouldn't know about Yaksha.

'Though they couldn't even touch the boss's toes anyway.'

Incarnation was ultimately a standard of realm, not martial power - even among Yaksha, the levels varied drastically.

When Baeknyeo unwound her faded multicolored turban, ominously black hair flowed down like a horse's mane.

Using the turban to wipe the sweat from her chest, she carefully examined the King Scorpion corpses.

In the area pocked with craters as if meteors had fallen, the mangled bodies of scorpions were scattered everywhere.

In some areas they were cleanly severed in half, while in others they were chopped into small pieces as if ground up.

"One Prajña. Two Yaksha."

Based on the combination, this was definitely the group she was looking for.

"Where did they go?"

Though finding it odd that the boss was being so talkative today, the vice-leader reported what he knew.

"It seems they went south."

"What's to the south?"

"A place called Vanguard... It's the largest oasis in the region. It's an intermediate base that merchants use before crossing into the Paras Kingdom. The security is tight."

Baeknyeo handed the turban to the vice-leader and mounted her Omek.

"Ah..."

At the intoxicating scent, the vice-leader desperately suppressed his urge to bury his face in the turban.

'Get it together. She's not a woman. She's just a beast.'

She didn't even wash her body until it rained, and he'd naturally never seen her wear underwear.

All she had was one set of rags no different from tatters, and when she urinated while walking, it was impossible not to be horrified.

He had never once thought her beautiful.

But why did his chest burn like fire whenever he was near her?

Baeknyeo gave her orders.

"Vanguard. We head south."

The gang members' eyes widened.

"Surely you don't mean to pursue them? The God of the Desert is approaching now."

Baeknyeo, being the king of beasts, felt the change in the wind's nature most acutely.

"Those guys left hours ago. It's already too late. We won't make it in time."

"We just need to ride fast."

But wasn't the impossibility of riding that fast exactly why they were desperately trying to dissuade her?

"Going there isn't the problem."

The vice-leader wanted to fulfill Baeknyeo's wishes.

"But what about the work we're doing now? The altar demolition business."

"We can do it later."

It was a solution only Baeknyeo could propose.

"...Understood."

The vice-leader, mounting his Omek, shouted to the gang members.

"From now on, we ride at maximum speed! Destination is Vanguard!"

'She's crazy. She's going to get us all killed.'

Baeknyeo and the 40-member bandit group departed south.

As night fell and the temperature dropped rapidly, just flying through the air was enough to freeze one's flesh.

"Ugh, so cold. There's this problem too."

Worin's words about having to reach Vanguard before sunset finally made sense.

"Just bear with it a little. I can see the oasis over there."

A lake-sized oasis reflected the moon floating in the sky, with a commercial complex formed beside it.

'So that's Vanguard.'

An apartment made of three buildings formed the outer walls by itself, with countless stalls visible in the inner courtyard.

Lian said,

"That's a fortress. The buildings are steel-framed and the windows are double-paned. Is there really a need to build it like that?"

"It's definitely strange. And you know what? People have been appearing frequently since the sun went down."

Countless merchants who had been hiding who knows where were rapidly gathering at Vanguard.

"Right. Just like people being chased."

Kido laughed.

"Kekeke! What's there to worry about? Worin told us to go. That woman may be crazy, but she has proper judgment."

Though contradictory, it was strangely convincing.

"We fought like madmen during the day, so when it's time to rest, let's rest properly. We got paid handsomely too."

As Caidra approached, the merchants gathering at Vanguard all looked up at the sky and shouted.

"Hey! Look over there!"

At the appearance of the terrifying monster bird, Baltan was terrified, and sirens wailed from Vanguard's watchtower.

"Monster! A monster has appeared!"

Then someone pointed at Sirone.

"Wait! There are people!"

Caidra, with Worin as its master, seemed accustomed to such situations and landed at the nearest spot.

"What about Latusa? Even if we take him to a stable or something, he'd just be a meal for everyone there."

"Worin said there's no need to take special care of him. If we let him roam free, he'll find food on his own."

Sirone, who had jumped down from Caidra, stopped walking and looked ahead with a hardened expression.

Countless merchants were staring at Sirone's group.

"Um... hello?"

Though he greeted them in the continental common language, the merchants who used only Kashan's language for their entire lives couldn't understand.

"He's not Middle Eastern, is he? What's with that disgusting green face?"

"Looks like he's been poisoned by desert toxins. Tsk tsk, how pitiful. There's no way he'll get married looking like that."

Though Kido had never eaten Middle Easterners, he understood from their stares and tongue-clicking sounds alone.

"These people really! I'm a goblin! I have the most handsome face among goblins!"

The tongue-clicking sounds grew louder.

"Where are you folks from?"

At the elderly merchant's question, Sirone spoke.

"Lian, relay my words. Tell them we're not merchants, and that monster bird is my summon. Introduce me as a mage."

This should be enough to convince them.

When Lian struggled to remember and roughly conveyed the message, murmurs arose among the merchants.

"A mage? If he can control such a monster, he must be an incredible mage."

"Then..."

Everyone's eyes changed.

'Mages have money.'

The moment that thought ended, all the merchants rushed toward Sirone.

"What! Why are these people acting like this!"

Since fighting among merchants meant closing shop that very day, soliciting was absolutely forbidden inside Vanguard.

But outside Vanguard, suckers belonged to whoever bit first.

Especially if it was a mage who could summon monster birds - buying all their goods would be nothing to them.

"Here! Buy my goods! They're specialty items! I guarantee the quality!"

"You need to tell me what they are!"

Countless words came through the Ultima System.

"Buy mine! Hurry up and buy it! Before I kill you!"

'If you're going to kill me, why are you doing business?'

A skeleton-thin man held out something like a black lump of dirt, and a nauseating smell wafted up.

"You were looking for this, weren't you? It's a medicine that makes you immortal."

"Immortal?"

"Just mix one spoonful in water and drink it, and you absolutely won't die until the next morning. You can have an amazing night."

"I'm not buying! I'm not buying anything at all!"

"You're sufficient on your own! Don't you know the saying that your right hand shouldn't know what your left hand is doing?"

Sirone cried out.

"Lian! I can't understand a single word!"

At the same time, Lian grabbed Sirone and leaped over the people.

Kido, with his glasses askew, was waiting with a dazed expression, and as soon as Sirone arrived, he simultaneously turned his body.

"Run! Get inside!"

As they passed through Vanguard's main gate, Caidra's monster bird cry could be heard faintly echoing through the sky.

"Wow! This is really incredible! Total hard selling."

As Sirone caught his breath with his hands on his knees, a woman's tinkling laughter was heard.

"Hohoho! Of course. This is the middle of a desert ruled by nothingness. You can't survive with a sound mind."

She was a plump woman in her 40s, with two subordinates equipped with swords guarding her left and right.

Her lips were red as blood, with powder applied so thickly it made her swarthy skin look white.

She held a Middle Eastern fan, and a corset was tightly bound inside her see-through dress.

"You are...?"

The woman flipped her fan back and greeted them.

"I'm Momodo, the 32nd administrator of Vanguard. I heard you're a mage - is that true?"

"Yes."

There was no need for Lian to translate.

"Please forget the commotion outside, and by all means, spend lots of money at Vanguard. Tonight is going to be quite long, after all."

"What does that mean?"

This time Lian translated.

"Because the God of the Desert will soon cover this place."

"God of the Desert?"

It was a term he'd seen in the dead man's diary.

"The God of the Desert is Noskarta, a special equatorial wind created by the unique environment of the Akad Desert. A massive sandstorm that sweeps away everything."

"If it's such a tremendous sandstorm, how has this place remained safe until now?"

Momodo pointed to a massive mechanical device installed between the ㄷ-shaped apartments.

"It's a drainage device. Even when sandstorms blow, it immediately pumps them out. The never-drying Oasis Luna and this drainage device are Vanguard's pride."

It was the only sanctuary in the central desert.

'Hmm, then the King Scorpions' great migration too...'

Just how tremendous must this sandstorm be for monsters over 2 meters long to flee in droves?

"Vanguard is safe. So spend money! Enjoy yourselves! Even the God of the Desert can't stop your extravagance."

After Momodo delivered Vanguard's promotional message and disappeared, Sirone's group looked around the market decorated in brilliant colors.

"Since she's so confident, let's relax. At least we won't be buried in the desert."

If a desert storm was coming, they'd inevitably be stuck here for a while.

"Should we? Let's fill our stomachs first. We couldn't eat anything because we were fighting King Scorpions."

Sirone's group chose grilled salamander skewers.

Though disgusting to look at, Kido's philosophy was that when you visit a new place, you must taste the local specialties.

They bought meaningless souvenirs and each got a special cream that prevented skin damage from sunlight.

"This is fun, this thing called traveling. Where should we go now?"

"How about over there?"

Where Sirone pointed, various tents were lined up along the street.

"It's an astrology shop. I heard the tribes of the Akad Desert are skilled in astrology."

"Ah, predicting the future, you mean?"

Kido, who had been blinking, snorted.

"I don't believe in that stuff. Just thinking statistically, there are way too many of them, right? Did all the fortune tellers in the world gather here?"

"Haha! That's true."

Sirone felt the same way, but as a Prajña who had realized the law, he was genuinely interested.

"Astrologers who have truly realized the law are extremely rare in the world. But let's go anyway, pretending to be fooled. This is also a memory."

Long lines of people formed at each tent.

'Well, this is a desert after all.'

It was natural for people surviving in a land ruled by death to have great anxiety about the future.

"It's popular. Looks like we'll have to wait a long time."

"That tent has no line."

It was a tent with a crystal ball flag fluttering, and surprisingly, there wasn't a single person waiting.

Kido said with suspicious eyes,

"Usually places like that have really no skill."

"What does it matter? We don't believe in it anyway. It'd be fun to hear from someone else's mouth what will happen to us later."

Since they'd decided to rest anyway, he wanted to try various things.

"Kekeke! I'll probably be the ruler of the world."

So Sirone, having found the astrology shop, parted the tent curtains and entered.

"Excuse me. Huh?"

A girl about the same age had even removed her face veil, placing it on the table, and was sleeping with her head tilted back.

She was drooling and showed no signs of waking up. As he watched this scene, Kido followed him in and said,

"There's always a reason why places go out of business."
