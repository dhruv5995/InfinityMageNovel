Omega (1)

"Is it beginning?"

Lightning flashed in Blitz's eyes as he surveyed the Alphoneus Mountains from the sky.

Through the bidirectional network, the thoughts of the Colorless Dragon Calathorsa were being transmitted.

'Dragon Speech.'

The dragon language consists of binary code.

'The minimum unit of information that forms existence.' That's why it's precise.

'While the human word "red" would have a nearly infinite spectrum...

Binary can accurately express every type of red that exists in the universe.

'There is no distortion in our conversations.' The terminus of infinite regression.

This was why the dragon race could build a massive database sharing each other's thoughts.

'But that's merely browsing information at best.'

The Ultima System recorded in the dragon database was not at such a trivial level.

'Unary.'

The Ultima System could accept all signals in this world as they are.

'In a world completely deconstructed, what you faced was probably the Void...

No information actually exists there.

'You possess the one thing that can dwell in that silent Void.'

The Heart.

In a place where nothing exists, only the heart flows.

'That is humanity.'

Soon Shirone would understand this too.

'Only humans can transcend administrative authority and strike the outer world.'

This was possible when all hearts, all quantum signals, were unified into one.

'As the Gaians did.'

The collision of the Ultima System and the Akashic Records.

"This is what you must witness." Blitz's gaze penetrated through the illusion called the Alphoneus Mountains, reaching deep underground.

Shirone, enveloped in Calathorsa's massive light, stopped thinking and opened his mouth.

"All the world's information—are you speaking of omniscience?"

Shirone's Ultima System accepted Calathorsa's binary without difficulty.

"It's not academic knowledge as defined by humans. Knowledge is ultimately a realm of interpretation. What I wish to convey to you exists in itself. It is knowing."

Light pressed down on Shirone as if it had mass.

"I am the Guardian of Time, Calathorsa. Without time, there are no phenomena. Nothing can be hot, melt, or freeze."

That's why he was colorless.

"Only I can spread out the instantaneous signals that compose this world in units of time. And now I will pass those records to you. Everything in the world, the beginning and end of time."

A powerful voice permeated through.

"Omniscience—Omega."

Knowledge is contained in the flow of time.

'The history of everything.'

Shirone recalled the day he completed the spine of knowledge in the great library of the Augent family.

'The mage's path.'

Everything had started from that moment.

And now, the seeker of truth was about to contain everything in this world.

"I will accept it."

Vast data of unknowable extent began seeping through Shirone's light.

"It will be a long journey."

Literally the beginning of the universe.

Shirone's ego, regressing to that point, gradually faded and completely disappeared.

"Ahh."

Everything was rushing in.

In the beginning, there was light.

'Gasp!'

Shirone's eyes snapped open from an indescribable shock, and lightning exploded in his vision.

'I am...'

Calathorsa's records had a structure of infinitely arranged binary information, but

'Ankera?'

With ten senses transcending time and space, Shirone absorbed the entirety of this world.

'What is this?'

When Ankera first realized its existence, what it felt was doubt about causality.

'Was I dreaming?'

Surely I couldn't have suddenly come into being?

'Or is this a dream?'

Ankera, pondering in a world without even time, finally reached a conclusion.

"I don't know."

Some world might have actually existed, or it might have been merely an illusion without a subject.

"Only what I perceive is everything."

The Heart Program—God.

Ankera's heart, the first to perceive the world, spread through quantum signals.

Eight concepts separated from the unified field, and the universe formed according to time's rush.

The sun and countless planets began operating according to their own rules through the primordial force.

'The beginning of laws.'

Though unpredictable by human thought, causality was already determined from this moment.

According to that causality, what could be called life was born in the Goldilocks zone.

'Cells.'

The simplest organic matter repeated evolution and elimination, experimenting with countless species.

The environment was still harsh.

"Taesung."

From the boiling sea, Argoneth, the father of life, slowly climbed onto land.

"The strongest life form has been born."

After saying this, when the motionless Argoneth opened his mouth again, vast time had passed.

"A mutation."

Where Taesung turned her head, the strongest life form that Shirone also knew was flying through the sky.

'Calathorsa.'

With countless dragons led by the Colorless Dragon occupying land, sea, and air, Taesung spoke.

"Poor children."

Argoneth agreed.

"As time passes, the environment will stabilize. If that species is preserved, the ecosystem's balance will be destroyed."

They were a kind of prototype.

"If possible, right now..."

When killing intent emanated from Argoneth's body, Taesung looked back with a sad expression.

"I think all life is precious."

"A personal view? How peculiar."

As beings equally born from Ankera, it was strange that their thoughts differed so much.

"They're children who came from me. It's all my fault. If I had created a better environment..."

"Laws have no meaning."

Argoneth cut her off.

"We are in the early days of the world. The ripples created when things lean to one side will grow uncontrollably larger as time passes. I exist for the ecosystem, not for specific creatures."

Shirone realized that the conflict between Argoneth and Gaia had begun from this moment.

'But...'

Certainly, even in the era Shirone lived in, dragons existed as apostles of time.

'What could have happened?' Omega flowed again.

All events integrating time and space streamed in, perfecting omniscience.

Kraaaang!

A dragon's roar was transmitted in binary language and manifested in Shirone's senses.

Dozens of shattered moons scattered fragments across the sky as meteors fell.

"Why..."

Calathorsa, crashed into the ground, writhed and slowly raised his head.

"Do you seek to destroy us?"

"Because you are strong."

Argoneth's voice was cold.

"There's no such thing as a predictable range for life forms, but you've become too strong. You may consider it an honor."

At first, they were merely strong creatures.

But the tremendous cognitive abilities created by extreme environments repeated infinite regression until...

'The source of the world.'

They reached the stage of controlling phenomena.

"How does that become a reason for extinction?"

"I don't know."

Argoneth didn't know either.

"We exist without reason, and all history is accomplished by a mission that transcends this world."

"Are you speaking of the outer world?" Ankera had defined everything in this world, but there was one fact it couldn't know.

Where did I come from?

"Life receives genes from previous generations. But Ankera is different. When a being is born from nothingness, can you even imagine that being's reasoning? It's simply a mission. A mission to fill this world with life."

"What if that mission becomes corrupted someday?"

Argoneth tilted his head and answered after another vast passage of time.

"However the whole becomes corrupted, that is the whole."

"Then what is the meaning of life? Only Ankera can dream new dreams. If all life is reset, what are we doing now?"

"...What are you trying to say?"

"I'm speaking of your authority. If such a situation occurs, as the one responsible for all life, you can't be said to be without fault either."

Ankera, Gaia, and Argoneth were born with the mission to manage their respective realms.

'My mission...'

Calathorsa spoke.

"I will protect it."

Argoneth raised his head.

"What?"

"Even if Ankera dreams new dreams, I will protect the dreams of all life. By becoming an apostle of time..."

Calathorsa, raising his massive body with countless dragons on his back, looked down at Argoneth.

"History will not change."

Argoneth fell into thought.

'Truly a peculiar creature. A mutation? But that too would be nothing more than the causality of laws.'

He wanted to think there was a reason for existence.

"I will watch."

As Argoneth, who had permitted the preservation of the dragon race, turned and moved away, Taesung appeared.

"What?"

"How fortunate, to be able to protect the children."

Taesung smiled and added.

"Honey."

"...Hmph."

Leaving behind a cold response as he passed by, Taesung turned and said.

"See you often."

It was simply that kind of world.

An era when they thought they were everything, not even knowing the true meaning of their mission.

Shirone endlessly accepted Omega.

And at some point, he felt through his ten senses an event that would shake the very foundation of this world.

"It's a nice feeling."

In the now-stabilized environment, Argoneth and Taesung looked down at the life forms on earth.

"Yes. They resemble you."

Befitting humanity born from earth, the males had rough skin, but the females were smooth like moist clay.

All had fierce expressions, with metallic hair falling below their waists, giving them a strong impression.

"Shall we call them Gaians?"

At Argoneth's words, Taesung turned her head.

"Is that really okay?"

"Though they resemble me in form, everything about them came from you. It would be good to call them Gaians."

Taesung was pleased.

"Our children..."

At that moment, Argoneth's eyes widened and a serious light began to swirl.

"What is it?"

When Taesung, feeling the same thing, looked up at the sky, Shirone also aligned his gaze with hers.

'It's not the sky.'

Countless flashes that probably originated from outside the world were being shot at the Gaians.

User code input.

Link.

The Gaians who received the signal raised their heads, and golden electricity flowed in their eyes.

"Grrrr!" One man who had been frowning soon made a calm expression and looked around.

"Here? It's disgustingly desolate. Won't be much fun."

A wolf-like woman approached him while alternately checking her hands.

"We're the first. We'll forget everything anyway when the missing link code activates, but it's still somewhat unsettling. Usually it's completed in the fetal stage."

As other users were already losing their memories, the woman made a dazed expression.

"Ah... I'm coming too." The light in her pupils was fading.

"Take care. See you in the next life." The woman's memory was blocked, and the man also looked up at the sky, waiting for his time to come.

"...The beginning of endless reincarnation." Argoneth approached.

"What are you?"

The moment the turning man smiled, Argoneth received pure shock.

Never could any being in the world so perfectly display arrogance.

'That light contained in those eyes.' Where could that light come from, that looked down on all things in the world as trivial?

'As if...'

It seemed to be saying this:

I am your god.
