**[710] The 19,000 Worlds (4)**

**Labyrinth Jessica**

In the beautiful kingdom of Molton, adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea to the north, lies the Giants' Ruins—one of the world's three great labyrinths.

Ever since the great hunter Jessica first discovered this place, the Giants' Ruins had been the paradise sought by countless hunters.

Some knew about heaven, others didn't, but it was an established fact that numerous ancient weapons were buried here.

When Jin Seong-eum arrived at Jessica, countless tents were still pitched around the massive pyramid.

Merchants had set up stalls to provide for their convenience, and further away, the buildings of the Molton Kingdom's Ruins Restoration Project Department could be seen.

"Jessica is also an unconquered labyrinth. But unlike the other three great labyrinths, it's also a profitable place."

At the words of Moon Gyeong, captain of the 'Three Steps,' Jin Seong-eum let out a refined breath while gazing at Jessica's pyramid.

Her large, horizontally-elongated eyes were fierce like a cat's, and her tightly pressed lips were red like wild strawberries.

As was common among Eastern women, her build was small, but her long neck created beautiful proportions, and her two fists were always clenched tight.

'The Iron Lady.'

Moon Gyeong admired Jin Seong-eum.

'I dare not think I could possess you.'

Three steps—that was the distance Seong-eum had permitted him.

As the princess's guard captain, if he had one wish, it would be to take even one more step closer to her before he died.

'It was a life that began at ten steps.'

That had been the minimum distance from which he could protect Seong-eum with his martial prowess.

'Nine steps, eight steps, seven steps...'

Seong-eum at six steps was different, and Seong-eum at five steps was different.

Each time he narrowed the distance by one step, his feelings of admiration grew, and only upon reaching three steps could he begin to understand her.

'I will protect you.'

Moon Gyeong couldn't imagine what Seong-eum would look like when he reached two steps—a distance she had never permitted any man.

"Let's go in. It's time to take the Ivory Tower's test."

When Seong-eum turned around, all 200 royal guards, including the 20 members of Three Steps, knelt in unison.

"You all stay here. I alone am sufficient."

Moon Gyeong shook his head.

"That cannot be, Your Highness. It's not that I doubt your abilities, but Jessica is crawling with shameless hunters. Please don't trouble yourself with tiresome schemes that would disturb your peace of mind."

Anger flashed in Seong-eum's eyes.

"Moon Gyeong, I am not a flower to be treated with precious care. Despicable schemes and men's tricks—these are things I must overcome myself. Otherwise, how could I call myself a candidate of the Ivory Tower?"

Moon Gyeong knew that no matter how strong the hunters were, they would be no match for Seong-eum.

According to the Jin Celestial Empire's analysis, when the three candidates faced each other individually, the consensus was that no one could defeat Seong-eum.

'One who dominates space has no weaknesses. But...'

He simply didn't like it.

The very thought of common ruffians laying their eyes on Jin Seong-eum was unbearably shameful.

"If you insist, then please keep at least the Three Steps by your side. This is competition, after all. We'll handle the miscellaneous matters."

Seong-eum was not one to easily bend her will to anyone's words, but she couldn't be completely cold to the three steps she had personally acknowledged.

"Fine. Then only the members of Three Steps shall follow me."

Overwhelmed with emotion, Moon Gyeong's eyes welled with tears as he struck his head against the ground until it bled.

"I will serve you with my life!"

Seong-eum looked down at Moon Gyeong indifferently, but for a moment, it seemed like a spring breeze passed through her eyes.

"Let's go. I hope La Enemie is here."

"It surely will be. Aren't you the one chosen by heaven, Your Highness?"

"Haha, such eunuch-like words..."

The princess of the Jin Celestial Empire stepped toward the pyramid.

**Labyrinth Andre**

**World Number 1**

When Shirone first arrived, he was greeted by the earth-shaking roar of volcanic eruptions.

"Where is this...?"

Shirone had unlocked the door marked with the number 1 using the Ultima System and entered.

The oxygen was much denser than in the previous world.

Tropical forests of tremendous height and scale spread out everywhere, and burning rocks flew through the sky.

*Kyaaaaaaa!*

At the strange cry from above, he looked up to see a creature over 40 meters long rapidly disappearing into the distance.

"A dragon?"

Just as Shirone was making a dumbfounded expression, doubting his own eyes, the bushes rustled and the face of a blue-scaled dragon suddenly popped out.

"Grrrr..."

The moment he saw those mechanical, emotionless reptilian pupils, chills ran down his spine.

Language was transmitted through the Ultima System.

"A strange human indeed."

From those first words, he could tell that this was at least a world where humans lived.

"Who are you?"

The dragon seemed to consider this quite a puzzling question, thinking for a long time before opening its mouth.

"Why aren't you afraid?"

As far as the dragon knew, humans were so weak that they feared even animals smaller than themselves.

"Where is this place?"

Of course, Shirone was tense facing a dragon, but he was a human who had come from a world dominated by reason.

"Now I understand. You're from another world. That's why you don't know how strong I am."

Shirone's face lit up.

"Yes! That's right! What exactly is this place..."

"Die, insignificant human."

The dragon's mouth gaped wide open, and its flame breath instantly reduced the forest to ash.

"Such a weak species after all..."

The dragon was turning away with a smack of its lips when its eyes caught something and quickly scanned to the side.

Shirone, having dodged with spatial movement, was frowning.

"How...?"

How could a human perform the phenomenon manipulation that only dragons were capable of?

'No, that's not the issue.'

What remained as an afterimage on the dragon's retina was the phenomenon of a human body transforming into light and moving at tremendous speed.

"Attacking me suddenly! What are you doing?"

Since the breath's power was no different from modern dragons, Shirone's voice naturally rose.

"That's impossible."

Unable to accept the reality, the dragon opened its mouth wide again and unleashed another breath.

"This is...!"

Finally unable to bear it, Shirone responded with a Photon Cannon, and for several minutes, a fierce battle unfolded.

"Graaahhh!"

Struck in the side by a Homing Photon Cannon, the dragon crashed through trees as it was pushed back.

Hearing the dragon's roar, the forest creatures made sounds like nails scraping against metal as they shook the vegetation.

"This can't be!"

Though he had interacted with countless dragons throughout his life, he had never heard of one being overpowered by a human.

It was an entirely new concept, impossible even to imagine.

"This cannot be!"

Feeling rage for the first time in his life, the dragon lunged toward Shirone just as Angel's Punishment struck down.

*KWAAAAANG!*

"...!"

As the spear of light pierced through, his jaw dropped so far it nearly dislocated, but the shock was so severe that no sound escaped.

'I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dying!'

The fear of death caused tremors in his pupils, and even as he felt his muscles paralyzing, he moved his legs with desperate will to survive.

"Graahhh! Graahhh!"

Instead of pursuing the dragon fleeing into the forest, Shirone fell into serious thought with a grave expression.

'Can't it fly?'

Some dragons in reality had atrophied wings, but they could still fly through dragon language magic.

"The Age of Dragons."

Based on the knowledge Shirone had learned, his guess was that this was a primitive planet dominated by dragons.

"Just how far back in the past have I come?"

The feeling of being overwhelmed was brief as Shirone shook his head and flew up into the sky.

Since Lian and Kido were desperately defending, he too had to find a way to break the seal as quickly as possible.

'It knew about humans.'

As Shirone searched for human settlements from above, massive wings of light blazed on his shoulders.

'I need to find water.'

The wings of light curled around his body like an embrace, then expelled air with a *pop* and shot Shirone forward like an arrow.

**Labyrinth Andre**

**World Number 283**

"There's no end to it."

The massive green barrier blocking his path certainly didn't look like gigantic plants.

It was just ordinary weeds that had taken root in the ground—which meant Shirone had become smaller.

*Buuuuuuum!*

As the air vibrated with a sound louder than thunder, Shirone hurriedly threw himself to the ground.

He then watched in a daze as a giant wasp at least five times his size brushed past his back and flew away.

'What in the world...'

When he cut through the grass blades tens of centimeters high with Wind Cutter, the familiar yet completely different forest floor stretched endlessly before him.

"A prison of spacetime."

It wasn't just moving through time and space, but focusing on a specific spacetime and magnifying it.

"What am I supposed to do here?"

He cast Fly magic to land on top of a grass blade, but even a gentle breeze was enough to shake his body.

"...! ...!"

Sensing the movement of countless objects through Spirit Zone, Shirone immediately activated the Ultima System.

"Enemy spotted! Enemy spotted!"

"Reporting coordinates! Over there! Over there!"

Feeling countless signals rushing in like a cacophony, Shirone looked down at the ground and was horrified.

"W-what is that?"

What looked like at least 10,000 ants were gathering in formation around the grass blade.

"Report from allied wasps! An unknown insect has invaded our territory! Stop it quickly!"

'...I get the general idea.'

It was a system at the bottom of the caste hierarchy that went from cosmic to natural to biological.

"Come down! You are surrounded!"

Ants that had climbed up the surrounding grass to secure the high ground stuck out their abdomens.

"Let's shoot our formic acid!"

"Shoot away! Shoot away!"

As hundreds of acidic droplets were fired like cannons, Shirone shot up into the sky with an annoyed expression.

"This is really driving me crazy!"

Looking down at the ants persistently shooting formic acid, Shirone loaded a Photon Cannon in his palm.

'There's no end anyway.'

Even though they were insects, the thought of killing tens of thousands of lives was truly miserable.

"Wait! Let's talk this out!"

"Shoot away! Shoot away!"

While the Ultima System could decode the ants' language, the ants couldn't detect Shirone's voice.

"Call the allied wasps! Let's finish it off with stingers!"

'This is getting seriously complicated.'

If World Number 283 was the lowest system in the biological hierarchy, the chances of meeting humans were virtually nil.

'I have to find a way to break the seal here somehow.'

He didn't know what kind of conversation would be possible with ants, but if he failed, Lian and Kido's lives couldn't be guaranteed either.

Shirone descended to the ground, raised his hands, and said:

"Call your representative. I mean... that's right! The queen! I want to meet your queen."

The formic acid bombardment stopped.

"Did it work?"

That illusion lasted only briefly as he watched the ants touching antennae and exchanging opinions.

"Stand aside! I shall eliminate this intruder!"

Where the ants were swarming, a path opened like a parting sea, revealing a massive soldier ant with sharp mandibles.

"He has appeared! The greatest warrior of the Garnet Colony, Thirteenth Night!"

Countless ants sprayed pheromones containing information about "Number 13" everywhere, making his head spin.

'The greatest warrior?'

Observing Thirteenth Night, who was raising his front legs and clicking his mandibles, Shirone nodded.

'Indeed...'

Judging by the aura emanating from that massive build, he was certainly a master of metamorphosis techniques—a Dalui (Accomplished Ant).
