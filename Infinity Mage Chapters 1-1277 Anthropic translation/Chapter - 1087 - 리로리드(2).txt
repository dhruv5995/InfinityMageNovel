Reloaded (2)

The pure smile of the Operator caught on the big screen struck the users like an unexpected twist.

It was far from the beauty that had been elevated to divinity in everyone's imagination...

"She's pretty."

She could smile just like them.

"Yeah. She's pretty."

As Yahweh2 withdrew his arm, the Operator who staggered backward slowly raised her head.

"I lost. And the Solar War too. By the time I revive, everything will probably be over..."

The High Gear overloaded.

"Enjoy yourselves to the very end."

As her engine exploded, her machine scattered into fragments and vanished.

"WOOOOOOH!"

The Eastern Kingdom's users erupted in cheers.

"Charge! Charge to the Solar Palace!"

Since the revival system was possible, the end of Solar Wars always meant the complete annihilation of one side.

As the balance of power rapidly crumbled, Western Kingdom users were decimated by the hundreds.

Eastern Kingdom users surged like a massive wave and completely occupied the Solar Palace.

"We've arrived! We've arrived!"

Though he was only third-tier, DestructionDemon707 could enter the interior since he belonged to the Golden Wheel.

"Come at me, you bastards!"

He shouted boldly and looked around, but the Western Kingdom's rankers were already nowhere to be seen.

The only survivor, Little Witch, was surrounded with both hands raised.

"Surrender. I'll surrender, so don't kill me. The rankers won't be reviving anytime soon anyway."

Though death was commonplace, Worin wanted to stay until the end to watch over Sirone.

"I'm sorry."

Yolga's son raised his gun barrel.

"We can't leave any variables. Handling business thoroughly is the Golden Wheel's motto."

As he aimed at her forehead as if waiting for a penetration judgment, Little Witch muttered.

"...You son of a bitch."

Fermi laughed pleasantly.

"Please visit us again next time."

For Fermi, dealing with Worin was much easier than dealing with Sirone or the Operator.

'She's not a troublemaker.'

A single gunshot rang out and Little Witch fell backward.

Finally, with all the Western Kingdom's rankers gone from the Solar Palace, only occupation remained.

Fermi, who confirmed through video that Yahweh2 was coming, spoke to DestructionDemon707's group.

"Hey, you guys."

"Yes? Yes!"

As the guild leader called them, those belonging to the third tier rushed over with tense movements.

"Want to give it a try?"

"What?"

Fermi pointed to the Law Gear in the solar furnace.

"The occupation."

When the attacking side inputs a user code into the Law Gear, the outcome of the Solar War is decided.

Conversely, the defending side wins by holding out for 24 hours.

"Me, me?"

Therefore, when the situation wasn't urgent, those who occupied the Law Gear were mostly rankers.

"Yeah. Since you're part of the Golden Wheel anyway, you can qualify as the primary defense guild."

"But there are rankers here too..."

"Haha! It's fine. They're all my employees."

Since the Golden Wheel were professionals who worked for money, they didn't care about the honor of Solar Wars.

"Besides..."

Fermi thought of Sirone.

'That guy will like it.'

If customers weren't 100% satisfied, they'd complain even if 99% was good.

DeathPrincess said.

"Let's do it. When will we get another chance like this? All High Gear users will be watching us."

"Right?"

Since the video was probably still rolling at this very moment, DestructionDemon707 straightened his back.

"Then I'll..."

With DeathPrincess and StrongestCodename flanking him on both sides, he headed toward the Law Gear.

'It's cold.'

How should he describe this feeling where everything felt crystal clear, yet he couldn't feel anything?

The representative of the Eastern Kingdom, DestructionDemon707.

'This is the weight of the crown.'

Suddenly realizing the emotion he was feeling, he stopped walking and sneered.

"Heh heh."

The corners of his mouth trembled.

'Am I... feeling fear?'

DeathPrincess whispered.

"What are you doing? Everyone's watching. If you won't do it, should I?"

"I'll, I'll do it."

After taking a deep breath, DestructionDemon707 opened the Law Gear's core and extended his hand.

As he placed his palm against it, the gauge for changing the Law Gear's user rapidly rose.

"UOOOOOOH!"

Thinking he was dying of embarrassment, DeathPrincess whispered.

"You don't need to yell."

As StrongestCodename smiled, a message appeared on the Law Gear's screen.

User transfer complete. Codename DestructionDemon707. Transmitting Law Gear's power to the Eastern Kingdom.

All Eastern Kingdom users who had been waiting to hear those final words threw both hands up.

"We won!"

Bullets split the sky, and DestructionDemon707's group also hugged each other and jumped up and down.

When Yolga's son turned around, Yahweh2, who had arrived at some point, was smiling.

'Good.'

Fermi, who confirmed through his expression that he was satisfied, breathed a sigh of relief.

'Now help me out a bit too.'

The Solar War has ended. By administrator privilege, all users will revive with full charge.

The world was engulfed in light.

Eastern Kingdom users gathered at the Solar Palace, while Western Kingdom users revived at the outskirts of the plateau.

Solar War rankings are being compiled.

Rankings considering cumulative damage, user destruction count, and other factors were displayed from 1st to 100th place.

Yahweh2 wasn't there.

"Too bad. He was the star of this Solar War."

"It ended too early. If it had gone over 12 hours like before, he definitely would have made the rankings."

Sirone didn't mind, and shortly after, communication came from the Operator.

It's me. I've revived.

Yeah.

As promised, I'll help with what you're doing. But before that, there's something I need to announce. I'm going to delete my codename.

Sirone couldn't respond.

Even just 10 days in reality means a lot of content changes in High Gear. It's hard to maintain rankings too. If I'm going to work with you in reality, that's the right thing to do.

Now that Sirone had grown attached to High Gear too, he didn't feel good about it.

Sorry, it's because of me.

It's okay. My undefeated record was broken anyway. When I come back later, I want to start fresh too.

With that, the communication ended, and the Operator used administrator privileges to make an announcement to the world.

"This is the Operator."

At the sound echoing from the sky, all Eastern Kingdom users in the Solar Palace came outside.

"There were many issues in this Solar War. Above all, my defeat will be the hot topic."

It was quiet.

"Thinking about it, many things happened in High Gear. These are irreplaceable memories."

At the nuance of farewell, rankers also reminisced about the times they had spent with her.

"I want to make a new start now. But before that, I have something to tell you all."

The announcement paused briefly.

Since this would be a big decision for the Operator too, users could wait forever.

"From this moment, I am..." At that moment.

An event will occur shortly.

A system message cut off her voice.

"What?"

As users murmured among themselves, the scenery toward the horizon began to distort horribly.

'It's tearing the code.'

New episode. Dr. Martin's Revenge. He will descend to steal the sun forever.

A gigantic eyeball gazed at them from within the disgusting crack that appeared on the horizon.

"An eye?"

The next moment, that eye broke through the scenery, revealing Dr. Martin's face made of scrap metal.

"The time has finally come! Foolish creations! I shall make you pay the price for betraying God!"

The ground shook from his voice alone.

As users failed to grasp the situation, the administrator meeting room became chaotic.

"Stop it quickly! We didn't even announce it! And what's this Dr. Martin's Revenge?"

"It's not the event we originally planned. The only person who could pull off something like this is... Number Seven."

"Whatever it is, end it!"

The black circle mark said.

"Most administrator privileges have been blocked. It's a quite elaborate program. We can't break through it right now."

"What???"

The administrators checked.

Each accessed the code with their privileges, but only messages saying "Access Denied" appeared.

"This crazy bastard..."

In a dark space where hundreds of screens floated, Number Seven stood alone.

After confirming all situations occurring in High Gear, he input the final authorization code.

"With this, service termination."

Dr. Martin's machine, created using all of High Gear's designs, invaded the world.

Looking at the Operator's face reflected on the screen, Number Seven bit his lips.

"You want to quit?"

What about everything we've done until now?

"No, you can never quit. So watch clearly. The world of High Gear..."

This world you loved most.

"How it abandons you."

As Dr. Martin, who had torn through the scenery, struck the ground with both fists, a thunderous roar erupted.

"I have finally achieved my grand ambition! I shall destroy the Law Gear! Eternal life is over!"

His lower body wasn't visible.

Only his upper body, which had broken through the code, sat atop the horizon like a rising sun.

"What? What kind of new event is this crap? If the Law Gear is destroyed, how do we generate power?"

Starting new episode.

Dr. Martin's expression, with facial muscles grafted from various metal structures, contorted.

"Die."

A beam from one eye scraped across the earth, rushing forward and incinerating Western Kingdom users.

"Dodge!"

Despite quick responses, 42 people vanished, and shortly after, Little Witch received communication.

After receiving the report, she told the Operator.

"Connection is impossible."

"What?"

"When you die, you get kicked out of High Gear. I don't know the cause, but connection is impossible."

Finally sensing something was seriously wrong, the Operator received a message from an administrator.

Big trouble! Number Seven seems to be planning to shut down High Gear. The administrators are also tied up.

"This..."

Before she could voice her anger, Dr. Martin scraped the ground with a second beam.

"Ugh!"

Though there were fewer casualties than before, the Western Kingdom's formation collapsed beyond control.

Yahweh2's voice was heard.

"Operator!"

Sirone, who had arrived leading Eastern Kingdom users, stopped his gliding charge.

"What's going on?"

"It's an emergency. One of the administrators has rebelled. At this rate, High Gear's service will be terminated."

All their conversations were transmitted to users across the continent through the bulletin board.

Dr. Martin shouted.

"Gahahaha! Yes, you don't even dare to challenge me! Then I'll destroy the Solar Palace right now!"

Users murmured.

"Where's the logic in this? Do you know how much I suffered collecting parts! Stop him quickly!"

"How do we stop him? Don't you see his level? Does 3,300 levels even make sense? Besides..."

Users who checked his durability through augmented reality looked pale.

72,000,000/72,000,000

"We can do it."

Sirone said.

"If Eastern and Western Kingdom users join forces, we can defeat him. We can't let it end like this!"

"Right. We fight."

The Operator turned around and shouted.

"All units, battle stations! We will defeat Dr. Martin and protect the Solar Palace! All users watching this video, come to Zeta Plateau!"

Click! Click!

Eastern and Western Kingdoms simultaneously loaded their ammunition.
