The Terrible Truth (2)

Sain and Kang Nan wore expressions of complete shock.

"My god..."

Under Gaold's relentless barrage of punches, Imir's body was left without a single unharmed spot.

As Gaold launched himself forward and drove his fist in, Imir's head snapped back as if his neck might break.

"Graaaah!"

More than his split lips, more than his broken teeth, the dizzying shock to his mind was more intense.

'What kind of bastard is this?'

He had fought countless powerful enemies, but this was the first time anyone had pushed him this far.

"Even so..."

Ignoring his broken arm swaying, Imir thrust out his opposite fist.

'Vacuum Press.'

Gaold's eyes bulged as he grasped the giant's fist with both hands, and a crunching sound rang out.

"Gah!"

And for the first time, Imir moved away from Gaold by his own will.

His fist was crushed.

Even Sain, who remained cool-headed in any situation, felt bewildered at this moment.

'Could it be that at this rate...'

It was Kang Nan who spoke the thought aloud.

"He's going to win?"

He was crushing the King of Giants, called the strongest creature in Heaven's history.

As if seeking confirmation, Sain looked back at Miro.

"What do you think?"

She too had never dreamed Gaold could accomplish this much, but—

"How much must it hurt?"

That's why her heart felt heavy.

"Right now, Gaold... how much pain is he in?"

Because it was that Imir, the atmosphere of the two who had momentarily forgotten also became solemn.

"Hah. Hah."

Gaold's focus was scattered.

'Where am I?'

Only fragmentary images came to mind; nothing remained in his brain.

"Ah..."

I was fighting that bastard, what was his name?

"Imir."

"Gaold."

Imir smiled with his eyes.

"What a wonderful name. All the heights you've reached must be contained in that single word."

Gaold said nothing.

"That's truly wonderful. Imir. Cool. Miro. Cool. Gapin, Augent. Ashur. Uriel. Yes, Lian."

'...What about us?'

Sain and Kang Nan felt slightly hurt, but Imir only looked off into the distant void.

"After training a single individuality to its extreme limit, one reaches an untouchable realm. Then who among them is the strongest? That's a very interesting question. Someone will ultimately lose, but no one thinks they'll be the one to lose."

Being talkative meant he was in a good mood.

"You think you can beat any opponent. Not because you're perfect. You absolutely trust your weapon and want to fight with it. I've crushed countless bastards until now, but victory or defeat doesn't matter. What's important is—"

Imir's eyes turned black as ink again.

"The fight itself. You just need a battlefield where you can show off that realm you reached by staking everything."

"Fun, then."

Gaold's pace gradually quickened as he walked through the suffocating killing intent.

"Looks like you haven't been beaten enough yet."

"Haha, maybe so."

Imir clenched his crushed fist and hurled it at Gaold's face.

The moment it touched the Air Press barrier, heat and earthquakes erupted once again.

"Graaah!"

While Gaold's expression crumpled like a demon's, Imir's lips curved up to their limit.

"You were the strongest."

It would have been better if we'd met in reality, but—

"It was a good dream."

As Gaold's body was sent flying, the earth began cracking in a radial pattern.

Rumble!

Kang Nan, who had been blankly watching the endless waves of earth being pushed away, frantically leaped out.

"Gaold!"

Imir's condition wasn't good either.

Watching all his fingers bent in strange directions, he raised his gaze.

"Is this the end?"

At that moment, a flash of light from the side struck Imir's head with a direct hit.

With his neck twisted about 20 degrees, Imir savored the impact before slowly turning his head.

"What, who are you?"

Shirone approached with Louver and Mong-ah.

"Imir, about Ultima..."

"Ah."

Imir waved dismissively.

"No need for complicated talk. Don't want to hear it either. If you want something, fight for it."

While that could be called perfectly befitting a martial artist, Shirone, being a mage, thought differently.

'Fighting here is meaningless. Recovering Ultima takes priority. No, at the very least...'

He had to escape from Imir's dream.

'I must be independent from simultaneous events. That's why the transmission dream began.'

In other words, Shirone in another space couldn't accept Yorahan's enlightenment.

Shirone headed toward the black hole.

'Extracting Ultima and leaving takes priority.'

According to Louver, Arius had already entered, but the probability of his return was slim.

"Hey."

Imir didn't like Shirone.

"Seems you're interested in the wrong place. Quickly decide whether to fight or die. It's annoying."

Fighting with those who use battle as a means rather than an end was just troublesome.

'Gapin. Your son takes more after his mother.'

That was also why Imir didn't mention Ikael's name among his worthy opponents.

Miro approached.

"Shirone, go into the black hole. Arius must have made some move. I'll handle things here."

Imir laughed.

"Of course you're fun too. But still don't get it? The reason I called Gaold the strongest isn't his force."

Imir's wounds began healing at tremendous speed.

"It's his mind."

As his broken parts were fully restored, Sain bit her lip and clenched her fist.

'I see. This isn't reality. It's all avatars. When the mind recovers, the avatar is restored too.'

In other words, it's a clash of minds.

If Gaold, having the most extreme mind, broke Imir's avatar, then...

'Miro's mind is specialized for defense. There's bound to be penalties here.'

Gaold, who changed his avatar form within another's mind, was the abnormal one.

Then an unexpected voice was heard.

"Go, Shirone."

Gaold was walking over, supported by Kang Nan.

"Hooh?"

Even Imir was surprised.

"I definitely felt the satisfying impact of crushing. Haha. Well, you're an avatar too. What truly endless obsession."

Gaold spoke to Shirone.

"Go."

"But..."

"I won't last long."

No matter how strong the obsession, there were limits to recovering an avatar in another's mind.

"Please."

The moment Gaold gave a small nod, Shirone launched himself toward the black hole.

Imir didn't pursue.

'Got it!'

As the ground scenery became distantly far, Shirone felt relieved, but the black hole was farther than expected.

'Ultima is in that place.'

And finally, Shirone's body was pulled into the extreme gravitational field.

It was the speed of light.

Shirone was in darkness.

'Where is this?'

Following the inertia of countless stars gathering toward one point, his body was also being pulled along.

Imagining all these stars colliding simultaneously was dizzying, but he vaguely recalled.

'Time is flowing backwards.'

It was like the nightmare he had every night when he first opened the Immortal Function during his school days.

They call it superposition.

'I see.'

He had been feeling it.

Information cannot surpass the barrier of light speed, but the heart can transcend time and space.

Planets gradually decomposed, and Shirone's body also began scattering in particle form.

'Yet it exists.'

He now understood what remains until the very end among the things that make up a human.

'Before forming me, the concept of "me".'

Following the path guided by imaginary time, Shirone burrowed into a space smaller than particles.

Strings of light where even time was integrated vibrated, and countless events repeated birth and extinction.

'Where only possibility remains... the boundary of the outer world.'

In the emotion of unity between self and object, Shirone felt the concept forming himself expanding.

'Integration.'

It was like... a massive explosion.

Canis asked.

"Now, try doing something. How can we summon God? You said you could do it."

The reason for his excitement was because his resentment and anger toward God were that great.

'Appear before my eyes.'

To appear meant to be materialized, and then at least they could fight.

'My insides are boiling to death.'

Rukia, who had been looking tenderly at the unconscious Glen, focused her eyes again.

"Integration of concepts."

"Integration?"

"It doesn't matter what. The moment this world exists, it's divided in two. Because existence cannot be defined without each referring to the other."

Not only Shirone but everyone had realized something through their journey so far.

"Only God can define it as one. Good and evil, light and darkness, existence and nothingness, it doesn't matter what. When these two are combined, they become an idea that needs no definition, and God will only appear within that concept."

It was a credible hypothesis.

"I see."

Ares said.

"God's Right Hand and Demon's Left Hand. Getting one more ability wasn't coincidental."

"Yes."

Rukia raised both hands.

"God's Right Hand relaxes the mind, and Demon's Left Hand twists the mind. Then what if I clasp both hands together and activate the abilities simultaneously?"

Shirone said.

"Taiji action would occur. Neither side would retreat, and they'd circulate endlessly."

Rukia nodded.

"God should be able to appear by borrowing my concept."

"But Rukia."

Shirone understood Taiji.

"When it becomes infinite, even the concept of existence disappears. If Law's number 2 breaks, you cannot be defined."

Because Shirone could exist while embracing infinity, he was the Infinite Mage.

"I..."

Rukia looked at Glen.

"I've decided to forgive. Glen must have had no choice too. During our poor days, he might have approached me out of longing, it might not have been love, but..."

She smiled.

"I don't want to define it. If I can embrace Glen with my heart, that's enough."

Not defining.

'Sacrificing with all my heart.'

As Shirone, realizing she couldn't be stopped, stepped back, Rukia turned to the device.

'Glen.'

To save the entire universe.

'I love you.'

Loving just one person was sufficient.

'Oh God.'

Clasping both hands like in prayer, Rukia closed her eyes gently and activated her ability.

'Have mercy on us.'

As God's Right Hand and Demon's Left Hand acted simultaneously, Rukia's heart rotated.

The pyramid vibrated, and all characters carved on the inner walls began glowing blue.

'Electricity.'

The moment energy generated by yin-yang rotation concentrated on the device, everyone realized.

'Ancient civilization is a generator.'

And since the electrical energy gathering here would be enough to pierce the barrier of the outer world.

"God is..."

An unprecedented event in human history.

"Descending."

"Shirone! What are you doing?"

Shirone, who had been shedding tears before Seina, heard Neid's voice.

'I don't know. Why does my heart hurt so much?'

This wasn't the first time.

When he parted with Amy, when she went to the sun, and even at this moment.

'Perhaps I...'

Am I going to bear great sorrow from now on?

Shirone was defenseless, but Giyorgi also wasn't moving at all.

'Choose, Yahweh.'

Penetration or integration?

What was needed to accomplish what no one in Good Evil Balance had achieved was only one thing.

Shirone slowly raised his head.

"Sacrifice."

The Immortal Function opened, and Shirone's body began spreading as brilliant light.
