[554] The Power of a Day (3)

D

Day 36.

From the day after Shirone's sequence formula surpassed 1 quadrillion, his abilities grew at a pace that could only be called rapid acceleration.

With eyes wide open, the numbers he unfolded from 1 began accelerating endlessly as they entered the quadrillion range.

'2 quadrillion!'

Though he was counting, it no longer felt like reading numbers.

It was a state where numbers flowed endlessly through his thoughts like blood flowing through veins.

'3 quadrillion!'

Through the massive enlightenment that allowed him to take his first step into a new realm, Shirone's numbers raced without knowing their end.

'4 quadrillion!'

As Miro watched the training with emotions swelling as much as those growing numbers, a moment of puzzlement flickered in her eyes.

'Huh? What's this?'

Shirone's avatar took the form of an angel with wings of light.

Moreover, as the sequence formula progressed, the afterimages of light would disappear and the outline would become clearly defined.

But from surpassing 4 quadrillion, the outline was distorting instead, and parts were even collapsing in form.

'Is the change starting now?'

When one reaches the realm of unity between self and nature, the mind of enlightenment can influence even the laws of things.

But with just the form collapsing, she couldn't even guess what kind of individuality was contained in Shirone's avatar.

"Gasp!"

Shirone exhaled roughly, his body trembling with a shocked expression before dropping to both knees with a thud.

Miro approached a bit closer and asked.

"How many?"

"It ended at 5 quadrillion."

Exactly half without embellishment.

'A psychological brake.'

Though he had mastered some technique of the sequence formula that could be learned in the quadrillion range and covered over 4 quadrillion in an instant, the thought of it being half his goal had created a new limit.

"As I said before, you mustn't be obsessed. Only flexible thinking like water can break through limits."

"Yes."

Of course, if it were as easy as it sounded, there would be no failures in the world.

"I'll try again."

Miro was satisfied that at some point, Shirone had stopped making sounds of distress.

'His desire for success has surpassed his fear of failure.'

Failure, failure, endlessly repeating failure.

But if one doesn't give up, those aren't failures but countless experiences absorbed as necessary steps to reach success.

'You're doing well, Shirone. Someone who has never fallen cannot walk.'

He wasn't training to earn sweet titles like 'genius' mage or 'monstrously powerful' mage.

'Fail countless times. It's not shameful. Rather, it's something to be proud of.'

A 'trained' mage who can handle any variable.

'That alone is your pride and the finest medal a professional can have.'

Shirone's nose bridge wrinkled as he concentrated intensely, gazing into the world of numbers.

'I'll become a mage! I absolutely will!'

Day 34.

Dorothy's room was hot with the heat of anger and dizzy with the scent of pleasure.

On the bed, Dorothy lay hunched over, buried under blankets, with sounds that confused whether they were ecstasy or crying seeping through the cotton barrier.

"Aah! Ah!"

Beside the bed, the scrap metal doll Hickory lay completely smashed and scattered.

"Agh! Aaagh!"

Just when she thought it was almost complete, all sorts of errors burst out at the last moment.

'Why now! Why are they all exploding at once!'

Her anger reached its peak, and her heart became distorted.

"Aaaaagh! Aaagh!"

Just as the blanket writhed roughly in a caterpillar-like hunched form, the door burst open and her younger sister entered.

"Hey! What was that sound just now? You broke something again, didn't you!"

The blanket's movement stopped, and her sister, quietly surveying the room, frowned as if she'd expected this.

"Seriously, psycho! What have you been doing all vacation without showing your face? Do you even know how worried Mom is?"

At the continued nagging, Dorothy unfolded her hunched body and sat up on her knees.

"...Get out."

Her face wrapped in the blanket was covered in cold sweat.

"Before telling me to get out, you should be quiet! You should think about the people living in the next room! All day on the bed...!"

"GET OUUUUUT!"

Her sister's shoulders flinched at the scream that seemed to tear her throat.

Though her sister was never normal, this hysteria was no joke.

"Cra...zy..."

Her sister fled the room and closed the door, and Dorothy covered herself with the blanket and curled up again.

"Agh! Aaaaagh!"

Screaming moans burst out from under the blanket.

Day 23.

Electricity had been sparking from Iruki's eyes for 20 minutes already.

As vast amounts of data flowed back into his head calculating nuclear fusion, the blood vessels in his eyes began to burst.

Even while shedding bloody tears, Iruki's mouth was smiling.

'I can do it. Because I can do it.'

If he couldn't succeed, he just had to keep pounding until he did.

Data began crashing at tremendous speed into the iron wall blocking the perfect formula.

'It will open eventually.'

Even if he couldn't open it, it didn't matter.

His already successful self beyond the iron door would open it and come out to meet him.

Day 21.

'Why? Why can't I advance from here?'

Amy's face contorted with anger as she rotated her Spirit Zone in sniper mode.

For several days, her sniping accuracy hadn't risen beyond 90 percent.

Amy checked her status backed up in Hongan and found the stagnation period in her psychological data.

'Stupid. I'm being satisfied.'

She couldn't reach it because her subconscious felt that perfection was unnatural.

'My thinking is rigid! I need to destroy myself!'

As she rotated her Spirit Zone, a 2-kilometer-long sniper zone spun at tremendous speed.

Each time she fired Fire Strike at targets, the air rang with a sharp sound.

The flames accelerating through the air tunnel reached their targets in just 1.3 seconds.

'If it's not 100 percent, it's meaningless!'

Dozens of targets exploded simultaneously.

Day 19.

"Good, Screamer! Smash it to pieces!"

"Uagh! Uagh! Uaagh!"

Screamer let out screams of pain, but his body showed no signs of stopping.

He had reached runner's high.

Pyroker watched his son throwing punches like crazy in a daze and muttered in a choked voice.

"That's right, Screamer. That's exactly it..."

"What? What did you say!"

Screamer snapped irritably, not having heard, but Pyroker was just proud of his son.

'You've finally surpassed it.'

There are limits to becoming strong just to beat someone, to trample losers and feel superior.

'No, you can't become strong.'

Such low-grade pleasures crumble too easily before the massive pain that must be endured ahead.

'Screamer, do you know why so many risk their lives competing?'

Because they don't want to lose.

Because they can't accept the fact that they failed to accomplish something, they endure any pain.

'Become a mage, Screamer! Become a champion! That will be the greatest happiness in your life!'

"Dad! What are you doing!"

Pyroker snapped to attention and wiped away tears.

Since he must be in deadly agony, he wouldn't be able to endure without some encouragement.

"Good, Screamer! He's finally groggy! The champion's completely lost it! Pound him! Finish him off!"

"Uaaaaah!"

Day 14.

The psychological brake of reaching half of 10 quadrillion wouldn't disappear easily.

The sequence formula still remained at the limit of 5 quadrillion, and several days passed in that state.

'It's okay. I'm doing my best.'

Shirone wasn't anxious.

If he couldn't do it, then he couldn't, and that was exactly the kind of thinking that coldly faced reality.

"Haha!"

Shirone, who was resting sitting on a rock by the stream, suddenly burst into laughter.

Come to think of it, on the thirty-second branch of the tree across the way, while most of the leaves hung downward, one leaf was pointing upward.

'That's really funny.'

Being able to laugh at the direction of a leaf that no one would even care about was proof that his thinking had become that flexible.

'The spider built its web big. Good for it.'

A spider web that must have been destroyed five times by rain and wind during the training period hung between branches.

'Really persistent. That's right, there was a lot of wind last night too.'

He felt happiness from watching the spider extend its thin legs and move around its home.

'You endured.'

At that moment, his body tingled and his face scrunched up.

"Huh? Huh?"

Tears poured out from an overwhelming emotion he couldn't contain.

'Ah, I see.'

Nothing is insignificant.

'Well done. Well done, spider.'

Even if it was just a lowly creature, even if it was a disgusting spider that others wouldn't even glance at, if you looked inside it, there was a story as vast as your own.

'There is Tao in all places.'

Shirone's Spirit Zone opened and an angelic avatar slowly rose up.

As Elysion activated, the boundary between the world and himself disappeared, and in a state where he even forgot Miro's instructions, the sequence formula began racing at tremendous speed.

3 quadrillion, 4 quadrillion, 5 quadrillion.

The realm he had thought was his limit crumbled as numbers finally piled up to an even higher realm.

'6 quadrillion! 7 quadrillion!'

As the angelic avatar collapsed further, Miro, who was watching from a distance, smiled.

'Everything in the world converges on life.'

No realm, no transcendence can surpass the act of living.

'You want to become a mage. That too is a vast life incomparable to others.'

Thinking he might be able to reach it within the time limit, Miro observed the avatar's changes.

'What's this?'

Miro's smiling expression suddenly hardened.

As the sequence formula racing through 7 quadrillion entered 8 quadrillion, the avatar's form completely collapsed and particles of light began swirling in countless whirlpools.

The dazzling display was spectacular enough to dizzy the eyes, but it was a sight that could never be called beautiful.

It was a bizarre mirage that honestly felt grotesque.

'No, it's not even that level. It would be the same standing before the sun.'

Feeling it was grotesque was a human standard.

Whatever individuality the avatar possessed, it was a phenomenon that transcended all human experience, which was why it felt frightening.

'What kind of singularity could it be?'

The scenery refracted as if space-time was distorting, and countless afterimages were overlapping.

'The change is becoming distinct.'

Having realized with his body that there is Tao in all places, it was safe to say there wasn't much left until the realm of unity between self and nature.

'It seems like just a little more would do it.'

As curious about Shirone's avatar as she was cheering for the sequence formula, the light mirage suddenly disappeared like a lie.

"Gasp! Gasp!"

Shirone, who had emerged from his trance, was breathing roughly when he sensed Miro's presence and quickly turned around.

"Did you see that just now? I broke through! I reached 9 quadrillion!"

"9 quadrillion... The inner demon of perfection."

Rather than the praise he had expected, when Miro bit her lip, Shirone finally realized he had disobeyed instructions.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I unconsciously used the sequence formula..."

"No, you did well. Even if you broke through 5 quadrillion, it seemed like you'd hit another wall. Let's do our best during the remaining time and succeed."

"Yes!"

Shirone, having gained confidence, walked energetically toward the training hall.

Meanwhile, Miro still couldn't leave her spot and looked back at the rock where Shirone had been sitting.

Since he had almost reached it, the situation was all the more regrettable, but hoping for more than this would be greedy.

'I'll be able to confirm it soon. But what kind of avatar is it?'

The change in natural laws that had been revealed when approaching the singularity was a mysterious phenomenon that even Miro, the strongest enlightened being, couldn't analyze.
