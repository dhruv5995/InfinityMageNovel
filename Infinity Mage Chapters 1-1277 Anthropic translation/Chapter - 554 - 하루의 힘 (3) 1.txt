[554] The Power of a Day (3)

D

Day 36.

From the day after Shirone's sequence formula surpassed 1 quadrillion, his abilities grew at a pace that could only be called rapid acceleration.

With eyes wide open, the numbers he expanded from 1 began accelerating endlessly, starting to enter the quadrillion range.

'2 quadrillion!'

Though he was counting numbers, it no longer felt like reading them out.

It was a realm where numbers flowed endlessly through his thoughts, like blood flowing through veins.

'3 quadrillion!'

Through the enormous realization that allowed him to take his first step into a new realm, Shirone's count raced forward without knowing an end.

'4 quadrillion!'

As those growing numbers filled him with overwhelming emotion, a moment of puzzlement flickered in Miro's eyes as she watched the training.

'Huh? What's that?'

Shirone's avatar was in the form of an angel with wings of light.

Moreover, as the sequence formula progressed, the light's afterimage would disappear and the outline would become clearer - that was its characteristic.

But after surpassing 4 quadrillion, the outline began to distort instead, and parts of it were even collapsing.

'Is the change starting now?'

When one reaches the realm of unity between self and nature, the spirit of wisdom can influence even the laws of things.

But just from the form collapsing, she couldn't even guess what kind of individuality was contained in Shirone's avatar.

"Huff!"

Shirone exhaled roughly, his body trembling with a shocked expression before falling to his knees with a thud.

Miro approached a bit closer and asked.

"How many?"

"It ended at 5 quadrillion."

Exactly half without any padding.

'A psychological brake.'

Though he had embodied some technique of the sequence formula that could be mastered in the quadrillion range and instantly traversed over 4 quadrillion, the thought that it was half of his goal had created a new limit.

"As I said before, you mustn't be obsessed. Only flexible thinking like water can break through limits."

"Yes."

Of course, if it were as easy as it sounded, there would be no failures in the world.

"I'll try again."

Miro was satisfied that at some point, Shirone had stopped making groaning sounds.

'His desire for success has surpassed his fear of failure.'

Failure, failure, endlessly repeating failure.

But if one doesn't give up, those aren't failures - they're absorbed as countless experiences necessary to reach success.

'You're doing well, Shirone. Someone who has never fallen cannot walk.'

He wasn't training to earn sweet titles like 'genius' mage or 'monstrously powerful' mage.

'Fail countless times. It's not shameful. Rather, it's something to be proud of.'

A 'trained' mage who can handle any variable.

'That alone is your pride and the greatest medal a professional can have.'

The bridge of Shirone's nose wrinkled as he concentrated intensely, gazing into the world of numbers.

'I'll become a mage! I absolutely will!'

Day 34.

Dorothy's room was hot with the heat of anger and dizzy with the smell of pleasure.

On the bed, Dorothy lay hunched over, buried in blankets, and sounds that were confusing mixtures of ecstasy and crying leaked through the cotton barrier.

"Ahh! Ah!"

Beside the bed, the scrap metal doll Hickory lay completely smashed and scattered.

"Argh! Ahhh!"

Just when she thought it was almost complete, all sorts of errors had burst forth at the last moment.

'Why now! Why are they all exploding at once!'

Her anger reached its peak, and her heart became twisted.

"Ahhhhh! Ahhh!"

Just as the blanket writhed roughly in a curled-up form like a caterpillar, the door burst open and her younger sister entered.

"Hey! What was that noise just now? You broke something again, didn't you!"

The blanket's movement stopped, and her sister, quietly surveying the room's scene, frowned as if she had expected this.

"You're such a psycho! What have you been doing all vacation without showing your face! Do you even know how worried Mom is?"

At the continued nagging, Dorothy uncurled her body and sat in a kneeling position.

"...Get out."

Her face wrapped in the blanket was covered in cold sweat.

"Before telling me to get out, you should be quiet! You should think about the people living next door too! All day in bed..."

"GET OUUUUUT!"

Her sister's shoulders flinched at the scream that seemed to tear her throat.

Though her sister was never normal, this hysteria was no joke.

"Cra...zy..."

Her sister fled the room and closed the door, and Dorothy covered herself with the blanket again and curled up.

"Argh! Ahhhhh!"

Screams of anguish burst out from under the blanket.

Day 23.

Electricity had been sparking from Iruki's eyes for 20 minutes already.

As vast amounts of data backflowed into his head calculating nuclear fusion, the blood vessels in his eyes began to burst.

Even while shedding tears of blood, Iruki's mouth was smiling.

'I can do it. Because I can do it.'

If he couldn't succeed, he just had to keep pounding until he succeeded.

Data began crashing into the iron wall blocking the perfect formula at tremendous speed.

'It will eventually open.'

Even if he couldn't open it, it didn't matter.

The already successful version of himself beyond the iron door would open it and come out to greet him.

Day 21.

'Why? Why can't I advance from here?'

Amy's face contorted with anger as she rotated her Spirit Zone in sniper mode.

For several days, her sniping accuracy had been stuck at 90% without improving further.

Amy checked her condition backed up in her Crimson Eyes and found the stagnation period in her psychological data.

'How stupid. I'm being satisfied.'

She couldn't reach it because her subconscious felt that perfection was unnatural.

'My thinking is rigid! I need to destroy myself!'

As she rotated her Spirit Zone, the 2-kilometer-long sniper zone spun at tremendous speed.

Each time she fired Fire Strike at targets, the air rang with a sharp sound.

The time for flames accelerated through the air tunnel to reach targets was only 1.3 seconds.

'If it's not 100%, it's meaningless!'

Dozens of targets exploded simultaneously.

Day 19.

"Good, Screamer! Smash it to pieces!"

"Uah! Uah! Uahhh!"

Screamer let out screams of pain, but his body showed no signs of stopping.

He had reached runner's high.

Pyroker watched his son throwing punches like crazy in a daze and muttered in a choked voice.

"Yes, Screamer. That's exactly it..."

"What? What did you say!"

Screamer, who hadn't heard, got irritated, but Pyroker was just proud of his son.

'Finally, you've overcome it.'

There are limits to becoming strong just to beat someone, to trample losers and feel superior.

'No, you can't become strong that way.'

Such low-level pleasures are too easily frustrated in the face of the enormous pain that must be endured ahead.

'Screamer, do you know why so many people risk their lives competing?'

Because they don't want to lose.

Because they can't accept the fact that they couldn't accomplish something, they endure any pain.

'Become a mage, Screamer! Become a champion! That will be the greatest happiness in your life!'

"Dad! What are you doing!"

Pyroker snapped to attention and wiped away tears.

Since he must be in a state of deadly agony, he wouldn't be able to endure without some encouragement.

"Good, Screamer! Finally he's groggy! The champion has completely lost it! Beat him! Finish him off!"

"Uahhhhh!"

Day 14.

The psychological brake of reaching half of 10 quadrillion didn't disappear easily.

The sequence formula still remained at the limit of 5 quadrillion, and several days passed in that state.

'It's okay. I'm doing my best.'

Shirone wasn't impatient.

If he couldn't do it, then he couldn't do it, and that would be the cold, realistic way of thinking.

"Haha!"

Shirone, who was resting sitting on a rock by the stream, suddenly burst into laughter.

Come to think of it, on the thirty-second branch of the tree across from him, while most leaves hung downward, one leaf was pointing upward.

'That's really funny.'

Being able to laugh at the direction of a leaf that no one would even care about was proof that his thinking had become that flexible.

'The spider built its web big. How nice.'

A spider web that must have been destroyed by rain and wind at least five times during the training period was hanging between branches.

'Really persistent. Right, there was a lot of wind last night too.'

He felt happiness from watching the spider stretch its thin legs and move around its home.

'You endured.'

At that moment, his body tingled and his face crumpled.

"Huh? Huh?"

Tears poured down uncontrollably from overwhelming emotion.

'Ah, I see.'

Nothing is insignificant.

'Good job. Well done, spider.'

Even if it's just a lowly creature, even if it's a disgusting spider that others wouldn't even glance at, if you look inside it, there's a story as vast as your own.

'There is the Way in all places.'

Shirone's Spirit Zone opened and an angel avatar slowly rose up.

As Elysion activated and the boundary between the world and himself disappeared, the sequence formula began racing at tremendous speed while he forgot even Miro's instructions.

3 quadrillion, 4 quadrillion, 5 quadrillion.

The realm he had thought was his limit crumbled, and finally numbers began accumulating toward a higher realm.

'6 quadrillion! 7 quadrillion!'

As the angel avatar collapsed further, Miro, watching from a distance, smiled.

'Everything in the world converges on life.'

No realm, no transcendence can surpass the act of living.

'You want to become a mage. That too is a vast life incomparable to others.'

Thinking he might be able to reach it within the time limit, Miro observed the avatar's changes.

'What's that?'

Miro's smiling expression suddenly hardened.

As the sequence formula racing through 7 quadrillion entered 8 quadrillion, the avatar's form completely collapsed and particles of light began swirling in countless whirlpools.

The dazzling display was spectacular enough to dizzy the eyes, but it was a sight that could never be called beautiful.

It was a bizarre mirage that honestly felt sinister.

'No, it's not even at that level. It would be the same standing before the sun.'

Feeling it was sinister was a human standard.

Whatever individuality the avatar possessed, it was a phenomenon that transcended all human experience, which was why it felt frightening.

'What kind of singularity could it be?'

The scenery refracted as if space-time was distorting, and countless afterimages were overlapping.

'The change is becoming distinct.'

Having realized with his body that there is the Way in all places, it was safe to say there wasn't much left until the realm of unity between self and nature.

'It seems like just a little more would do it.'

As curious about Shirone's avatar as she was cheering for the sequence formula, the light mirage suddenly disappeared like a lie.

"Huff! Huff!"

Shirone, emerging from his trance, was breathing roughly when he sensed Miro's presence and quickly turned around.

"Did you see that just now? I broke through! I reached 9 quadrillion!"

"9 quadrillion... The obsession with perfection."

Unlike the praise he had expected, when Miro bit her lip, Shirone finally realized he had disobeyed instructions.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I unconsciously used the sequence formula..."

"No, you did well. Even if you broke through 5 quadrillion, I thought you'd hit another wall at least once. Let's do our best during the remaining period to succeed."

"Yes!"

Gaining confidence, Shirone walked energetically toward the training hall.

Meanwhile, Miro still couldn't leave her spot and looked around at the rock where Shirone had been sitting.

It was a regrettable situation because he had almost reached it, but hoping for more than this would be greedy.

'I'll be able to confirm it soon. But what kind of avatar is it?'

The change in natural laws revealed when approaching the singularity was a bizarre phenomenon that even Miro, the strongest Wise One, couldn't analyze.
