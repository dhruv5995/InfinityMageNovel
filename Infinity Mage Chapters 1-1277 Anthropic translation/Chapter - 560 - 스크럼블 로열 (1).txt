[560] Scramble Royal (1)

"Run!"

Knowing they couldn't subdue Shirone, Shuamin's group fled to the opposite corridor immediately after their surprise attack.

'Are they out of their minds?'

Casting attack magic on a senior student.

Thinking he could no longer let this slide, Shirone cast teleportation and gave chase.

The fact that they tried to compete with Shirone using movement was the underclassmen's fatal mistake.

The distance closed in an instant, and realizing they couldn't escape, Shuamin's group ducked into a storage room as soon as they turned the corner.

Catching the tail end of their hiding, Shirone roughly opened the storage room door and looked around.

As if possessed by ghosts, they had vanished.

'Invisibility cloak. Where on earth did they get that?'

Shirone's voice echoed through the storage room.

"Come out. I know you're all hiding in here."

When there was no response, he floated homing photon cannons around him and captured targets through Spirit Zone.

As the seekers turned in three directions, the golden spheres trembled as if about to burst forth.

"You can see the lasers, right? These are guided missiles. Once I fire them, even I can't cancel them. I'm going to count to three now. One."

Silence.

"Two."

A wavering atmosphere.

"Three...!"

Shuamin revealed himself from a corner of the storage room.

"Hmph, do you think you can actually attack us?"

Alt emerged from inside a box, and Gerain crawled out from between building materials.

'They're really fast at hiding.'

Gerain, getting to his feet, agreed with Shuamin's words.

"That's right. Magic is forbidden on campus. Especially if you hurt students, you won't get off with just a week's suspension, will you?"

Their shamelessness was beyond belief.

"You cast magic first."

"Hahaha! Fine. Then let's all go down together. I've been wanting to try getting expelled anyway."

'These insolent brats...'

They were exploiting the fact that graduating class and advanced class students had different weights of responsibility in life, but it was still an absurd logic.

"Fine, then I won't use magic."

Shirone thought it would be better to play along to get a confession, but Gerain already looked victorious.

"Good thinking. Well then, we'll be going. Come on, guys, let's go."

Shirone moved to the side and blocked the exit.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"Then what are you going to do? Magic is..."

When Shirone slightly raised his right arm and opened his palm, Gerain immediately shut his mouth.

As Kubrick's slot rotated on his retina and floated a sword at the top, Armang was grasped in Shirone's hand.

"Diamond Armed."

The moment he spoke the keyword, the sword's blade cracked open and instantly devoured Shirone as it traveled up his right arm.

"Wh-what is that?"

Shirone's appearance in pure white robes was intimidatingly imposing.

When the artificial brain's exterior emitted purple light and rotated around him, it was almost mesmerizing.

But by the advanced class kids' standards, it seemed better than holding a sword in his hand, as their tense expressions relaxed one by one.

"What the heck, you scared us! You're just trying to frighten people."

It would indeed be frightening to pass by a graduating class senior holding a sword in a dead-end storage room.

Shuamin signaled with his eyes and cast Wind Cutter while Alt and Gerain provided supporting fire.

'These bastards...!'

Shirone didn't even think of dodging as he stepped forward.

At the tinkling sound of metal breaking, Shuamin's group, who had been running toward the door, stopped in terror.

"What kind of clothes are those?"

The spot hit by Wind Cutter had turned metallic.

It was the shell of a Ringer, an armored mineral species boasting the strongest durability even in heaven.

"You kids, since when did you become so unruly?"

"What are you saying? Old fogey."

When they had met during advanced class integrated lessons, they had been polite and well-behaved children.

'There's definitely something going on.'

Feeling the need for interrogation, Shirone extended Armang's tentacles like peacock feathers.

"Ugh!"

Shuamin's group was horrified at the biomatter they were seeing for the first time.

"Spill it. Who ordered you?"

"Wh-what! What are you going to do with that disgusting thing! Senior, you're a pervert!"

Shirone's expression remained cold.

"That depends on how you behave."

"Guys! Let's really do this!"

At Shuamin's signal, the group activated their specialties.

Fireball, Ice Dagger, Eruption.

These were magic on a completely different level of imagination from Wind Cutter, and Shirone moved seriously for the first time.

Floor molecules rubbed together causing volcano-like explosions, and ice daggers embedded themselves in the flames rising from the Fireball.

But Shirone, having already left his position, swung his tentacles to grab all three by the neck and lift them into the air.

"Grk! Monster!"

"Then why are you doing this? This is self-defense. And as you said, I'm not using magic either."

"Shut up! You runaway who even gave up on evaluations!"

"Shut up?"

Shirone's eyebrow twitched.

Thinking about how much he had looked up to graduating class seniors when he was in advanced class, this was unthinkable insolence.

"Aaahhh!"

As the tentacles' pressure increased, Shuamin's group's faces turned red.

"Talk. Or your necks will break."

"Kill us! We'll never tell!"

While they were somewhat serious, he still couldn't shake the feeling they were underestimating him.

They thought he wouldn't really kill them, and Shirone indeed had no intention of committing murder.

'What do I do now?'

After pondering briefly, Shirone came up with a good idea.

"You absolutely won't tell, is that it?"

"That's right! We are proud mages! Our convictions cannot be broken!"

"Fine. Then I have no choice. I'll have to ask Mark."

"Ugh!"

As expected, it was effective - Shuamin's group's faces crumpled.

Mark, who had become Shirone's follower after losing in the teleportation evaluation, had trained relentlessly to secure his place in Class 4, and was still reigning as the advanced class's boss.

"That's dirty! Selling out an underclassman's name? And you call yourself a graduating class student?"

Seeing Alt's words mixed with formal speech again, Mark must indeed be frightening.

'Well, a nearby fist is stronger than distant law.'

They would be more concerned about Mark, who they'd have to live with for several more years, than Shirone, a graduating class student.

"So talk. Otherwise Mark will be asking you."

Gerain, who had been watching Shuamin's expression, carefully spoke up.

"We're from the Hide-and-Seek Research Society."

It was an underground research society Nade had mentioned, and if so, their unruliness was understandable.

Underground research societies had tremendous solidarity and their activity areas were like extraterritorial rights, essentially another society within the school.

"Why would the Hide-and-Seek Research Society tail me?"

"We don't know the reason. The president just told us to go observe."

When they were talking about convictions earlier, now they were spilling everything.

"Who's the president?"

But this time, Shuamin's group refused in unison.

"We absolutely can't tell you that!"

"Really? Then I'll tell Mark..."

Shuamin pleaded tearfully.

"Really, senior. If we reveal that, the president will kill us, not Mark. We don't know why we're investigating here either. Please forgive us just this once."

Ironically, the fact that Mark's name didn't work showed their sincerity.

Withdrawing his tentacles, Shirone looked down at the underclassmen who had fallen to the floor coughing and said:

"Don't spy on other research societies again. If something like this happens again, you'll be the prime suspects."

"Yes. Yes."

"Go back now. And don't skip classes."

As soon as he finished speaking, Shuamin's group ran outside, and Shirone fell into thought.

'Hmm, an underground research society is moving. Could this be related to my portrait incident too?'

The possibility was sufficient, but since it was his first time being in a research society during class time, he couldn't be certain.

'I should ask Nade.'

Shirone realized lunchtime was approaching and headed toward the cafeteria.

'By the way, those kids, can they even get out? They'll have to take a huge detour.'

The cafeteria scene after a long absence was no different from before.

As the only time of day they could relax, the atmosphere was lively.

If there was a difference from before, it was that the relationship dynamics had become much more diverse compared to the early days when different classes and factions were distant with each other.

Most notably, his eyes were drawn to the fact that 4-dimensional girl Dorothy was sitting across from Iruki.

'Dorothy only used to eat with Luman.'

More precisely, Dorothy was the only one who would humor Luman.

Even now, Luman was sitting next to her.

Though he was a master of crowd control, his selfish personality and fat body meant he still seemed unpopular, and his already corpulent body had swollen 1.5 times more during vacation.

Boyle from summoning magic looked disgusted watching Luman shovel food into his mouth.

"Do you even feel hungry after eating like that? Just how much did you stuff yourself during vacation?"

"Hmph, you should ask how much special training I did. I keep eating when I'm stressed."

Iruki delivered a sharp retort.

"You're stressed because you keep eating."

Then Luman glared with cat-like eyes.

"So what? You're all skin and bones because you can't eat."

"Want me to tell you an easy way to lose weight?"

"Huh?"

When Luman showed interest, Iruki tapped the table with his index finger.

"Always tap the table like this when you're eating or reading."

"Tap? What effect does that have?"

"Calories are burned as much as your finger moves."

Luman shot up.

"This bastard! Are you making fun of me for being fat?"

Iruki answered briefly.

"That's mathematics."

Boyle and Dorothy turned their heads simultaneously.

"No matter how trivial something is, numbers express it clearly. If you tap the table, that many calories will be consumed. Even a tiny amount of energy means that much weight loss."

Unable to refute the logic, Luman quietly sat back down, but his feelings were thoroughly hurt.

'Crazy bastard. Someday I'll...'

Then he heard tapping sounds from beside him and turned to see Dorothy tapping the table with her index finger.

"What are you doing?"

"Dieting."

Nade approached Shirone, who was watching this scene, and whispered:

"Those guys have been suspicious lately."

Startled Shirone confirmed it was Nade and sighed in relief.

"Who's suspicious? Iruki and Dorothy?"

"Yeah. You noticed too, right? Dorothy's been showing interest in Iruki lately. So let's you and me interfere."

"What kind of conclusion is that? Isn't that good?"

Nade made a disgusted face.

"I don't like it."

"Why don't you like it?"

Nade put his arm around Shirone's shoulder and spoke like he was lecturing:

"Listen carefully. Being involved with girls at our age means you can do tremendously many things. It's complete betrayal to us! I absolutely won't watch that happen until I die."

Shirone looked at him pathetically and pushed away Nade's arm as he turned toward Iruki.

"Then you should just die."

"Hiiing!"

With Nade following with a tearful expression, Shirone arrived at the table and Amy pulled out a chair for him.

"You're here?"

"Yeah. How was class today? It was the specialty exam, right?"

"It wasn't particularly difficult. The real challenge starts about 10 weeks from now. Probably only Arin will get a master rating."

"Oh, I see."

As Shirone and Amy chatted, Nade whispered in Iruki's ear:

"Those two seem to have worked things out well? I was worried because she was so cold when Shirone wasn't around."

"They'll figure out their own emotional compromises. Don't worry about others and worry about yourself."

"Hiiing! Everyone hates only me!"

Just before Nade shouted, everyone suddenly fell silent, causing his voice to echo clearly through the cafeteria.

"Ugh!"

Nade's face turned red, but no one paid attention to him.

Everyone was looking toward the cafeteria entrance.

"It's Maya."

It was the first time she had graced the cafeteria since refusing evaluation and avoiding it from the first semester.
