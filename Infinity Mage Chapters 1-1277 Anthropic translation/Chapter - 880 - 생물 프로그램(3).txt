Biology Program (3)

"What on earth are you talking about!"

The foreign officials shouted in unison.

"You can't disclose it! Do you even understand what kind of matter this is? If the Ivory Tower plans to monopolize this information..."

"I understand what kind of matter this is."

Shirone cut them off.

"That's exactly why I can't disclose it."

The footage of Pishio that Shirone had confirmed wasn't classified or mysterious.

The reason he couldn't talk about it was...

'Because it's the truth.'

The truth that Pishio had conveyed by sacrificing his own body.

Sometimes people approach truth through enlightenment, but sometimes that truth can be harsh.

"There's no going back on this. And the video recording device has already been destroyed. The Ivory Tower will review it and then make it public."

Dante raised his hand.

"Wait, the Ivory Tower will review it? You mean you're going to ignore the national side?"

"I'm not ignoring it. If it's just about talking, I can reveal it here. But considering its impact, it's not something that can be handled at the kingdom level."

Seriel had roughly guessed, but her doubts wouldn't be resolved without hearing it directly.

"Can't you at least tell us what kind of content it is? We have our own information too."

"Sorry. Give me time to think."

While Seriel made a displeased expression, Iruki calmly nodded.

'I'll ask later.'

Not being able to disclose it publicly was just political rhetoric put forward in front of many people.

'If it can be reported to the Ivory Tower, it can be told to me too.'

He believed there was at least that much trust.

"This is unacceptable!"

An official whose anger had reached his head shouted.

"We didn't come all this way just to hear such nonsense! We'll face criticism from the entire world!"

"I never asked you to come."

Shirone glared sharply at the official.

"Also, I don't care what response each kingdom takes, but I'd like to tell you not to do that."

"Hmph!"

The Ivory Tower's judgment was always right.

Not because it was actually right, but because only they could push through their own thoughts.

"Let's go! What a waste of time!"

The official from the Mael Kingdom was the first to turn around, and the other officials followed.

Even while doing so, the talking didn't stop.

"Are we really going to retreat like this? We have stakes in the holy war too. We need to file a lawsuit at the national level."

"We won't be able to win. We'll have to engage in espionage warfare. After all, there are no perfect secrets in this world."

After the officials left, Shirone said:

"It's all over. Let's go eat."

The teachers and students of Alpheus Magic School settled into a restaurant they had reserved in advance.

It was a joyful gathering so it was bustling, but several people were lost in deep thought.

Among those who would leave and those who would stay, Iruki approached Shirone.

"Let's talk for a moment."

Watching Shirone follow behind Iruki, Seriel fell into contemplation.

'I should follow too.'

She desperately wanted to, but she had to meet the conditions.

'Someone who absolutely needs the information. And the trustworthiness to pass on that information.'

Amy's reason for staying was probably the former, but Seriel somehow didn't meet the latter.

'He won't want me to come.'

Dante seemed to have the same thought as he stayed in place, while Nade started walking.

"I should go too."

Liz stopped him.

"Just stay. To follow them, you need to meet two qualifications."

"I know what they are too."

No mage wouldn't know.

"Then why do you want to go? You don't really need to know."

Nade looked back at Liz and said:

"Because I'm curious."

"Don't worry. Trust is what's important. I just need to listen and keep my mouth shut."

"To me too?"

Nade blinked.

"You won't tell me either? Are you really confident you can do that?"

"Uh, well... you won't ask anyway. Right?"

Liz said through gritted teeth:

"Just sit still."

Nade clicked his tongue and returned to his seat.

Shirone and Iruki entered the forest near the cemetery and sat on a rock.

"What happened?"

Though he perfectly understood Iruki's question, Shirone just smiled.

"Pishio's video, what was recorded on it? You can't tell me either?"

"Right. Sorry."

After watching Iruki's reaction for a moment, Shirone changed his expression and laughed.

"Just kidding."

"I know. It wasn't funny at all."

A Spirit Zone unfolded.

Since Shirone's mind was the strongest barrier, Iruki asked comfortably:

"What is it?"

Shirone moved to the seat next to Iruki and said:

"The truth of this world."

Three hours ago.

The director who had installed the video recording device checked one last time before leaving the building.

"It's all set. Are you sure this location is okay?"

"Yes, it's sufficient."

After the director left, Shirone used Material's ability to create a new wall.

It was a sealed room that even air couldn't pass through.

'Pishio.'

After making a small chair, he activated the video recording device and the recorded video turned on.

"Shirone."

Pishio was there.

Of course, it wasn't the appearance from their school days that Shirone remembered.

'How did this happen...'

The mutation had already progressed considerably, with only half his face recognizable.

"Sorry for surprising you. I didn't have time. I had to solve even one more problem. You understand, right?"

Shirone nodded.

"I'll keep it short. First, the reason I gave you viewing rights to this video - it's not because you're one of the Five Great Stars, nor because you're my classmate. It's because you're a Hexa."

The left part of Pishio writhed.

"Humanity has dug into many things. They roughly know what principles the world operates on. But there's still a mystery they can't solve. Just where is this place?"

Why do we exist?

"Actually, the fact that something exists is very strange. Once something exists, it means there's a cause."

Who created the universe?

"The alien life form Argoneth. The parasite that's invading my body. It's telling me."

Pishio pointed to the writhing part.

"There was never a universe to begin with. That's why we don't exist either. From the start, an event where something existed somewhere has never happened. Shirone, it's just nothingness."

"Originally there was nothing, nothing happened, and it's the same now. There's no such thing as 'existence.'"

"Then why..."

The Pishio in the screen answered:

"But why are we here? Why do we feel like there's a universe? It's an error that occurs because we don't perfectly understand the concept of nothingness."

Shirone closed his mouth.

"There's nothing. Really nothing. We're just mistaken into thinking there's something. But who? Where is the subject of that mistake? That doesn't exist either. That's how it is, Shirone."

Pishio raised his hand with difficulty.

"To explain nothingness, we have to borrow the concept of existence in some way. That's where it goes wrong. Time, space, mistakes. If you move a pencil on a desk somewhere else, does the spot on the desk become nothingness? Absolutely not. Even the thought of moving something somewhere else is existence. Humans truly cannot imagine nothing at all. The limit we can approach is knowing that we cannot imagine it. That's the end."

Shirone imagined nothingness.

Through logical and conceptual combination, he could conceive of a perfect state of nothingness, but that wasn't actually nothingness.

'To truly imagine it...'

Because even the self doing the imagining would have to be absent, imagination was impossible from the start.

"I call this Infinite Nothingness."

Pishio smiled bashfully.

"It's a concept we can't even approach, but we're still human so I tried naming it. Anyway Shirone, if you believe my words, you'll be able to understand now too."

Pishio's eyes changed.

"There's nothing, only mistakes exist. It's not a contradiction. Even the fact that you're mistaken right now is a mistake. It just doesn't exist. You need to know it doesn't exist."

Pishio's shoulder writhed more roughly.

"Everything exists within that mistake."

Just as humans couldn't conceive of nothingness, they also couldn't conceive of everything existing.

"Everything is a difference in perspective. Differences in perspective toward nothingness separate good and evil, emptiness and love, countless things. In reality, there's nothing. Yet the reason I'm conveying this video to you who isn't me is..."

Pishio's shoulder exploded with a pop.

"Because mistakes are freedom."

Shirone captured his bitter smile in his eyes.

"The report on Argoneth can be found in the Ultra-Organism Research Institute's report. The problem is... this thing knows too much. By human standards, of course. And for some reason, it seems to have a mission to eliminate life forms that approach this secret."

If the video were made public, Argoneth would eliminate all of humanity.

"There's no time. I'm suppressing it with drugs but it'll wake up soon. Shirone, you have to choose. Whether all of humanity will fight, or whether you'll fight alone."

The speed of Pishio's mutation accelerated and his head bent to the side as if it would break.

'Damn it...'

The fact that he couldn't help was heartbreaking.

"Argoneth is the source of all life. But you're different. You're free from its control."

Because he was a Hexa.

"Whether it's infinite nothingness or infinite existence, it doesn't matter. Even if it's a mistake, it's the world I lived in. So..."

"Pishio!"

When Pishio's eyes rolled upward, Shirone rushed toward the video.

"I've definitely... conveyed it to you. Shirone..."

Finally Pishio's neck completely snapped, and the mutated cells drooped down.

"Huk! Huuuk!"

Shirone grabbed the video and shed tears.

"No. No..."

The reason there was no corpse in the coffin.

As the host died, the cells rapidly melted and spread like porridge.

"Hah."

Shirone returned to his seat powerlessly and fell into deep thought with his head down.

'Why is that important?'

Pishio's message revealed the truth of the world, but it seemed like nothing would change anyway.

"Why does Argoneth try to eliminate humans who approach this secret?"

The key to reaching the outer world.

'Infinity. The mage of infinity.'

Can't conceive of a state where nothing exists?

To Shirone, who had made no progress since reaching the 9th sense, an eerie feeling was transmitted.

'Wait... could this be...'

A flickering screen was reflected in the retina of Shirone who was resting his chin on his hand.

Shirone, who had been absorbed in thought and hadn't noticed, hurriedly raised his head.

"What?"

In the video that wasn't over yet, Pishio's cells that had turned into mucus began to writhe.

They became more active as if alive, and the surface bulged up.

'There's more video?'

And finally, a mucus-like substance in human form walked toward the screen, dripping thin liquid.

Where the mouth should be opened round, then tore open with a rip, and a voice leaked out.

"Shi...ro...ne..."

It was Argoneth, the father of all life.
