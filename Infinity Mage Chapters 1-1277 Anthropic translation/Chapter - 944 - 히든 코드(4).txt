Hidden Code (4)

The war between the allied forces and the demon clan fought in the flower field was like a bingo game that erased life.

Neither dazzling movements nor powerful magic mattered—they only produced results through simple mathematical reduction.

'There's no end! This isn't an exaggeration!'

No matter how many they killed, demons would somehow be right back in their places, and the allied forces sensed their defeat.

"Kahaha! I'll wrap around your intestines!" Just as a demon with horns on its temples was about to thrust a spear into a soldier's abdomen.

"Kuk!"

The air roared as the demon's waist twisted and tore apart as if ripped.

"Oops, sorry."

Natasha appeared in a blur of afterimages, grabbing the demon's spine bone and sticking out her tongue.

"Why... How..."

The demon whose upper body had fallen to the ground lifted its head and expressed its confusion, but Natasha turned her gaze away.

'Where did he hide?'

In ultra-high-speed combat—a speed that made even "high-speed" seem inadequate—mistaking targets was commonplace.

It meant she was concentrating that intensely, and her consciousness was entirely focused on Rian's location.

"Hyaaaa!"

Rian's battle cry erupted, and as the scenery rippled, demons within a radius of dozens of meters were sliced apart.

With his field of vision suddenly cleared above waist level, Rian could be seen revealing his Yaksha form.

"There he is."

The moment her words ended, Natasha and her avatar simultaneously vanished from space.

Rian's eyes widened.

'Time's seesaw.'

The phenomenon humans call a "life flashing before one's eyes" separates sensory time from brain time.

The body remains in reality, but an enormous amount of signals cross paths in the brain.

'Normally, you die. If you feel this, you die.'

Except for lucky cases of survival, escaping a crisis through one's own power was nearly impossible.

'But I am...'

As Divine Transcendence's Deny activated, Rian's body began moving beyond its limits.

'Ozent Rian!'

The moment he pulled his great sword up to his chest, Natasha's fist struck hard against its flat surface.

"Kugh!"

Through repeated learning, Rian thrust his great sword forward before being pierced by the shockwave.

The force that overloaded both his shoulders came not from brute strength but from supersonic speed.

'I counterattack here!'

Overcoming inertia and stopping in midair, Rian stepped forward with one foot and swung his great sword.

Instead of dodging with her upper body, Natasha bent both knees and rose up like a submarine surfacing, shaking her torso.

'Incredible flexibility.'

Even within the life-flashing phenomenon, her upper body appeared doubled, and fists spread out like buckshot came rushing in.

'Dodge.'

Just as Rian hastily twisted his body and pulled in his great sword to slash her—

"Kuk!"

A dull impact from his unguarded side sent him reeling as he heard the sound of bones breaking.

"Graaaah!"

Rian was pushed sideways and tried to overcome the inertia, but his legs wouldn't respond.

'What the...'

Where and how had he been hit?

As Rian bent his waist and stopped, looking forward, Natasha was already approaching.

'This woman really fights well.'

Rather than being inherently strong as a human—though she certainly was strong—it felt more like she was extremely good at something specific.

'A combat genius.'

There was a reason she was called Gustav's 4th Knight.

"Hmm."

Natasha cupped her chin and examined Rian's condition, slightly frowning as she spoke.

"I felt this before too, but..."

Even Rian, who was usually indifferent to others' evaluations, swallowed and waited for her next words.

"You really have no talent, don't you?"

Though his expression remained unchanged, something heavy settled in Rian's heart.

"Why do you use so much force? You should move by calculating time and space. Your rhythm is a mess, and you have no creativity. Fighting you is really no fun."

"I don't fight for fun."

Natasha readily agreed.

"Of course not. But it's an important part, isn't it? Do you want to spend your whole life doing something that's no fun?"

Rian fell silent again.

"You're a strong person, but... I can't seem to find any other strengths besides that."

Rian was strong.

But he was also the person furthest from being extremely good at anything.

"That's why it's frustrating. Want to learn combat from me? Just fixing a few things would make you decent."

"Shut up."

Rian's ribs had healed again.

"Learning doesn't discriminate between people, but you're the exception. There's nothing to learn from the world's greatest villain."

"Then if I weren't a villain, would you learn?"

A moment of silence passed.

"What do you mean?"

"You said you don't want to learn from a villain, right? Then while you're learning, I'll be on humanity's side. You have good physical abilities. It's a waste to leave them as they are."

Natasha was still an incomprehensible woman, but there was something that defined her as such.

"I see."

Rian smiled bitterly.

"You wouldn't have any weaknesses."

Among all the geniuses Rian had met, she had the most nearly perfect talent.

"I'll just accept the sentiment. Though we're enemies, I can tell you're sincere. But you can't teach me. If it could be fixed, I would have fixed it long ago."

"That's why I'm saying I'll help."

"To someone else, to your genius eyes, what I lack might just be a single flaw. Like finding the right part and fitting it in to solve the problem."

"Isn't that how it is?"

"You don't understand."

This time Natasha closed her mouth.

"You don't know how many times I've swung my sword to overcome that one flaw. What I've tried. How long I've resented and cursed myself."

"That's why I'm saying it's frustrating."

"Have you ever thought about it? Not about the flaw, but about what kind of effort a person with that flaw might have made?"

"A genius dancer has been born in the Gustav Empire!"

Natasha first made her mark in the dance world when she was only seven years old.

Even before the empire's most prominent figures, her dance was perfect art.

"Amazing. That little child isn't even nervous."

There was no need to be nervous.

'Rotation.'

With both hands raised above her head, spinning on one toe, her center of gravity aligned perfectly with the direction of gravity.

'Leap.'

Natasha's body soared high with elasticity unbefitting a child, drawing beautiful lines.

"Ooh!"

She could almost see the audience's eyes widening in amazement.

'This is fun.'

Being good at something.

'I want to get even better. Then it'll be even more fun.'

The angle of her ten fingers' movement, the bend of her knees, the position of her chin, the degree of gravity, distance from the ground, air resistance, gaze, facial muscle expressions, and more.

'I can feel it all.'

Rather than checking and adjusting each thing individually, it felt like her entire body had become a brain.

Countless thoughts passed through her mind while airborne.

'Upon landing...'

As the music quickened, Natasha's toes began crossing rapidly.

While music flowed through her mind, her body continuously broke down each beat.

Rhythm.

A measure of how many events could be contained within a single moment of time.

"She's a genius! An undeniable genius!"

Beside her was her peer Daphne, but the officials only saw Natasha.

Even the dance troupe's director was the same.

'Syncopation. At least 1/1000th beat or more.'

When a rhythm is broken into regular beats, someone might hit the beat 0.1 beats slower than that regular beat.

If that's called a 1/10th beat, trained individuals can feel up to 1/100th beats.

But being off by 1/1000th of a beat from the regular beat is beyond human perception.

It's a level where the feeling itself creates an unsettling sensation that gives you goosebumps.

"Brafe!"

Gustav language meaning "magnificent" poured out as applause erupted.

Natasha became an overnight star, but all she could think about was wanting to dance better.

"Daphne."

Natasha called out in the practice room.

"Yeah?"

Though they were close peers, Daphne found it difficult to approach Natasha, who received all the world's attention.

"Your center is a bit off."

"Huh? Me? I can't tell when I look in the mirror."

"About 2 degrees. At our age, our muscle strength is weak, so maintaining an accurate center is most important. When rotating, don't focus on the crown of your head as the center—imagine a circular band."

"A circular band?"

"Centrifugal and centripetal force. Instead of concentrating force, imagine letting the force gather naturally."

"Ah..."

Daphne, having grasped something, bent her knees and spun on her toes.

"I did it!"

Surprised at herself, Daphne looked dazed for a moment, then grabbed Natasha's hands.

"Thank you, Natasha. I thought you'd become so famous that you wouldn't care about someone like me."

"What are you talking about? I want everyone to know the joy of dance. Let's work hard and definitely perform on the same stage together."

"Yeah."

Tears welled up in Daphne's eyes.

Time passed, and both Natasha and Daphne reached adulthood.

Daphne worked hard, but ultimately, the world's—not just Gustav's—greatest dancer was Natasha.

"Daphne, don't listen to the music, but feel like you're playing the music in your head. Then push gently. Like this with your fingertips..."

Even Natasha's hand positions were wondrous.

"Beautiful."

Though she couldn't visually confirm what was different, Daphne definitely felt it.

'1/10th of a degree. No, maybe 1/100th of a degree difference.'

Daphne forced a smile.

"Okay, I'll try."

"Right. Fighting!"

Watching Natasha return to her spot and resume practice, Daphne's feelings grew complicated.

'She never rests.'

Unlike other peers, she had no interest in going to cafes or meeting men.

Only dance.

When dancing, Natasha always wore the happiest expression in the world.

Daphne, who had been looking down briefly, packed her bag and walked past Natasha.

"I'm leaving first. I'm not feeling well."

"Huh? Suddenly? What's wrong?" Without even responding, Daphne opened the practice room door, despair evident in her eyes.

Time passed, and one day Natasha was dragged away by some assailant and had her spine broken in an accident.

It was the retirement of a genius dancer.

Emerging from her recollection, Natasha spoke.

"I never thought about it. But if they really hated me for that reason..."

Natasha's cheek puffed out.

"That's a bit unfair."

"I don't know what you went through. But I know this: to you, it's just a flaw, but to them, it was years they had to carry in their hearts for life. As long as you don't understand this..."

Rian aimed his great sword.

"Your goodwill will never be conveyed."

Rian's words strangely hurt Natasha more than a threat to kill her.

"...I didn't work hard."

For the first time, coldness filled her usually bright, cat-like eyes.

"I didn't work as hard as me."

"That would be right. I don't know who you're talking about, but in any case, it wouldn't be you."

The arm of the death god controlling Natasha moved.

"They took away what was most precious." Of course, Natasha never even investigated whether Daphne was the one who hired the assailant to assault her.

Rather than waste emotions on irreversible matters, she had a tendency to become the best in fields where she could make a difference.

Such extreme tendencies were themselves genius-like, but...

'I want to dance.'

The days when she could be happy just by surrendering her body to music would never return.

"I kill. That is my job."

Death God's Dance

Syncopated Concerto.

The moment Natasha moved within the time's seesaw, a shiver ran down Rian's spine.

'What?'

It was 1/1000th of a beat.
