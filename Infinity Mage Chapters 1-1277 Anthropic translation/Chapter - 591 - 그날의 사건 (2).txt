[591] The Events of That Day (2)

The Stop spell was cast, and the events manifesting from the specific structural forms of Estas rose to the surface.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 0:00.

Space: Estas Warehouse 72.

In the interior of Estas, reproduced exactly as it was 19 years ago, a woman entered through the doorway.

It was Miro, her appearance not much different from now, holding a newborn child in her arms.

With a serious expression as if bearing all the burdens of the world, she stared at the passage before turning around to ask.

"How much time do I have?"

"......"

Someone spoke from outside the door, but the fact that no sound came through meant they were outside the event.

"Don't worry. I'll definitely succeed."

Miro made this promise to them.

"If I can't return in time, just close the time. I won't resent you."

Someone outside the door seemed to be speaking at great length as she stood there for a long time, then nodded and turned around.

"Yorga."

At the 3-minute mark after the event began, this was the last word she uttered as she left Estas Warehouse 72.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 2 hours 42 minutes.

Space: Estas Warehouse 72.

Opening the door to Warehouse 72, Shirone and Anchal took their first steps into Estas.

Though it was now a familiar sight, today their hearts pounded with excitement.

"Whew."

Taking a deep breath, Shirone looked back at Anchal and asked.

"But who cast the Stop spell? If it wasn't Armin who came here."

"It must be Fermi's irregular formula. Upper-level events are hidden in a single coordinate of spacetime. When time stops, they separate and appear as time and space."

While the events played out like reality to them, to people outside, everything happening here occurred in an instant.

"If I cast Ataraxia here..."

Before Shirone could finish speaking, Anchal grabbed his wrist and pulled him.

"Hide."

Pressing against the wall and deploying Thousand-Faced Technique, an illusion identical to the wall surface appeared and concealed them.

Soon after, Miro entered Warehouse 72, covered head to toe in blood with both arms hanging limply.

Her expression was somewhat dazed and her steps heavy, but her eyes remained clear.

'Miss Miro? What happened?'

Miro suddenly stopped walking, but Anchal calmly observed her.

'It's fine. There's no way we'll be detected.'

The ability of the Demon Eye to manifest illusions like reality was a technical implementation of the Prajna realm - even Miro couldn't easily see through it.

"Shirone."

At Miro's call, Shirone's shoulders flinched.

"Don't come. Whatever you're thinking, you absolutely must not come to this place."

Thinking he needed to talk to Miro, Shirone moved toward the wall, but Anchal grabbed his shoulder.

'Not yet. Getting entangled in the event from the start isn't good.'

Rumble!

At that moment, Estas began vibrating and the positions of the structures started changing.

Miro hurriedly turned around and shouted.

"You fool...!"

Before she could finish speaking, Miro's form gradually faded and disappeared like a lie.

The vibration stopped, and Anchal dispelled the illusion magic.

"Estas's structure has changed. That means Warehouse 72 is no longer the entrance."

"Does that mean events change when space changes?"

Anchal nodded.

"Upper-level events are records carved into specific times and spaces. If either one changes, the event won't occur. But from now on, it'll be different. The warehouse moving means we've already taken a different path from the existing events."

"Who moved the warehouse?"

"It could be Fermi..."

Anchal looked at Shirone.

"Or it could be you."

Shirone didn't understand her words.

"But I just entered? How could I move the warehouse?"

"The upper level has a structure where time circulates infinitely. In other words, it's a circle where beginning and end connect, not a straight line. There's no distinction between past, present, and future. We just entered, but there's a possibility that your future self moved Estas for some reason. Otherwise, how could Miro have known your name just now?"

"Ah..."

Shirone's mouth fell open.

"The upper-level events are records from 19 years ago. There's no way she could know your name, right? Therefore, the Miro we saw was already in a state of having met you."

"Because she heard from my future self, she knew I would be there?"

"We can't be certain of anything yet. The fact that the event has already taken a different path means it will continue to do so. The movement of space is especially serious."

"In what sense?"

Anchal cast illusion magic to create a cube.

"Simply put, Estas is a kind of cube. And Guffin contained specific events within it. For example..."

Pictures depicting wars that anyone from Tormia would know were overlaid on the six faces of the cube.

"Let's say this picture is an upper-level event. It's a simple picture, but it contains countless stories depending on the observer's perspective."

Shirone realized how Guffin had hidden events in spacetime.

"He compressed 3-dimensional events into 2 dimensions."

"Right. He captured events exactly like this picture. However, we've currently entered inside this picture. So we experience 2-dimensional events in 3 dimensions. And now, for some reason, Estas has moved."

As the cube spun wildly, the picture became jumbled like a puzzle.

"Hmm."

"Now do you understand? It means all the events recorded at specific times and spaces have been scattered."

Anchal pointed to the passage leading to the next warehouse.

"It takes less than a minute to get to Warehouse 14 from here. But there might be a future one hour ahead unfolding there. Or a past one hour behind."

If space was twisted and the timeline severed, another hypothesis could be formed.

"Then what if I twist time? I mean, what would happen if I cast Ataraxia here?"

"How broad a scope of time do you perceive?"

"About one second before and after."

"Then you'd encompass all of the upper level's time and more. This is actually a 2-dimensional event without time. If you cast Ataraxia now, you'd experience events from all time periods that occurred in this space."

"But I can't change space. That's why you said I might have moved Estas."

"Exactly. Fermi is suspicious too, but if there's someone who would need to change space, it's you."

"What kind of necessity would that be?"

Unless it was a seriously grave matter, there was no reason to activate Estas while prepared to twist events.

"We have no choice but to go to the engine room. If the events have changed, we need to know in order to reverse them."

As Anchal turned toward the engine room, Shirone asked with a surprised expression.

"You knew Estas's equation?"

"Don't underestimate the intelligence network of the Jincheon Space Agency. Even if it's a Level 1 secret, we can obtain blueprints."

Shirone's eyes went hollow.

'Level 1 secret...'

Even before going to Heaven, he had felt this, but it was amazing that he had survived this long without dying.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 17 minutes.

Space: Estas Warehouse 14.

As soon as they exited the warehouse door, a powerful explosion rang out.

"What?"

The moment he turned his head, the scene of a warehouse painted with blood greeted Shirone.

"Ahhhhhhh!"

"Chase her! Never let her escape!"

Shirone's eyes widened.

'That's the voice from then!'

Confirming the identity of the voice he had heard when first casting Ataraxia in Estas, a man wearing claws curved like eagle talons on his wrists was chasing Miro.

"Don't let your guard down! The opponent is the strongest Prajna!"

Though Miro was running while looking ahead, in the vision of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara that looked down upon the entire world, there were no blind spots.

"Ahhhhhh!"

As Avalokitesvara's palm pushed another soldier into the wall, his body burst like a fly.

"Reporting! Squad 1 annihilated! Squad 1 annihilated!"

"Damn it!"

Rask, leading Squad 2, gritted his teeth and rushed out.

"Miro! Surrender your neck obediently!"

The distance closed in an instant, and only then did Miro turn around.

"Tsk!"

As Avalokitesvara's palm divided in a moment's time to target Rask, his claw created afterimages as it swung.

With an explosive roar, the Avalokitesvara palm was deflected, and Rask landed on the ground with his claws crossed in an X formation.

"Annoying..."

Miro looked irritably at the child in her arms, then turned around again.

"Chase her! Target the child!"

The Mars forces quickly passed by Shirone.

Just watching the battle left Shirone breathless, and as he let out a sigh of relief, Anchal dispelled the illusion magic.

"At these coordinates, Mars Squad 1 was annihilated. Judging by her holding a child, not much time has passed."

"She seemed to be trying to protect the child somehow."

Otherwise, there was no reason for someone as powerful as Miro to flee with enemies in front of her.

'That child is...'

Shirone recalled the night before finishing his training and descending the mountain, when Miro had asked about his parents.

Shirone, perhaps I am...

What was Miro trying to say then?

"I need to confirm who that child is."

"Then let's move to the next room."

They arrived at Room 13 where Miro had fled, but there were no traces of battle.

"The space is correct, but the time period must be different."

At Anchal's words, Shirone drew Armand.

Gripping the sword and activating Diamond Armed, an organic robe wrapped around his body and the external artificial brain floated above his head.

"Is that Armand?"

Though Valhalla Action was currently paying off debt, the other functions would significantly increase survival probability.

"I need to meet Miro now somehow. I'm going to cast Ataraxia here."

If he perceived time differently, Anchal and Shirone's coordinates would split, so there was no reason to stay here.

"Good. Then I'll go to the engine room. Find me when you're done checking."

After confirming Anchal left the warehouse, Shirone cast Ataraxia and the surrounding scenery began to shimmer.

"Heoeoeoek!"

A completely different perception of time from the existing Ataraxia - 2 hours and 48 minutes of records came flooding in all at once.

The sensation of past, present, and future being compressed into two dimensions was as grotesque as looking at the world through a kaleidoscope.

"Kuuuuu!"

In the violence of information, Shirone desperately perceived the time when Miro had been in this place.

"Ahhhhhh!"

When Ataraxia disappeared, his head throbbed as if it would split.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 32 minutes.

Space: Estas Warehouse 13.

"Who are you?"

Miro, clutching the child, lifted her back from the wall.

"Miss Miro?"

Shirone, who had hurriedly regained his senses, stopped with a start.

Mars Squad 2, who had been chasing her just moments ago, were scattered across the warehouse floor, brutally torn apart.

'The battle is over.'

"I asked who you are. If you're Mars, I'll kill you."

Shirone hurriedly pulled back his hood.

"No! I'm a magic school student!"

It was the best answer to reassure Miro.

"A student? Couldn't you get out?"

If he was a student from the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society, it was entirely possible he had been inside before Guffin cut the timeline.

"Poor thing. Unfortunately, prepare for your life to end. You can't leave this place."

Miro, her tension released, sat back against the wall.

Shirone approached while looking at the child in her arms, still sleeping peacefully with a serene face.

"No. I came here to meet you, Miss Miro."

"Me?"

Miro turned her tired face toward him.
