Karma Chain (4)

The sailor's supplies were woefully insufficient to last even a day, but the people had gained confidence.

In certain situations, killing someone might be the only way to survive.

But at least they weren't alone.

Though this atmosphere wouldn't last forever, Shirone smiled warmly.

'Just for a moment.'

If everyone could care for each other's hearts, this world would never be hopeless.

Among the people who had lost themselves to the flood, a warm breeze filled with human warmth began to flow.

But from far away, perhaps from a higher vantage point watching the situation, Desica was displeased.

"What's with that guy?"

As a minister of internal affairs for a nation, he would have heard Yahweh's name, but knowing his face was another matter.

The knight whispered to him.

"There's always someone like that wherever you go. Fools who act spoiled without knowing the tragedy that awaits them. I wonder what that guy will do when there's truly no water left to share."

Desica snorted.

"He'll probably cry and beg. He doesn't know how hard life is. It becomes troublesome when guys like that interfere."

If people started helping each other, naturally the arrows would point toward Desica, who was hoarding food supplies.

"Deal with him."

"...Understood."

Desica's knight bowed his head with cold eyes and walked toward Shirone.

"Hey, you."

Shirone looked up.

"Me?"

"Yeah, you. I'll let it slide this once, but this kind of behavior is forbidden from now on."

"I believe the minister you serve hasn't touched his food supplies."

"That's not the problem. If we start sharing resources, it means we'll all die together. Resources are limited in any world. Unless you're an idiot, you should know that."

For the first time, displeasure flickered in Shirone's eyes.

'This is it.'

What really felt terrible was.

"Sorry, but giving my portion to someone else is my freedom. I can't follow your words."

The knight let out a big sigh.

And when he looked back at the minister, Desica nodded as if he understood what was meant.

"Brat."

The knight's sword, drawn with a swooshing sound, dug deep toward Shirone's nape.

"Where do you think you are right now?"

Unlike the calm Shirone, Poine's eyes held terrifying malice.

'Insignificant creature...'

Just as she was thinking of turning the knight's neck 180 degrees, Shirone asked.

"Where are we?"

"The middle of the ocean. Food is scarce, and we don't know when big waves might hit. Killing one person like you is nothing. No, it might actually be helpful."

The knight's expression turned cruel.

"You'd make good food."

The moment the blade touched Shirone's skin in a realm humans couldn't perceive.

"I've decided."

Shirone slowly stood up.

Desica's expression crumpled, but the knight remained frozen while pointing his sword, unable to move.

'What?'

His vision became distant, and he lost control of his body as if trapped in his own brain.

Mind Technique

Imprisonment.

'Save me! Someone please...!'

His senses were still alive, but none of it felt like his own experience.

While people watched in bewilderment, Shirone looked at Desica and said.

"The desire to live is a natural instinct of living beings. I don't want to deny even that."

Desica remained silent.

"But someone shares even small things. I don't care what you think, but..."

Shirone's eyes filled with intensity.

"Don't mock that heart. Even if it seems foolish, this too is a great instinct for survival."

People swallowed nervously and watched Desica as Shirone delivered a sharp rebuke to the minister of internal affairs.

"Hmm."

Desica stroked his chin and asked.

"Who are you?"

When Shirone didn't answer, he raised the corner of his mouth and made a proposal.

"You seem to be a mage. How about working under me? I'll give you half of my portion."

A knight guarding a minister of internal affairs wouldn't be of low caliber even by world standards.

If he could immobilize such a skilled person, appeasement was the only option.

"Foolish."

Desica's eyebrows twitched, but Shirone turned away as if there was no need to deal with him further.

"This is the middle of the ocean."

In the distance, the sea's back was rising.

"Save yourselves."

As soon as Shirone finished speaking, the sailors rang the emergency bell and moved busily.

"Massive wave! Everyone get inside!"

As people watched with anxious expressions, the captain came out personally and shouted at them.

"What are you doing! Get inside...!"

Kukukukukukuku!

At the deafening sound, the captain stopped speaking and turned his head toward the sea.

"Damn it."

A wave of unprecedented height was approaching to swallow the ship.

"Kihehehe! Humans, humans!"

Amphibious demons were submerged in the tsunami, each holding up their weapons.

"Save yourself."

Muttering this, Shirone wrapped his entire body in Miracle Stream and prepared to fight.

"Urgh!"

The knight, whose senses had miraculously returned, grabbed his head and examined the tsunami.

'...We can't withstand it.'

It wasn't a scale that humans could deal with.

"Minister! This way! We must escape!"

The fact that he cared for his minister until the end showed he was qualified as a knight, but...

"Messiah."

"Leave me be."

Shirone already knew what happened to those who lost their hearts in this world of apocalypse that someone had already prophesied.

"Aaaaah!"

Desica and the knight turned pale seeing the tsunami that had approached within 400 meters.

At that moment, dozens of massive water columns began shooting up to the sky from the back of the ship.

"Kraaaang!"

With a roar that shook heaven and earth, the water dragon Kaios flew up to face the tsunami.

The dragon's breath, boasting a 24-hour charging time, exploded through dragon speech.

Astronomical amounts of water twisted together like a braid and struck the tsunami, causing the sea to churn and lifting their ship hundreds of meters high.

"Aaaaah!"

The ship was in chaos, and only Shirone and Poine watched the demons descending from the sky.

"Poine, I've decided."

At least they had seen hope.

Miracle Stream condensed strongly in Shirone's hands, then exploded into brilliant light.

"Kieeee!"

The demons engulfed in light turned to ash and vanished, while conversely, the people felt the emotion of their hearts being purified.

"Ahhhh..."

The feeling of falling from the sky was dizzying, but even that was embraced by a warm heart.

'Hand of God.'

A hand of light descended from the sky to support the ship and slowly lowered it to rest on the water's surface.

The storm was still rough, but as the Hand of God stirred around the ship, it quickly calmed.

"This, this can't be..."

Not only Desica and the knight, but even the people who had received help from him couldn't approach Shirone.

"Yahweh."

According to news heard across the sea, a blonde boy fights for the world.

The minister of internal affairs also knew that boy's identity and physical characteristics.

"This makes no sense."

Rather than blame himself for not recognizing him, the current situation made no sense.

'Yahweh is here? Why?'

The one who would save the world couldn't possibly be on a refugee ship carrying mere dozens of people.

"Desica."

"Yes, yes!"

Desica, understanding the situation, prostrated himself.

"When we reach the Kingdom of Dionath, establish a provisional government. Someone from the Kingdom of Tormia will come soon. Cooperate with them to help as many flood victims as possible."

He wasn't foolish enough as a politician to miss the political situation from Shirone's words.

"...I understand."

A massive tectonic shift - the world was trying to reorganize itself around Tormia.

"However, we still have a long way to go. If Yahweh would use his power, we could quickly reach land..."

Desica flinched when he looked into Shirone's eyes.

"Huk!"

No honeyed words would work against the feeling of his mind being pierced.

"If it were just the people on this ship, we could go to land right now."

Shirone turned around and said.

"We're all going together."

The people who turned their heads following his gaze opened their mouths with blank expressions.

Following Kaios flying through the sky, countless ships filled the entire horizon.

The Other World.

The Valley of Wailing was originally a river where the hottest hellfire flowed in hell.

But after the spiritual realm was sealed, the lava had completely dried up, becoming a cliff hundreds of meters deep.

Riding the rolling gravel, Etela and Shagal descended to the bottom of the valley.

'I need to find food.'

Having fallen into hell in a living body, she was hungry, but there was no guarantee they could find food.

Just as Etela was about to move while surveying the surroundings, intense pain shot through her thigh.

"Kuk!"

Bending one leg, she turned around to see Shagal had stabbed a knife into her thigh.

Glaring at his bitter smile, Etela stood up again.

"Why do you keep doing this?"

"Are you asking because you don't know?"

Shagal pointed to the chain.

"You and I are trapped in this chain of hell. A chain that shares all pain, emotions, and feelings."

As the chain connecting the two gradually shortened, Etela gritted her teeth.

"Huu."

She tried to endure it, but it was an uncontrollable force, and the same was true for Shagal.

Eventually, when their bodies were completely pressed together, Etela turned her head away with a disgusted expression.

"You understand? This is punishment. The price for daring to forgive me. You'll never be able to escape from me."

There was no argument to make.

Since she had chosen this herself to remove Shagal from reality, she had no choice but to take responsibility.

"Let's find a place to rest before tormenting me. We don't know what demons might come out at night."

When Etela pushed Shagal away, the chain lengthened again, but the limit was only about 2 meters.

When Shagal stabbed his quick sword into his own thigh, Etela, who had been walking ahead, collapsed.

Looking at her back as she no longer even responded, Shagal thought.

'And this must be the punishment given to me.'

It was his fate that to torment Etela, he first had to harm his own body.

'Hm?'

How long had they walked? Shagal's superhuman senses detected an eerie presence and transmitted it to his brain.

"Stop."

Etela belatedly stopped walking, and phantoms of quick swords flickered around Shagal.

The eerie presence was still distant, flowing from the end of the valley's darkness.

Etela's face turned pale.

'I can feel it. Unapproachable emotions, anger, sacrifice, pain.'

Don't come.

As if ringing directly in her brain, a woman's voice sounded as loud as thunder.

There was no way Shagal hadn't heard what Etela heard, but he slowly advanced.

"Hmph, is hell also a place where people live?"

Since they were connected by chains, if Shagal went forward, Etela had no way to stop him.

The deeper they went, the stronger the emotions became, and finally fear rushed in to an unbearable degree.

"What's that?"

The two stopped walking and looked up.

Hundreds of chains were embedded in the rock walls on both sides, and a woman bound by them was visible.

"Don't, don't come..."

It was Jinseong-eum, Princess of True Heaven.
