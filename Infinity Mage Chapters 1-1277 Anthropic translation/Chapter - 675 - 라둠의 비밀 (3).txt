[675] Radum's Secret (3)

Ancient biological weapon, Saengwha.

A strategic defensive weapon that mimics biological mechanisms, collecting photons to grow its own body.

With just the roots it extends into the ground, it possesses enough power to supply electricity to all of Radum. Currently, it serves as a fortress where the executives of Spectrum, the largest coalition of demi-humans, reside.

With Venezia having left Radum, only three figures occupied the round table that once held four seats: the ministers of Combat, Defense, and Internal Affairs. The fourth chair sat empty.

However, they were acutely aware of La Enemy's presence in that vacant seat.

Spectrum's Internal Affairs Minister, the pureblooded vampire Raika, was the first to speak.

He was a handsome man with jet-black hair slicked neatly back. His face was pale as if powdered, and his lips were as flat and wide as a skate's, strikingly red against his pallor.

"The kingdom has made its decision. I expected as much. Though it's surprising that the Magic Association Chairman came personally."

"Rufist is a strong human."

Spectrum's Defense Minister, Plarino of the Hwa tribe, spoke.

Her eyelashes were unusually long, her red lips glistened as if they might slip away, and her body emanated not the scent of chemical products, but the vivid fragrance of living flowers.

The ancestors of the Hwa tribe were known to be incarnations of lotus flowers that achieved enlightenment over 40,000 years. Though they were an excellent race capable of incarnation arts, fewer than 30 individuals remained worldwide.

The reason they faced such a severe population extinction crisis was due to their race's inherent trait of 'extreme passivity.'

Having no instinct for choosing mates, they were genetically programmed to submit to the desires of all races.

To them, chance coupling was a beautiful probability, and they possessed a noble heart that cherished any seed. However, humans wouldn't leave them be, and they gradually withered under humanity's possessiveness and monopolistic desires, leading to their current state.

"He's also a dangerous human. Worse than Gaold."

When Mikea Gaold was Association Chairman, the pressure on Radum hadn't been so severe.

"That's why I said Rufist wouldn't work. Thinking you could have a conversation with such a conservative human was foolish."

Spectrum had also pressured the Kingdom of Tormia through their organizational channels, but the incident Gaold caused was too significant.

"It doesn't matter. Now an opportunity has come to us as well. A chance to reclaim Vashka."

A man with half his face covered in reptilian scales spoke.

Spectrum's Combat Minister, the dragon-horse Drakker.

Dragon-horses were humans created through biological experiments on dragons. Though their dragon creators considered them failures, they nonetheless conquered numerous regions with combat power incomparable to other demi-humans, eventually establishing themselves as a distinct race.

"Venezia was foolish. If you can't avoid it, you should use it."

Plarino nodded at Raika's words.

"We will overthrow the humans."

Drakker looked around at the empty seat as he spoke.

"You want that too, don't you?"

A new memory formed in the three minds of La Enemy smiling and nodding.

"Joshua! Get it together, Joshua!"

Feeling her shoulders being shaken, Joshua slowly opened her eyes and immediately sat up, drawing her bow.

It was a learned motion, but she missed nocking an arrow, leaving the bow empty. However, Cargin wasn't in any state of mind to notice such things.

"Whoa, whoa! Calm down! It's me, me!"

After staring briefly at Cargin, who held up both hands with a pale face, she came to her senses and lowered her bow.

"What happened?"

"Looks like you were blown here by the explosion. I don't know where we are either."

Cargin looked terrible.

Thinking she probably looked the same, Joshua tried to stand.

"I'll take a look around. Ow!"

Seeing her wince in pain and fall on her bottom, Cargin examined her ankle.

It was swollen and twisted.

"Oh no, you're injured. I wasn't thinking straight either."

When he cast healing magic, pain like fire rushed through her.

"It hurts!"

"Just bear with it a little. I should be able to fix it quickly."

Healing magic is divided into high-speed activation types that enhance natural recovery and regeneration types that rapidly repair cells. Cargin specialized in the latter.

"Be grateful I specialize in regeneration. Back in my day, they called me God's Hands..."

"Shut up and just heal me. Things are chaotic enough as it is."

Though Joshua was openly rude to him, perhaps because she'd grown fond of him, he didn't feel particularly bad about it.

"Even conservatively estimating, it'll take at least 10 minutes."

Even with regeneration magic, treating a fracture takes considerable time.

"That's too long. We don't even know where we landed..."

As she looked around, a murky voice came from the direction of the path.

"Kik kik kik! Found them, found them."

Joshua aimed her bow from her sitting position. This time she didn't forget to nock an arrow.

Goblins appeared from all directions, wielding deadly weapons that matched their agile movements as they approached.

"Damn! There are too many."

Though her arrowhead was equipped with fire-attribute magic bullets, it wasn't enough to handle over sixty enemies.

"Guruk guruk! Wait! The woman is ours!"

Hearing voices from behind, Cargin looked up while still casting magic to see Pig-heads with pig faces carrying large axes approaching.

"Damn... shit!"

Both races were carnivorous, making them terrifying to humans.

The goblin coalition Speed Killer's leader wasn't pleased that the Pig-head coalition Mad Species was trying to steal their prey.

Representing the goblins' cruel gaze, leader Marta made a throat-slitting gesture as she spoke.

"No way. Both humans are ours. If you back off quietly, we'll give you one leg."

"Geuruk geuruk! You think one leg will fill our stomachs? We're starving here!"

Pig-head leader Fugo protested strongly, but Marta only found the opponent's desperation amusing.

"Kik kik kik! That's your problem. We found them first, didn't we? If you don't like it, run faster next time."

The two people, relying on a single arrow while watching the standoff between organizations, swallowed nervously.

'Maybe things will work out.'

If they could provoke the goblins and pig-heads, they might find a chance to escape.

But as if mocking their thoughts, the pig-head made a terrible proposal.

"Guruk guruk! Then let's do it your way! Then you won't complain, right?"

"Ho? The goblin way, you say? You think you can?"

Marta's eyes gleamed as she shouldered her bladed nunchucks.

"Fine. Whoever catches them gets to eat."

"Meat! Meat!"

Using Marta's words as a signal, goblins and pig-heads rushed toward the two from all directions.

At the same time, Joshua's arrow flew and the magic bullet exploded.

"Yahoo!"

The goblins scattered in all directions, their aggressive nature making them enjoy even their prey's resistance.

"The organs are mine! The eyeballs are mine too!"

"I want... kehehehe!"

Cargin grabbed Joshua and cast teleportation, but unless they burrowed underground, there was nowhere to hide.

"Kikiki, humans just before slaughter are more disgusting than pigs."

"Don't call us pigs! Guruk guruk!"

Even while moving through teleportation, Joshua's shots were accurate, but the goblins' natural physical abilities matched those of quadrupedal predators.

"Guwooooo!"

As Mad Species members continued pouring in, jumping from buildings, the teleportation flash curved through them like lightning.

But they couldn't avoid the goblins' attacks as well, and eventually the repetitive compulsion broke, sending both people tumbling to the ground.

"Huuuuk!"

As Joshua's ankle, which had been nearly 30% healed, worsened, the color drained from Cargin's face.

"Got you."

Looking back, Speed Killer and Mad Species members had formed a semicircular encirclement.

"I promise one thing. I absolutely won't kill you. I'll just eat you."

Confirming the two people's change in expression, Marta clutched her stomach and laughed.

"Puhahaha! See that face? They're completely terrified."

Cargin's body, holding Joshua, trembled.

'How can I die?'

Though he'd thought about dying as casually as eating throughout his life, when the time actually came to die, no method came to mind.

"Run away."

Joshua nocked a smoke arrow to her bowstring as she spoke.

"Time it right and escape with teleportation."

"B-but..."

Cargin squeezed out all the courage of his lifetime to ask.

"What about you?"

He was afraid the answer might be "Well, what about me?"

"It's a life that's already over anyway. Ever since Leo died."

Though she didn't dare say she'd loved him, he'd been a cute little boy.

When he laughed calling "Mama, mama," she could forget her miserable life, if only for a moment.

"Kids! It's dinner time!"

As goblins and pig-heads rushed forward competitively, Joshua set off the smoke bomb.

"Uaaaah!"

Cargin flew up with teleportation, escaping the enemies' radius with the greatest concentration of his life, dodging blades.

"Guruk guruk! Should we chase him?"

"Forget it! Let's claim the woman first! She looks more delicious!"

As final struggles often go, Joshua ignored her broken leg and threw her body forward, firing off all her magic bullets without reservation.

BOOM! BOOM!

As the explosion sounds grew more distant, Cargin's running speed also decreased.

'What have I done?'

His legs gave out and he collapsed.

Hadn't he lost Mariang like that and lived his whole life in despair?

'Let's go back. At my age, how much longer would I live anyway?'

He turned toward where Joshua was, but his heart still wouldn't move.

"Huuuu!"

He didn't want to die.

Even if it was a short remaining life, even if he had to bear the burden of being a coward, he wanted to live.

Cargin pounded his legs with his fists.

"Move! Move, damn it!"

His legs hurt as if they might break, but he actually knew the truth.

That tormenting himself and suffering like this was better than dying.

"Uaah! Please move! Move!"

'Did he escape safely?'

Her quiver was empty and her ankle was severely twisted.

She'd taken down over thirty enemies alone and even eliminated Fugo, the Mad Species leader, with a strange strategy.

It was a personal record in her life, but what remained was fitting retribution.

"Don't think I'll let you die easily."

Marta's eyes were full of killing intent, and the Mad Species members who'd lost their leader were drooling while imagining chewing on her.

'I should have saved one arrow.'

At least an arrowhead would be better than their teeth.

"Cut off her legs first."

As the goblin who received the order raised a glaive as tall as himself to strike Joshua's legs.

"You vicious bastards!"

Everyone turned to see Cargin, looking ten years older, running toward them with a club.

"Uaah! Just kill me instead, you bastards!"

With his white hair disheveled as he ran, it was clear his mind had already snapped.

When Marta tripped him, his body tumbled and crashed into Joshua.

"What are you doing, old man! What did you think you'd accomplish by coming here!"

"Huuk! Like this..."

Cargin spoke through tears and snot.

"I can't live like this."

"..."

Before his foolish words about just coming to find a place to die, Joshua realized she felt the same way.

"Kuku! What's with this guy? I spared his life and he walks into danger? Does he want to be eaten by us that badly?"

'What have I done?'

Cargin came to his senses again.

How many times would he have to come to his senses to at least pretend to be human while living in this world?

"How fortunate. One woman wasn't enough."

"Boys, it's a meat feast!"

Pushing past Speed Killer, a chubby pig-head rushed forward first.

"Gueeee! The forearm is min—!"

And the next moment, a flash flew over and his face exploded with a bang.

"What!"

They looked around but saw no one.

"Found you, Rian! Over here!"

Hearing a voice from above, they looked up to see Sirone calling to Rian from the rooftop of a two-story building.

"Huk! Huuk!"

Tears finally formed in Joshua's eyes, and without realizing it, honorifics slipped out.

"Captain!"
