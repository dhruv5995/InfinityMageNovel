Confrontation (2)

Shura's eyes were sunken.

"Just kill me instead."

After Nane's blasphemous chanting continued all night, even the mountains and vegetation were trembling.

Though they were holed up on the outskirts of a shelter created by Gestalt's ability, the sound didn't seem to fade even a little.

Kurururururur.

Shura finally regained her senses after a long while due to the vibrations rolling in from far away.

"Huh?"

Seismic waves rushed in at high speed, penetrating toward where Shura was.

As the Gestalt collapsed and the false barrier disappeared, the mountain range extending to Bashka came into view.

"What's happening?"

Having learned many things about the world while following Buddha, what she suspected was:

'This isn't natural.'

If an earthquake of this magnitude had started at the coast, a tsunami should have swept across the continent.

'It's the power of breaking the precepts.'

Several figures passed through Shura's mind.

'Shirone, Lian, Gaold...'

But no matter who she thought of, none were capable of causing an earthquake large enough to shake the continent.

"The heavens have opened."

It was natural that figures from Heaven, which was like her homeland, came to mind first.

'I need to let them know.'

Though Nane was still preoccupied with chanting blasphemies, Shura kicked off the ground and ran toward him.

The interior of the cabin where Amy lay unconscious was filled with Nane's voice.

"Maha Prajña..."

The sounds spilling from Nane's mouth seemed to accumulate like matter with mass.

"Avalokiteśvara..."

The moment Nane's voice cut off abruptly, a small tremor shook the building.

"Mmm."

It wasn't just because he sensed the earthquake that he stopped.

Amy's eyes, which had been unable to awaken despite being struck by countless enlightenments, slowly opened as if receiving a signal.

"...Have you awakened?"

In her confused mental state, she couldn't even realize that Nane's voice was human language.

'Where am I?'

Like she'd become an arthropod, she had no sensation in her hands and feet, only moving her eyes left and right.

'I was definitely...'

Terrible memories came flooding back.

While trying to escape with her comrades, they encountered Division Commander Parkma and were annihilated.

'Berik.'

He wasn't someone who should have died like that.

'Only I survived.'

Faced with the situation of having her life saved by one man's kindness, Amy bit her lip.

'What kind of soldier am I?'

Then Nane's face suddenly intruded into her field of vision.

"Are you alright?"

Amy stared at him quietly for a moment.

'Who is this?'

His face was covered with various tattoos, making it impossible to recognize even his original features.

But the man's eyes resembled someone dear that she knew.

'Shirone.'

The moment that thought crossed her mind, all the information flowed in and reached a single conclusion.

"Nane!"

Looking down at the surprised Amy, Nane smiled kindly.

"That's right. It's that Nane."

Amy hurriedly tried to sit up.

"Aaaaah!"

Soon after, pain like her muscles burning with fire struck, and she ended up collapsing back onto the bed.

"You're like a newborn child. Not only will there be pain, but if you force yourself to move, you could hurt your body."

"Why are you here?"

The Buddha of the age.

She couldn't look kindly upon someone who judged the world as emptiness and sought to close the universe.

Most importantly, he was clearly an enemy as someone who stood at the opposite end from Shirone.

"Your condition still isn't good."

Nane covered Amy with a blanket and got up from his seat, walking toward the door.

"I'll go prepare something to eat. Until then..."

Nane stopped speaking and slowly turned around.

"Haa. Haa."

Amy had gotten down from the bed and was glaring at him while supporting her trembling body through the pain.

Amy gritted her teeth and said:

"Answer me. Why are you here? What did you do to me?"

Nane smiled with his eyes and said:

"Well, this and that..."

But when Amy's expression turned sharply cold, he immediately corrected himself.

"You were consumed by the Fire Realm. It was powerful enough to burn even your consciousness. So I awakened you."

"Awakened me?"

Amy also recalled the situation at that time.

Having lost her reason due to Berik's death, she had raised her fire power at the cost of giving up on life.

"How did you awaken me?"

Since it would take a very long time to explain, Nane turned around again and said:

"Rest for now. I'll bring something to eat."

Since it seemed true that she had received Nane's help, Amy kept quiet for a moment.

But soon she widened her eyes and charged at him.

'I'll eliminate the Buddha.'

Come to think of it, wasn't it because of Nane's existence that all the current results had come about?

Of course, she couldn't deny that he had provided a key cause for her separation from Shirone.

Her red eyes glowed crimson as enormous flames rose from her hands.

As if all the dust from her mind had been wiped clean, the power was far superior to before.

'Even if it's cowardly, I have no choice!'

Amy, focused solely on subduing Nane, extended her hand without hesitation.

"Die..."

With a thud, a sword struck directly into Amy's solar plexus.

"Sermon. Pain."

As the blood-red sword scattered like a phantom, electricity sparked in Amy's eyes.

"Aaaaaaaah!"

As unimaginable pain struck, her knees automatically hit the floor.

Hearing the scream from outside, Shura roughly threw open the door and shouted:

"Nane?!"

Unable to continue speaking at the scene before her eyes, Nane turned his head toward Amy.

"Yahweh creates what doesn't exist, but Buddha realizes what does exist. If it's painful..."

"Huuuuu!"

Amy raised her head while clutching both arms, her eyes still unbroken.

"Think of it as my pain."

Having experienced everything in this world, Nane's voice functioned as truth.

Shura approached.

"When did she wake up?"

"She regained consciousness a little while ago. By the way, it seems a big earthquake occurred."

"It must be Heaven's army. They probably came here to meet you."

Nane smiled meaningfully.

Even though he had swallowed Ankera's dream, his philosophy differed from what the angels pursued.

"They'll find us anyway. Even Gestalt's ability can't hide from the angels' senses."

Amy eavesdropped on their conversation despite her pain.

'Heaven's army has come?'

With Nane alone being overwhelming, if they joined forces too, there would be no hope for humanity.

"Let's wait and see for now."

Just before Nane opened the door to leave, Amy asked:

"Wait. What are you planning to do with me?"

There was no way Nane, who had been hidden behind a veil until now, would suddenly save her life for no reason.

'He knows.'

The fact that she's Shirone's lover.

"Even if you hold me captive, you won't get what you want. I'd rather die than be used."

She had no intention of becoming a hostage.

"Hah. You really are stubborn."

Well, that's why she had stimulated Nane's interest among countless beings.

"What I'm planning to do with you is..."

Nane, who had been looking at the ceiling lost in thought, met Amy's eyes and smiled.

"Feed you first."

Since there wasn't even a table in the cabin, the three sat in a circle on the floor to eat.

Though it was a simple meal made from plants, for Amy it provided all the necessary nutrients.

"Ugh."

The pains she hadn't felt when excited about seeing Nane continued to torment her.

"It would be best not to overdo it for a while. When your condition returns to normal, do as you wish."

Amy slammed down her utensils.

"I don't understand. You're doing this even though you know who I am? What exactly are your intentions?"

Shura pointed accusingly.

"Where do you get off speaking informally to Buddha! Did you forget that we saved your life?"

"That's why I'm asking why you saved me! If you just saved me for no reason, what about all those who died to demons?"

"That's..."

Honestly, Shura was curious too.

"The reason I saved you is..." Nane opened his mouth.

"That's right. It's because you're Shirone's lover."

"What?"

Actually hearing it was absurd.

"Shirone and I could be called companions on the path of enlightenment. Though our directions differ, the distance we must travel is the same. I personally respect him. I was curious. For the loving Yahweh, what kind of woman would be irreplaceable to him?"

"You're mistaken. Shirone is a friend I met during school. He has nothing to do with universal love."

"Is that so?"

Leaving only a short answer, Nane picked up his bowl again and moved rice grains to his mouth.

On the other hand, Amy didn't touch her food and persistently glared at him.

Eventually Nane gave up eating and continued:

"If I threatened to kill you, would Shirone yield the path of enlightenment to me?"

The answer came immediately.

"No, absolutely not."

"You're wrong."

Nane shook his head.

"Shirone would yield. To save you, he might even give up the entire world."

Amy's eyes flashed dangerously.

"So that's why you saved me? Because you couldn't threaten Shirone if I died?"

"No. It's rather the opposite. I want to understand Shirone. I want to accept everything about him."

Whatever happens after that doesn't matter.

"So..."

If his philosophy of emptiness remains unchanged even after understanding love, then he would be a true Buddha.

"May I love you?"

Rice grains flew from Shura's mouth.

"Pfft!"

Amy was equally dumbfounded, and an awkward silence stretched long in the cabin.

"No."

Amy came to her senses and spoke.

"Do you think that makes sense right now? Why would you love me? What do you know about me?"

"I can get to know you from now on. And loving someone is personal freedom, isn't it?"

Amy thought of Berik.

"Of course, but you're not loving me. You're loving the person Shirone loves."

"Yes. But everyone is the same. There's nothing in this world you can love without reason. At first, it would be something trivial. Then without knowing it, that feeling grows and grows until it becomes something precious that can't be exchanged for anything."

"I'm not forcing you. Rest comfortably. You asked why I saved you, so I answered honestly."

Nane left first out of consideration for Amy.

'What kind of situation is this?'

While chewing her rice in a slightly dazed state, she felt a sharp glare on her forehead.

When she looked up, Shura was watching her with an unpleasant expression.

"You must feel like you own the whole world. Yahweh and Buddha both - at this rate you'll unify the universe too."

"What? What did I do?"

Though she knew Amy was the wronged one, Shura felt strangely irritated.

"Anyway, you'd better recover quickly. When Heaven's army starts moving, the world will end too. Even if you're going to die, you should see your boyfriend first, right?"

Though she couldn't nod, Amy also knew well that recovery was the key priority, just as Shura said.

Seeing no response, only glaring, Shura got more annoyed and threw down her utensils, walking toward the door.

"You do the dishes."

The door slammed shut with a bang.
