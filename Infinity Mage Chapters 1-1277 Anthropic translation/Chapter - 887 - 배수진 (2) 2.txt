Desperate Stand (2)

The special forces that had raided Tess's unit retreated before achieving any significant military gains.

Two days later.

"Urgent report! Twenty million demon troops are moving south in the northwest area!"

"Report! Forty million from the northern mountain range..."

A torrent of dire news.

Iruki watched on the three-dimensional strategic map as the entire demon army moved simultaneously.

'A full-scale war.'

Using the raid from two days ago to confirm the enemy's reaction, he designed perfect movement routes with military strategy.

They intended to devour the central continent.

'This much is good.'

Even from Iruki's position, prepared to fight with mutual destruction in mind, drawing in the enemy was important.

'The problem is time.'

The elemental bombs needed at least ten more days before they could be deployed in actual combat.

'Overdrive.'

Electricity sparked in Iruki's eyes as his thoughts began developing at superhuman speed.

'This method can buy twelve hours.'

Countless strategies went through processes of combination and abandonment as methods to buy time came to mind.

'Up to here is about forty-eight hours...'

Seeing him bleeding from his nose, his executive secretary Aromi bit her lips.

'It must be thinking that transcends human logic.'

Only Iruki could do this.

The more he did so, the more rapidly his brain's durability would decline, but the person himself didn't care.

'I've bought four days. But it's still nowhere near enough.'

He needed to find a way to prevent the demon army from reaching Tormia for at least six more days.

'This is it! With this, five days! And then...'

Lost in thought, Iruki didn't realize that blood was now flowing from his eyes as well.

Ten minutes later, Iruki's eyes shot wide open before he collapsed, vomiting blood.

"General Commander!"

Aromi rushed over with a towel to wipe the blood, but Iruki waved her off and stood up.

"Please reorganize the strategic map."

When the commanders spread out the new strategic map, Iruki walked around frantically, moving units.

Everyone who saw the results he produced trembled with expressions of shock.

"Such a method..."

Iruki suddenly stopped his hand.

"Up to here is seven days."

The commanders swallowed hard.

"What you're seeing now will be exactly the military formation on the seventh day. Through normal methods, this is the limit."

"Then if it's an abnormal method...?"

Iruki's face contorted in pain.

"The method to buy the remaining three days is extremely drastic. In fact, you could probably think of it yourselves."

Everyone examined the map again, and the faces of several quick-thinking individuals turned pale.

"Surely not..."

Iruki moved the large army.

"We'll deploy all nearby forces to the Kanian Plateau. We can tie them down here for three days."

In other words.

"But General Commander, the Kanian Plateau is terrain disadvantageous to humans. That's why until now..."

The commander who realized fell silent.

"Yes. It will be a difficult battle. The estimated casualties are at least two hundred thousand or more. But if we can't hold them here, the seven days we earned through normal means will be meaningless."

If this strategy came from Iruki's mind, it had to be considered the only method.

'The hardest part is for the General Commander himself.'

Iruki elaborated.

"I think it's a bad strategy. No one wants to fight a disadvantageous battle. But if we can't hold them here, humanity will be completely annihilated by the demons."

"...How about deciding by vote?"

It wasn't a vote meant for opposition.

"No. There will be no vote. The fewer people responsible, the better. That's what the position of General Commander is for."

"But..."

It wasn't Iruki's fault.

If there had been a better method, he would have found that path even if his brain burned up immediately.

"Nothing will change. Just because we'll be fighting a slightly more difficult battle doesn't mean it's not war. I'll devise the best strategy under the premise of buying three days."

Only then did Iruki wipe his face with the towel.

"There will be a detailed strategy meeting in thirty minutes. Please convey this to each department."

Iruki needed rest.

After all the commanders left, Aromi, the only one remaining in place, spoke.

"I think we should vote."

Iruki only smiled.

"No one thinks this is an arbitrary decision. Your thoughts are humanity's thoughts. You don't need to bear this alone."

If she couldn't think like Iruki, she at least wanted to share the responsibility.

"It's not a weight that becomes lighter when shared. And... there's also blame I must take personal responsibility for."

"What do you mean?"

Iruki examined the map.

'I'm sorry.'

Though it was just a model terrain, he could see the image of someone who would be fighting somewhere on that terrain.

"I'll take all responsibility. In return..."

Iruki opened his heavy mouth.

"May I request one personnel transfer?"

2nd Corps Magic Division.

Corps Commander Garcia personally stepped forward due to urgent orders from Valkyrie Command.

All officers above battalion commander rank had gathered, and Amy also took a seat at the far end.

"For the next seven days, the 2nd Corps will make a rapid march to the Kanian Plateau. Minor skirmishes may be omitted."

The pens of the note-taking commanders suddenly stopped.

"Did you say the Kanian Plateau?"

"I just said that. Not paying attention? And you call yourself a brigade commander?"

"I apologize! But the Kanian Plateau is not under 2nd Corps jurisdiction, and strategically..."

Reading the killing intent in Garcia's eyes, the brigade commander shut his mouth and straightened his posture.

A cold silence flowed.

"...What are you trying to say?"

"Nothing! I'll correct myself!"

Though military discipline was solemn, the same thought was flowing through all the officers' minds.

'It's a desperate stand.'

It was impossible to read Command's exact intentions from the field, but this much was certain.

'They need lives to throw away. A lot of them.'

Amy wasn't afraid.

'Iruki isn't someone who would easily sacrifice our forces. Thinking conversely, it means there's a chance for reversal.'

A strategy for humanity to win had emerged.

"I know what you're thinking," Garcia said.

"Fighting only winning wars doesn't make you a soldier. That makes you a mercenary. To a soldier, life is another form of combat strength. We're not going to die. We're going to fight. If there's anyone who cannot accept this, speak up right here, right now."

No one raised their hand.

"Issue orders to each unit. After lunch, immediately form large formation. Don't miss it. This is a rapid march."

"Yes!"

As the officers filed out in order, Garcia looked back at Amy.

"6th Battalion Commander of the Magic Division."

"Yes! Lieutenant Colonel Amy Karmis!"

"You stay behind for a moment."

Even as teacher and student, requesting a private meeting in a military conference room was unusual.

"Understood!"

Even after everyone left, when there were still no words, Amy, sitting at the far end, turned her head.

"Do you have something to say separately?"

"Mm, there was a personnel transfer request for you from above. When you return to the battalion, pack your things."

"What? A personnel transfer?"

Garcia nodded.

"As of this moment, you're no longer part of the Magic Division but belong to the Tormia Capital Defense Command. Spatial teleportation magic circles have been authorized, so jump to Bashka."

'Tormia?'

Amy, who had been blinking for a moment, slammed the table as shame surged rapidly.

"What are you saying right now!"

Though it wasn't behavior acceptable before a corps commander, Garcia understood her.

"When all units are leaving for dangerous missions, why am I the only one being transferred to the rear? What's the reason?"

"The content from above is this: Highly evaluating Amy Karmis's unit training abilities..."

"Master!"

Amy shouted loudly.

Garcia spoke in a lower voice than before.

"Among the high-ranking officials of the Holy War, there seems to be someone who doesn't want you to die."

Amy thought of one person.

'Iruki!'

Her teeth ground audibly.

"I cannot accept this! Pulling troops to the rear like this is favoritism and overreach!"

"It could be, or it might not be," Garcia flipped his hand.

"It doesn't matter. You're a capable talent. The judgment that they don't want to waste you like this is also fully understandable."

"But why me! There are plenty of people in the 2nd Corps who are better than me!"

"Even if you tell me... Don't you know the answer yourself?"

"I refuse orders! I won't leave! I'll lead the 6th Battalion on the march!"

"I won't allow that," Garcia said with cold eyes.

"Orders don't distinguish between life and death. Just as being a soldier means following orders to die, this time is the same. I cannot tolerate a mere battalion commander going against the chain of command."

"Master, are you telling me to become a coward? What should I say to my subordinates? That I'm going to run away, so they should enthusiastically charge toward death?"

"That's also your burden to bear. What I want to tell you is to quickly return to Bashka. That's an order."

Amy, who had been trembling while clenching both fists, turned around quickly.

"I'll come back."

Garcia said nothing.

While the troops were eating lunch, Amy came outside with a backpack slung over her shoulder.

Though she didn't show it outwardly, their gazes hurt Amy more than arrows.

The subordinates who had put down their utensils saluted.

"Are you leaving now?"

"I'm not leaving, I just have some business in Tormia so I'm going and coming back. I'll return soon, so keep the unit in good order."

The subordinates smiled, but no one would think she was sincere.

"Don't worry. We learned from you, Commander, so we should be able to manage well."

It was something said because they heard she had been transferred as a training officer for the Capital Defense Command.

"Right. I'm counting on you."

Since she wanted to show through actions rather than words, Amy didn't make excuses and turned around.

On her way out of the unit, she heard the soldiers' voices.

"Did you hear? That officer is the only one in the entire corps who got assigned to the rear? And as a training officer at that."

"Tch! Some people are heading into death, while others will be flirting with young guys in comfortable places. This is why people need strong connections."

The fact that Amy was the lover of one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower was now an open secret.

"Honestly, I understand. You know how cruel those demons are, right? Plus it's a battle with almost no chance of winning - if you were in that position, would you want to send your lover?"

"Who's saying otherwise? If that's the case, don't jump into the battlefield in the first place. Going back and forth like this just lowers morale."

Hearing their words, Amy's face flushed uncontrollably red.

'Iruki, you bastard!'

The reason Amy was obediently leaving the unit wasn't just because she received orders.

'I sincerely hope it's not you.'

It wasn't a situation where she could definitively say it was Iruki.

'But if it is you, you'll have to convince me by any means necessary. If you can't do that...'

Amy's red eyes blazed.

'You'll learn exactly what insubordination means.'

The period for rapid march was seven days.

To rejoin the unit again, Amy ran quickly toward the spatial teleportation magic circle.
