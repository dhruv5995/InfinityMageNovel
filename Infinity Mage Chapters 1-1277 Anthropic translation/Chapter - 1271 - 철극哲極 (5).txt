**Iron Pole (5)**

The Terraforce Supreme Court.

The Chief Justice had already left, but the justices who refused to bend their will remained.

"This is too hasty! The battle between good and evil isn't over! Isn't Ultimate Good still remaining?"

The reason Terraforce quickly confirmed evil's victory was because of the universe's fate.

"If we drag this out any longer, the universe will truly close! Justice, is that what you desire?"

"That hasn't happened yet. The universe's judges must think based on the present."

"Look at that present. What remains for humanity? No users can survive on this land. Civilization has vanished, and resources and life forms have gone extinct!"

Only suffering remains.

"Objection! I formally appeal!"

"There's no time for that! All executors shall carry out the Supreme Court's final judgment! Those who disobey will be detained!"

The court doors opened and beings equipped with plasma swords in both hands poured in.

"Justice! Will you really do this!"

Appealing the Supreme Court's judgment was an unprecedented event in Terraforce history.

"...What choice do we have?"

Even with standards transcending humans, they hadn't reached the 11th sense.

"We're following the great principle of Terraforce established by the Creator. We're trying to maintain balance."

They too were God's creations.

As silence flowed, the executors surrounded the opposition justices in a circle.

"Detention."

The Prison of Balance.

They all disappeared into a space that isolates anything contrary to the universe's balance.

A dust storm like burning fire blew over the land that had become ash.

"Huff. Huff."

Cutting through that grayish curtain, a woman with cloth covering her nose and mouth walked forward.

The last guardian of good, Miro.

"Please save me!"

At the sound carried by the wind, she stopped walking as a girl came running.

'A survivor.'

Ninety-nine percent of humanity had died, but there should still be some remaining on the surface.

Though not many would be left.

"Hehehehe! Catch her!"

A demon carriage pulled by skeletal horses was hunting the girl.

They could have killed her already, but seemed to be playing with one of their few remaining toys.

"Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara."

As Miro's avatar rose high, the demons in the carriage looked up.

"Huh?"

Above the gray curtain rippling like fabric, the avatar of Avalokiteshvara was looking down at the earth.

"Single Thunder."

Kuuuuuung!

The palm technique fell vertically, crushing the demons along with their carriage into the ground.

The girl moaned with dry lips.

"Ahh."

"Are you okay?"

Whether the person before her was enemy or ally, dream or reality, there was only one thing to say.

"Water. Some water..."

Miro provided water through magic.

Once her thirst was quenched, focus finally returned to the girl's eyes and she began crying sorrowfully.

"Waaaah! Waaaah!"

There was no need to ask what had happened.

"You're fortunate. Do you know where demons are gathered? Any other survivors besides you?"

"There aren't any. I don't even know where I came from. I wanted to die... it was so scary..."

Then the storm wind completely changed and Terraforce ships appeared in the gray sky.

"What now?"

"Ultimate Good."

At the voice heard close by, she turned her head, but only a transparent form flickered.

"The Chief Justice?"

As the stealth was released and the alien being's form appeared, the girl was terrified.

"Eek!"

Miro asked.

"What's going on?"

"The Supreme Court has rendered its judgment. As of this moment, humanity has been determined to have lost to evil in the battle between good and evil."

Looking at the current situation, it was understandable, though not without some sense of injustice.

"Is this your will? You're the Chief Justice."

"I pronounce the sentence, but the judgment follows the three principles of the Terraforce race. It couldn't be helped."

"You couldn't prevent it?"

"I could have bought time. But I thought this was better than fighting there."

If he had struggled in the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice would have also been detained in the Prison of Balance.

"Quick judgment is good, but for what reason?"

"Currently, survivors are attempting to reverse the situation. And this is my personal thought, but..."

After thinking briefly, the Chief Justice spoke.

"It makes sense."

"Of course, the odds aren't high. Rather, if it fails, we won't be able to prevent the universe's destruction. In other words, humanity's failure would lead to the Terraforce race's extinction."

"And yet you'll bet on us?"

"Ultima."

The Chief Justice nodded.

"Terraforce is superior to humanity, but we haven't reached Ultima. I think I may have seen the reason why. Ultima, it seems, isn't achieved through intelligence alone."

Miro savored those words.

"What should I do?"

"Endure."

There wasn't time for long explanations.

"Ultimate Good, you cannot defeat evil alone. Good and evil, emptiness and love are separated from one. The moment either side overwhelms, humanity will lose direction."

"Then how do we win?"

"Winning is also evil's methodology. When all of good, evil, emptiness, and love interlock, humanity will make the final choice. You must endure until then."

Terraforce ships approached from the distance.

"You must not forget that you are Ultimate Good. The moment you cannot hold that position, the balance will tilt rapidly. Love will lose power and evil will rise, and emptiness will win."

Terraforce executors approached, releasing their stealth.

"Let's go."

"...Remember this. Good is a being that stops evil, not one that hates evil."

Their forms disappeared and loud sirens wailed from the sky.

The girl gaped in bewilderment.

"...My goodness."

Plasma flashes were bombarding the surface.

Kukukukukukuku!

Terraforce's attacks striking the planet also reached the underground survivors.

Even in the room where the Ivory Tower residents gathered, heart-shaking vibrations could be felt.

"How hasty."

The 'people playing card games' sat around a round table, dealing cards.

"They want to end the war before the world closes. Not bad. The demons will disappear too."

"But doesn't that mean Terraforce is also predicting emptiness's victory?"

Silence flowed.

"Victory. Is that possible? Good, evil, emptiness, love - since all are ultimate, there's no higher hand."

Like the four patterns of aces.

"Hmm, this is a matter of combination. Good and evil can choose emptiness and love, and emptiness and love can choose good and evil too. The meaning changes completely depending on the combination."

"That's right!"

Goudio slammed the table.

"The winner of this game isn't good, evil, emptiness, or love. They only make hands - the one who chooses is separate."

"...Not four people."

"Right. This was a five-player game from the beginning. What combination will remain? That is the heart. Therefore, the last person we need is... the human player."

Mais grabbed his head.

"Damn! We should have realized when Ms. Minerva bet her entire fortune. That wasn't a variable. It was that kind of game from the start. We were the ones who didn't know the rules."

Of course, Minerva did it unknowingly, but that's precisely why this game was established.

Thunk! Ness stabbed a dagger into the center of the table as if planting an iron pole and said:

"One more person! Anyone, quickly!"

"May I join?"

Even these gambling addicts straightened their expressions as Lampa, a 3-star member of the Ivory Tower, approached.

"Ah, Mr. Lampa."

"I sold even my abilities, so all I have left is money. I think I'm perfect for this."

"Please sit."

Goudio explained the rules.

"We'll each combine our hands. Just bet on who you think will win."

"Hehe."

Lampa laughed.

"That's quite an interesting game."

Syura came.

"Let's begin."

Sirone, who nodded, followed her up the stairs leading to the surface.

"Ah."

Amy's eldest brother Dayan and second brother Ares were waiting for Sirone.

"Hello."

While he didn't know Ares well, this was the first time seeing Dayan since Amy's house.

"Yes, it's been a long time."

Sirone spoke with a stern expression.

"I'm sorry. I couldn't protect her. This time I'll definitely save Amy..."

"Don't overdo it."

"Pardon?"

"I don't know much about time or the universe. But this much is certain. You're not going to retrieve a lost object. You're going to meet someone who's alive."

"My sister is simply fighting her own battle. So whatever the outcome..."

Dayan bowed his head and said:

"I hope you'll respect the things Amy thought about and the choices Amy made."

Sirone thought.

'As expected...'

It was the Karmis family.

"Yes. I'll fight with everything I have."

Before a journey that staked his entire life, Dayan's words surprisingly relieved the tension.

Ares winked and gave a thumbs up, and Sirone finally arrived at the surface.

The outside world he saw for the first time after regaining consciousness was far more severe than he had imagined.

No, there was nothing at all.

"This way."

A man with horns on his forehead was guarding the altar that remained in the destroyed state Nane had left it.

"Huama."

Fourth in the Council of Ten, Huama (Vajra Yaksha).

He had been guarding the altar since Veron's passing, waiting for this day.

"Syura, you're late."

"How's the situation?"

"Not good. I can hear demon roars, and strange flying objects are floating in the sky."

He glared fiercely at Yahweh's face, then gestured with his chin and turned toward the entrance.

"Come in."

Uorin and Kido had already arrived.

"Kido."

Knowing what it meant that they had come together, Sirone felt even sadder.

Syura explained.

"The entire radius around the altar is an iron pole zone, but we chose this place to block external forces. Yahweh, while you repeat the past, we'll protect Uorin and Kido."

More precisely, their abilities.

"This place won't last long against the Earth Annihilation Wave anyway. The resistance will defend it to the end, but..."

It meant they weren't in a comfortable position.

"I understand."

Sirone went to Kido.

"I'm sorry. I'm always only receiving help from you. What I can do for you is so little..."

"That's not true."

Kido shook his head.

"Having something you want to devote your entire life to is truly happiness. Right?"

There was a time when only eating and reproduction mattered.

"I received a lot."

Even if it was endless thirst.

"Thank you."

It was a wonderful life.

"Ki..."

Feeling like tears would burst out, Sirone stopped speaking and pulled the small goblin into a tight embrace.

Kido smiled and said:

"We're friends, right?"

Sirone nodded repeatedly, and Kido, gently pushing him away, cleared the path.

Uorin was waiting.

"Have a safe trip."

Her eyes were somewhat hollow, but kindness dwelt there instead of the former venom.

"Yeah."

He felt he owed many debts.

'Mutual action.'

Ultimately, humans are weak beings who can only live by depending on each other.

"I'll be back."

But he wouldn't depend on God.

'Tachyon.'

Sirone too was planting one thought in this universe with everything he had.

'I will definitely change it.'

The future.

His consciousness, dissolved into imaginary particles, leaped beyond spacetime and disappeared into the realm of infinite nothingness.
