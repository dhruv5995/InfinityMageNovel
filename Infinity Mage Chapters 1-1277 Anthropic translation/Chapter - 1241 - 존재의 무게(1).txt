The Weight of Existence (1)

While processing the information about the apocalypse, the leaders of each nation harbored the same question.

'If Maya must be killed... how far does the method of killing extend?'

'What if the assassin is a spy from a specific country? Or what if indirect murder occurs in the chaos?'

With ambiguous criteria, most countries believed that killing by sword would be most accurate, but...

'A crossbow archer.'

The Iron Kingdom, originally destined to become the world's leading nation, made an extreme move.

Kaiden was cautious.

'Why is he doing that? It's dangerous. Why isn't anyone stopping him? Am I the only one watching?'

Fermi thought:

'If I hadn't obtained information about the future, Shirone wouldn't have stopped the March of Benevolence.'

By now, the audience would have been swept up in the waves of benevolence, and in that chaos, it would be the Iron Kingdom killing Maya.

Fermi also thought:

'But I knew, and then the Iron Kingdom knew. The Iron Kingdom won't kill Maya.'

There wouldn't be just one or two who felt something was off about the prophecy of killing Maya and becoming the world's leading nation.

'And now all nations know the information.'

If retreating means defeat, Iron would be considering both scenarios.

'Since Shirone stopped the wave of benevolence, naturally Iron will try to kill Maya...'

Because Iron is trying to kill Maya:

'Kaiden will break free.'

This was the future Fermi had envisioned when he disclosed the apocalypse information.

Kaiden hesitated.

'It seems like only I know. No, are they just watching even though they know? What kind of event is this?'

Though one couldn't blame the fear of those who don't know the future, his right hand didn't hesitate.

"Gah!"

As the demonic sword technique activated, sharp air pressure cleanly severed the crossbow archer's neck.

'He really killed him.'

He might not have been an assassin, but even so, his right hand would have moved anyway.

"Kaiden?"

As the applause stopped, Maya looked back at the stage with a bewildered expression.

Then screams erupted.

"Kyaa! A person died! What's going on?"

El Kiana shouted:

"What are you doing? Murderer! What are the guards doing? Quickly, that person..."

She froze when she turned around.

"Huh?"

Hitmen from each nation had all come up, drawing their respective weapons and charging forward.

"Move aside!"

"Ah, ahh."

El Kiana truly wanted to move aside, but couldn't budge even a finger.

Seeing the hitman's eyes turn coldly, she instinctively knew even in that split second:

'Am I going to die?'

Just as the blade was about to strike her neck, Reina wrapped her arms around her waist and rolled across the stage.

"Idiot! Run away quickly!"

"Hik!"

As El Kiana ran toward the exit, Reina surveyed the stage that had become a battlefield.

'Was this what Lai mentioned? But why are they targeting us? No, they're targeting...'

The crossbow archer's position suddenly came to mind.

"Maya!"

The moment she shouted, assassins from each nation surrounded Maya and swung their swords.

'We must kill her first no matter what.'

"Hiyaaaa!"

At that moment, along with Kaiden's battle cry, a tornado arose where Maya stood.

When Maya, who had squeezed her eyes shut, lifted one eyelid, she saw Kaiden's broad back.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah. Who are these people?"

"I don't know either, why they're targeting you. Just a moment ago..."

They were clapping with tears in their eyes.

"A demon swordsman?"

A man holding two daggers in reverse grip spoke.

"Somewhat clumsy." Though they were undoubtedly the best hitmen, the reason Kaiden kept his mouth shut lay elsewhere.

'The fate of the Southern Cross has weakened.' He instinctively knew that the tiresome fate that had been following him had disappeared.

The reason he could still use demonic sword techniques was because of his right arm acting on its own.

'It's like fighting with one arm. And I can't even control it.'

Kaiden decided on the method to protect Maya in this situation.

"Maya, run away."

Though the enemies were also listening:

"I can't win." Discarding his pride and honestly confessing was the only way to make Maya move.

"Kaiden..."

"Go quickly! Don't annoy me!" Since he would never say such things, Maya held back tears and cast instant movement.

"Chase her!"

The hitman moved and Kaiden blocked the way.

"Hiyaaaa!"

He put strength into his battle cry, but in reality, there wasn't much else he could do.

'It's me anyway. I'm the one moving.'

He just didn't realize it.

'Please...'

That he loved Maya far more than he thought.

As Lightning Impact's blue electricity struck down on the stage, chain explosions occurred.

The hitmen, realizing the sudden increase in power, finally showed serious expressions.

'If we delay, we'll lose her.'

But if they dealt with Kaiden, hitmen from other countries would snatch the target first.

"Let's work together."

Since they prioritized situational judgment, negotiations were quick.

"Kill him first, then compete again. How about it?"

Since there were no amateurs, the hitmen expressed their agreement by turning to look at Kaiden.

Kaiden rejoiced inwardly.

'Good.'

The power of demonic sword techniques remained, but his body except for his right arm had to move with reason.

'Everyone just needs to attack me. Then while I die, Maya can escape.'

He sincerely prayed.

"Why don't you know?" Seiel asked.

"You don't fight battles you can't win. Where in the world is there something even God doesn't know?"

"That's the key."

Fermi turned from the window.

"Because even God doesn't know, no one knows. No one in this universe can know."

What Kaiden would do.

"But the problem is..."

When Fermi checked before, Kaiden's prison break only applied to his right arm.

"It's not the human itself. It doesn't mean only the right hand. True prison break... is only possible when one completely escapes the prison of flesh."

"The prison of flesh."

"Right."

Fermi smiled bitterly.

"He doesn't know."

Kaiden was unnerved.

'What the hell?'

His right arm was exquisitely blocking the attacks of 12 top hitmen.

'This arm, what exactly is it?'

Even though it was attached to his body, he couldn't control it, so it didn't feel like his own.

The hitmen's expressions also gradually soured.

"Not bad."

They, who prided themselves on ultra-fast assassination abilities, had been unable to settle the match for 3 minutes already.

'Is he a sword genius? No, it's strange. I've never seen such swordsmanship. It's unpredictable.'

Unlike the hitmen acknowledging Kaiden, he himself felt uncomfortable.

'Damn it!'

It felt like being enslaved by a body part.

'No. I'm definitely the one moving. It's not like my hand has eyes...'

He was clearly reacting through information his own two eyes were receiving.

'But.'

Kaiden made a tearful expression.

'Why don't I understand?'

Since it was moving through his brain, if his right arm could do it, he should be able to do it too.

'Whatever it is, it's inside me. I'm avoiding it. Desperately running away...'

The fate of the Southern Cross.

Even if the laws had changed, Kaiden's heart still remained in that place.

'Damn it.'

He had hated it so much.

'I don't care about magic or swordsmanship. What I wanted was to be a painter. I wanted to draw the best Maya!'

At that moment, a hitman's dagger sliced past the back of Kaiden's right thigh.

"Grgh!"

"...Got the hang of it."

This guy, it's only his right arm.

The moment Maya exited, she froze.

El Kiana was dangling with both legs in the air, caught in Pope Constantine's grasp.

"Ma, Maya! Save me!"

At her desperate expression, just as Maya took her first step, her gaze collided with Constantine's.

'This person... isn't human.'

It felt like her breath stopped.

"Interesting. Both you and this woman. Does that mean there's nothing you particularly want to change?"

How could one live without regrets?

But since all those experiences had created her current song, she was grateful for the present.

"It doesn't matter."

Maya appearing before her now was also a result according to God's will.

"Die."

The moment light shot from Constantine's hand, El Kiana kicked Maya away.

The divine power, originally meant to be demon-breaking ability, barely grazed Maya's bangs.

El Kiana shouted:

"Run away!"

Maya, who had fallen on her bottom, found herself asking without knowing why:

"...Why?"

Though not particularly evil-natured, she wasn't someone who would help others while being captured herself.

'Right. Why did I do that?' Even she found it puzzling.

'I really hate her. She's sickeningly good, annoying, and even stole my part...'

El Kiana said:

"Kill me instead. That girl can't die, she's the protagonist of the Holy War finale performance."

Do you even know what that means?

"The world's greatest... diva." If sound carries both heart and information simultaneously, her voice is the ultimate wave.

Maya's eyes welled up with tears.

"El..."

The Pope interrupted:

"Diva?"

And he stepped toward Maya.

"Songs that don't praise God are merely heretical magic."

"Kaiden!"

Kaiden, who had been swinging his right arm while kneeling on one knee, heard Maya's voice.

"Maya!"

El Kiana and Maya were floating on either side of the Pope, who was emanating divine light.

"Behold everyone! God's proof! His power! Corrupt humans! Now God's era shall begin!"

The kings of each nation had left, but key officials monitoring the situation remained.

'That's the Pope? He's gone mad.'

Meanwhile, Albino realized what had come to pass.

'Was this it?'

No matter how much you change the cause, you end up reaching the result God desires.

"Maya dies."

It cannot be prevented by any cause.

"No!"

Kaiden shouted, but now only his right arm remained intact on his body.

"Oh God! Accept my faith!"

As Constantine shouted, fire lit in his eyes and Maya's pupils rolled upward.

"Maya! Maya!"

Kaiden once again cursed his fate.

'Why can't I...'

Have what I want?

"Persistent bastard."

The hitman's attack range now reached his nape, but nothing was visible.

'It's not even a grand wish. I just want to stay by Maya's side. That's all.'

Is that really so?

"I..."

As Maya's body began to convulse, Kaiden gritted his teeth and straightened his knees.

"Truly desire."

Perhaps what he wanted wasn't so modest...

"Maya."

One human's entire heart.

The moment the hitman thrust his final killing blow, Kaiden grasped his sword with both hands.

Demonic Sword Technique:

Flash.

For an instant, geometric trajectories drawn in light brilliantly appeared on the stage.

"What...!"

At a speed that allowed no reaction, the hitmen's bodies separated into multiple pieces.

"Graaah!"

Even the Pope's arms were severed near the elbows, and Maya and El Kiana fell.

Albino's eyes shook with shock.

"How...?"

How could the result change?

"Whooooo."

The afterimage of the flash evaporated, and Kaiden slowly turned around, exhaling deeply.

The Pope staggered backward.

"You, you..."

Omega's core keyword, Cross Kaiden.

"Stay away from Maya."

Breaking out of God's prison.
