Solar War (4)

Eastern Kingdom starting point.

Shirone opened his eyes in the temporary barracks located beneath the 600-meter-high Zeta Plateau.

He was inside a Med Gear, undergoing rapid charging.

'Still, 20 minutes have passed.'

The delay generated here was why there was a death penalty.

When he opened the door and stepped out, the third divisions of numerous guilds were maintaining those who had been revived.

There were three starting points in total, but this one alone had over 100 users.

"Yahweh 2."

The DestructionDemon707 party, who had awakened from their Med Gears almost simultaneously, was approaching.

DeathPrincess's right arm was missing.

"So you died too. I'm sorry. We should have protected you more, but thinking that all users were watching us, we forgot our original mission and got carried away."

'We should have died instead of Yahweh2.'

They were dejected by the fact that a momentary lapse in judgment had led to this result.

"It's okay. If we made a mistake, it means the Western Kingdom made the same mistake too. It's not about who's perfect winning. It's a fight about how quickly you can control variables."

They raised their heads.

"When the Western Kingdom makes two mistakes and the Eastern Kingdom makes only one, that's an advantage in itself. Let's focus on victory. It's not like the Eastern Kingdom is so weak that our absence from the front lines would tip the war." 

Encouraged by Shirone's comfort, the DestructionDemon707 party nodded.

"Yeah. From now on, we won't worry about the broadcast."

The third division of Golden Ring approached with a cart loaded with a pile of supplies and began maintenance.

DeathPrincess's right arm was reattached, and auxiliary items were distributed to the others.

'This is an enormous battle of resources.'

Large guilds had prepared multiple copies of the same parts in anticipation of death penalties.

Armor-piercing rounds and grenades were loaded, and auxiliary charging devices were distributed to each member.

StrongestCodename looked back at Yahweh2, who was receiving explanations from Golden Ring's third division.

'You say it's okay?'

No one is perfect.

In war, which is the totality of relativity, could there be any other words more encouraging than these?

'But these aren't words just anyone can say. Just how many battlefields must one experience... to speak with such confident voice?'

Golden Ring's third division said:

"Orders are to return as quickly as possible. Use boosters when climbing the plateau."

Depending on how you climb the 600-meter height, the total power consumption changes dramatically.

'Is the initial strategy emergency maneuver?' Since the momentum battle wasn't over yet, Shirone also agreed and left the barracks.

"Let's go!"

Dozens of users simultaneously activated their rocket engines and ascended above the plateau.

Yahweh 2. Joining the battlefield.

When he used guild communication, Aegis responded:

It's chaotic combat. If you can't arrive within 7 minutes, it would be better to take a detour and hit the center.

Checking the satellite footage, users from the Western Kingdom's Nairola were gathering.

At their center, he could see Yolga's Son.

'Fighting well.'

Even under the combined attack of Operator and Little Witch, he was skillfully buying time.

'Operator is outside. So tactically, probing Solar Palace would be best.'

The reason Fermi passed the choice to him was because he didn't know Shirone's current condition.

I'm joining up. Going turbo.

A response came shortly after:

Approved.

As Yahweh2's machine increased acceleration, the distance from DestructionDemon707 gradually widened.

"Wow, now he's faster than us."

StrongestCodename chuckled.

"It was going to happen anyway. Let's do what we can do. Win the Solar War."

DeathPrincess said:

"Yeah. Whether we're caught on the broadcast screen or not."

After exchanging glances with each other, they nodded and activated their boosters.

Meanwhile, a familiar codename appeared in front of Shirone, who was heading toward the center of the battlefield.

"You bastard!"

The machine of Bishamonten, a ranker from the Western Kingdom, blocked Shirone's path like an iron wall.

The moment all kinds of firearms spat fire, Shirone desperately threw his body aside.

'Damn, of all times.'

The time Aegis requested was now 3 minutes.

"Kahahaha! What's wrong? You seem to be in a hurry? But you're going to die by my hand..."

Before he could finish speaking, DestructionDemon707 crashed his machine into Bishamonten's side.

With a thud, the large body was pushed back, and StrongestCodename and DeathPrincess joined in with gunfire.

"Yahweh2! Go! We'll handle this!"

"But..."

Even if the three of them attacked together, they were no match for Bishamonten, a Western Kingdom ranker.

DestructionDemon707, clinging to the large body, made eye contact.

"We won't make the same mistake twice. Right?"

Even being a human shield didn't matter.

Shirone, turning forward, withdrew even his lingering gaze.

"Da Vinci."

As his back shoulder opened and output energy, the landscape rushed toward him rapidly.

When he arrived at the target point, over 30 rankers were engaged in fierce combat.

'Operator.'

Shirone ignored them and charged forward.

Aegis had died.

It must have been the 7 minutes she mentioned, and Yolga's Son was facing Operator and Little Witch.

Yahweh2 was caught on the broadcast screen again.

"I've arrived."

As users' attention focused, Little Witch's eyes sharply narrowed.

'I'll catch him.'

Even though it was a simulation, she found it unpleasant for Shirone to die to someone else.

Just as she was charging toward Yahweh2, Yolga's Son grabbed and pulled her wrist.

A contest of output versus output.

"Hngh!"

As she was dragged along, overpowered by the engine's force, a hand with blade-like claws came flying.

Little Witch, who avoided it by tilting her head back, weaponized her left hand to attack Yolga's Son.

Pop pop pop pop pop bang!

Sparks burst, and Yolga's Son, who had created distance, maintained a defensive stance and said:

"Let's show restraint? We're not the protagonists here."

"You..."

Just as Little Witch was about to speak, a terrible roar erupted from where Operator was.

"Collapse."

At the familiar sound, he turned his head to see countless rankers colliding in mid-air.

Yolga's Son smiled bitterly.

"That's going to be tough."

The legendary secret technique that always allowed Operator to survive even in critical situations.

'Well... the one who obtained it is a monster though.'

Black Field was a crafted item.

To collect all the components of the 7-stage process, you'd have to circle the High Gear world dozens of times.

In the place where machine fragments poured down like rain, Operator aimed at Yahweh2.

"I'll finish this for sure."

Having cleared the rankers with Collapse, she was determined to show the difference in skill this time.

Shirone activated the Michelan Gun.

'Everyone is fighting.'

Even though this wasn't reality, the hearts of friends who sacrificed themselves for Shirone were real.

'I'm fighting too.'

For the first time, he felt like he was truly living in this world.

'Therefore.'

Resonance.

Shirone's senses seeped into the arrangement of codes that formed the simulation.

'Therefore.'

I and the world are not different.

As the sphere of light created by the Michelan Gun wavered, the entire landscape began to shake.

Users of the Solar War from both Eastern and Western Kingdoms stopped fighting with surprised expressions.

"Huh? Huh?"

What appeared on the broadcast screen was like a sun.

Floating above Yahweh2's head was a golden orb over 10 meters in diameter.

"Urgh!"

Operator hastily applied the brakes.

'What is that?'

Even she, the original designer of High Gear, had never imagined photons of such size.

When Yahweh2 fired the flash, Operator's AI output attack information:

Projectile level: 879.

Direct trajectory, evasion difficulty defined only by speed - she felt chills.

'Dodge...'

Before the thought could finish, the flash struck directly and the shockwave swept the surrounding area.

Whoooooosh!

The operator meeting room analyzing the scene was quiet.

Someone snapped impatiently:

"What's the number? Speak up."

The lollipop mark lit up.

"2.1 million force."

The atmosphere became even more stifling, and the silence would last much longer than expected.

'It's not an illegal program. But the Michelan Gun shouldn't produce this kind of power. That means it can be used infinitely.'

It was clearly balance-breaking.

'Should we take emergency measures?'

If the outcome of the Solar War was decided by a single Michelan Gun, users would complain.

'But on the other hand...'

If they patched during the Solar War, wouldn't that also cause problems later?

"Let's observe for now."

The gear mark spoke.

"We approved Operator's play to prepare for such unexpected situations."

Where they turned their attention again, a crater was clearly formed.

Solar War users were mesmerized by the screen.

"My goodness..."

Even in footage taken from altitude, the depression was massive enough to be visible to the naked eye.

"Whew."

At its center, Operator knelt on one knee with Black Field planted in the ground.

"I, I blocked it."

What they saw in that split second was the black magnetic field expanding to tremendous size.

Fermi muttered:

"Did she use all remaining output for Collapse?"

Though separate from High Gear's power source, the charging time was much longer than Michelan's.

'Then now is the opportunity.'

Even without Collapse, Operator was still powerful, but at least the win rate was a realistic number.

Eastern Kingdom users shouted:

"Go, Yahweh2! Defeat Operator!"

Carrying those thousand cheers in his heart, Shirone leaped into the crater.

Operator's eyes lit up.

'Power is ambiguous.'

Having fought to the end without dying once, her power was lower than other rankers.

Cleanly annihilating enemies and leisurely returning was Operator's signature, but now she faced an enemy with insufficient power.

'19 percent. I can hold out for a while. If I destroy Yahweh2 and go to Solar Palace...'

The next moment, she bit her lower lip and began running toward Solar Palace.

The broadcast screen audience stirred.

"What, what?"

Operator was running away.

Since it was the first sight in High Gear history, the shock they received was enormous.

"Could it be because of her undefeated record?"

Certainly, one loss would be painful.

But running away to protect that one loss was hardly honorable either.

Shirone pursued Operator.

'It's not about honor.'

The reason she protected her undefeated record was...

'Because this place is everything. Because this world she escaped to, fleeing reality, must be real.'

She thought defeat was death itself.

'How much must she have wanted to avoid going back?'

Though Shirone fully understood the wounds Operator had received, he also knew:

Death wasn't something so light.

'Resonance, Da Vinci.'

As the metal wings activated, Yahweh2's machine shot forward like a bullet.

Operator ran with gritted teeth.

'I absolutely won't die.'

This world is reality.

The emotions of parents fighting daily, the guilt of abandoning them - all mere illusions.

'I can't die. The moment I die... I'll realize it.'

Where reality is, who she really is - she knows all of it.

Her heart was impatient.

Even the machine she had boasted was High Gear's strongest couldn't deliver her heart to Solar Palace.

And at that moment, something quickly passed by her side and blocked her path.

'Yahweh 2.'

From rigid thinking, Black Field swung down, and Shirone's machine leaped over the code.

'Double jump?'

Striking far to come close.

Shirone, who avoided Black Field by a millimeter gap, simultaneously activated Raphael and Da Vinci.

Crash!

Yahweh2's fist shot like a rocket and penetrated Operator's chest head-on.

"Kuk..."

Her expression was so terrified it couldn't be considered simulation.

As the entire continent fell into silence, Shirone spoke with his fist still thrust in:

"Operator."

Her two eyes slowly moved.

"Now it's 1 win, 1 loss."

The moment she saw Yahweh2 smiling, her broken High Gear began beating rapidly.

Thump, thump.
