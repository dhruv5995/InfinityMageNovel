[767] Breaking the Precept (2)

South Almond Republic.

Almareta's expression as she attended the state council meeting was surprisingly flushed with excitement.

'Is unification finally coming?'

According to intelligence from their spies, Igor was already dead and the capital Pashia had been liberated just a few hours ago.

'How could such a thing happen...?'

It was a situation that inevitably raised questions, but faced with the hope of ending the long war, rational thinking had vanished.

The ministers waiting for the President had also heard news of the liberation through their respective channels, but few knew the precise details.

"Can we really trust this information? There are many strange aspects to it. Though I suppose we won't suffer any losses."

Among the countries that had avoided demon invasion, only a handful existed worldwide, but for the ministers, even war had been profitable.

'Since it makes us a lot of money.'

Citizens facing death at their doorstep found no reason to oppose the parliament's tax increase proposals.

"Only 1 out of 400 spies sent north has reported news of liberation. Aren't we getting too excited?"

The fact that only Jaycee had survived meant that no one could escape the demons' surveillance.

"He's a trustworthy person. His skills are outstanding and his patriotism runs deep. Igor's death is indeed fact."

The Interior Minister looked toward the Defense Minister and asked.

"Just what exactly happened?"

Just then, Almareta entered.

"I'll explain."

As the ministers rose, she gestured for them to sit and walked up to the podium.

"North Almond's liberation is indeed fact."

"Do you have grounds to be so certain?"

"Because Igor died long ago."

The meeting room stirred with murmurs.

"To get straight to the point, the core force that led this incident was neither the resistance nor anarchists, but the Ivory Tower."

Sighs leaked out from among the ministers.

"I'll give the briefing."

As the Defense Minister rose from his seat and walked to the podium, Almareta stepped aside.

A briefing lasting about 30 minutes followed.

"...Currently, the number of demons residing in the capital is estimated to be in the single digits, and the 2 Stars appear to have departed to seal the altar."

Shadows fell across the ministers' faces.

"In just one day... the two of them liberated Pashia alone?"

"Monsters."

Just what kind of humans were these so-called Stars of the Ivory Tower?

"Thank you for the briefing."

As the Defense Minister returned to his seat, President Almareta gripped the podium with her hands and spoke.

"As you all must be guessing, we stand at the most critical crossroads since partition. The north is currently in a state of anarchy. Every minute and second is precious."

The Interior Minister spoke.

"We should immediately dispatch troops to occupy the north. It was our land from the beginning. We cannot hand it over to another country."

Almareta nodded.

"I share that sentiment. However, if we act unilaterally, the Ivory Tower will intervene. We must reach mutual agreement."

Though she used the pleasant term "mutual agreement," ministers who had experience dealing with Stars groaned inwardly.

'We'll have to beg on our hands and knees.'

The Foreign Minister spoke.

"Please leave it to me. Even if we have to give them something, I'm confident I can secure our right to interfere in the north."

While it was somewhat inappropriate to say one could "handle" a Star, the Foreign Minister had achieved dramatic agreements with the Ivory Tower before.

"No. This time, I will negotiate personally."

"You, Madam President?"

Though there would be no choice if the Stars demanded it, usually a nation's leader wouldn't volunteer to suffer humiliation.

"Just what kind of Stars are they? Do we know them?"

"That's... classified information."

Even if they were Stars of the Ivory Tower, they had once been citizens and mages belonging to specific nations.

Revealing their identities beforehand in a meeting of ministers wasn't good for the country in any case.

The Foreign Minister spoke with the wisdom of experience.

"Still, shouldn't we know roughly what we're dealing with to prepare to receive our guests? How many stars do they have?"

According to his theory, the Stars of the Ivory Tower had slightly different tendencies depending on their number of stars.

"The number of stars is 10."

"10 stars..."

The Foreign Minister, who had been rolling his eyes while searching his memory, frowned and tilted his head.

"Wait a moment. If there are two people, how can there be 10 stars..."

The Foreign Minister's face froze like a mounted specimen.

"10?"

The basic arithmetic that 5 plus 5 equals 10 passed through their minds, and all the ministers gulped.

"Now you roughly understand, don't you?"

As the ministers slowly turned their heads, Almareta gestured toward the door with her chin.

"What are you doing? Why aren't you moving quickly?"

Sirone and Minerva crossed South Almond's airspace rapidly aboard their jet.

"That's the capital, Gardan."

It was a massive city built in the middle of the grasslands.

"It's bigger than Bashka."

"It's a republic, after all. Even accounting for social costs, their development speed is much faster than kingdoms. Their defense capabilities are far superior too."

Though Tormia was also among the great powers, South Almond's defense capabilities were known to rival the Seven Royal Stars.

"Still, I like Tormia better."

"Hehe, who's saying otherwise?"

While nations held no meaning for Stars of the Ivory Tower, Sirone's display of humanity after regaining it wasn't unpleasant.

"Let's get off at the castle gate."

"It's fine. Stars of the Ivory Tower get free passage through airspace too. And they seem to already know everything?"

Military processions stretched all the way to the government building.

"Is this your first time meeting with a head of state? The soldiers are probably out of their minds right now. Their superiors must be pressuring them like crazy."

"Is there really a need for such grand hospitality?"

"There isn't. They're doing this because they have something to extract from us. Don't get swayed and just do as I tell you."

Moving faster than sound, they crossed the castle walls and arrived at the government building, where an officer shouted at attention.

"Welcome the distinguished guests!"

To the military band's performance, citizens who had been arranged in advance scattered flower petals in a grand welcoming ceremony.

"Ignore it. Just look ahead and walk."

Knowing this wasn't mere goodwill, Sirone also moved forward with a cautious expression.

Ministers, vice-ministers, experts and officials from various departments, commanders wearing general's insignia.

'That person is...'

South Almond's President Almareta, standing against the backdrop of the government building, approached with a humble smile.

"Welcome, distinguished guests. Thank you for visiting the South Almond Republic."

Even with citizens watching, she bowed twice to Sirone and Minerva.

'They've staked everything on this.'

While Minerva wore a meaningful smile, Sirone didn't know how to respond.

"Uh, I'm affiliated with the Ivory Tower..."

Ignoring the President, Minerva looked toward a man in his early 50s standing to the side.

"Long time no see, kid."

South Almond's Magic Association Chairman, Ruda Garcia, nodded slightly in response.

"It's been a while."

A certified First-Class Grand Mage who had mastered flame magic to its limits, his fireball was said to be able to burn down an entire village.

"Again."

Minerva curved her index finger downward as if telling him to bow deeper.

"..."

Garcia didn't move.

"Again."

"This is a welcoming ceremony we prepared with our utmost effort. Let's not engage in behavior that diminishes mutual dignity."

From the moment Sirone first saw Garcia, he had felt it.

'This person is strong.'

Even compared to Tormia's Magic Association Chairman Rufist, his presence was in no way inferior.

"Again. This is your last chance."

Almareta, having completely forgotten being ignored, sent troubled glances.

'Just do it. You know this person's personality.'

Garcia bowed 90 degrees at the waist.

"It's been a while, Star of the Ivory Tower."

Minerva, who had been looking down at him with cold eyes, pointed at Sirone with her chin.

"There's one more."

Garcia showed no emotion.

"It's my first time meeting you. I'm Association Chairman Garcia."

"Yes. I'm Aryan Sirone."

Prolonging the conversation would only sour moods.

"Oh my, you're the association chairman? You've grown so much. It feels like yesterday you were trembling in front of me."

Minerva's age was suddenly felt anew.

"I wasn't trembling."

"Sirone, remember this guy's name well. He's the world's best in flame magic."

The fact that Minerva, who hadn't even glanced at the President, personally introduced him lent credibility.

The face of Almareta, who had guided the two to the meeting room, changed to one of surprising coldness.

"May I speak directly to the point?"

"What kind of directness is it if you're asking others first? Anyway, go ahead. I've seen enough of the President's sincerity."

This was the speaking right they had gained by bowing their heads.

"Please give us governing rights over the north. We will of course manage the altar and will not do anything to draw criticism from other nations."

What the republic wanted was, after all, money.

"What do you think, Sirone?"

While leaving it to South Almond would be convenient, he had been thinking it would be better for the Holy See to manage the altar.

"It's not perfectly sealed. Are you confident it will never be breached?"

"Presidents don't use the word 'never.' However, I take pride in South Almond's defense capabilities."

Almareta glanced around nervously, then pulled out a box from under the table and offered it.

"And this is a small token."

Sirone's expression immediately crumpled.

"This kind of approach..."

But before he could finish speaking, Minerva took the box and opened the lid.

Contrary to expectations of gold and jewels, it contained bonds with amounts written where the national seal was stamped.

"I can see you're not joking."

"It's one-tenth of South Almond's national budget. Please entrust it to me. I'm confident I can satisfy the Ivory Tower."

Sirone's eyes grew hollow.

'One-tenth of the national budget? This isn't lobbying level. I absolutely cannot accept this.'

Minerva, who had been fingering the bonds, tossed them aside.

"This approach is problematic."

'As expected. Since Minerva is also a Star of the Ivory Tower.'

Just as he was feeling ashamed for having doubted her momentarily, shocking words reached his ears.

"Half the national budget. Nothing less will do."

At first, he doubted his ears.

The amount they had initially proposed—one-tenth—was already such that one person wouldn't need that much money in a lifetime.

'...I see.'

Almareta looked at Sirone with a tearful expression.

"That's too excessive a demand. How could we run the government if you take half the budget?"

"What do you think?"

Sirone nodded and spoke.

"If it's half, I'll agree too."

"..."

Once again, like a lie, emotion quickly drained from Almareta's earnest gaze.

"Twenty-five percent. I cannot concede more than that."

"We said fifty percent."

"Thirty percent. If it's more than that, our nation would rather give up governing rights to North Almond."

"Forty percent. Let's end it here. I'll offer two methods. Pay ten percent annually over four years, or transfer government bonds now."

"...We'll give it to you now."

Minerva shrugged her shoulders and laughed.

"You're quite a decent president."

She was betting that during the four years of paying ten percent annually, other nations would pay even more than that amount.

But if they ended the contract now, the Ivory Tower would never interfere again.

'Conversely speaking...'

It meant that gaining governing rights over North Almond was far more profitable even after giving forty percent of one year's budget.

'Still, this way South Almond won't run wild. It's better to end it at this level.'

What was surprising was that Sirone had caught on to her intentions quite quickly.

'I thought he was enlightened, but he's unexpectedly practical.'

Forty percent of a nation's budget was an amount Minerva couldn't exhaust even if she spent money her entire life.

Sirone had realized it wasn't about the money, but that South Almond's budget needed to be cut.

'They already have military power rivaling the Seven Royal Stars. If they absorb North Almond, it'll become another seed of conflict.'

Almareta offered newly written bonds.

"Since you are both at the highest positions in the Ivory Tower, I trust there will be no complications from this."

An amount equivalent to forty percent of the national budget was written on them.
