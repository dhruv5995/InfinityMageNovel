[682]献花 (2)

The interior of the Seonghwa, which absorbs photons to sustain itself, is compartmentalized by thick iron membranes like the cells of actual plants.

This is because the substance called light-mineral itself mimics the genetic mechanisms of living organisms, with cells growing larger or differentiating as growth progresses.

Furthermore, just as human cells divide repeatedly to form hearts, livers, nerves, and bones, it creates complex and precise mechanisms on its own, making it a machine that far transcends human engineering knowledge.

Therefore, it was no surprise that the door opened automatically when Lupist arrived at the Seonghwa's control room.

Inside the hexagonal space spanning 40 pyeong, countless wires, display devices, and computational systems that enabled highly precise interception were busily operating.

Lupist ignored the ten Shadow People guarding Plarino and walked forward.

"It's been a while, Plarino."

They had met ten years ago at a negotiation table arranged through secret channels in the royal castle of Tormia.

"Yes, Lupist."

Plarino's expression was cold.

"Things don't go as one wishes. I had hoped you, at least, wouldn't become the Magic Association President."

Lupist, who could be called the kingdom's representative far-right figure, seizing the center of the kingdom's power was tantamount to disaster for Radum's sub-species.

"Things in the world... That's a misleading way to put it. Because someone fails, someone else succeeds, doesn't it?"

It wasn't coincidence that Mikea Gaold, classified as a key figure of the left wing, had risen to the position of Association President despite politicians' concerns.

At that time, he was devoted to the Heaven Project, and domestic terrorism problems based in Radum were merely secondary matters.

"So you're determined to pluck the flower?"

The thought of handing over the Seonghwa she had cultivated for decades entirely to the kingdom made Plarino's stomach burn.

"No. This thing's worth too much to just pluck carelessly."

Lupist spread his Spirit Zone and drew up his Steel Battery.

"I need to pull it out by the roots."

"Protect the Minister!"

The Shadow People unit, composed of women, scattered to places where shadows existed.

The gray skin of Shadow People becomes transparent in darkness, making them excellent for VIP security.

The fact that female physical abilities don't fall short compared to males was also suitable for protecting the psychology of the Hwa tribe.

'Shadow Arts.'

Shadows expanded like water, filling the room.

With power that could swallow even Shining magic, light disappeared, and in perfect darkness, several Shadow People approached Lupist.

'The best security is eliminating risk factors.'

Literally assassination.

Their movements, boasting perfect equalizing that synchronized completely with darkness, were difficult to capture even with the synesthesia of Spirit Zone.

'Got him!'

Four swords silently sliced through Lupist's body.

'Nothing's caught?'

The sensation at their fingertips disappeared, and their nervous systems departed from control as if blocks were separating.

"Are you stupid or something?"

The corpses of Shadow People, split into dozens of pieces, rolled across the floor.

"What did you think would happen, charging at a sword?"

Iron is something to avoid, not attack.

'That bastard...!'

The Shadow People hiding in shadows shed tears of blood at their comrades' deaths, but never revealed their presence.

While technically excellent, their patience wasn't superhuman.

"I'll kill you!"

Just as the remaining Shadow People were about to charge, prepared to die, Plarino raised her hand and shouted.

"Stop!"

"Minister! But...!"

"Lupist isn't an easy opponent. Leave him to me."

Though she showed strength, she couldn't guarantee how long they could hold out against the merciless Steel Mage.

"Hand over control of the Seonghwa."

"Let me make a proposal. Provide a place where Radum's sub-species can live. Then I'll abandon the interception."

"No."

Setting up separate facilities for sub-species in the Kingdom of Tormia would result in significant losses.

'Jane will handle it.'

Lupist trusted Jane's abilities.

"Even when there's a way to resolve this peacefully, you insist on bloodshed?"

"Peace?"

When Lupist opened his palm, metallic substances sharp as blades rotated like a storm.

"Do you think you're human?"

As he swung his arm, gray metal spread like mercury in a membrane, aiming for Plarino's neck.

"Minister!"

A Shadow Person embraced her and fell to the floor, while fragments split in mid-air and spread explosively, penetrating into the darkness.

Following screams, the corpses of the remaining Shadow People revealed themselves outside the shadows.

"How are we different from you!"

Plarino, prostrate on the floor, shouted in a miserable voice.

"We have emotions too, culture, history! We're beings who can love, rejoice, and share sorrow! So why do you only try to exclude us!"

"First, you don't pay taxes."

Lupist resumed walking.

"Second, you don't give birth to humans. Legally, you're not eligible for national registration certificates. While there might be short-term effectiveness in incorporating you into slave labor or public brothels, supporting you from a long-term perspective ultimately becomes a burden on the kingdom. It's financial waste on a different dimension from keeping pet dogs or livestock."

Plarino sobbed.

"Finally, third."

Lupist looked down at her with cold eyes.

"Our proud citizens of Tormia, who pay taxes, produce children, and provide labor, hate you. So just disappear from this world. Humans are comfortable when you're gone."

Plarino's shoulders trembled violently.

"How can you be so cruel? For such trivial reasons... you think it's okay to kill lives?"

"Trivial reasons?"

Lupist kicked Plarino's chin.

"Minister!"

The sole remaining Shadow Person hurriedly supported her.

The moment the Shadow Person saw Plarino's eyes trembling from shock, she gave up on attacking Lupist.

'This is bad. Passive desire is manifesting.'

The Hwa tribe is strong, but being born with aggression is extremely rare, like carnivorous plants.

Even Plarino, who through bloody training could reject others' desires, was merely a single flower before the Magic Association President's authority.

When Lupist approached the energy output device's display and pressed the cancel button, a window requesting a code appeared.

Lupist licked his lips and approached Plarino again, creating a storm of blades.

"I'll start by cutting off your limbs."

"You bastard!"

The last remaining Shadow Person's face was shredded by the blade storm as she leaped up, kicking off the ground, and fell to the side.

"Give me the code if you want to die comfortably. Torture isn't my specialty, but I guarantee you won't last even a minute."

She was terrified beyond reason.

"You know how many Hwa tribe members have been sacrificed."

The Hwa tribe's fragrance filled the room.

"Owned by humans, sold when they got bored, used again by new humans, then withering away from stress-induced madness—that's us. Humans even show compassion to stray dogs! So why won't you extend a helping hand to us!"

"Why should I care about your circumstances?"

Plarino closed her mouth with a sorrowful expression.

"Do you think humans don't have a history of parents having to watch boiling water poured on their children's necks? We didn't get this for free either. People are always full of complaints. Equality is distant, and not everyone can be happy. But even constructing this crude system required countless human sacrifices. Humans created this system solely for human happiness. And now beings who've contributed nothing suddenly appear asking to be included?"

Lupist's attitude, which brooked no emotion, actually made Plarino's heart grow cold again.

"You'll regret this. You'll see what consequences your selfishness brings."

A flower incarnation bloomed from Plarino.

When the bloodline of Violet Tiara, rumored to be the most beautiful among the Hwa tribe, revealed itself, the room felt brighter.

'I should capture her alive if possible.'

Jane would handle it anyway, but just in case, it was better to keep Plarino alive.

'It would be a waste to destroy the Seonghwa too.'

If the control device broke, repair costs would be astronomical.

"Watch closely."

Plarino's incarnation dissolved into particles of light, then emitted intense light like neurons.

"The rage of flowers trampled by humans!"

Incarnation Arts

Small World Creation.

"Jane!"

Aria, suffering from severe infection symptoms, convulsed her upper body.

Through mental resonance connected to Jane, her current state was transmitted directly into her mind as if experiencing it firsthand.

"What's wrong?"

"A vampire! A powerful one!"

Kuan's expression became serious.

If it was powerful enough to overwhelm someone of Jane's caliber, it could only be Raika, a pure-blood vampire in Spectrum's leadership.

"Please go, Kuan! Jane can't display her original abilities."

It was difficult to defeat Raika while mentally resonating with a sick person.

"I can't. My mission is to protect you."

If something happened to Aria after entering the Seonghwa, the code would disappear.

With capital destruction imminent, even if Jane died, Aria had to be protected.

"But! Jane is..."

The guilt was severe since she had chosen the difficult path over the easy one to save Aria.

"If Jane dies, then I'll take you to the Seonghwa."

Kuan spoke coldly, looking back at the Seonghwa and grinding his teeth.

'Please be safe...'

Black smoke raced through the corridor and transformed into human form before Jane's eyes.

Before the form was fully shaped, Raika's palm struck Jane's solar plexus, and the massive impact of shock waves penetrated her body.

"Guh!"

Though her body didn't retreat even a step, it felt as if her life had flown to the universe.

She hit her knee with a thud, swayed as if about to fall forward, then fell backward and hit her head.

"Pointlessly persistent."

Raika clicked his tongue, looking down at Jane, who had died with her eyes open.

Around them, the corpses of subordinate vampires were dissolving into black smoke.

Though not pure-bloods, they possessed fairly powerful souls.

What annoyed him most was being unable to dismiss Jane's skill in wielding seven such vampires through mental domination.

"Anyway, it's finished."

As Raika turned, fluttering his cloak, his form vanished instantly.

...Jane!

Aria's voice permeated the brain of the deceased Jane.

Jane! Jane!

'Mission.'

A faint light of life began to dwell in the dead pupils.

Though her heart wasn't beating, about 20 seconds remained before reaching brain death.

'Association President.'

A belated life review flashed by, and Jane slowly raised her hand.

'For the nation and people...'

Concentrating with a dying brain was remarkable, but it couldn't compare to the realm of self-harm, considered most difficult for mages.

Gathering wind magic at her fingertips, she pierced her abdomen and directly grasped her heart.

'I can't die yet!'

Casting Mental Transcendence, a mental-type magic, strength beyond physical limits activated, contracting her heart.

"Ugh!"

As blood circulated and bodily functions gradually returned, the heart's contractile force wasn't something maintainable with a woman's grip strength.

'I need to regain control of the Seonghwa.'

Feeling her wrist muscles rupture, Jane pressed against the corridor wall and began walking.
