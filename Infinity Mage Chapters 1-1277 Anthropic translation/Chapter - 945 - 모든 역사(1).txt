All History (1)

'That's the place.'

Tess ran through the massive shadows cast by the living flower petals.

Even as she rapidly covered the 300-meter distance, the surrounding living flowers were catching fire from the flashes of light.

Finding the ancient weapon the enemies had stolen was easy.

A group of what appeared to be elite demon soldiers was guarding it in the direction Tess was running.

The security wasn't as tight as expected.

'Father's enemies.'

Though demons made her blood boil, the longer she delayed, the greater the damage to the living flowers would be.

As Tess stomped her foot and generated anti-gravity, her body floated up.

By the time the demons turned their heads, she was already clinging to a pillar of the living flower.

Tess ran vertically up the pillar.

Just as the sounds of battle grew distant, a black swarm came flying from the far sky.

"Caw! Caw!" They were human-faced birds with black feathers.

'This is my limit.'

Realizing this, Tess found the nearest entrance and infiltrated the living flower.

Demons were standing guard inside as well, but not enough to make avoiding their gaze impossible.

After silently eliminating several demons and even hiding their corpses as she climbed up...

"Hiya! Hiya!"

An excited old man's voice was followed by a woman's piercing scream.

"Please forgive me! Please!"

It was the control room.

Moving like a spider across the ceiling, she slowly peeked her face out from above the doorway.

"Puahahaha! This is really fun, isn't it? She really does everything we tell her to!"

Blood vessels bulged in Tess's eyes.

Gustav 4th Squadron's Smodo and Zetaro.

Smodo, who was tormenting the Fire Tribe woman, was a disgusting pervert, while Zetaro, who was surveying the battlefield, didn't even care.

"Smodo, don't get too carried away. You keep missing your attacks."

Given the Fire Tribe's characteristic of feeling most stable when following orders, threats or torture shouldn't have been necessary.

'He's enjoying it.'

Though Tess had also learned numerous torture methods during her spy training, what these men were doing wasn't for extracting information.

The Fire Tribe woman pleaded.

"Just kill me instead. Please..."

"Puahahaha! Zetaro, did you hear that? This woman still thinks she's alive! Hey, should I show you what state you're in with a mirror?"

"Smodo, enough with the operation already..."

Zetaro's eyes widened as he turned his head with a sigh.

"Duck!"

"Huh?"

The moment Smodo looked toward the entrance, Tess's kick struck his jaw.

"Gah!"

Several teeth flew toward the ceiling as Smodo's body flipped backward.

"You damn bastards!"

Pushing aside her surging rage for a moment, Tess checked on the Fire Tribe woman.

"Are you okay? Hey!"

The Fire Tribe woman's head tilted to the side, her eyes rolled back as if she'd already lost consciousness.

'She's dead.'

Zetaro clicked his tongue as he helped Smodo to his feet.

"How unfortunate. Such a young woman, what a pity... I pray for the deceased's peace."

Tess's mind spun.

"...Are you joking?"

Even while feeling the tremendous killing intent on his skin, Zetaro remained calm.

"Is all of this just a game to you people?"

"You."

Smodo, missing teeth, spat while wiping blood.

"Nice body."

Tess was suffocated by irritation.

"You're in the top 1.78 percent of women I've seen. Judging by your weight..."

Before he could finish speaking, Tess's fist spun Smodo's jaw around.

Watching him fall to the floor, Zetaro frowned.

"Always asking for a beating... Gah!"

Tess immediately grabbed Zetaro by the hair and frantically smashed his face against the control room wall.

After just a few impacts, Zetaro's face was covered in blood.

"Bad bastards! Pure evil bastards!"

When Zetaro's body stopped responding, Tess threw his light frame to the floor.

Zetaro collapsed with a thud like a corpse, while Smodo crawled across the floor with his split lips.

"Ow, what kind of woman has such a strong punch? Ahhhhh!"

Tess raised her saber and stabbed his calf.

"Does it hurt?"

With the saber piercing through his calf and driven deep into the floor, she approached Smodo's face.

"Does it hurt? Is this little thing painful? Is that why you're screaming?"

"Ahhhh, ahhhh..."

Even his trembling hands were disgusting.

Tess grabbed his index finger and crushed it.

"You try experiencing the same thing."

She bent the middle of his finger at a right angle in that state.

"Ahhhhh! It hurts! I said it hurts!"

"Yes, that's pain."

Tess broke another finger.

"Ow! Ow, I'm dying! This is elder abuse!"

"Shut up."

After breaking six fingers total on both hands, Smodo lost even the strength to resist and buried his face in the floor, sobbing.

"It hurts. It hurts so much. Please forgive me."

"Forgiveness? Did you show mercy to that woman?"

"I was wrong..."

Tess felt like her heart would burst, but she couldn't even name what emotion it was.

"How is it, experiencing it yourself? Is it fun? Is this fun? Was it so entertaining to mutilate bodies, cause pain, and listen to screams, you bastard!"

A moment of silence passed.

"...Third-rate."

"What?"

Smodo lifted his head, irritation written across his face.

"Doing it for fun is third-rate, you fool."

Tess got goosebumps from his eyes, which showed not an ounce of remorse.

"What are you people... exactly? If it's not even fun, then why do you do such things?"

Smodo grinned, baring his teeth.

"Because we can."

Freedom.

"Smodo, are you in your room?"

Mother's throat always went dry whenever she entered Smodo's room.

Her twelve-year-old son.

He didn't exactly cause trouble, but perhaps the trouble had already occurred in his mind.

"Yes, I'm here. I won't come out."

"I'm not here about that."

Like most parents, Smodo's mother lied as she opened the door.

Just seeing the vertical lines drawn densely across the white walls made her dizzy.

The objects positioned precisely at those coordinates also pained her heart.

"Relatives have come to visit."

Smodo had severe OCD.

From infancy, he could only use the same baby bottle, the length a pencil wore down each day was predetermined, and if books weren't arranged in order on the bookshelf, chaos would ensue.

"Tell them to have a good time. I'll stay here."

'His mind really is exceptional.'

Only for that reason was Smodo still a child worth protecting.

"Sigh. Smodo, how long will you live like this? I know you have severe compulsions. But let's overcome them. You'll become a great person someday. You're always first in exams even though you hardly go to school."

Smodo didn't answer, but she could see he was conflicted.

"Come on, let's go out. Just say hello to the relatives and come back."

"You promise?"

Mother's face brightened.

"Of course, just greetings. Okay?"

When she gently pulled her son's wrist, Smodo pretended to be reluctant as he followed.

On the first floor, Father was chatting with relatives.

"Oh! It's big brother Smodo!"

She could see children of similar age playing tag.

But to Smodo, they were just space and objects moving through that space.

As Smodo came down the stairs, he noticed salt spilled on the snack table.

The children seemed to have knocked over the salt shaker while playing tag.

Smodo stared intently at the table when his aunt called out.

"It's been a while, Smodo. Do you remember Auntie?"

"Yes."

Smodo never forgot the form of objects.

"Except for the new wrinkles around your left eye."

He could list endlessly but held back with effort.

"Hohoho! You're really funny. I heard you're so good at studying?"

Mother casually mentioned.

"Yes. I got first place this time too."

"Oh my, Smodo goes to Gustav Public School, doesn't he? I heard it's a place where only geniuses gather."

"He's still young. Though I do hope he'll become a great person of the Empire..."

Even while listening to the adults' conversation, Smodo's gaze kept shifting to the table.

"Hahaha! Run away! Run away!"

The children ran, making the floor thump.

"Kyaa! I'm caught!"

The salt bounced around.

"To enter Gustav Public School, you need to—"

The sound disappeared, and all attention focused on the salt.

He felt like he was going crazy.

His heart pounded like it would burst and every nerve in his body stood on end.

Thump.

A child kicked the table as they passed by.

"Ahhhhh!"

When the adults turned their heads at Smodo's scream, he was already running over, pushing the child away.

"Smodo!"

The fallen child cried and Mother shouted, but Smodo was on his knees in front of the table, frantically rummaging through the salt.

"Damn it! It's all mixed up!"

The absurd scene made them forget that he'd pushed a child.

"Smodo, what are you doing?"

"All the salt got mixed up. I need to put it back where it was. This was here, and this particle was, yes, here!"

"The salt is..."

Mother asked.

"What about it?"

There was even faint killing intent in her voice.

"Damn it! This needs to be piled up here. I need tweezers."

She knew he had compulsions.

But the sight of her son rummaging through salt wasn't compulsion by normal standards.

'My son isn't crazy.'

Mother said tearfully.

"Smodo, that's just salt. Salt that got spilled."

"That's not right. The size, shape, color—every particle is different."

The moment he finished speaking, Mother approached and turned Smodo's shoulders.

Then she slapped her son's cheek with all her strength.

"What's wrong with you? What are you dissatisfied with!"

She didn't care that the relatives were watching.

"Are you stupid? Are you insane? Why do you live like this! Why do you live this way!"

Smodo moved as Mother shook him.

Even when she hit his cheek, even when she yelled, he didn't resent her.

For someone who had lived his entire life with compulsions, it was a minor problem.

'What am I...'

What filled the child's mind was a fundamental question.

'What world am I living in?'

Whether this was an error, blessing, or curse, he felt trapped within the framework that made up this world.

Tess asked back.

"Because you can... you do it?"

"Right. That's freedom. You broke my fingers too, didn't you? Because you could."

"To say that now..."

Smodo broke his own finger and screamed.

"I can do this too!"

Tess grimaced.

"What's the problem? If this is wrong, then the world shouldn't have been made this way from the beginning! Go complain to whoever made it! I do it because I can, so why are you bitching at me!"

Smodo stood up with his broken-fingered hand on the floor, shrieking in agony.

"Ahhhhh!"

Though the calf muscle pierced by the saber tore, he stood up limping and pulled off his top.

He wasn't wearing anything below the waist anymore.
