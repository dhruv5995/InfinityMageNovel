Smile, Smile (3)

Omega Year 938.

It had already been 1,500 years since Ange Raga had dismantled the Ultima System with the alcohol of Ilhwa.

In heaven, a small number of Gaians led by McClain Giffin were still carrying on their resistance.

Countless giants had advanced to other planets and given birth to new humanity there.

Some of them returned to become the Celestial Race, and the River Clan that Ozent belonged to was one of them.

"Brother."

A woman with clear blue hair grown to her waist, befitting the River Clan, approached Ozent.

"Are you alone again today?"

"Smile."

Though Ozent never showed emotion to anyone in the clan, he would occasionally show a shy smile in front of his younger sister.

"You only practice swordsmanship, so you have no friends even at twenty-two. If a person has no social activities, they become narrow-minded."

"I'm comfortable being alone."

Ozent didn't know his exact age.

Of course, he was also one of the Celestial Race, but his first memory was only of wandering the mountains like a wild dog.

The person who took pity on young Ozent and adopted him was Smile's father, Damian.

"Go back. If father finds out you're here..."

Smile pushed against Ozent's chest.

"Come on! Let's put the annoying talk aside for later and go to the Marang River with me. We can swim after a long time and catch some food too."

If Damian found out, the atmosphere would become strange again, but there was no one in the clan who could break Smile's stubbornness.

"We have to return before sunset."

"I know already."

The Marang River they reached after crossing a small ridge was so wide it could rival the sea.

'Beautiful.'

Ozent liked looking at the river.

"Come on, come on! Should I show off my skills after a long time? Dad won't let me swim these days."

He didn't like the sight of his daughter, who had a wedding arranged, splashing around in the river.

"Well, you're an adult now too... Ugh!"

Ozent's gaze wavered, losing its place to go as she threw off her top.

"What are you doing now?"

"What's wrong with this? Everyone catches fish like this."

Of course, the River Clan was good at swimming and this wasn't the first time he'd seen them catch fish dressed like this.

The problem was that it was Smile, but rather, she couldn't understand Ozent's reaction.

"Even if we're siblings, we're at an age where we should be careful now. I understand why father worries."

"Haha! Brother, really. We used to bathe together when we were young, so what's wrong with this? If I look closely, you have a tendency to obsess over really strange things. That's why people say you're sinister."

"Sinister?"

To the River Clan, Ozent was a timid eccentric who didn't show emotions and only practiced swordsmanship.

'Maybe that's true.'

Showing emotions to others was far too difficult for him.

"So meet some girls and make friends. You practice swordsmanship every day, so you're embarrassed even seeing your sister's body."

Smile gathered her arms to lift up her chest.

"Well, I do have a good figure though."

Then she giggled and laughed.

"Don't make terrible jokes."

Ozent was sad.

'It really feels like we're becoming siblings.'

Bold-natured Smile probably didn't notice the subtle changes working in Ozent's heart.

Perhaps because Ozent was extremely timid, his emotions were thoroughly hidden.

'I'm a coward.'

A complete coward who could neither approach her nor coldly leave.

"Anyway, brother, get ready and come in. I'm going first!"

Smile took a deep breath and entered the river from the low cliff with graceful movements like a fish.

'I hate getting wet.'

Ozent sat down.

He could see Smile swimming vigorously in the river water reflecting the sunlight.

Just watching the river was good enough.

After enjoying swimming for about 30 minutes, Smile began diving in earnest to hunt fish.

Though she had no talent for swordsmanship, no one could match her persistence, so she wouldn't come up above water until she caught one fish.

"Smile, let's go back now."

"Just one more!"

She shouted that and dove again, when the river's current began to change rapidly.

"What's this?"

It was a change that only someone as super-sensitive as Ozent could detect.

Soon after, fins appeared above the current.

'Water dragons?'

They were giant fish weighing over 10 tons, part of the Celestial Race that couldn't exist in heaven's ecosystem.

"Smile! Come out!"

But Smile was already deep underwater.

"Damn it!"

Only when Ozent grabbed his sword and kicked off the cliff did Smile underwater realize it too.

Fish being chased by the water dragons were approaching her in schools.

'I have to get up!'

The moment she came up to the surface with all her strength, what she saw was the giant fish's maw.

"Smile!"

Just before she would have gone into the fish's belly, a severed head starting from the gills shot upward.

"Brother!"

Ozent, who grabbed Smile's hand, used external gravity to fly up into the sky.

Dozens of fish jumped up after them, and shadows fell across their faces.

"Hold tight!"

As he released external gravity in all directions, Ozent's body began to vibrate violently.

At the same time the water dragons attacked, his sword swept like a gale.

"Wooooow!"

Looking at the fresh chunks of meat falling in pieces, Smile gulped.

'Looks delicious.'

Meanwhile, Ozent barely managed to reach the cliff area after running through the air with all his might.

"Haa, haa."

Smile gave a thumbs up.

"Brother, you're the best!"

"You idiot! Did you come to the river without even knowing it was the water dragons' spawning season? Where the hell do you keep your brain?"

"You didn't know either."

"Why should I know that? Anyway, I'm not..."

...part of the River Clan.

But if he said those words, it felt like he would really become nothing...

"Brother, I'm hungry. Let's eat something before we go."

Ozent had no choice but to shut his mouth.

"Sigh, your appetite really..."

They lit a small campfire and skewered the prepared fish on branches, roasting them golden brown.

"It's delicious."

"Since we're already late, eat slowly. You'll get indigestion."

Smile nodded, but her eating speed didn't slow down at all.

"But brother, about earlier. That flying around in the sky thing. Is that swordsmanship too?"

"It's a technique of extracting inertia outside the body. It's quite difficult. But why?"

"Can't you teach me that too?"

Ozent burst into laughter.

"You? When you haven't even mastered basic physical techniques, fat chance you could do it."

Though the River Clan had many capable warriors, for some reason Smile had not even a bit of talent.

"No. I'll really work hard at it. Hm? Please teach me."

"You have to awaken all your body's senses."

Ozent opened his palm.

"Anyone can clench and open their fist. But to master your own body, you have to go deeper."

"How?"

"Move extremely slowly. Watch while you eat."

While Smile was chewing, Ozent's eyes calmly settled.

At first she didn't understand what he meant, but after about 10 minutes she finally felt it.

"Ah?"

Ozent's five fingers were slightly curved.

"You see? Slowly. More slowly. Divide the single time of making a fist into 10 hours of segments."

"I want to try too."

Smile opened her palm.

"Mmm..."

Ozent, who had been carefully observing his sister, added:

"If you stop, it's over. Never stop even once, just keep moving only slowly."

"Got it. Slowly."

Smile's expression was quite serious.

"Ah! This won't work! I stopped again. This is unexpectedly difficult. Brother, where did you learn something like this?"

"I never learned it. It's a method I developed while thinking by myself. Breaking down physical sensations into the smallest units."

Ozent had no teacher.

"If I had to name a teacher..."

Smile blinked waiting for an answer, but Ozent prepared to leave.

"It's late. Let's go back."

Since the sun was already setting, Smile also tidied up without complaint.

"Smile."

At the entrance to the mountain path leading to the village, an old man with neatly tied water-colored hair stood leaning on a staff.

"Dad."

Damian, the chief of the River Clan, gazed steadily at Ozent and Smile walking side by side.

"I'm sorry."

When Ozent avoided his gaze and bowed his head, Damian sighed.

'Sigh, this is really troublesome.'

He had never shown it outwardly.

Even though not his biological son, Ozent was also his son, and above all, the River Clan's greatest warrior.

No, should he be called a warrior?

Compared to the River Clan's domineering swordsmanship, Ozent's movements were far too delicate and precise.

'Even with different blood, they grew up together, yet how can they develop so differently?'

Ozent's becoming a loner was partly due to his sword talent that no one in the clan could match.

"Let's go home."

Without saying anything and turning around, the father's appearance made Ozent's heart even heavier.

For the River Clan with good appetites, dinner time was a harmonious occasion, but today the atmosphere was heavy.

"Ozent, the pre-wedding ceremony is tomorrow. People from the Mountain Clan will come. Of course, Smile's fiancé too."

"I know."

It was customary for the bride's side to invite the groom's family before the ceremony and hold a feast for seven days.

"What kind of person will my fiancé be? Even if he's not handsome, I hope he's strong. Like brother."

"Smile."

Ozent warned her, but Damian's mood was already disturbed.

"Ozent, what do you plan to do from now on? The River Clan has protected the river for generations. Under the command of the strongest warrior."

The strongest was Ozent, but there weren't many who would support the individualistic him.

"I will leave."

This time even Damian was surprised.

"You'll leave?"

'There's no longer any reason to stay here.'

Though it was common for a chief's daughter to marry another tribe, it did seem rather early.

'It's because of me.'

"I'm not telling you to leave. You're a strong warrior and my son. It's just that protecting the river..."

"Has been the River Clan's responsibility for generations. I'm not qualified. I have something in mind too."

"What do you mean?"

"I want to travel various places and build up my skills more."

"You want to become a boundary keeper?"

With Ozent's skills, he could certainly survive even in purgatory, but as a father, his heart ached.

'In the end... am I running away again?'

That was the kind of child he was.

Even when he wanted something, he couldn't say a word, and even when something made him angry, he just bore it alone.

Such an eldest son was reliable, but now that he knew about his feelings for Smile, it was only pitiful.

'Well, this might be the natural order.'

If he hadn't adopted him from the beginning it would be different, but the two of them were in a relationship that could never be.

"Brother! Leaving suddenly? You never said anything like that to me before!"

"I'm sorry."

Smile raised her voice.

"Is sorry the end of it? Brother, you're always like that! You never tell me the really important things. I don't know what you're thinking."

What am I thinking?

'Damn it!'

If it was something that couldn't be changed anyway, even if he had to leave, he wanted to shout it out clearly.

'Smile, I love you...!'

That mustn't happen.

Feeling rising anger, Ozent put down his utensils.

"I'll excuse myself first."

"Where are you going? Talk with me."

Even as he went outside ignoring Smile's words, Damian didn't scold him.

'I must endure.'

Rational and cool-headed Ozent didn't have the courage to step even one step away from the taboo.

'Sword, I must hold my sword. Control the anger.'

Anger was, after all, his only teacher.
