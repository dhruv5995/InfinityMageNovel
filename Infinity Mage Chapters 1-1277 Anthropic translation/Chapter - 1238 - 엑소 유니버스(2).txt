EXO Universe (2)

"Distinguished guests from all nations, we have achieved great unity in the face of global challenges. All agreed terms have been delivered in writing, and by tomorrow morning, the first-ever global leadership council encompassing the entire world will be elected..."

As the closing ceremony proceeded, the performers caught their breath in the waiting room.

"Huff... huff..."

Kaiden handed Maya a bottle of water.

"Here, take this."

Though her throat was parched enough to drain a whole bottle, she only rinsed her mouth.

"You don't need to be nervous. You're the best."

Maya probably wouldn't even remember that she didn't respond.

Seeing her cold expression for the first time, Kaiden gulped and retreated to a corner of the waiting room.

El Kiana glared at him with annoyed eyes.

'Seriously... can't you see she's concentrating? A pro is finished the moment they get nervous, you idiot.'

The fact that she was having these stray thoughts was proof she was nervous herself.

'No, I can't! Focus, focus!'

Silence returned, with only the sound of conductor Panier turning sheet music pages.

'How annoying, that guy.'

If Kaiden had been just a little more clueless, he would have been kicked out of the waiting room.

'Please don't let anything happen.'

Performers are slaves to superstition - even the smallest feeling can make them feel like the world is collapsing.

The sensitivity of that moment could probably kill a person...

'30 minutes left.'

If she didn't know how to control it, she never would have made it this far.

'Please don't let anything happen. Just stay like this, pour everything out and come back.'

After that, what would it matter if she got drunk and ended up in the emergency room?

Just then, there was a knock.

'No...!'

It was bad luck.

Suppressing the urge to scream, Panier spoke with a cold expression.

"Who is it?"

A fierce-looking man with a sword opened the door, and Reina stood up.

"Rai."

"Wait... can we talk for a moment?"

She glanced at the conductor, and Panier nodded expressionlessly.

Getting angry would only make the bad luck worse.

"Go ahead."

Reina was just as sensitive, so as soon as they stepped into the hallway, she spoke in a low voice.

"Are you crazy? Do you know where this is? Even the royal guard shouldn't be able to get entry permission."

"I heard from grandfather. I can't give you details, but it's a dangerous situation. Come with me."

"Grandfather?"

Currently, Clump was stationed in Delta as commander of the Tormia Cathedral garrison.

"What are you talking about? The performance is in less than 30 minutes."

"Idiot, everyone's going to die. That's probably why grandfather pretended not to see me. Let's go now."

"I can't. I won't go."

Does it even make sense for a pianist to abandon their post 30 minutes before a performance?

"Without me, over 30 people will all lose their minds. I can't do that."

"Then you'll die...!"

Rai gritted his teeth.

Being family, he knew her stubbornness matched his own.

"Handle it yourself."

"Go back to headquarters. Don't stay because of me."

There was no response.

Since her brother would probably stay here, Reina's heart grew heavy.

'A kid whose family is everything.'

Though he seemed cold, he was actually the most caring of the three siblings.

The eldest son got attention for being the eldest, the second daughter for being the second daughter, the youngest for being the youngest, but...

'There must have been some distance without us realizing it. From me, brother Guy, father, and grandfather too.'

Perhaps Rai's obsession with the sword was also because he wanted to prove himself to his family.

'Now go your own way. Whatever kind of person you become, we'll always be here.'

Reina took a deep breath.

"Huff."

Her mind, trained through countless battles with superstitions, returned to a state of focus.

"I have to do it. The performance."

Because for a performer, that's everything.

Habitz asked.

"You can't be killed? You? Why?"

"Because that's the law. All beings can kill me. But I can also kill them. In other words, we all share the same law."

Sirone said.

"But Satan can escape from Yahweh in any situation. Have you ever thought about it? What kind of law could it be that lets you escape from me, transcending all possibilities?"

"I don't know. What is it?"

Habitz doesn't define anything.

"It's because you die."

"Satan is a being outside the law. So you're always probabilistically superior, but it's different with Yahweh. Your probability of survival is 0 percent. Because it's absolute death, you could escape from me 100 percent of the time. In other words, you and I exist at the extremes of law."

"No, listen. I just tried to stab you with a knife..."

"To summarize."

Sirone interrupted.

"You can still escape from me anytime you want. But because of that, if you try to kill me, you cannot avoid death under any circumstances."

That was why Habitz's instincts had screamed.

"But I tried to stab you?"

"It's just the result. I don't know what future it would have been, but if you had stabbed me in the back..."

Sirone paused to reconsider, then said.

"You would have died. Somehow, I would have found a way to kill you."

This thought suddenly occurred to him too.

'Perhaps Satan...'

Cannot kill Yahweh who has mastered the heart, so instead corrupts the hearts of other humans.

"Haha."

Habitz laughed dryly, then returned to a creepy expressionless face and spoke.

"Shiok."

As twelve fanatics surrounded Sirone again, Habitz circled around using Vanishing.

'You're spouting nonsense.'

Shiok's twelve hidden codes began to disturb Sirone's mind again.

"Yahweh."

If you are strong, try defeating us.

Prove your power, rise to the top of the world, make everyone follow you.

"Huff."

Sirone is not indifferent.

Rather, because he has mastered the heart, because he suppresses all desires, he is more precarious.

"Step back."

In the end, he was Yahweh because he wouldn't break.

"Graaah!"

When the hidden codes didn't work, Shiok, irritated, was about to start combat.

"Ugh!"

Habitz, released from Vanishing, once again passed by Sirone's side and rolled in the mud.

"S-Satan..."

On the second time, even Shiok had to acknowledge it.

'Is it real?'

Satan cannot kill Yahweh.

"Hmm."

Sitting soaked in water, Habitz examined his trembling legs.

'Fear?'

No, that couldn't be.

"Why is this happening now?"

Just as Habitz raised his sword to cut off his legs, Sirone approached and said.

"It's useless."

"Wait. Let me solve this first, then I'll fight you again. Why does my body keep..."

"Habitz, do you believe in God?"

Habitz stopped moving and turned his head.

"God?"

"Not the god we define, but a god who truly rules all dimensions. I honestly have doubts."

"If it's discourse about God..."

"But."

Sirone said.

"I'd rather there was a god."

Then he kicked Habitz in the face, sending his body sprawling.

"Yahweh!"

Shiok bared his teeth, but Habitz lay fallen, calmly accepting the rain.

"I'd rather there be a god, so everything would be fair, equal, no one would get hurt, and lightning would strike when someone does something bad..."

Sirone gritted his teeth and asked.

"Why do only we sacrifice? Why don't you take responsibility? Is it because there's no god? Because lightning doesn't strike from heaven, because no blade springs out from somewhere to cut your throat, does the world seem ridiculous to you? Because someone endures, sacrifices, and shows consideration, you think you can do whatever you want?"

"Hmm."

Habitz thought carefully.

"I think I understand. So if I throw away trash, someone picks it up and puts it in the trash can. If no one cleans it up, the streets will get dirty, and if time keeps passing like that, everyone will end up living in a garbage dump."

"Right."

"But the person cleaning up feels wronged. Why am I always the one cleaning? Those people are throwing filth everywhere, so why do I have to make this street clean? Then suddenly this thought occurs to them."

Habitz suddenly sat up.

"If everyone didn't throw trash from the beginning, this street would always be clean. No one would need to sacrifice, and everyone could live happily."

Sirone said sincerely.

"Right."

"I don't really understand."

"What?"

"Obviously they throw it because there's someone to clean it up. Even if all 100 people throw trash, someone among them will step up and clean it. The one person who least wants to live in a garbage dump takes on the trash of the other 99."

Sirone was speechless.

"Of course that one person will feel wronged. They cleaned it all up, but all 100 people equally enjoy the clean street. But nobody forced them to, right? If they don't like it, they don't have to clean. Then someone else will step up and do it."

Habitz pointed at Sirone.

"Just like you."

Rough breathing mixed with the sound of rain.

"Everyone kept passing it off, and in the end, you ended up taking it on. But there's no choice. You have to do it because you're the only one who can. So just keep doing it from now on."

Habitz spoke as if annoyed.

"Spend your whole life cleaning up trash by yourself, you idiot."

"...Photon Cannon."

Sirone grabbed Habitz by the collar, pulled him up, and swung his left fist.

'Infinity!'

The moment his jaw turned, a tremendous flash raced through Habitz's mind.

"Aaahhh!"

Soon after, a splitting headache came, and he clutched his head and screamed.

"Shiok!"

"Protect Satan!"

Shiok, activating the non-existent time of 0.666 seconds per second, helped Satan escape outside the law.

"...Faster than light."

At Sirone's voice, Shiok's eyes widened.

"H-how?"

The reason light speed is constant is because it's the speed of signals that make up this world.

Therefore, nothing can exist until the signal arrives, creating the light-speed barrier.

"But you can reach non-existent time?"

Faster-than-light omniscience penetrates the zero information between signals, the true vacuum.

"Photon Cannon."

This is Guffin's exclusive ability to create something from nothing, and the secret of the Wizard's missing one frame.

"Infinity."

Also, when this omniscience is applied to matter.

"Aaahhh!"

It becomes atomic destruction magic that fires particles at 99.9999 percent the speed of light.

Where Shiok had screamed and disappeared, only Habitz remained, writhing.

"Does it hurt?"

He wasn't in a state to answer.

"The reason pain is tragic is because it's lonely. You fall into hell alone at the festival of life. No one can take your place. It's the only thing you must take complete responsibility for yourself."

Habitz charged.

"Kiiiii!"

He concentrated all his current rage into his long sword and tried to strike Sirone's neck.

"You made a mistake."

Sirone slowly placed his hand on Habitz's chest.

"Graaah!"

As the atomic destruction magic tore through his body again, Habitz screamed and staggered.

"Hnngh! Hnngh!"

As Sirone approached, Habitz's legs instinctively began to create distance.

'R-run away. Run... huh?'

I see.

Habitz, suddenly realizing, looked back at Sirone with a shocked expression.

'Is this... fear?'

It was the one definition born from chaos.
