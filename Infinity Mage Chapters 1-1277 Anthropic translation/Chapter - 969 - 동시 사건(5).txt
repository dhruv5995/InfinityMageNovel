Simultaneous Events (5)

Bashka Royal Castle.

As the royals clutched their heads in terror, the royal guards began to stir.

"Graaaah...!"

Yahweh's Wrath.

The red Miracle Stream was dyeing the spacious room crimson like blood.

"I-I didn't order this."

Adolf XIII, whose eyes met Shirone's, lost strength in his legs and fell on his rear.

Though Shirone's face showed no distortion, Adolf felt as if he were seeing a ghost.

"Then who did?"

"My younger brother Robins. Please believe me. I knew nothing until my brother brought it up."

Having been severely punished for lying before, Adolf XIII answered with only the truth.

"Your brother."

As far as Shirone knew, Robins was just as cruel and cold-hearted as Tenar.

'If anything, he's worse. To think he'd try to kill his own blood relative. And Military Officer Bedium.'

Shirone had known since his school days that Lycan's father was Black Line's strongest hitman.

But the Bedium that Shirone understood through Omega far exceeded his expectations.

'Even his reputation as the strongest hitman is just what's known on the surface. Wandering around the world, he's assassinated two kings alone. Ministers and deputy ministers number 47.'

Even these numbers were just history that he had achieved before Shirone was born.

'The reason the world hasn't turned upside down is because the mastermind has never once been revealed.'

It was a moment when the saying came to mind that the best assassin is an unknown assassin.

"Where is the prince now?"

If Robins was connected to Bedium, he had to find him as quickly as possible.

"I don't know. Really."

This time Adolf XIII didn't close his eyes either, and Shirone attempted quantum transmission.

'It failed.'

Quantum transmission had the powerful function of simultaneous events, but it also had drawbacks.

'If you know the coordinates of time and space, spatial movement can always be successful.'

Because photon signals are cold.

'But the heart is different. For the observer's mind to exist simultaneously in different spaces, it must act. And the mind is unstable and uncertain.'

For quantum transmission to succeed, the mind recognizing Shirone had to be 100 percent certain.

It wasn't a difficult condition.

Family members could easily be certain of Shirone with less than 30 percent information.

'But those with a priori information like Robins cannot materialize me.'

This was also why most of the 12 Apostles had been sent to strategic key points in advance.

The royals glanced around nervously.

'What is he thinking?'

They couldn't understand why he remained here even after hearing the plan to assassinate Pony.

Shirone muttered with pitying eyes.

"...Stupid bastard."

Adolf XIII's shoulders flinched, but Shirone's gaze was directed beyond the ceiling.

"Huff! Huff!"

Suppressing her fear of death, Pony looked at the light rising beyond Lycan's shoulder.

'Shirone. Shiro...'

As electricity flowed through her throat, her nerves went wild and her limbs twitched uncontrollably.

"Where are you looking? We're old classmates meeting after a long time - shouldn't we at least make eye contact before you die?"

Despite his words, Lycan's pupils were observing Pony as if seeing her for the first time.

"I thought you were a decent woman, but..."

Lycan strongly pressed down on Pony's throat, lifted her waist, and drew out a chain scythe.

"Well, that's life."

Following the cold friction sound of metal, the chain scythe plunged toward Pony's brainstem.

"Gah!"

Just before he could feel the sensation in his hands, a powerful impact struck his back and sent Lycan flying into the wall.

"Who is it?"

Crouching like a beast while pulling the chain scythe, he saw a familiar face in his eyes.

"Damn, shit..."

It was the second most hated face in the world, and adding disgust made it first.

"Pony, are you okay?"

Shirone ignored Lycan's gaze and approached Pony, helping her sit up.

"H-how did this happen?"

Though her body was still in shock, she regained her senses and made an expression of incomprehension.

"Let's get out first. Can you stand?"

Sparks burst from the front, and Lycan swung his arm from behind Shirone.

Just before the chain scythe could pierce his neck, Miracle Stream completely wrapped around his arm.

"Graaaah!"

As if he had forgotten how to exert strength, no matter how hard he tried, his muscles wouldn't move.

Shirone stood up.

"Lycan."

Lycan's arm moved by itself and pressed the blade deep against his own throat.

"Kiiiii! Kiiiii!"

Lycan made snake-like shrieks as a threat, but Shirone's expression didn't change.

"It's been a while."

The snake sounds stopped abruptly.

"Still as annoying as ever. Are you still infected with that good guy disease, wandering around everywhere?"

"Yeah. Sorry."

Since the days of arguing about whose philosophy was right had long passed, he got straight to the point.

"Your father, Bedium - where is he now?"

Lycan struggled to break through the Miracle Stream, but no effort was of any use.

'Damn it. Has it come to this?'

Despite being trained by his father, the world's strongest hitman, the difference in level was too severe.

"This is a technique of the heart. It's an interaction between you and me, after all. If your heart were stronger than now, you could push back the Miracle Stream and move."

It didn't seem possible.

"Kill me."

Shirone pondered the true meaning of his words.

"Heh, I know you're the type who'd spare someone if they begged for their life. But I don't want that, so just kill me."

"Why? Because of shame?"

"No. If I'm saved by you, I'd have to give up something worse than death."

Lycan's lips twisted into a grin.

"Want to know where Military Officer Bedium is? Fine, I'll tell you. If that's what you really want."

Suddenly Shirone's eyes widened.

"Stop!"

The Miracle Stream shattered, and the chain scythe cut halfway through Lycan's throat.

Blood spurted horizontally, and Pony looked at him with shocked eyes.

"You..."

Staggering, Lycan opened his blood-filled mouth.

"Hehehe. See? I won, didn't I?"

He had overcome Shirone's heart, but what he gained in return was his own death.

"...Stupid bastard."

As sadness filled Shirone's eyes, Lycan shook his head as if he were wrong.

"I am an assassin."

The body drained of life collapsed with a thud.

Silence followed, and Shirone, who had been savoring Lycan's last words, nodded.

"Bedium will come."

To take revenge on Shirone for killing his son.

"Breaking through Miracle Stream and even using his own life as a strategy to kill me. Yes, you really were an assassin."

Though he was a villain, in the end he had carried out every moment of his life according to his beliefs.

"Evil is strong."

That's why the help of many more people was needed.

"Pony, the person who hired the assassin is Prince Robins. But the other royals are just as complicit."

"I figured as much. Though I didn't think they'd act this quickly."

"It's because I came. They're trying to check the relationship between you and me. And I..."

Shirone made his decision.

"I'd like you to lead Tormia. To fight against evil going forward, I need your help."

"My help?"

Shirone explained the principles of quantum transmission and the Ultima System project.

"Time is pressing. With an excellent leader, we could shorten it significantly. A leader who can unite people and make them focus on one goal."

"I understand what you mean."

Pony said.

"But I don't have the qualities of a king. You know, Shirone. Someone who finds lying shameful cannot lead everyone. I can only be responsible for myself."

"I know. That's why I came to you."

As Pony blinked and fell into thought, an idea suddenly flashed through her mind.

"If I become king, I will end up denying the king."

The reason mages are called children of intellect is because they criticize even the privileges given to them.

"That's enough."

Shirone smiled.

Citizens who had been doing relief work in downtown Bashka simultaneously pointed at the sky and shouted.

"Wow! What's that?"

A dragon covered in long, grass-like green scales was flying overhead.

The small, cute girl's appearance had vanished, and it was now large enough to dominate one city block.

"Would around here be good?"

Eight, having chosen an appropriate location, drew in breath and prepared to shoot her breath.

'Healing of Life.'

A dragon's breath boasts tremendous power comparable to an angel's judicial halo.

They charge their breath in special organs within their bodies, and the charging time varies for each dragon.

Eight's breath had a charging cycle of a whopping 100 hours, exceptionally high among the 12 Apostles.

"Roaaaaar!"

As Eight opened her massive mouth and roared, golden gales swept through Bashka.

"Ah, ahhh..."

Those injured by the demons had their wounds heal as they rose one by one.

Miro's group was shocked.

'Incredible recovery power.'

Eight, having breathed over all of Bashka, folded her wings and descended to the ground.

People cheered.

"Oh, great dragon! Save us! Glory to Tormia!"

Having experienced miracles several times in one day, it felt as if Tormia had been chosen by god.

A maid announced.

"Your Majesty, Lady Pony requests an audience."

The royals' eyes were filled with shock, and Adolf XIII's face turned pale.

'H-how?'

Shirone had clearly been here with them, and the assassination plan had never leaked out.

When Pony entered, all hypotheses disappeared and only cold reality pierced their minds.

"Damn..."

He forgot royal dignity and spat out curses, but he didn't have much time left wearing the crown anyway.

Pony's gaze passed over the kneeling royals and unconscious guards before reaching Shirone.

'It's really true.'

Meeting Shirone again right after parting made her feel as if her memory was malfunctioning.

Shirone looked around at the royals and said.

"From this moment on, Pony will inherit the throne of Tormia. As a Star of the Ivory Tower and one of the Five Stars of the Integrated Space Management Department, I cannot allow someone who assassinated blood relatives and deceived citizens by taking credit for others' achievements to be crowned king."

The royals instinctively realized that Shirone was the one who had resolved Bashka's disaster.

"How dare you..."

As his 44 years of waiting scattered like bubbles, Adolf XIII was consumed by rage.

"Pony! You finally...! Urgh!"

At that moment, Miracle Stream shocked his heart and the king's face turned white as paper.

Collapsing with a thud while clutching his chest, his eyes held tremendous terror.

"Gasp! Gasp!"

Shirone said coldly.

"I don't want to waste time. Confess your wrongs to the people and step down from power. Then I too will treat you as one human being."

"Uuugh..."

Adolf XIII's face crumpled into a pitiful expression.

"I-I'm sorry."

Even if someone had held a knife to his throat and threatened him, it wouldn't have been this frightening.

'My heart, my heart is stopping...'

The unfamiliar stimulus that was difficult to feel even once in a lifetime still remained alive in his mind.

"Then from now on..."

Just as Shirone was about to speak.

"Your Majesty! Something terrible has happened!"

The door burst open roughly as all the noble officials in the royal castle rushed in.

"Giants, giants...!"

Shirone and Pony simultaneously looked at each other.
