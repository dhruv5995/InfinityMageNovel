[625] Hanya's Magic (2)

Endless flashes of light surged around Infercus, who was engulfed in a colossal radiance.

ROAAAAAR!

Since it was the strongest creature, watching the dragon scream in agony evoked an inexplicable terror.

"14 percent! 11 percent!"

At the analysts' shouts, the audience clenched their fists without even blinking.

'Is this really possible?'

An event that could be counted on one hand, even in history and mythology, was being recreated before their eyes.

Grrrrrr!

Just then, Infercus writhed wickedly within the massive storm of energy.

"Its magic power is recovering! 13 percent! 15 percent!"

"That crazy old man. What are we supposed to do if he even set up magic concentration?"

Hanging onto realism was proof that this wasn't a program designed with clearing in mind from the start.

"17 percent! 19 percent! It keeps rising!"

As Infercus's head gradually bent toward the ground, the participants equipped their magic with pale expressions.

"Damn it! Hold on! Focus the firepower!"

While everyone was fixated on the dragon, only Shirone turned around and headed toward a corner.

"No."

The hooded woman spoke.

"They can't hold out against that."

KIEEEEE!

Infercus's back arched so severely that its spine seemed to bend as it concentrated its magic power to escape the quasar.

"It's condensing. It's passed the critical point."

As Baikal said, the quasar's size decreased while its impact force began to increase instead.

"9 percent! 7 percent!"

At that point, the dragon's body contorted.

"4 percent! 2 percent! 1 per..."

Elizabeth's rising voice cut off abruptly, her eyes shaking with shock.

ROAAAAAR!

The 360 million magical dragon was being sucked in along with the quasar that was vanishing into a point.

Kieeeee...

The terrible cry faded distantly like a memory from the past, and everyone in the colosseum stood frozen with vacant expressions.

"They really did it. They defeated a dragon..."

The extreme survival evaluation is now complete. Final survivors: 28. The second evaluation will begin shortly.

In this surreal situation, the participants first turned their gazes to where Shirone was.

They could read an almost spine-chilling level of concentration from his figure, already preparing for the next evaluation with his eyes closed.

"Bra...!"

A foreign scout shot up from the VIP seats.

"Bravo!"

As if by arrangement, countless scouts burst into praise in their native languages, and the audience gave a standing ovation.

Even as thunderous applause shook the colosseum, Baikal remained motionless.

'Is this your answer, Shirone?'

Elizabeth turned her head, unable to hide her excitement.

"Evaluator, you must give your assessment."

Baikal, who had been lost in thought until the applause died down, finally opened his heavy lips.

"S."

Lara smiled as she recorded the grade.

"Amazing. Clearing stage 10. In all my years as a scout, this is the first time my heart has been so full."

Baikal asked Elizabeth.

"Check the records for the entire Kingdom of Tormia. See if there are any cases of successfully clearing stage 10."

"There are."

Elizabeth's eyes glowed blue.

"19 years ago, right here at Alpheas Magic School, there's a record of the kingdom's first stage 10 clearance. Like today, it was a first evaluation, and there were 15 final survivors."

"19 years ago. Who was the top graduate then?"

She blinked her eyes to access the information and said.

"Mikea Gaold."

There was no way Baikal wouldn't know the name of the former Magic Association president.

"...Are you trying to follow in the footsteps of a madman?"

The second evaluation selection for the graduation exam will now begin. One of five categories, excluding extreme survival, will be selected.

Even after an event that wrote new history for the kingdom's magic school, the system remained indifferent.

"Ah, how foolish. On a day like today, they should let the participants rest more! They're ruining a great match."

As the middle-aged man complained, the hooded woman leaned her head on her fist in a crooked posture and muttered.

"They're not taking the exam to compete though..."

The man's face crumpled.

"Look here, miss. I've been holding back, but if you have something to say, say it directly to me. Don't pretend to mutter while not even using honorifics. Who exactly are you?"

The hooded woman whipped her head around.

"Who are you then, mister? Seeing as you're here, you don't seem to be a parent either."

"What, you don't know me?"

The man proudly pulled out a Spirit magazine from three years ago and showed it off.

The article title was written in the special feature section.

Poltar, the Man Who Loves Magic: Reflecting on 27 Years as a Private Scout

"Ah?"

"Now do you know? This is my 30th year. I'm someone the Magic Association's Creas branch gives special observation passes to."

"From the Association? That's impressive."

"Of course. Magic is my life. I meticulously record and keep everything from the history of regulatory magic to the records of all Alpheas Magic School graduates."

"Amazing. With that kind of passion, why don't you become an official scout?"

Poltar's eyes took on a distant look.

"In my youth when I was crazy about magic, I once dreamed of being a mage. But life doesn't always flow the way you want it to."

"Any special circumstances?"

Poltar turned his head with a sad expression.

"I can't do the Spirit Zone."

"..."

"Even though I memorized the fundamentals of magic by heart, I still can't do it. This is really difficult even after 30 years. Ha, sometimes it seems like I might be able to..."

The woman turned back to face forward without responding.

"Anyway, who are you? Only officials can observe without Association approval."

"Me? I'm a student here."

"Ah, advanced class."

That explained why her words seemed extraordinary.

"Then you should watch with your friends. Why are you here?"

"Just because. I don't really know anyone..."

Poltar looked at her pitifully.

"Oh dear. Are you being bullied or something?"

"Yeah... well, something like that."

Poltar's hand patted the woman's back.

"Cheer up! Dream big! If you work hard, who knows? You might really become the world's greatest mage! You're still young!"

'Not that young though...'

Since he was seeing her as young, there was no need to clarify.

"Heh heh! Anyway, today is really the best! It's been so long since such an exciting graduation exam!"

An announcement was heard.

The second evaluation category will now be determined.

Circular holograms appeared above the heads of participants scattered throughout the colosseum.

With the extreme survival option dimmed, an arrow rotated through the remaining five categories.

'How much have I recovered?'

What the participants waiting for the second evaluation were most concerned about was Shirone's current mental state.

Perfect recovery was impossible without magic, and indeed his complexion was noticeably paler than at the beginning.

'What is he trying to do?'

Shirone's friends watched with worry.

'Once the evaluation starts, most will focus their attacks on Shirone. Depending on the category, there might be a need to form factions.'

If competitors formed alliances, his friends would ally too, and the focal point would naturally be Shirone.

'Attack Shirone first. Even if he's tired, he's still the top graduation candidate. It's advantageous for me to deal with him quickly.'

As different thoughts arose, the arrow finally pointed to one slot.

"Haah."

While each category had its advantages and disadvantages, one thing was certain - no participant would welcome this particular category.

Personal Combat (Combat Power Assessment).

"WOAAAAH!"

Being the most popular category in graduation exams, the audience's reaction was explosive.

'This is really driving me crazy.'

While the participants could clearly see the hardships ahead, no one was foolish enough to waste time complaining.

'Attack Shirone.'

Almost simultaneously, all 28 participants entered the Spirit Zone, and the majority launched themselves toward Shirone.

Conversely, Shirone's friends took positions to counter them and rushed in from the opposite direction.

'Personal combat. It's definitely factional warfare at the start.'

Amy, who had already experienced defeat by the Golden Ring a year ago in graduation exams, intended to build a united front.

Iruki and Nade, who made the same judgment, joined her left and right and headed toward Shirone whenâ€”

'Elision!'

Photon Cannon flashes fell diagonally above all participants except Shirone.

"What!"

BANG! KWAKWAKWABANG!

As the battle's opening salvo began with this unexpected situation, participants who had rolled on the ground looked at Shirone with dazed expressions.

"Hah. Hah."

Having cast twenty-seven shots simultaneously, he was already breathing heavily with his head bowed, seemingly exhausted.

His approaching friends' steps stopped abruptly, and Shirone slowly backed away, wiggling his fingers as if inviting them forward.

"This crazy bastard...!"

Participants who realized his gesture meant he'd take on everyone felt uncontrollable rage and revealed their killing intent.

"The worst decision."

Baikal spoke.

"...is what I'd like to say, but I can't say that anymore. I got properly blindsided in the first evaluation."

"Still, facing everyone is impossible. And he's already exhausted."

"I agree, but the word 'impossible' is a bit much. Even if 27 people unite, they're not Cage-level."

That was true.

"But the unpleasant feeling can't be helped."

Regardless of possibility, as a mage, there was no way to feel good about Shirone's current decision.

"Number 27. Who do you think you are?"

Most of the participants whose pride was hurt glared intensely and rushed at Shirone.

"You must answer, Shirone."

As the second evaluation began, Baikal posed another question to Shirone.

"Are you... such a great being?"

A fierce flash blazed, and Shirone flew up to the sky during the participants' hesitation.

As everyone's gazes turned skyward, the hooded woman followed Shirone's flash with her eyes and said.

"The reason geniuses aren't accepted by the majority is because they deny existing systems."

Who could accept that time and space are intertwined as one system?

"It's not jealousy or envy. Rather, it's a matter of understanding. Because the systems are different, they can't accept it."

At this rather grandiose discourse, just as Poltar turned around, the woman grabbed the armrest and shot up.

"But I understand, Shirone. Push it through. Even if the whole world denies you..."

The woman who revealed her face by pushing back her hood spread her arms wide and arrogantly lifted her chin.

'I, the strongest Miro, understand you!'

"Ah, sit down! I can't see!"

"...Sorry."

As someone behind pointed and shouted, the embarrassed Miro flipped her hair and sat down.

"Come down! So all you're doing is running away!"

Participants concentrated their fire on Shirone as he flew through the sky using teleportation.

Even his friends, who initially didn't understand, could now fully comprehend Shirone's intentions.

'You really want to become a mage.'

Iruki, having made his decision, grinned eerily.

'Then that's what I want too, Shirone!'

As Atomic Bombs exploded in succession and flew skyward, Shirone spread his light wings and flew to the edge of the colosseum.

'This won't work, that won't work...'

Countless negative voices saying he could never become a mage faded from his thoughts.

"It doesn't matter. Even if everyone says no."

As his light wings flapped and his body landed behind the Ataraxia accumulated at the colosseum's edge.

"I am a mage!"

A white sphere formed before Shirone's eyes and vibrated menacingly, making Rian smile.

"Of course, Shirone."

"That crazy..."

Participants who spotted the Ataraxia hastily stopped their charge and gritted their teeth with pale faces.

'Photon Cannon!'

As the sphere of light passed through the Ataraxia, all 27 participants twisted at the waist as if turning inside out.

"Dodge! Scatter!"

A massive flash seized control of the entire colosseum.
