[662] Insufficient Five Senses (1)

The Grass Leaf Circus members who had completed their regular tour traveling throughout the MÃ¤rchen Kingdom had left for their hometowns during winter, leaving only Chagall and Tia, who had no family, to live with Ryden.

"Chagall, come here for a moment."

Chagall, who had been practicing circus techniques, wiped the sweat from his forehead and went to Ryden.

"What is it? Do you have something for me to do?"

"No. I want to teach you something."

Chagall tilted his head.

"I thought I'd learned all the techniques?"

Despite being only sixteen years old, Chagall boasted the most outstanding skills among the Grass Leaf Circus members.

"From today, you'll practice juggling."

"Haha! Director, you're not getting dementia, are you? You know how old I was when I first picked up clubs, right?"

"Bring them over."

At the serious tone, Chagall brought over a box containing clubs, and Ryden grabbed three clubs in one hand and threw them.

"Here we go."

Without even going through the preparation stage, Chagall spun the three clubs and displayed dazzling juggling.

His technique was skillful - during performances he did this while riding a unicycle, so it was as easy as breathing.

Chagall caught the clubs in order and spoke to Ryden with a triumphant smile.

"Did you see the skill of this genius?"

"Yes. You are a genius."

Chagall became embarrassed.

"Why are you suddenly like this? It's just basic juggling."

Of course, Ryden's assessment of genius wasn't because he had spun just three clubs.

'He absorbs any technique by the shortest route.'

It would be too wasteful to let Chagall's insight, which penetrated to the core of techniques, rot away like this.

"Do it again. Properly this time."

Sensing the unusual atmosphere, Chagall also became serious and threw all ten clubs from the box into the sky.

Ryden watched the dazzling techniques - X-pattern throws, spinning throws, sequence changes.

"Pass them over."

Two-person juggling began, with Chagall and Ryden exchanging clubs while each continued their own juggling.

'Huh?'

At some point, realizing that the clubs weren't coming back, Chagall looked at Ryden and his eyes widened.

'Suspension?'

Ryden was keeping clubs floating in front of him by alternately catching them with both hands.

Two, four, six clubs were fixed in mid-air as if nailed there, and finally all the clubs passed to Ryden's hands.

Buzzzzzz!

The air trembled like a bee's wingbeat, and Ryden's hands dissolved into afterimages as they moved between the ten clubs.

"Grrrrr!"

A groan leaked through his clenched teeth, and Chagall and Tia stared blankly at what could be called the pinnacle of juggling.

When the strong wind suddenly stopped and Ryden's hands came to a halt, the ten clubs fell with a clatter as if their strings had been cut.

"Phew, it's been a while, so it was tough."

"Director, what on earth was that...?"

"Swift Sword Ryden. That was my name before I became the director of the Grass Leaf Circus."

Ryden revealed the story of the assassin who had made a name for himself in the world.

The time when he would be talked about publicly had already passed, but even that was shocking to Chagall.

"Director..."

"You can say whatever you want. I've already put away my sword and intend to dedicate the rest of my life to this place. It would be good to bury my bones here too. But seeing you made me change my mind a bit. Your talent seems too precious to end like this."

"Talent... you say?"

"As you just saw, even juggling can be transformed into techniques for killing people. How you use it is up to you, but I believe you'll make the right choice."

Chagall looked back at Tia.

She now knew Chagall's heart, so although she didn't show it, she knew they would end up living together.

"How can I do it like you, Director?"

Ryden raised his index finger as if there was only one way.

"Schema."

"Huh?"

Sensing a presence, Sirone opened his eyes wide and discovered Aria bending over, then jumped up in surprise.

"Wh-what!"

He frantically looked for Rian, but he was already up, doing push-ups with his feet on the bed.

"Hehe, you look really cute when you sleep?"

When Aria brought her face close, Sirone pulled the blanket over to cover his bare torso.

"Please have some manners. How can you enter a man's room without permission?"

"Why? Afraid I might eat you up?"

Looking at her mischievous questioning face, who knows what might have happened if Rian hadn't been there.

"Sirone, hurry up and wash. Let's eat, eat."

When Rian pointed to the entrance with his thumb, Aria, who had been staring intently at his bulging muscles, snatched Sirone's blanket.

"Hey!"

"Aah! What are you doing?"

Sirone hastily covered himself, but thinking this looked even stranger, he lowered his arms.

"Wow! You're really skinny. You need to exercise."

This was something Rian had been worried about too.

"Yeah, Sirone. Let's exercise together from now on. Even if you're a mage, you can't have poor physical ability."

Sirone looked at himself in the mirror.

'Am I that skinny?'

He had never paid attention to it before, but when Rian flexed and showed his chest muscles, the contrast in their builds was obvious.

When he was attending magic school, he didn't have time to train, but in reality, most mages were thin.

If you could fly through the sky by concentrating your mind, what reason would there be to run around?

"Men need strength. Come on, hit me, hit me."

When Rian patted his chest and gestured for him to try hitting it, Sirone pouted and glared at him.

The fact that his first thought was to fire a Photon Cannon showed that building muscle was wrong from the start.

"Forget it. It'll get better as we travel. I wasn't this skinny when I lived in the mountains either."

Seeing him gather his toiletries with a sulky expression, Aria covered her mouth and laughed.

"Anyway, hurry up and wash and come down. Today's the private evaluation, so it'll take longer than yesterday."

Out of 273 people, only 54 had passed the first evaluation, and today they had to cut more than half again.

After washing his face and arriving at the hall, all the successful candidates were already scattered around waiting.

'The guild master is...'

He could see Rufist and Jane, still wearing masks, sitting across from each other at a corner table.

Ethella was drinking tea by the window, and across from her, Quan was eating breakfast.

Passing the first evaluation meant having some degree of expertise in one's field.

Among those preparing for the second evaluation - a woman sharpening arrowheads, a martial artist lifting dumbbells, someone preparing traps for the specialty evaluation - one person particularly caught his eye.

"Good morning, Mr. Sirone."

A young man sitting on the floor in a relaxed pose befitting a free spirit raised his hand to Sirone on the stairs.

'His waiting number was 147.'

Wig of the Gale.

Twenty-three years old, his specialty was dual swords, and he was one of the rising stars currently receiving attention along with Rian, known as the Knight of Mach.

"Yes. Good morning. Are you well prepared?"

"Haha! I was so nervous I couldn't sleep a wink. It's an honor to work with an Ivory Tower candidate."

Despite saying that, there wasn't a trace of nervousness in Wig's demeanor.

Also, even though Rian among the examiners would be evaluating him, the fact that he specifically addressed Sirone gave off a strange sense of rivalry.

"Knight of Mach. Is that person your swordsman?"

Wig turned his head toward Rian, who was frantically devouring meat, and asked.

"Yes. But more than that, he's my irreplaceable friend."

"Hmm, he doesn't look that strong. Do you happen to know what his Schema overlap level is?"

Schema is commonly explained as a body diagram, but it's not like a blueprint drawn in one's head.

More precisely, it's feeling control over the body.

For example, if someone operates three layers of Schema, it means they can control physical changes in three areas while performing a specific action.

Even someone clumsy can memorize the motions of a somersault through training, but gymnasts can simultaneously feel the position of their fingertips and muscle balance in a split second.

Ultimately, while the body is one, the diagrams of excellent individuals become relatively numerous. By that standard, you could see how inferior Rian's motor skills were.

"Uh... well, that is..."

When Sirone couldn't speak and just mumbled, Wig seemed to realize and scratched his head.

"Ah, sorry. For a candidate to evaluate an examiner - I was too presumptuous, wasn't I?"

"No. I think it's natural to be curious. If Mr. Wig passes too, he'll be a reliable ally."

"Thank you for saying that. Then I'll see you at the second evaluation later."

Wig picked up the dual swords he had placed on the floor and walked to a corner of the hall, sitting on the floor again.

Although he had stammered in confusion, once the conversation ended, Sirone felt strangely guilty.

'Why couldn't I speak honestly?'

Rian was strong enough to match any swordsman, and Sirone took pride in his achievements.

He probably disliked his friend being judged by the world's standard that those who couldn't open Schema lacked talent.

'Sorry, Rian.'

Rian, who had been chewing meat, made eye contact with Sirone, pointed to his food, and gave a thumbs up.

"Hahaha!"

Rian is the best, Sirone thought.

After breakfast, Sirone, Rian, and Aria took their places in the guild's courtyard and waited for the second evaluation.

Since this was a place to demonstrate specialties directly connected to survival, no one except the candidates could enter.

"We'll begin. Please come in."

At Aria's words, the door opened and numbers 28 and 29, the first successful candidates from the first evaluation, entered in order.

Unlike before, there were no polite greetings, and as Sirone watched with narrowed eyes, the two people removed their masks.

"What on earth are you thinking?"

When Sirone snapped, Rufist chuckled and walked toward the table.

"Sorry if I surprised you."

"I'm not surprised - if you were going to do this, you should have told me beforehand. You told me to form a mercenary group."

"Nothing will change. You're the leader. Where we're going is the Iron Tower ruled by Radum's upper class - Saenghwa. Ordinary strength won't even register there."

Since he had heard about the Iron Tower from Aria, Sirone couldn't press Rufist further.

"By the way, what about number 213?"

Irregular Eater Acet Meirei.

During the first evaluation, there hadn't been time to ask in detail, but she had definitely said she could hear La Enemy's voice.

"According to intelligence, four years ago a massive heretic trial was conducted in the Garon Kingdom. It was carried out after receiving an oracle from their archbishops in the Terapos Order. The purpose was one: to find and eliminate those who eavesdrop on God's voice."

"Are you saying that's number 213?"

Jane spoke.

"We speculate that Meirei's irregular eating ability, God's Frequency, is the power to pick up electrical signals floating around the world. She heard La Enemy's voice on a specific frequency range. It's probably not unrelated to the heretic trials either."

It was impossible to know how the evil god Terapos, known to have destroyed countless universes, was connected to La Enemy.

Rufist said.

"Her ability will serve as a compass for removing La Enemy's history that has seeped into Radum. Anyway, it's information that won't hurt for you to know. Make sure she passes the second evaluation too."

As Rufist turned with Jane and walked toward the back door, Sirone called out.

"Wait. Where are you going?"

When Rufist turned back, not understanding what he meant, Sirone pointed forward as if telling him to come back.

"You need to show your specialty before you go. This is officially a test."

"I'm busy right now. I'm not in the mood for jokes."

"It's not a joke. Even if you're the guild master, shortcuts aren't allowed. Hurry up and come get evaluated."

Knowing Sirone's stubbornness from before graduation, Rufist sighed and returned to his position.

"Then..."

RUMMMMMBLE!

The Silver Ring Guild building shook, and the candidates waiting in the hall looked around in terror.

"Wh-what's that?"

And shortly after, the masked numbers 28 and 29 appeared through the door looking annoyed and walked to the corner table.
