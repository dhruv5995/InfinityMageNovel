The Weight of Existence (4)

Cain turned around in front of the exit of the Hall of Evil.

"Here it is. If you follow this path, you'll see the church. Gyorgi is there."

Sirone's group peered beyond the door.

Outside the hall was a beautiful forest, and above the forest, they could see a spire with a bell.

Cain continued speaking.

"I created Melkidu's system, but the true owners of this place are actually them. The Satanists."

Nade asked.

"What are you planning to do?"

Either way, he was the first murderer. If they left him behind like this, it would be unsettling.

"Don't worry. Of course I am evil, but as I said earlier, I'm closer to being a scholar who majors in evil."

Cain stepped back and said.

"I'll be watching. The final battle between good and evil that my mother and I gave birth to. If evil wins, I won't need to hide in a place like this anymore either."

"What if good wins?"

At Iruki's question, Cain thought for a moment.

"Well."

Then he said.

"Does good even have such a thing as victory?"

As Cain disappeared into the corridor leaving behind meaningful words, Sirone looked back at his friends.

"We've finally arrived. From now on, it's not Melkidu's system. It's real combat."

The eyes of Iruki, Nade, and Eden changed.

"Let's go."

The Satanist monastery didn't seem different from other monasteries when viewed from afar.

But as they approached closer, the decorations, statues, and pictures carved on the walls were all nauseating.

"How terrible."

The group passed by a fountain.

'Usually it's little children peeing.'

The Satanist decoration was in the form of a crouching pregnant woman with her hands on her belly, screaming in agony.

"Ugh!"

And a fountain of blood erupted.

Nade, who was about to step back in disgust, flinched and then turned his head with cold eyes.

A nauseating smell wafted from the blood soaking their bodies, but no one moved away.

"Gyorgi."

The leader and executives of the Satanist church were opening the church doors and approaching them.

'Gyorgi, Gultan, Marit, Euphrapus'

Next to the four demons specialized in the Great Yahweh War was the person Sirone was looking for.

"Ms. Seina."

Her eyes, already influenced by the Satanists, contained a blood-red light.

Gyorgi spoke.

"You've finally come. How do you feel about touring the holy land of evil? It's quite a nice place, isn't it?"

"Give Ms. Seina back. That's all I want. Fighting now is meaningless."

Gyorgi also knew that the end was approaching.

"You've gotten quite close. It seems you didn't waste your time in Melkidu. But you're wrong."

Gyorgi opened the Devil's Bible.

"Asuka Contract Chapter 7, Verse 2. Shun the above and crawl below. Lewdness is there."

Gyorgi's shadow split in two and stretched out as giant hands.

'An ability that counters light?'

As Sirone balanced it with Hand of God, the Satanist elder Marit stepped forward.

"Emblem (Mark of Demons)."

The form created by gathering human malice was embarrassing to even look at.

Eden frowned.

'I don't know what it is, but I really hate it.'

However, now that he knew the birth of good and evil, he could understand the sexual feeling.

'If you expressed the emotion Lilith felt when she crossed the forbidden line in form, would it become something like that?'

On the other hand, Sirone focused on the emblem itself.

'The emblem collects the malice of Satanist believers. And attacks with Euphrapus's ability.'

The memory of the emblem's spear piercing through Hand of God and stabbing his side flashed by.

'It's like a weapon that's Yahweh's natural enemy.'

Because it contained the condensed emotions of humans who denied Yahweh, not those of demons.

"Mica."

_Yes.

Since Melkidu's core was reality, he could connect with Mica.

'How many Satanist believers are there?'

The current total number of Satanist believers worldwide is 1,273,018,388.

The emblem spear that stabbed his side back then had roughly the power of 30 million people.

'I won't be able to withstand it this time.'

Even if he could save his life, Yahweh's realm would be torn to shreds.

Due to the influence of emotional sickness, the number of Satanist believers showed a steep upward curve reaching the 1.1 billion range. However, growth has recently slowed due to the influence of special waves.

It was the waves of Humanity.

Satanist elder Euphrapus said.

"Yahweh, admit defeat. You couldn't stop emotional sickness or the change in laws. Why don't you understand that what rules the world is not good and love, but evil and공?"

Iruki retorted.

"You can't beat공either anyway. If things continue like this, everything will end."

Gultan grinned and said.

"It doesn't matter. If it ends like that, we'll just disappear together. If someone stops it, that's fine too. Either way, you're the ones who should be worried, not us."

While the members of Catacomb smirked, only Gyorgi had an uncomfortable expression.

He said.

"Yahweh."

You who abandoned me.

"This is the last chance given to you."

The moment he finished speaking, as if by promise, Seina moved and stood directly in front of Sirone.

"This woman has received Satan's baptism. She is closer to us than any human."

Eden shouted.

"Don't talk nonsense! You brainwashed her!"

"It's the same either way."

"What?"

Gyorgi held back his words.

"If you want to save Seina, then do so. But you will die by the spear of malice."

Nade said.

"Ha, do you think we'll just let that happen?"

"Who knows. What's certain is that there isn't much time left. If you lose here..."

Gyorgi opened the Devil's Bible.

"There is no Ultima."

As soon as he finished speaking, Seina charged, and Sirone's group scattered left and right.

'Damn it!'

Until humanity's end, 1 hour remaining.

The end of the Great Victory Dream.

Yorahan's mind was in Drimo, but his body was still wandering the mortal world.

How many long years had passed?

"Sanchi! Sanchi!"

Their journey had taken them around the world countless times, arriving at a deep mountain village in the East.

"Kiaaa! I'll have my revenge! You wretched things! How dare you kill me? How dare you?"

The 17-year-old girl's face was badly damaged, and blood vessels had risen all over her cheeks.

"Sanchi! Please come to your senses!"

As Sanchi's mother wailed, the village old woman frantically shook a rice container.

"Earth God! Please help this child! Free her from the evil spirit!"

"Grrrr!"

As Sanchi writhed in agony, the corners of her mouth tore and murky laughter leaked out.

"Keke. Kekekeke!"

Fear appeared in the old woman's eyes.

"Hyaaaaak!"

She fell backward as if seeing a phantom and said with unfocused eyes.

"Too... too evil a ghost..."

"Please do something!"

Sanchi's mother cried desperately, but the people gathered in the yard didn't move.

"If even the old woman with the strongest spiritual power in the village is like that, how can we catch a ghost?"

"Ah, then our daughter..."

"Excuse me."

When people turned around, a stranger wearing iron armor was standing there.

"Waaa! It's, it's a goblin!"

"I sense an evil presence. If it's not too much trouble, may I take a look?"

It was clearly a man's voice but somehow androgynous, and no evil could be felt.

"Please help us!"

Everyone was frightened, but the mother who was about to lose her daughter wanted to grasp at any straw.

"Our daughter is possessed by a ghost! Please, please...!"

Clank, clank, making heavy footsteps, Armand entered the shabby house.

"Kiiiii! What are you supposed to be?"

Having traveled the world and influenced countless evils, this was a new type.

'Evil evolves too. It's an endless fight.'

Armand said.

"Leave that child. Your place is where rivers of fire flow and skies of sulfur burn."

"Kihehehe! What nonsense! Those two bastards buried me alive and now what?"

'A vengeful spirit.'

It was a demon caught between reality and the other world, obsessed with resentful memories.

"I understand your feelings, but it was long ago. Those who harmed you have probably already become white bones."

"How would someone like you know! My anger, my hatred...!"

Armand placed his hand on Sanchi's chest.

'Small World Genesis.'

"Kwaaaaaa!"

People were horrified by the terrible scream, but soon Sanchi fell asleep.

"Ah! Our daughter!"

As the mother crawled over, Armand said.

"It's not over yet."

Having said that, Armand faced the vengeful spirit connected as one with himself.

In the dark, deep space of the mind.

"Kihihihi! Now I see you're dead too. Can you possess like me?"

The vengeful spirit had the form of a rotting body with dozens of tentacles instead of arms and legs.

Probably the terror and struggling of being buried alive manifested in form.

"That's actually good. The living keep trying to chase me away. Now this body is mine."

The vengeful spirit's odd eyes widened as it reached Armand, stabbing the darkness with its tentacles.

"What...?"

A woman sharpening a sword, but on the other side, all kinds of monsters were mixed together.

"Have you come?"

Even the vengeful spirit, confident in grotesqueness, was frightened before this scene.

"What, what are you exactly?"

"Stop your lingering attachment and cross the river of fire. The forgetful Lethe will give you peace."

"Give up my attachment?"

The vengeful spirit's face contorted.

"Who are you to say that!"

And the moment it stabbed its tentacles at Armand, tremendous waves of emotion rushed in.

"Huk!"

"Forgive them."

As I will forgive you too.

In the space of the mind, Armand calmly accepted the vengeful spirit's desires and obsessions.

It was truly a disgusting and abhorrent process, but.

'That's right, isn't it Yorahan?'

She could smile.

As Small World Genesis was released, her consciousness returned from the dark space to reality.

"It's done now. Your daughter is safe."

The moment the armored knight stood up and turned to leave, people prostrated themselves flat.

"Heavenly being! Please protect our village!"

'Heavenly being.'

Armand extended the tentacles that had been the vengeful spirit's body in all directions through the gaps in the armor.

"Waak!"

As people stepped back in surprise, she calmly walked down the open path.

"I am merely a lost wandering soul."

Hundreds of years passed again from then.

"Haa! Haa!"

In a wasteland without a single blade of grass, Armand could no longer walk and knelt on one knee.

'This is the limit.'

She had grown in power by devouring demons, but now she couldn't endure alone anymore.

"I... will now become a sword."

She imprinted on herself as she became an object.

"Whoever possesses the demon sword will gain the world. Good people, evil people, ghosts can all wield me, but."

Please.

"...I hope they'll be good people."

That lonely monologue would spread on the wind and later guide her to Sirone, but.

'You've suffered, honey. Now I too... think I can let you go.'

Parting with one's beloved is always sad.

As the Vajra Armed Forces was released, a single demon sword was firmly planted in the rocky ground of the wasteland.

Then the corpse kneeling on one knee began to crumble like dust and scatter in the wind.

'Goodbye.'

Yorahan.
