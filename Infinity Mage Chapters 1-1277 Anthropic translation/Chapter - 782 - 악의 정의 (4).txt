[782] The Definition of Evil (4)

A letter bearing Kashan's seal arrived in Tormia via the fastest route on the Red Line.

It was registered mail to be delivered directly to the head of the Thunder Dragons, and Albino left his post immediately after reading the letter.

"Knock knock."

When there was no response to his verbal knock, Albino opened the door and entered the room.

"When someone comes to see you, at least look at them."

Through the gaps in the pile of documents heaped on the desk, Iruki raised his haggard face.

"If you're a person, then look at what state I'm in."

Albino approached.

"Seeing a crazy bastard talking crazy, I guess you haven't gone completely insane yet."

"...What is it?"

Iruki openly showed his annoyed expression.

"Congratulations. You won't need to suffer through menial tasks anymore."

When Albino threw the letter, Iruki looked down and confirmed Kashan's seal.

"What's this?"

"A scout offer came from Kashan. Go to the holy war. If you're okay with it, the kingdom is also thinking of actively supporting you."

Iruki lost interest.

"No thanks. I haven't even established myself here yet, so what holy war? Anyway, these useless things..."

The Mercordain family had served as heads of the Thunder Dragons for generations, and the son's heart not wanting to break that tradition was admirable.

"You hated the Thunder Dragons."

"Just because you don't want to take a shit doesn't mean you don't go to the bathroom."

Albino took in the sight of his son maintaining composure while focusing intently on his work.

'Right, Mercordain is just homework to you too.'

That settled it.

"Don't be like that and at least read the letter. The conditions are quite good, and you'll like it too."

When Albino tapped the table where the envelope lay, Iruki stopped working and frowned.

"I said I'm not interested. I'm busy right now, so go home and..."

"It's a letter written by Shirone."

Iruki snatched the envelope and pulled out the letter.

"..."

He read the letter as fast as his eyes could move, then returned to the first page to savor each sentence.

"Whew!"

After inputting all the content into his head, he exhaled deeply and rubbed his face with both hands.

Knowing what his son was thinking, Albino smiled warmly and said:

"Go. The world wants you. Times are turbulent, but I can protect Tormia."

Iruki remained silent.

"You have talents that others don't possess. But that talent is just a miraculous probability created by all humanity rolling the dice. Don't think it's yours just because it came to you. Use it for the world."

"...I'll go."

Iruki's eyes were resolute after making his decision.

"Using the Red Line international station will be fastest. When you arrive in the Molton Kingdom, Kashan will open a military channel for you."

All countries under the Red Line have magical circle facilities at their associations for jumping to other nations.

"When does Bashka open?"

"In 57 minutes. If you miss this, you'll have to wait 12 hours. I'll handle the procedures, so go to the Magic Association now."

However, international jumps involve many considerations like diplomatic issues, so the opening times of magical circles are restricted according to international law.

'There shouldn't be any need to wait in Molton...'

From Molton, a border country with Kashan, he could jump directly to Kashan using the empire's military channels.

"It'll still take quite a while though?"

Considering the delays at each country's stations, he'd have to wait an average of about 6 hours per country.

"Sleep and eat on the way. Don't forget to exchange for international currency. If there's a decent girl, definitely make a move. Who knows? Maybe your face will work in another planetâ€”no, another country?"

It wasn't worth responding to.

"I'll meet Nade and leave right away. Please take good care of him even when I'm not here. He's someone who'll eventually make a breakthrough, so keeping him won't be a loss for the kingdom."

Nade, who had returned to Tormia with Liz, was researching ancient weapons under the Thunder Dragons' authority.

"...Sure."

Even Albino couldn't joke when watching his son's back as he departed for the world beyond.

Iruki packed his belongings in a briefcase and headed straight to the annex where Nade was staying.

"Nade, I'm coming in."

Papers containing information about ancient weapons, the kingdom's top secret, were scattered on the floor.

At a messy table with empty liquor bottles and half-full coffee cups, Nade sat smoking a cigarette.

"What a fine thing you're doing."

Nade looked almost like a shut-in.

"What's up? Isn't it work time right now?"

Iruki picked up a liquor bottle rolling around his feet and put it in the trash while asking.

"Does drinking give you good inspiration?"

Nade scribbled on paper, puffing hard on his cigarette while tapping his temple.

"It relieves tension. You need to relieve the tension of having to succeed to think creatively."

"Then what about coffee?"

"It awakens a brain tired from fatigue."

"Then what about cigarettes?"

"It constricts blood vessels to speed up blood flow. You can think more in the same amount of time."

These were the three sacred tools of creation.

"You'll die doing that."

"I can still endure it. I'm young. It's all about choices and focus anyway. Once this is resolved, I'll quit everything."

Currently, Nade needed 120 percent.

"So what's up?"

Released from his immersion by the continued conversation, Nade looked up at Iruki.

"Going-out clothes? Where are you going?"

Iruki pulled out the letter.

"Shirone called for me. He seems to need help. I'm going to Kashan. I won't be able to return for a while."

"Shirone did?"

Nade shot up, pressing against the table.

"What about me? Did he call me too?"

Iruki pretended to read the letter.

"It says you're not needed. Something like you should just put water in a plate and stick your nose in..."

"Don't joke around."

Nade snatched the letter and read it.

"Hmm, so that's how it is."

Nade's eyes, which had been hazy from fatigue, regained their sharp focus.

"Sorry about this anyway."

"Hmph! Sorry my ass. Go help Shirone. I have my own work to do."

Returning to the table, Nade scribbled inspiration in messy handwriting.

"Just watch what I'll do in this war. I'll make tons of money and smash the bastards who made Shirone cry."

No money, no war.

'Hang in there. You can do it.'

Iruki believed in the potential of Nade, who had transformed from a pure engineer into a technician with money as his goal.

"I'll contact you."

Nade silently raised his hand, and Iruki slowly closed the door and left the room.

"They've arrived."

Shirone, who had been pacing aimlessly through Agaros's spacious room, flew up at the administrator's words.

'They're here! They're here!'

When he arrived at Agaros's inner castle gate, the people playing card games with Minerva and Uorin had come out.

The empire's empress didn't need to come out to greet him, but Uorin was simply in a good mood.

'Because he's Shirone's friend.'

Getting to know the friend of someone you love is as delightful as getting to know the person you love.

"Open the inner castle gate."

As the massive gate opened to reveal Iruki, Minerva raised an eyebrow.

"That kid is Iruki?"

The Servant that Shirone had praised until his mouth was dry.

'He certainly doesn't have ordinary looks.'

Light brown hair, mismatched eyes, a skinny body, and a coat too big for his frame with flapping sleeves.

As people who had imagined he'd resemble Sain watched with puzzled expressions, Iruki raised his hand.

"It's been a while, Shirone."

When no response came back, Minerva turned around to see Shirone with a tearful expression.

"Iruki..."

They were on the same side.

No matter what future unfolded, he was a friend who would absolutely never change and stay by his side.

"Iruki... waaah..."

Shirone burst into tears.

'So that's how it is.'

Minerva looked back at Iruki.

'Someone he can show any weakness to.'

The mind of the infinite mage, whom even Garcia had admired, seemed like it would never waver in any situation.

Seeing such a Shirone crumble in one second, she had no choice but to acknowledge Iruki.

"Why are you crying?"

Iruki set his briefcase on the ground, smiled, and approached to embrace Shirone.

"It was hard, wasn't it? You did well."

It was sufficient comfort, and Shirone, at a loss for words, could only nod repeatedly.

Uorin approached with a smile.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Kashan's empress, Theraze Uorin."

"Thank you for calling me. I'm Iruki, Shirone's friend."

Even facing the pinnacle of the Three Emperors, Iruki looked directly into her eyes and offered a handshake.

'Mitochondrial Eve. The eyes of one who carries history? You really dumped a woman like this, Shirone.'

Uorin also understood at a glance.

'Incredible nerves of steel. Even though they're friends, they're really different.'

As they exchanged glances, both thinking the other wouldn't be easy to deal with, Shirone said brightly:

"Iruki is a researcher with the Thunder Dragons of the Tormia Kingdom."

Uorin smiled with her eyes as if she'd received the information.

"Of course I know. It must have been a difficult journey, but thank you for responding to our difficult request."

"I'll have to hear it to know whether it's difficult or easy. For now, please prepare a place. I want to start quickly."

Though they hadn't even caught up yet, color finally returned to the eyes of the card game players.

"Good. Gando will guide you."

They arrived at the Panic Room.

Though cramped, it was good for private conversations, and those meeting for the first time briefly introduced themselves.

Once introductions ended, Uorin conducted the meeting.

"As Shirone wrote in his letter, hearing it directly will probably help with your judgment."

The explanation continued from the war situation to the concept of extreme evil, and descriptions of Ex Machina and <Legal Death>.

"Hmm, a weapon that changes the law."

As expected, Iruki, being a Servant, showed the most interest in the ancient weapon Ex Machina.

Gaudio said:

"I hate to say this after calling you here, but how well you can handle Ex Machina is unknown. You'll have to take a test. We need to check teamwork too."

It wasn't that he was looking down on Iruki, but handling Ex Machina required the world's strongest brain.

"If you fail, you might just have to go back. It's not about whose recommendation it is."

"Of course. I'm fine with anytime."

Ness brought up the key point:

"Additionally, please keep quiet about what you heard regarding Ex Machina today until the war ends."

If Iruki failed the test and leaked information to his home country, all strategies would be ruined.

"...Right."

Though it could be unpleasant from Iruki's position, he nodded obediently.

"In the same vein, we can't provide information about Alpha Fish and Beta Fish that we're looking for either. That's the overview. Now let's go to Ex Machina."

"That's fine too. But..."

The card game players, who had been about to leave, stopped and looked back at Iruki.

"Alpha Fish and Beta Fish. I don't know who they are, but I think I know what kind of people you're looking for."

Agaya asked:

"Why do you definitively assume they're people? Killing Havitz would require countless laws, wouldn't it?"

"No matter how you change the laws, it's ultimately humans who define good and evil."

Gaudio, making eye contact with Ness, asked:

"So... who do you think we're looking for?"

"Two emotions that will cause ripples in the purity of chaos."

Iruki held up his index and middle fingers.

"The one who loves Havitz most, and the one who hates Havitz most. These two people are absolutely necessary for <Legal Death> to succeed."

"..."

At the exposure of their core strategy, the card game players could neither confirm nor deny, keeping their mouths shut.

"Well, let's begin."

As Iruki headed for the Panic Room's exit, Shirone and Uorin looked at each other and smiled.
