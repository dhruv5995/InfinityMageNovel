"A deal?"

Sirone's gaze followed the chip Fermi had flicked.

Depreciation's transaction.

At the time, he had been bound by Valhalla Action's debts, but Sirone had heard about Fermi's abilities.

"What kind of deal?"

Fermi rose from his chair and stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, looking down at the cityscape.

"I've brought tea." The secretary entered, set teacups on the table, and silently left the office.

"As you know, I sell drugs. The central continent has been trampled by demons, but all seven kingdoms of the southern continent are in my hands. Even the royalty live with my drugs constantly on their lips."

"You call that something to be proud of? Among my classmates, there's no human as corrupted as you."

Fermi's lips curved upward.

"Did the funeral go well?" "It's Fisho's will. You wouldn't tell me anyway. But it doesn't matter. I can roughly guess what it contains." Sirone didn't believe him.

"What does it say?"

"The biological program Argones. It must have been about the singularity that will soon cover this world."

Fermi turned around with a smile.

"It would be disappointing if you just thought of me as a drug dealer. I'm fighting for the world in my own way too."

"Under Code."

Fermi picked up a medicine bottle from the desk.

"Dream Star. You've heard of it, right? Information discarded from reality accumulates intact in the Abyss."

"So what?"

Fermi took a sip from his teacup and hurled it forcefully toward the window.

It shattered with a crash, sending fragments flying.

"What do you think?"

Sirone watched silently.

"The moment I threw the teacup, the future was already decided. How many fragments it would break into, what shape those fragments would take. So what about me?"

Fermi pointed to himself.

"Was taking a sip of tea my will, or the action of matter? If you reversed time, would I not have drunk the tea?" If humans were free from the flow of time, different results should occur with each Time Vibration.

"Everything is already decided. My future, your future. The world of the Abyss isn't just simple waste. It's precious information that has passed through all of the future's filters."

"I understand what you're saying."

Using Fermi's method, it would be possible to predict this world's future to some extent.

"You're saying the world might end soon. But what does that have to do with you selling drugs?"

"Hmm. Do you know how much I make?"

"No."

"Astronomical amounts. Beyond imagination. And that money becomes the foundation for my Extrasensory Perception."

Fermi flicked another chip into the air, caught it, and smiled.

"It's good to have insurance, isn't it?"

Sirone understood.

"You want to buy my magic?"

"In Depreciation's transaction, the value of magic is based on rationality that I determine. Yahweh's magic. To borrow it even briefly, selling a kingdom wouldn't be enough. It's too expensive."

Fermi continued.

"But I've saved up."

It was enough to build several kingdoms and still have plenty left over.

"Of course, within the rules of Extrasensory Perception. I can only buy magic with money earned through transactions."

If Fermi's words were true, there would be two people who could use Yahweh's magic.

"How about leaving it to me? You seem to be having quite a hard time. I'll save the world in your place."

He could transfer all the burden to Fermi.

All the countless pains he had to bear alone until now flashed through Sirone's mind.

'Fermi is...'

I hate to admit it, but he's strong.

Not only was his Extrasensory Perception complete, but his judgment, thinking ability, knowledge, psychological warfare - he scored near perfect in all areas.

'I have no desire to become a hero.' If Fermi could break Nane, if he could save this world, it didn't matter.

"I refuse."

At Sirone's words, Fermi smiled.

"Well, it would be a shame to give up a position like one of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars."

"That's not the problem. Even if you're stronger than me, it's money gathered by causing countless people suffering. I can't sell Yahweh's power to you."

As always, Fermi didn't get excited.

Whenever Sirone saw that calm face, he felt caught in a snare, but he had no choice but to stay alert.

"Then how about this?"

Fermi brought his mouth close to Sirone's ear.

Hearing his quietly whispered voice, Sirone's pupils dilated greatly.

Standing alone on the beach, Gaold watched the sun rise over the horizon.

After regaining consciousness, he hadn't attacked Miro, but his cold attitude remained unchanged.

Miro vented her complicated feelings as irritation.

"Why? Let's go another round."

Kang Nan said.

"Gaold isn't that stupid. When he saw you in an excited state, he lost his reason, but... if there's only a fine line between love turning to hate, the reverse must be true as well."

'Miro is still in his head.'

That fact made Kang Nan deeply sad.

"Miro."

Hearing Gaold's voice, Miro approached him while grumbling constantly.

"You called?"

Gaold took Miro into his sight.

Hot longing surged from within his chest, but soon that emotion transformed into anger.

'It hurts.'

To Gaold, Miro was pain itself.

Miro said.

"Your eyes look murderous. Do you hate me that much? Then how about slapping me instead?"

"That would be somewhat effective." Earning her resentment would be better than forgetting her forever in his mind.

Miro looked back at the sea and spoke.

"Remember what I said in Zion? I told you to come back anytime if you felt you couldn't endure anymore."

"You did."

"Can't you come back now? Since you don't have to fight anymore, since I'll be by your side..."

"How pathetic."

Miro frowned.

"Yeah, you idiot! This is all because of you! Why did you interfere in my life and cause chaos! Honestly, I don't like you!"

Gaold turned away coldly.

"Leave. This is your last chance. If I see you again, I won't forgive you then."

Watching Gaold's retreating figure as he returned to Kang Nan, Miro wore an incredulous expression.

"You..."

Was this really the Gaold she knew?

Kang Nan asked.

"Are you okay?"

She couldn't dare imagine the heart of Gaold, who wanted to fight even while hating the woman he loved.

"Let's leave. We're going to the central continent. Everything will be decided there."

The three people began walking, and Miro, left alone on the beach, ground her teeth.

"Fine! This is the end now. It was disgusting to meet you, let's never see each other again! Got it?"

Gaold didn't even respond.

"I'm going back."

If she harbored more feelings here, she might lose even her will for Extreme Line.

"I said I'm going back!"

The only crack engraved in Extreme Line's spirit made Miro's chest throb.

'You came to save me.'

Since meeting at the magic school, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say he had lived his entire life for Miro.

"This is really driving me crazy!"

Having made her decision, Miro stomped forward angrily and instantly caught up to Gaold.

"I'm coming too! I'm going as well!" Seven days after Fisho's funeral ended, the demons finally seized Kazra's capital.

Most of the royalty were slaughtered, and the citizens were incorporated into hell's army through ideological education.

"Since the Spirit Zone is closed, we'll have to use humans."

The demons still numbered over 200 million, but it was no longer their war alone.

"One month from now. If we occupy Tormia within that time, the war ends. After that, they're useless."

Vulcan's plan was to eliminate all humans on the planet after winning the war.

"Why must we do that?"

Since it was Habitz's will, the person asking the question wasn't Vulcan but Habitz, whom Smodo was addressing.

"Eliminate all humans?"

"Yeah. Kill them all and we die too. That part's fine, but what's the reason?"

"Because I'm curious."

Habitz stroked his mustache as he spoke.

"That's all. The first murderer probably thought like this: What happens if I kill? So they tried killing. If it wasn't good, they probably never did it again, but trying it felt good. You can steal their things, and they don't annoyingly bother you anymore. That's why many people do it."

"So chaos existed before evil. Curiosity about possibilities, you mean."

Habitz nodded.

"This war is the same. I'm curious what will happen if we kill everyone. Let's try it."

"Nothing might happen."

Habitz's smile lines bulged.

"That's interesting too. It would prove humans are meaningless. But if they're special beings..."

Habitz's gaze turned to the night sky.

"Still, wouldn't something happen? Would God come down and say something like 'You have won'?"

Smodo said.

"I hope nothing happens. That's my preference. It's thrilling."

"We'll decide that when the time comes..."

When Habitz deployed Avatar, Vulcan and Smodo's brains became unable to perceive him.

"Tonight we'll raid the enemy camp. Tell Natasha. And Zetaro..."

Habitz said.

"I'm going for a walk."

Vulcan and Smodo turned their heads toward Habitz, who was somehow already ten steps away.

'Vanishing.'

What was truly eerie wasn't that they couldn't see Habitz, but that he had disappeared from their minds as well.

'Habitz is free.'

Because he can do anything, he is utterly evil.

"..."

Natasha's pupils, with her eyelids cleanly cut away, reflected the enemy camp's landscape.

Her gaze was fixed, an interested smile played on her lips, and she sat with her knees drawn up, grasping her wrists.

'Amazing.'

It was an aura only she could feel, being someone who could be called the world's best in combat without exaggeration.

"What are you doing? In such a strange pose."

Zetaro approached, yawning.

"Over there."

Natasha pointed to the enemy camp.

"There's something incredible. I don't know who it is, but every time they breathe, it feels like the world is being sucked in. I want to go see quickly."

"There's someone that strong?"

Since it was Natasha's assessment, Zetaro also peered through the darkness at the enemy camp.

"I can't tell. Anyway, wait a bit. Vulcan said we're attacking tonight. I'm going to sleep more. Oh, right."

Zetaro turned around, then suddenly remembered and asked.

"You can win, right?" Natasha didn't answer.

One kilometer away from the demon army, Tess was standing guard at the Valkyrie barracks.

"Something's not right..."

On the surface, nothing was different from usual, but strangely, his heart was pounding today.

'Something always happens on days like this.'

Lian's voice was heard.

"What? You're still doing that?"

He approached carrying freshly baked bread, broke it cleanly in half, and offered it to Tess.

"Eat. You need a midnight snack."

"Thanks."

Tess's lips curved up, but it was awkward.

"Why are you like this today? You've been restless since earlier. Our defensive position is solid."

"I don't know. I feel uneasy. It's like someone's watching from over there."

Lian examined the enemy camp.

"Hmm."

The law knows.

The fact that Lian and Natasha's gazes had collided head-on across a distance of one kilometer.
