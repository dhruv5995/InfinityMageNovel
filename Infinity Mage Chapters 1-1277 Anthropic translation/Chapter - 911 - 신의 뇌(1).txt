The Brain of God (1)

Omega Year 187.

Gerfin, who had returned from the hell of the shadow world, gathered the Gaians and prepared to escape the photon system.

"This will be an interesting journey."

The hearts of those welcoming a new era were filled with excitement.

"There is only one way to escape the photon system."

In a place where a thousand Gaians had assembled, Gerfin began his final speech.

"To break free from Ankela's dominion and all become administrators of this world ourselves."

Though everyone already knew this, the Gaians silently focused on Gerfin atop the tall spire.

"We have no more controversy or doubt. We are the true masters of this world. Therefore, we shall escape from Ankela's void and leap beyond infinity."

Applause echoed throughout.

Though they were a minority compared to the total population, individual numbers weren't particularly important to the Gaians.

'Of course, today is different.'

To destroy Ankela's authority and escape the photon system, the more personal codes they had, the better.

As Gerfin descended from the spire, his metallic hair flowing, people gathered around him.

"The time is approaching. Your role is crucial."

Though the Gaians were integrated through Ultima, the core keyword was still Gerfin.

"Magic."

The principle of phenomena.

Understanding the truth of this world and changing phenomena through that understanding were separate matters.

Only Gerfin, the infinite mage, could open the final lock at the edge of the universe.

"We choose."

The pride of the Gaians, who had regained the meaning of perfect existence at the end of truth, pierced the heavens.

"Uncle Gerfin!"

A woman with golden steel hair twisted into spirals and pinned to her head approached.

"Mila?"

She was the historic first child born when Gerfin returned to the shadow world.

"It's been so long."

Even with the characteristically sharp features of Gaians, she radiated a bright and gentle atmosphere.

"Of course. I'm a proper lady now. You don't know how long I've waited for today."

Mila's face flushed slightly.

"Ever since the day I fell in love with you, Uncle."

"I see. I'm sorry."

As Gerfin smiled and patted her head, Mila stuck out her tongue and laughed cheerfully.

"It's okay. When we leave this world, everything will start anew. Maybe I'll have a chance then."

"Haha! I hope so."

Though Mila had been rejected when she confessed to Gerfin, her heart bore no wounds. She understood that love required mutual consent.

'To know what is right and act upon it.' She was fortunate to have been born a Gaian.

"Gerfin, preparations are complete."

At the elder's words, Gerfin opened his 11th sense, the bow sense.

'Ultima.'

He could feel all the Gaians on the planet perceiving him through their bow sense.

"Then—"

As Gerfin smiled and looked back at Mila, she nodded with an excited expression.

"Let's go."

The Spirit Zone opened, and just as they began extending at superluminal speed through the infinite realm—

Bang!

Mila's face exploded.

Her body, remaining only from the neck down, swayed left and right before falling with a thud. Gerfin turned his head.

"Archangel."

In the distant sky, Ikael was looking down at the earth with her halo greatly expanded.

"Foolish humans, why do you abandon the authority given by God and court death?"

Gerfin muttered.

"Ataraxia."

The concept that gave birth to this world.

'The signal closest to the outer world. The range of amplification could be called the distance from nothing to something.'

Even for Gerfin, the infinite mage, concepts positioned at the highest level of the universe were troublesome to deal with.

The Gaian chief examined Mila's condition.

"She's dead. The attack was faster than the sense of time explosion. It couldn't have been blocked."

"May she have pleasant dreams." Gerfin looked up at the sky.

"Archangel, may I interpret your current interference as Ankela's will?"

Ikael raised her chin haughtily.

"Not interference, but law. I, Ikael, Archangel, shall destroy those who disturb the law."

Having extended Ataraxia to the ends of the sky, she reached her hand toward the earth.

"This is your last chance. Follow God's will."

A single flick of her finger would have pushed back the earth and split mountains.

"God?"

Gerfin smiled.

"Don't be mistaken."

As Gerfin's eyes blazed golden, fire lit up in all the Gaians' eyes as well.

"How dare you!"

As Ikael extended her hand, the surrounding atmosphere began falling at a tremendous speed.

"Ultima System."

A thousand Gaians gave birth to a single thought.

"We refuse."

Whoooooosh!

A dome-shaped barrier spread across the ground, blocking the wind pressure that was crushing down on the mountains.

'What the—?'

Ikael's pride wounded, she furrowed her brow.

'What is that light?'

What was it connected to that gave it power to ignore even the laws of this world?

"Ikael, do not doubt."

Seeing Gerfin, who had somehow flown up to the sky, Ikael twisted her nose bridge in disgust.

'If it's just one person...'

The moment she thought that, a sphere of light was born in Gerfin's hand and began pulsing menacingly.

"Photon Cannon."

A flash of light carrying mass rushed toward Ikael at near light-speed.

'Ataraxia!'

Amplifying her sense of time, she leaned back to dodge as the flash struck the plateau behind her.

CRASH!

The power that sent 20,000 tons of earth flying was comparable to the previous Ultima.

'I must eliminate that human.' Feeling her mission as an archangel, Ikael gritted her teeth and flew toward Gerfin.

The moment the leader of angels and the representative of Gaians collided head-on, the world shook.

'How can such power exist?'

As flashes from Photon Cannons rained down like a downpour, Gerfin's voice was heard.

"I told you not to doubt."

As Ikael turned her head, Gerfin, who had transcended spacetime, was right before her eyes.

"The stellar body is shaking."

In Ikael's wide-open pupils, the flash approached at tremendous speed.

"Urgh!"

Just as she tried to use the power of amplification, Gerfin blocked her path faster than the Photon Cannon.

"Huh?"

CRASH!

The roar shook heaven and earth, and Gerfin, taking the direct hit from the flash, flew away together with Ikael.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

Having pierced through four peaks and crashed into the ground, Ikael immediately raised her head.

Gerfin was embracing her waist, not moving at all.

'Why?'

Just as Ikael slowly extended her hand, Gerfin suddenly lifted his face.

"As expected."

Gerfin said, raising one corner of his mouth.

"Angels don't have hearts."

Though it was natural since angels were mental entities, Ikael felt strangely unpleasant.

"There's no reason for angels to imitate the biological organs of inferior humans. We are the highest intelligence."

"Really?"

Gerfin slowly got up, grimaced, then knelt on one knee.

"Ugh!"

Through looking down, Ikael discovered Gerfin's back, charred completely black.

It was a choice only a madman could make.

"Why did you do that?"

Gerfin didn't answer.

"You wouldn't have been destroyed by that level of attack anyway, but I should be the enemy who killed your kin?"

"I made a promise."

If Lucifer hadn't been destroyed in Gerfin's place, today's opportunity wouldn't have come either.

"I can't harm you." Attacking and blocking oneself was the binary way of thinking typical of Gaians.

"What are you talking about? A promise?"

Gerfin scratched his wire-sharp hair roughly.

'This is troublesome.'

Lucifer's face, who had asked Ikael to find the meaning of existence, flickered before him.

'Ah.'

Discovering some possibility, Gerfin suddenly thrust his face before Ikael's eyes.

"You. Can you reproduce?"

The moment he finished speaking, Ikael's eyes widened as she swung her fist at tremendous speed.

"Ugh!"

Taking the punch squarely on the jaw, Gerfin flew dozens of meters and crashed into a giant boulder.

"How dare a lowly human insult an angel?"

Even if she borrowed a human body to produce Nephilim, it was far from bestial behavior.

Gerfin approached, holding his dizzy head.

"Ow, what kind of temper..."

"Shut up. All of this must have been your scheme in the end. But it won't work on me."

At that moment, fire lit up in Gerfin's eyes.

"Who do you think created this world?"

Meeting the characteristic gaze of a Gaian, Ikael frowned and answered.

"The eternal and immortal Ra. The one and only God who gave light to this world and gave birth to angels."

"Do you really think so?"

Ikael's eyebrows trembled.

'I really hate that look.'

It felt like he regarded not only archangels but all things in the universe as more worthless than filth.

"Are you trying to say you're God? That Ankela, me, everything is false?"

"No."

Gerfin shook his head.

"We're no different. Even if humans created this world, who created those humans?"

The eternally repeating shackles of creator and created.

"That's why I want to go see."

"I won't allow it."

Just as Ikael raised her will to attack, Gerfin extended his hand and said.

"Want to come together?"

"...What?"

"We won't know what came first until we go see. Let's check together. Who knows? When we transcend infinity and reach the end..."

Gerfin smiled.

"Your reason for existence might be there."

"Reason for existence?"

She had never once doubted her own existence since being born an archangel.

'I am the first. I am birth.' But looking into Gerfin's eyes, she felt like she might really fall somewhere.

'The outer world.'

Ikael frowned and shouted.

"Nonsense! Do you think I'd fall for human words? I am the leader of archangels, Ikael."

"Really? Then there's nothing I can do."

Thinking he had tried enough, Gerfin snorted and activated the Ultima System.

Though briefly delayed, countless Gaians had finished preparing to leave the photon system.

"Let's go."

The moment Gerfin's body transformed into light, Ikael witnessed an amazing sight.

'Really...'

The blue sky disappeared, revealing signals crossing against a black background like space.

'Does it really exist?'

She had to stop it.

Moreover, if it was just Gerfin alone, activating Ataraxia would be sufficient to stop him.

"Ah—"

But.

At the hundreds of millions of flashes shooting toward the sky, Ikael was stunned.

"It's there?"

As Gerfin's body, scattered into light, grew fainter, the stellar body shook anxiously.

"I, I too..."

Ikael extended her hand.

Ankela's eyes snapped open.

'What is this?'

Before understanding, a sensation of electric shock surged as the giant pupils shook rapidly.

A voice mixed with electrical noise spread.

"Full-scale breach attempt against the cosmic system detected. Target: Gaians. Code allocation: 99.8% of total. Searching for optimal response plan."

Silence fell.

And after a moment, Ankela, having regained its original gaze, intoned in a majestic voice.

"Activate Code Argoneth."
