[689] Eyes of God (1)

The incident that had ballooned like bubbles through the Wheel of Emptiness was heading toward every possible pattern that could occur.

An infinite number of patterns reacting with a single random element was like the principle of throwing countless pebbles to fill the sea.

Everything that could happen was happening.

Fighting, dancing, torturing, kissing...

Of course, these events weren't actually taking place.

They could have occurred, but what was more important was that La Enemy's randomness was gradually being lost.

As Sirone's patterns increased, the number of ways La Enemy could react relatively decreased.

Some events changed to having no probability of occurring in the first place, and thus the bubbles of the Wheel of Emptiness began to burst.

Finally, when all events disappeared as 'events that could never have occurred in the first place,' what remained was true Movement Zero.

Grabbing the shoulders of La Enemy, who could make no reaction, was an extremely easy task.

"Haa, haa."

Sirone exhaled roughly while glaring at La Enemy.

'I've caught him. I absolutely won't let go.'

Even if it meant dying here, he would hold on tenaciously.

'It was a battle of probabilities.'

As Lufist became lost in thought, La Enemy spoke.

"You've finally come, Sirone."

Even in this desperate situation, there was no sign of tension.

Pirirri.

Just then, a black shadow passed by with a whistle sound.

Only after blood spurted with a thud did La Enemy examine where his right arm had been severed.

"Kido."

When Sirone turned his head, Kido was standing hunched over with one foot slightly raised, holding La Enemy's arm.

"Kikikik, there can be no mistakes for a Speed Killer. Now I'll thoroughly grasp your memories and..."

"I get it, so just hurry up and eat it."

Though the impatient Sirone urged him on, contrary to expectations, La Enemy was watching the situation with even a hint of amusement.

"Well then, let's see."

As he began to bite and chew La Enemy's arm, time seemed to flow slowly.

While everyone watched with tense expressions, something went down Kido's throat with a gulp.

"Hmm..."

Looking up at the sky and waiting for 'Taste of Events' to activate, doubt filled Kido's eyes.

"Huh?"

And through <Nemesis>, all of La Enemy's memories were transmitted to everyone.

Sirone's eyes shook with shock, and watching such a Sirone, La Enemy tilted his head slightly.

This is a story.

The secret history of a being born as a product of perfect chance.

"Th-this can't be..."

The starting point of La Enemy's memories was a universe of distant time that humans could never experience.

Living beings existed on a certain planet.

Their forms, habits, language, and methods of communication were completely different from humans, but this wasn't an important issue for Sirone's group.

Because he possessed nothing at all.

"It's coming! I can see the head! Just a little more strength!"

A life form born with everyone's blessings began a tragic life without giving even one second of joy to its family.

"No! No!"

The parents wailed upon seeing their newborn child.

The child born as a mutant had inherited nothing from either parent.

To be precise, all the sensory organs through which their species perceived the world were damaged.

"Why our child! Why does it have to be our child!"

Nevertheless, the parents decided to raise the child.

At that point, Sirone felt chills run down his spine.

'This is insane.'

It was a child who could demand nothing, and it was even impossible to guess what state it was in.

Without visual organs, it didn't know what light was.

La Enemy is blind.

Without auditory organs, it couldn't even hear sounds.

La Enemy is deaf.

It couldn't smell, couldn't taste, and with even its nerves paralyzed, it couldn't even detect the movement of its digestive organs.

'How can this be possible?'

Thus, the ego continued its miserable existence trapped in nothingness, possessing no characteristics.

It might have had thoughts, but it was in a state where it couldn't even think that those were thoughts.

Time was meaningless, and one second in the photon system was extending to 10,000 years, 100,000 years, even 100 million years.

"Uaaaah!"

Kido screamed as if his head would explode just from accepting the memories.

Venezia was also shedding bloody tears, ruminating on the memories that had killed two of her brains once again.

"Kruuuu!"

Even Sirone, whose mental strength was far superior to theirs, was gritting his teeth with a distorted face, desperately enduring.

Suffocating.

So suffocating it felt like going insane.

Probably, that child's head at the time was filled entirely with something of this nature.

100 million years became 1 billion years, then hundreds of billions of years again...

In the endless expansion of time, the nature of nothingness began to gradually twist, unable to bear the emptiness.

"Kyaaaak!"

The parents who came to provide nutrients to the child as usual saw the child's body twisting like a pretzel and fled in terror.

The skeleton crumbled, and organs that were unnecessary from the beginning began the process of extinction.

He was gradually changing into some random form, just a lump of meat with no functional beauty to be found.

By the time 40 years had passed by photon system standards, no one came looking for him anymore.

"..."

In silence, the world was simply quiet.

Since time didn't exist, there was no function of aging either.

Like an unbreakable egg containing only the concept of nothingness, it was destined to continue eternally.

Therefore, it was perfect chance.

A signal with no motive, intention, or purpose caused a faint ripple in his world.

"...!"

The skin of the lump of meat tore horizontally, and for the first time in its life, it began to show signs of movement.

A question.

Certainly, it was a question.

When an eyeball was born, opening wide the horizontally torn shell, tremendous light poured in.

In the beginning was light.

Subsequently, tremendous information rushed in, filling the world of nothingness with presence.

He called this world the universe.

I am existence.

Anke Ra (Eternal and Immortal Ra).

As Venezia collapsed to her knees, Kido, feeling dizzy, vomited what he had eaten.

'This is exactly...'

La Enemy smiled sadly and said.

"Yes, this is me."

Though Kido had vomited everything, new memories were being transmitted from the flesh that had already been digested.

The image of La Enemy sitting like a broken puppet in a dark space appeared.

'This is real!'

It was Ra existing somewhere in reality, not an event.

"Where? Where are you?"

"..."

"Answer me!"

Even amid the flood of memories, Sirone desperately held onto his reason and shouted.

La Enemy shook his head and stepped back.

"I will become a god."

Finally, when all memories were transmitted and he realized Ra's true intention, Kido clutched his head and shouted.

"Sirone! It's dangerous!"

Lufist frowned and deployed Spirit Zone.

'Damn it! So this was the scheme!'

He intended to become Anke Ra again in a human body.

If he couldn't become a god as a concept of totality, he would transform into the most individualistic being and challenge again.

'In the end, La Enemy is...'

It was the totality of events that Anke Ra had experienced from ancient times until now to become a perfect human.

1st Place. La Enemy (19 years old): 98.7 percent.

Recalling the figure confirmed when accepting the Ivory Tower test, Sirone felt his hair stand on end.

'He was almost there!'

Venezia had been right.

A Kar value of 98.7 percent built up through experiencing events.

What could fill the remaining 1.3 percent fragments was not events but vivid memories of the five senses.

Kido grimaced and swung his spear.

'We should never have come here!'

Through the five people - Sirone, Shagal, Kido, Mayray, and Venezia - La Enemy's Kar value was heading toward 100 percent.

"Kill him! If he's completed, it's over!"

Being a perfect human was no different from saying all other humans were wrong.

Therefore, they had no value in existing.

"It was nice meeting you, Sirone."

When La Enemy extended his hand, the scenery began to turn red as if a barrier of air was being peeled away.

"Super Thin Paper."

As the boundary between reality and unreality disappeared, a tremendous army revealed itself.

"Just how many are there?"

Counting roughly, it was an army of easily over a thousand.

Demons with necks long like ropes and bellies bulging out swept across the landscape in an instant.

"Kiaaaaak! Kiaaaaak!"

'Photon Cannon!'

When a barrier of light exploded centered on Sirone, the demons' arms and legs scattered in all directions.

'Where's La Enemy?'

Just as he turned around, a blood-red sword came flying.

"Kruuk!"

"Do not invade our domain!"

A murky voice was translated through the Ultima System.

'What's that now?'

It was a massive warrior with horns protruding at right angles from both temples.

"Lord of Despair, Barsiba."

Behind Sirone, the scenery peeled away and Igor appeared.

"What's going on? What is this army?"

"This world has its own circumstances. I'll handle it."

When Igor gripped his blue flame spear tightly and lunged forward, Barsiba swung his great sword to meet him.

As Sirone bit his lips watching the chaotic melee of friend and foe, a voice came from behind him.

"This is dangerous as it is, Hexa."

A gray-skinned creature over 3 meters tall was approaching with extremely awkward steps by human standards.

"Mayray."

There was no other name to call her.

"Combat doesn't help us. Even at this moment, La Enemy is collecting the five senses."

"Then what do we do? Should we die?"

"That could be one method. But Terraforce is a race that protects order. There's something we expect from you."

"Which is?"

"There's one way to temporarily lower La Enemy's Kar value. But the aftermath that will hit your world will be considerable. It's questionable whether humanity's representative would approve."

"Who's humanity's representative?"

"...There isn't one."

That's why she hadn't revealed it until the end.

"So we decide here. Hexa, you become humanity's representative. And approve it."

"I'm not qualified for that. It's questionable whether others would acknowledge it."

"It doesn't matter. It's not a human problem. It's the law of the Terraforce Supreme Court. Without approval from a species' representative, we absolutely cannot use this method. You are qualified. Decide."

Sirone looked back at the chaos once more.

Everyone was defeating the armies of the hidden world with tremendous force, but the numbers were still increasing.

'If this continues, it's over.'

Having made his decision, Sirone turned his head and said.

"Fine. I'll permit it."

"Approved. Yes, I'll activate it."

Muttering as if communicating with someone, Mayray emitted a terrifying light from her retinas and strode forward.

"I am a Supreme Court Justice of Terraforce."

Her spear-like long hand aimed at the world.

"From now on, I will begin judgment upon all humanity."
