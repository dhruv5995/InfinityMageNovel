[537] Such Problems (1)

The Miro party that had fallen into The Abyss wandered through a ruined world where the sunset glowed.

The form of the apocalypse, completely different from what they had imagined, indicated just how far into the future the information had leaped.

The place they arrived at was a contaminated zone, and everywhere they looked was painted with disgusting mucus.

"Most of the city is like this. What the hell is this stuff?"

When Miro stepped on the mucus with a squelch, slime rose up from all directions and attacked her.

Lian swung his sword and sliced it cleanly, and the mucus that fell to the ground seeped back into the mucus.

Marsha pulled out the pipe she was biting and shouted.

"Ah, seriously! Stop stepping on that! How many times is this now!"

"But it's fun though. Squelch squelch."

Fermi looked across the city and said.

"The sun is setting. We should find a place to rest for now."

Marsha approached while exhaling smoke.

"The surface seems dangerous. Those strange flying things are also concerning."

"How about that cave over there?"

Lian pointed to a subway entrance installed on the sidewalk.

"That's fine. We can't enter the buildings anyway."

Grrrrr.

Just then, a surface creature walked around the corner of a block.

For them, who had expected that the mucus would have driven away all surface creatures despite having arrived here only a few hours ago, this was an unusual event.

"Is it a monster?"

It had a giant face resembling a lion with a mouth torn to the ears and teeth jagged like nails.

It was an Electric Tiger, one of the few walking animals in the apocalypse.

The creature walked straight toward Miro's party regardless of the mucus covering everything around.

Slime splattered without fail, but as bluish electricity crackled from its body, it quickly burned away.

"It's adapted to the environment. It's an electric-type monster for now."

"I'll handle it."

As Lian gripped the handle of his great sword and stepped forward, Fermi raised his hand to stop him.

"No. Every magic has compatibility. In that case, I, who can use all magic, am most suitable."

As Fermi swallowed a chip, the Electric Tiger simultaneously charged while spewing electricity.

'Lightning Thunder.'

As powerful lightning struck down three times with thunderous crashes, the Electric Tiger screamed and collapsed flat on the ground.

"Of course, a true magician breaks through any compatibility."

Marsha pointed accusingly.

"How ridiculous. You're just being stingy with money, right?"

"Of course there's that aspect too."

The corner of Miro's mouth rose.

'Clever fellow.'

The apocalypse was a world made of code.

Therefore, Fermi was trying to confirm whether the electric-type ability was the monster's information or the world's information.

'If it were the monster's information, it would be immune to electricity. But Fermi's lightning struck properly. Therefore, though it's a virtual world, incarnation and law are separated just like in reality.'

Fermi tapped his chin thoughtfully.

'At least for us, death here means death in reality. The key is to find Sirone as quickly as possible.'

Marsha asked.

"By the way, about those casino chips, how many can you swallow?"

"As many as the stomach can hold. However, overuse might cause symptoms like headaches or nausea. Why, are you looking to make a deal?"

"If it's necessary for the operation. I'll think about it for now."

Fermi observed Marsha carefully.

'She said she was an Unregulated Eater.'

Though it used to be a magic extraction method, if she had experienced catharsis, there was a high probability her current ability was different.

"By the way, what's your ability? I feel bad because it seems like only I'm being exposed."

"That's because you're a broker. Product introduction is basic. I can't reveal mine yet. You know the reason, don't you?"

Fermi changed the subject and pointed with his index finger.

"Your tattoo is pretty. Does it have some meaning?"

On the back of Marsha's left hand holding the pipe was a small tattoo.

It was a cross-shaped dagger with the handle part expressed like smoke.

"I got it after leaving Galliant Island. There are several more besides this one. For example... here."

Marsha put her hand into her skirt hem and pushed it deep below her navel.

"Want me to show you if you're curious? Want to check it out?"

At Marsha's meaningful gaze, Fermi shook his head.

"I'll pass. I don't have such hobbies."

Any further interest would be a matter directly connected to life and death.

"Let's go in. The sun is setting."

With Lian in the lead, they descended the subway entrance stairs to find an overturned train in a tunnel with no visible end.

Miro lit up with Shining magic and said.

"Fortunately there's no mucus. Still, let's not get too far from the entrance."

Kyaaaaa!

The moment she finished speaking, a terrible scream came rolling from the other end of the tunnel.

"Please save me! Please!"

"Eat! Eat! We eat!"

As incomprehensible words echoed through the tunnel, Miro's party immediately took combat positions.

"Hey, you there."

A ventilation grate next to the railway fell off with a clatter as a man stuck his face out.

"Don't go that way. You'll be eaten by the underground people. If you want to live, come this way."

'Even if he says that...'

They couldn't trust anyone anyway.

"Kyaaaaa!"

As another scream was heard, Miro made a decision.

"Let's follow him. Whoever we fight, at least the side we can communicate with would be more convenient."

'Come to think of it...'

The man was speaking their language.

When Miro's party jumped down below the ventilation grate, a narrow tunnel continued.

After walking dozens of meters, the man opened an iron door installed in the wall and said.

"Come in. This is my home."

The house, converted from an engine room, was full of items of unknown purpose like digital music players and monitors.

"Honey, what's going on?"

"We have guests. Please prepare some tea."

The man who asked his wife turned to Miro and said.

"It's been a while since I've seen humans. Are you folks Abyss Walkers?"

"Abyss Walkers?"

The man shook his head as if he had started wrong.

"I mean, people who entered through Under Coder. Intact humans without information loss."

Miro said.

"That's right. Then you too?"

"It was quite a long time ago. I don't know how much time has passed in the real world."

When his wife brought out tea, the man offered them seats.

"Sit down. My name is Malta. I'm a magician just like you. This is my wife Curia."

"Hello? I'm Malta's wife."

As Miro sat on the sofa, she asked.

"A magician? But why did you fall here?"

"This world's name is Apocalypse. It's part of The Abyss. Maybe for the same reason as you folks. I entered this place with my own feet to find my wife."

Fermi realized from Curia's lack of reaction even after hearing this story.

'Her information has been lost.'

"My wife in the real world is in a vegetative state. I was quite a successful magician too, so I searched everywhere for a method, but it was futile. So I entered this hell where my wife exists."

"But your wife is..."

"I know she's fake. But what does it matter? You can't imagine how long I've spent in this world. Then suddenly I had this thought. That the me in reality must already be dead. Then everything became clear. That this is where I should stay."

"Is there no way out?"

Malta shook his head.

"There isn't. No matter what means you use, there's no way to escape from The Abyss. Though some lunatic did say strange things."

"A lunatic?"

"It was a human named Gaold. Even I could see he was crazy. His hair was disheveled, his eyes were sunken, and his body was so emaciated that even the underground people wouldn't have anything to tear off and eat."

Miro's eyes sparkled.

"You met him? Where is he now?"

"He already left. He said he was returning to reality, so I asked him how he planned to get out. Do you know what that crazy bastard said?"

Malta spread both arms as if it was absurd.

"He said to get out of hell, you just have to go to the end of hell. Haha! Who couldn't think of that?"

A gentle smile formed on Miro's lips.

'You're still moving forward, Gaold.'

Though the incarnation was asleep, the information that comprised him was reaching toward extremes even in this world of apocalypse.

"Actually, it's not like I didn't try."

Malta spread out a full-sized map he had drawn himself from under the coffee table.

"I went out to try as he said. But I couldn't last even a week. Once you leave the city, it's all desert, desert, desert. That human probably died."

"No, my friend won't die. Not until I die."

Fermi pointed to a dot marked on the map.

"Is this our location?"

"That's right. I investigated thoroughly when I decided to live here. First, this world has many underground facilities. Buildings also have hundreds of rooms. Some places are full of mucus so you can't even enter. They call it mucus here."

"What are the tree symbol and sun symbol?"

"Life trees and colonies."

Malta told them about a race called the Children of the Sun.

"There are 3 life trees in this city, so there are also 3 colonies. Each is ruled by a different consul. They're not particularly warlike, but the problem is the underground people."

"The screams we heard in the cave?"

"Right. They look similar to humans but are agile like they use schema. Since they can't photosynthesize, they mainly hunt. They use strange weapons, so it's best to avoid them if possible."

Having finished what he had to say, the man extended both hands.

"You can take it if you want. It's no use to me anymore anyway."

"Ah, then gratefully..."

The moment Lian reached for the map, Fermi said.

"No, I've memorized it. Let's rest here today and start examining the colonies tomorrow."

"..."

Lian's hand quietly withdrew.

"Resting isn't a problem. You can use it as a forward base too. I'm also happy to meet people after a long time. Excluding that lunatic from before."

"Thank you. Then we'll impose on you for a while."

"Feel free to use the facilities. Thanks to being a magician, there's plenty of water. I also learned how to charge electricity. This world has many convenient things. Use the bathroom if you want to wash."

Marsha, who had been looking at Malta's hospitable smile, puffed on her pipe vigorously then stood up.

"Then I'll wash first. I feel sticky, maybe from the mucus splashing."

"Water will come out when you press the button."

Marsha, who raised her hand in acknowledgment of Malta's consideration, entered the bathroom, turned on the hot water, and undressed.

"Phew, I'm tired."

Entrusting her body to the water droplets pouring from the showerhead, she looked at her body reflected in the full-length mirror.

The tattoos carved on her body numbered seven.

Left hand back, right palm, between the breasts, below the navel, inside the left thigh, above the hip bone, and the last one was in a place not visible to the eye.

Of course, they weren't actually carved on her body, but magical tattoos for activating the Unregulated technique 'Dagger of Unfilial Piety.'

'Sirone...'

The wounds from her adoptive father in childhood had been comforted by the catharsis given by a young boy.

You can kill me.

Of course the trauma hadn't disappeared, but she had developed a mindset to actively overcome past wounds.

It was a life value that couldn't be converted to material worth.

'If I can repay the debt with this...'

When she released the Unregulated technique, the seven tattoos disappeared.

After finishing her shower and drying her body, she carefully discovered an unfamiliar high-tech toilet and sat down with her chin propped.

"By the way, how much will I be able to receive when this job is over? I need to expand the business soon. Hm?"

After finishing her business, Marsha looked around.

"Toilet paper..."

Where toilet paper should normally be, there were green and red buttons.

"What's this?"

When she pressed the green button, high-pressure water shot up from under the toilet seat.

Marsha flinched and stood up with a surprised expression, examining where the water had come from.

"Wh-what? Is it a monster?"

For someone familiar it would be nothing, but for Marsha who had lived in a more primitive past, it was an incredibly humiliating incident.

"To just do this...!"

Though she wanted to smash it, she couldn't damage property while staying as a guest.

"..."

Five minutes later.

"Ah, refreshing."

As Marsha came out drying her hair with a towel as if nothing had happened, Miro, who had been making plans with Fermi, turned her head.

"Was the water okay?"

"It was clean. Oh, right. Miss Miro."

"Yeah?"

A sly smile like a cat appeared on Marsha's lips.

"Don't you need to use the bathroom?"

That night at midnight.

A giant sphere of light rose over the northwestern colony of the city.
