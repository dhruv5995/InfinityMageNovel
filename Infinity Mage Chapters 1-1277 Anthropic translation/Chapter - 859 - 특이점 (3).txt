Singularity (3)

Through Seongeum's sacrifice, the Light Spring Castle was activated.

The spatial distortion brought the borders of Gustav and Jincheon together, but the sea itself hadn't disappeared.

Fierce battles still raged in Jincheon's western sea, and demons endlessly poured onto the white sandy beach.

"Hold the line! We just need to hold out a little longer!"

Their purpose was to buy time until Jincheon's elite forces could capture Gustav.

In this battle that would determine the survival of both empires, the overwhelmingly dominant side was hell's army.

"Kekekeke! Watching humans struggle like this is disgusting when you see them all together. Don't they look just like bugs?"

A massive demon with a protruding round jaw sat cross-legged on a giant clam shell.

Hell's Army 8th Corps Commander Mitura.

The demon was a tsunami incarnate, keeping a giant cleaver beside him that a normal human couldn't even lift.

"I'm getting hungry! Let's eat something!"

At Mitura's command, the demons attending him caught a creature from the ocean depths.

"Kyaak!"

It was a mermaid with a beautiful human upper body and a fish-like tail below.

"Please spare me!"

Living in environments with water pressure that humans couldn't survive, they were rarely documented academically.

The mermaid's face was pitiful as she wept and begged, but to Mitura, she was merely an ingredient.

"Shut up! I can't pass up such a delicacy."

Grabbing the mermaid's hair, he slammed her against the giant clam's shell and raised his cleaver.

"Please! Please!"

He pressed down on the mermaid's head and brought the cleaver down with a thud, severing her tail.

"Kyaaaaaaak!"

Her upper body writhed in pain and terror, while the separated lower half flopped about in shock.

"Let's see..."

Mitura grabbed the tail fin and bit into the bleeding cross-section.

The cold fish flesh melted smoothly on his tongue.

"Mmmmm..."

The mermaid who had been watching her own body being devoured rolled her eyes back and fainted.

She wouldn't live much longer.

"Not bad."

Having quickly chewed and swallowed half the tail, Mitura threw the remainder into the sea and stood up.

"Shall we get started?"

Even without opening the demon realm, he could easily create a tsunami to sweep away the beach.

"Hoooooo!"

A massive radius began to ripple, and seawater started rising on those waves.

Though weak now, by the time it reached land, it would be a 200-meter-high tsunami.

"Commander! Over there...!"

Jincheon's army fighting on the beach lost their will to fight upon seeing the approaching tsunami.

"Damn it all!"

It was already work enough cutting down house-sized demons, and now a natural disaster was bearing down on them.

"Is this the end?"

If the western sea fell, the 8th Corps demons would instantly sweep away the imperial capital Yeomra.

"Uaaaaah!"

Just as the soldiers, drained of strength by nature's overwhelming force, screamed and fled.

Ding-a-ling.

A bell sound was heard.

Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

Though the noise of war was tremendous, the soldiers could clearly hear that clear, delicate sound.

"What is that?"

Where the commander looked, a neat-looking man with his hair tied up on top of his head stood holding a fan.

Ivory Tower 3-star resident Arte.

And on his shoulder was a small creature with red skin swishing a long tail.

"Over 200 meters? Can you really block it?"

It was Arte's satellite, Tokay.

"Ma... that's a demon?"

As the commander stared in surprise, Arte began walking.

"200 meters. A bit difficult."

Arte raised his fan above his head.

"Just a bit?"

As he lowered his arms with sleeves fluttering like a dance, time seemed to slow down.

The sight of water flowing down from the surface of the tsunami's massive wall was clearly visible.

"Wind Scene."

Arte's magic was unique in that it utilized differences in air pressure rather than air flow.

As a pressure trough formed, the atmosphere in a radius as vast as the tsunami began twisting at tremendous speed.

Whooooooooooong!

A sound like the world splitting rang out, and the soldiers, their hearing paralyzed by shock, saw the sea spread wide open.

"The... the tsunami..."

Like being hit by a small typhoon, the wall of water was destroyed and heavy rain like hail poured down.

"Whew."

As Arte finished his dance moves, the refreshing bell sound rang out ding-a-ling once more.

The commander, coming to his senses, asked.

"Who are you? How did you manage such..."

"I'm from the Ivory Tower."

Arte's expression wasn't good.

'Saving lives and making the world better. I have no objection to humanity's ideal, but...'

It was unprecedented for all the stars of the Ivory Tower to join Sirone's cause and engage in total war.

"There's no choice, is there?"

Tokay found the current situation quite interesting.

"Stagnant water is bound to rot. The new current called Sirone will change the Ivory Tower."

That's why the Five Great Stars had also joined the war to prove their philosophies anew.

"I know that too."

The commander approached.

"What should we do now? We blocked the tsunami, but second and third waves will come."

Arte walked toward the sea, raising his fan.

"Ghost Goblin Arte joins the war against the demons."

The pupils in Tokay's marble-like large eyes rotated rapidly, calculating wind elements.

"320893. 23091. 3494539. Trajectory angle 23 degrees..."

Arte's magic targeted not hell's army, but the Gustav Empire across the sea.

"At least Category Six level wind power. Can you do it?"

"I told you."

Arte's face, which never showed emotion outwardly, crumpled like a ghost.

"I'm joining the war."

The moment the fan passed from right to left, the soldiers felt all the air being pushed away.

"Weather Magic, Great Wind Scene."

Kwakwakwakwakwakwakwak!

A whirlpool formed by the pressure difference rose up from the middle of the sea, sucking in water.

The wind grew stronger, and finally the surrounding demons began being sucked into the whirlpool.

"What... what is that?"

The whirlpool's size was growing exponentially, but even that speed was nothing compared to the completed result.

"It's a typhoon."

The Great Wind Scene would travel thousands of kilometers and strike Gustav with empire-level force.

Arte raised his fan again.

"Here comes another. I'll blow it all away."

Watching Tokay roll his eyes, the commander gulped.

'Crazy bastards. Attacking across the sea?'

Massive storms were flying one after another toward the Gustav Empire where Sirone and Rian were.

Feeling Sirone's gaze piercing the back of her head, Merania pleaded even more pitifully.

"If it could calm your anger, I wouldn't mind being torn to pieces right here. So please, forgive me."

She didn't expect this to calm Sirone's rage.

'But it will have an effect.'

When raging in fury, you can't feel fatigue, but the moment reason returns, the aftermath is unavoidable.

'He's wavering. That's enough. He's been destroying the world for over a day now, so he can't be fine.'

Merania raised her head.

"Yahweh—!"

Sirone kicked her in the face.

Though a mage's kick was light as a feather, her eyes as she turned her head were filled with shock.

"Enough of that."

If he was going to waver over words like these, he wouldn't have abandoned Yahweh in the first place.

"I don't believe it. Whatever those words might be. No, even if they were true, I'd deny them."

'It's not working.'

Sirone was human too, so continuing like this would cost him his life.

'But then there would be no demons either.'

Sirone conjured a Photon Cannon above his palm.

"Just die."

In the critical moment, a thought flashed rapidly through Merania's mind.

"It can be reversed!"

"What?"

Sirone's expression changed for the first time.

"The woman who sealed the Spirit Zone is currently wandering hell. But it can be reversed."

"Seongeum..."

The Photon Cannon disappeared.

"You can save her?"

Since any small mistake could ruin everything, Merania spoke truthfully.

"I can't guarantee that. However, if it's about liberating her from hell—"

Sirone grabbed Merania by the collar and lifted her up.

"Tell me. What's the method?"

"Breaking through Purgatory."

"Purgatory."

The twelve apostles who guard each 0.666 seconds.

"The Spirit Zone is closed, but if you could pass through time not covered by the law, you could extract her spirit too."

"How do I break through?"

Even Sirone couldn't perceive Purgatory.

"Even corps commanders don't know Purgatory's true nature."

There were only theories about dragons, the counterpoint to the twelve apostles who guard time.

"Then this doesn't make sense."

As Sirone raised his hand again, unable to contain his anger, Merania hurriedly said.

"But they certainly follow Satan's commands. And right now, this was the crucial moment.

"Someone granted Purgatory's authority is staying in the human imperial capital. If you meet him, you'll find out."

Sirone looked into Merania's eyes.

Beautiful eyes without 1% falsehood, but demons had deceived with such eyes anyway.

"...Who is it?"

"A human named Supreme Commander Ogent Gai."

The thought flashed that this was Rian's older brother whom he'd met before, but it was only momentary.

"A human has the authority?"

"Since Satan, Lord Harvitz, is human. Purgatory isn't a concept controlled by corps commanders. Exactly speaking, it's something Military Officer Balkan left behind as a precaution—"

Sirone released his grip on her collar.

"Guide me to where Ogent Gai is."

Whatever part was true, there was no option to turn back when there was a way to save Seongeum.

"Y-yes."

Merania stood up, bowing her head, then looked around at the demons and gave orders.

"Everyone withdraw. From this moment on, I'll personally kill anyone who fights humans."

Though the demons were clearly displeased, they couldn't disobey their corps commander's orders.

Like cockroaches hiding in corners, all the demons that had surrounded them scattered.

"Let's go. I'll guide you."

"If you're lying..."

Sirone said with intensity in his eyes.

"I'll stake everything I have to make you suffer the worst possible fate."

Emotions too vast were difficult to express in words, and Merania gulped.

'It doesn't matter.'

If it could stop Yahweh's anger for even one second.

Imperial Capital Marsak's Command Room.

Ogent Gai, who had come here to prepare for battle, was lost in thought as he donned his armor.

'Family.'

Black hair and blue hair, different personalities each, but they'd had a fairly good relationship as he remembered.

'Rian.'

No talent for swords and no sense, but somehow an endearing guy.

'Is this the age of blue hair for Ogent too?'

The reason his heart swelled was surely because they were family, but even such thoughts were a luxury.

'I want to become stronger. Isn't that natural for a swordsman?'

He had abandoned family, country, and even his character to side with demons in pursuit of strength.

"I need to end this war."

As Gai turned around after fastening his sword to his waist, a red whirlpool appeared before his eyes.

"What?"

His brow furrowed as 2nd Corps Commander Merania walked out of the whirlpool.

"Why is a demon..."

Behind her, Sirone followed with cold eyes.
