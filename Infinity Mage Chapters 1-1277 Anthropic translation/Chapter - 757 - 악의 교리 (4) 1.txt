[757] The Doctrine of Evil (4)

"Who is that woman?"

As the military police moved to surround her, the captain raised his hand to stop them.

"Stop."

It was a strange feeling.

And the fact that he felt something strange meant that the military police captain possessed senses far superior to the other officers.

'What the hell is this?'

He felt like vomiting, and once he realized that, his head became unbearably dizzy.

"What are you doing! Hurry up and attack! Sic! Sic!"

Hearing the noisy commotion from the Beast Corps, he slowly turned his head with a hardened expression.

It was a shocking sight.

"Wh-why is this thing acting like this?"

The mutant poison hounds, improved again and again using Garas, were designed to be braver than wild beasts and absolutely obedient to their master's commands.

"Move! I said move!"

But even when beaten on the rump with a whip lined with leather straps, they just stared into the distance.

As if desperately denying the woman before their eyes.

'They're afraid.'

The nauseating aura the military police captain had felt - some unknown force was spreading from her body.

"Dogs are better than humans."

As Minerva approached, the mutant poison hounds scattered stealthily to the corners of the forest as if they had urgent business elsewhere.

Their movement, unable to even show their extreme fear, resembled the psychology of those who fed the creatures in Garas's warehouse.

"Ugh!"

As Minerva passed by, the military police captain finally couldn't hold back and spewed out stomach acid.

"C-Captain?"

The subordinates looked bewildered, but the captain didn't envy them at all for not feeling the terror.

'I lived because I vomited.'

In about three more minutes, his subordinates would die instantly, crushed by the woman's aura without even knowing why.

"Come here, cute puppies."

If caught, they would die.

The mutant poison hounds, realizing this instinctively, pretended to be distracted, sniffing flowers in an uncharacteristic manner.

One mutant poison hound that could emit powerful poison tried to slowly increase the distance but was eventually caught by her hand.

Instead of even thinking to flee with its powerful legs, it accepted her touch, and its broad dog legs bent all the way to the ground.

'She's death itself.'

Just how many lives would one have to kill to carry such an aura in their body?

Beautiful appearance, witch's attire.

'Miracle Minerva.'

The military police captain realized that Amy's survival was hopeless.

"Oh my."

The mutant poison hound trembled with its hind legs completely down, then hot urine began dripping to the ground.

"Are you scared? Of me?"

Whine, whiiine...!

Water leaked from the eyes, nose, and mouth of the dog that had aged twenty years, and the military police officers collapsed one by one, their eyes rolling back.

"Yes, let's see."

Minerva walked toward the rear and bent down to examine beneath where the urine was dripping.

"It's a male."

Yelp! Yelp-yelp-yelp!

The mutant poison hound let out its final scream.

"Die."

As if a switch had been flipped, the dog's eyes immediately rolled back and it collapsed to the side with a thud.

"Good heavens..."

Jacy, leaning against a tree trunk, watched in disbelief as lives died all around her.

Beast Corps members and military police officers collapsed, coughing up blood, and finally the mutant poison hounds died in convulsions.

"Even if you're from the Ivory Tower..."

The sole surviving military police captain glared at Minerva while breathing heavily.

"It can't be stopped now. Under President Igor's grace, the North Almond Republic will dominate the world."

"Sure."

Minerva snapped her fingers, and the military police captain's life left his body.

"Go do lots of world domination in the afterlife."

Jacy, the only one left alive, asked breathlessly.

"Are you... perhaps a resident of the Ivory Tower?"

Minerva took out a pipe from her broomstick's holder, put it in her mouth, and lit it.

'Is she ignoring me?'

Jacy spoke again.

"If so, you must attack North Almond quickly! Otherwise the Garas will invade the world!"

Minerva exhaled smoke with a weary expression and said.

"I know."

Then she slowly approached Jacy, met her eye level, and immediately slapped her cheek.

With a sharp slap, Jacy's head turned, and after a moment of bewilderment, she immediately snapped back.

"Why did you hit me! Someone who can't even move!"

Minerva hated humans.

If humans were creatures who thought 'If I say it this way, they'll move that way for me'...

She felt disgustingly nauseated to the point of getting goosebumps.

'I'd rather roll around with dogs.'

Still, Minerva didn't show it.

"Sorry. I was wondering if this might work."

Jacy bit her teeth in frustration but had no intention of confronting the witch who had subdued mutant poison hounds with her aura alone.

"I know you. The Grand Witch, Miracle Minerva."

Most of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars were shrouded in mystery, but Minerva was the person who had debuted most spectacularly in Ivory Tower history.

"What will you do now? Go to Igor and tell him to stop the experiments? Or..."

"I'll handle it myself."

Honestly, nothing was decided yet, but once she went to the capital and met the president, everything would be resolved.

"Please take me with you."

Minerva's eyes grew coldly sharp.

"...And the reason I should?"

"Because I know facts you don't know yet. You'll probably face setbacks if you go to the capital like this."

"Kekekekeke!"

The witch's laughter echoed through the forest.

"Listen, little missy. Oh, sorry. You're older than me. Though I'm much younger at face value, of course."

"..."

"Anyway, if you knew what kind of life Grand Witch Minerva has lived, you wouldn't dare use the word 'setbacks.'"

The aura of death could be felt.

"You think you can do anything as long as your mouth works even if you can't move your limbs. That's what you people are like. If you make me any more disgusted, you'll follow those humans."

"Kill..."

A voice choked with tears burst out.

"I want to kill them! Those damn northerners who killed my husband! I want to kill every last one of them!"

Jacy pleaded with a distorted face.

"Please take me! I have nothing left! If I can kill even one more person, I'll give my soul...!"

Anger.

The only purely human emotional state that Minerva didn't find disgusting.

"...Tell me what you know."

Jacy quickly came to her senses.

"The military police captain said there are eyes even where they can't see. The North is using the Other World. Otherwise, there's no way my identity would have been exposed."

"Maybe you're just bad at your job."

"What do you take me for! I'm someone who has mastered all magic related to espionage!"

No matter how much she raged, nothing got through to Minerva.

"Sigh, fine. So you're saying there's a possibility Igor has allied with the demons."

Even if not a complete setback, it was certainly a troublesome matter.

"I'll take you."

Minerva, who had deeply inhaled the cigarette smoke, whispered quietly while gathering smoke between her lips.

"Open your mouth."

As if entranced, Jacy parted her lips, and Minerva tilted her face and kissed her.

'Ah...'

The scent of the smoke entering through her lungs was like burning grass, and Jacy fell into an ecstasy she had never experienced in her life.

Detoxification Magic.

The witch's breath.

She briefly lost consciousness, but it was only for an instant.

"Done. You should be able to move now."

Sensation returned from her toes, and strength entered her muscles as if nothing had happened.

Jacy stood up awkwardly and was at a loss for words.

"Um, well..."

The kiss wasn't the problem.

She couldn't lift her face because she had felt supreme pleasure through the witch's body.

"Do not sleep with a witch."

Countless humans had their lives ruined by being enchanted by the sweetness witches offered, at least in Minerva's case.

"...I hate humans."

Leaving behind Jacy, who was nodding blankly, Minerva concentrated magic power into her broomstick.

The shabby wooden material exploded with a pop and transformed into a 2-meter-long staff with a propulsion system on the back.

The ultimate projectile created by the intelligence of the Great Star in exchange for abandoning <Berserk>, the Jet (Z).

It was officially registered with the Ivory Tower, making it an absolutely reliable means of transportation.

"Get on. We'll stop by military facilities before entering the capital."

Minerva gracefully sat on the Jet floating at 1 meter height, resting her thigh on it.

"Ah, yes."

Since it was introduced in history books as the fastest thing in the world, Jacy also swallowed nervously and sat in the back seat.

"Um, should I hold on? If I fall..."

"No need."

The Jet briefly glowed purple, then her body was fixed as if trapped in a soft mold without needing to exert any force.

"Here we go."

The moment Minerva's words fell, tremendous flames erupted from the Jet's propulsion system.

"Kyaaaah!"

Even though she could barely feel inertia, Jacy screamed at the sight of the sky rapidly approaching.

'Too fast!'

As the Jet circled the sky once and began to seriously pick up speed, a sonic boom exploded in just 4 seconds.

It was Mach speed.

Verdi's mother, who had discovered Baseto with a vacant expression, covered her mouth with tears streaming down.

"Honey..."

What on earth had happened to make a person end up in such a state?

"Those terrible people..."

Baseto had a vacant expression as if in shock, and his eyes were so swollen from crying.

"I need to bring my husband. He'll die at this rate."

The moment Verdi's mother, having lost her reason, stepped forward, Shirone spoke in a cold voice.

"Don't move."

Verdi's mother flinched and stopped walking.

"Since he seems safe for now, let's watch patiently. If we cause a commotion here, more people will become victims."

The spirit of universal love meant not killing others to save Baseto.

'This is really strange.'

But the biggest reason Shirone still didn't take action was something else.

'There are too many demons.'

In the Other World viewed through the senses of Bakji, demons were patrolling in pairs.

'But this is outside the spiritual realm?'

The Other World shared spatial coordinates with reality, but since the altar opened, they had tried to keep their distance.

Thinking he couldn't take everyone, Shirone looked back at Albas and said.

"Please protect Verdi and his mother. I'll follow them and bring back Mr. Baseto."

"But how will you go? From here on, there's nowhere to hide. This is a supply route for storing large logistics."

An open field where ten carriages could pass side by side stretched endlessly.

"That's in terms of space."

Albas tilted his head, but he wouldn't understand even if explained.

'Super Aeni Bardo.'

Combining Bakji and Shipok, reality and the Other World overlapped, and Shirone's figure disappeared.

"This can't be..."

Albas looked around.

"Where did he go?"

Of course, Shirone was still beside them, and after checking the demons' positions, he patted Verdi's head.

"Wait a little. I'll definitely save your dad."

Verdi immediately had an answer.

"Where would he go?"

Why did his heart suddenly feel so full?

"Obviously to save our dad."
