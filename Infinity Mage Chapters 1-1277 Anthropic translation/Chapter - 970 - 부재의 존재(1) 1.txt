The Presence of Absence (1)

Aetra, who had spread Breath and the Healing of Life across all of Bashka, landed beside Miro's group.

"Phew."

She wiped her sweat with a smile as she returned to her cute appearance with twin-braided hair.

"Hehe, I should get praise from the Messiah."

Miro approached her.

"Ultra-high-speed activation, I see."

"Yeah. Life force increases by about 200,000 times."

"200,000..."

Just imagining that number, it seemed capable of healing any wound short of death itself.

"Good effect, right? Plus, since it strengthens the immune system, it can cure diseases and poison too."

Miro spoke with genuine admiration.

"Invincible?"

"In a way. But..."

Aetra's eyes filled with sadness as she looked toward people in the corners of the city.

Among those intoxicated by the joy of victory, there were still those who couldn't smile.

Those who had lost family, those driven mad by terror, those who had suffered terrible things at the hands of demons.

Though not as much as Taesung, Aetra also felt maternal compassion for their miserable reality.

"I can't heal wounded minds."

"Wouldn't White Dragon be able to?"

White Dragon Astraiker, who dealt with soul information.

"Probably not. Her極號 could make them feel better, but it can't erase the wounds carved into their minds."

It would be no different from doing drugs to forget pain.

"I see."

Miro changed the subject.

"I heard there's a charging time?"

"For Healing of Life, it's 100 hours. I have the longest among the 12 Apostles."

"100 hours. About 4 days from now?"

Aetra grasped the true meaning behind Miro's question.

"Right. It's definitely an ability that's hard to time during battle. But the Messiah told me to use it generously when needed. He said not to worry about efficiency when it comes to saving lives."

It was a very Sirone-like thought, and Miro agreed.

"But 4 days is..."

Miro's eyes widened as her head turned rapidly, and lightning struck where her gaze stopped.

"Blitz?"

Aetra asked with a tilted head, but Blitz was too tense to explain.

"They're coming."

"Coming? What's coming?"

A roar erupted from Bashka's walls, and Miro's eyes turned cold.

"Already?"

Heaven's army, scattered across the world by Hand of God, had returned.

'They must have flown at least thousands of kilometers.'

If Hexa was the ultimate action of the mind, then the stronger they were, the farther they would have flown.

'Then the one who arrived first would be...'

Ironically.

"Kahahaha!"

It was someone who could be presumed to be the strongest even among Heaven's army.

"Come out!"

As Imir's voice spread through the air, glass windows in every building throughout Bashka city shattered.

Miro cursed and cast Mass Teleport, taking the group that had gathered.

Upon arriving in front of the walls, Garcia's coalition forces were already swarming Imir.

"Playing pathetic games?"

Each time Imir spun in place and threw jabs, coalition soldiers' heads exploded in succession.

"Garcia!"

Even hearing Miro's voice, Garcia only glared at Imir.

He was angry.

'Why?'

The sight of a being who had blown away the demon army in one strike exchanging blows with coalition soldiers...

'Is he mocking us?'

No, it didn't feel like that.

Imir simply seemed to be purely enjoying this situation, this current battle.

"Let's go! We are humanity's guardians!"

The coalition forces, having seen blood so far, forgot their fear and charged at Imir.

And with each honest strike, strike, strike from Imir, bodies inevitably burst.

........

Garcia's nose bridge wrinkled.

"Uaaaah!"

He was angry without reason, and the magnitude of his rage was greater than meeting his parents' killer.

"Wait!"

Garcia ignored Miro's voice, and Miro clicked her tongue as she quickly followed.

Enox, representative of the fairy race, approached beside her.

"Let's attack together."

They too were vaguely aware of the intense discomfort rising in their hearts.

'Hellfire!'

As Garcia's fire magic exploded, Enox stirred up wind and dove in.

Ancient magic using wind spirits clawed at Imir, and Thousand-Hand Avalokitesvara rained attacks down madly on top of that.

A dust cloud rose, then scattered with a pop like an explosion.

'No impact?'

Imir, who had expanded the air with muscle vibrations, was walking over the coalition's corpses.

"Come at me."

At that point, Garcia, Enox, and even Miro stepped back.

Lian took Imir into his sight.

'I don't know.'

Even before Hand of God had blown him away, he had briefly exchanged moves with him, but this feeling was a first.

'I can't feel anything.'

Though his ability to gauge capabilities wasn't exceptional, he could at least distinguish between strong and weak.

But from Imir, he could feel neither strength nor weakness, neither fear nor killing intent, nor even hostility.

"Ah..."

Anger also welled up in Lian's heart.

'So that's what it was.'

Just as one cannot see something very far away, everyone here couldn't feel Imir.

"Kekeke, what are you doing? Hurry up and come at me!"

The same thought occurred to all of them as they stepped back as much as Imir approached.

'Why does something like this exist?'

The reason they were angry was because Imir's very existence was negating them.

'Imir shouldn't exist. Because...'

The moment they acknowledged his existence, all matter except him would have no value in existing.

"Puu!"

Seeing them continue to create distance, Imir looked up at the sky and exhaled.

"I understand what you fear."

Looking forward again, Imir's eyes held 1 percent expectation and 99 percent emptiness.

"It's something like this. You don't want to die. You don't want to be annihilated. You want to continue your thoughts."

Imir's steps came to an abrupt halt.

"But that desire exists because you feel something called life. As for me, I can't feel anything."

Just as humans couldn't feel Imir, Imir couldn't properly sense the universe either.

"It was thrilling."

The memory most intensely remaining in Imir's mind was the strike Augent had delivered.

Even now, thinking of that moment, the spot where his molar had been knocked out throbbed vividly.

"You promised me. That you would definitely return."

Imir's gaze moved toward the blue-haired swordsman standing behind Miro.

"Keep your promise."

Deliberating wasn't like Lian, but this time he was lost in thought for a long time.

Finally, as he took a step, Miro said:

"Let's do this together. You can't catch him alone."

"I know."

He wasn't foolish enough to show pride against a formidable enemy he couldn't even feel fear toward.

"But I can't retreat. I can't take another path either."

Lian, having passed everyone, took the lead.

"This is the final destination."

Miro knew.

How much courage it would take to get to that distance—just 2 meters from Imir.

"It was thrilling earlier."

Imir said.

"But that was the thrill of meeting Augent. Now, to satisfy me, that level won't do."

"Don't worry."

The great straight sword was drawn at invisible speed.

"I'll fight you until death."

A horizon was drawn across the landscape, and with Imir at the center where the world separated into top and bottom.

As shock traveled along the great straight sword embedded in his forearm, Lian's right elbow burst.

"Keuuuu!"

The advantage of Denai was ignoring inertia.

With his sword against Imir's arm, Lian twisted his upper body with all his conviction.

"Uaaaah!"

The twisting of laws distorted the world as Imir's body began to be pushed back.

"Hehehe."

Imir, who had been trembling his shoulders slightly, wickedly tore his mouth corners as he leaned forward.

"This is ridiculous."

Simultaneously, his other forearm rose and struck Lian's body at tremendous speed.

As Lian momentarily stepped back and raised his great straight sword defensively, the fist hit the blade.

A shockwave erupted.

His brain couldn't perceive time, and the standards for fast and slow completely disappeared.

'I'm sleepy.'

Through half-closed eyelids, he could see thousands of Tess spinning around laughing.

'I want to sleep...'

His eyes wouldn't close.

'I want to close my eyes. I'm so tired. Why can't I lie down? I can't sleep standing up.'

Lian waited calmly.

'I should go home. Sister Reina doesn't seem to be at the royal castle. Should I take Sirone?'

Yet the next moment didn't come.

'I'm bored.'

Having nothing more to think about, Lian began counting numbers from 1 arbitrarily.

'...two thousand three hundred twenty-one, two thousand three hundred twenty-two.'

How much time had passed?

'Uaaaah! Uaaaah! Uaaaah!'

Lian had an intuition.

Perhaps this state where time didn't flow might continue forever.

'Move! I said move!'

The brain had forgotten time.

'I can't escape.'

The fact that he had to experience this moment endlessly was terrifying.

"Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha!"

Countless faces of Tess, only heads remaining, filled the sky, bursting with maniacal laughter.

There was Tess inside Tess's mouth, and Tess inside Tess's mouth, and Tess inside Tess's mouth...

'I'm going insane.'

What was keeping Lian trapped in time?

'Obsession.'

Even though his body, mind, and heart were already destroyed with no power left to move.

'I want to achieve something here.'

An absolutely immutable idea was binding Lian at the midpoint between life and death.

The universe was filled with Tess's face, and it was on the verge of exploding from her laughter.

'Ah...'

At the peak of that madness, Lian finally grasped the true meaning of what Augent had conveyed.

'I, in order to reach where I want to go...'

How much could he give up?

Giving up a happy life, giving up the woman he loved, giving up his lifespan, giving up his body.

'I gave up being human.'

If he still couldn't reach it, perhaps the choice remaining to him was one of two.

Give up the obsession, or give up everything except the obsession.

'I advance!'

As consciousness dwelt in Lian's eyes, time finally began accelerating toward the future.

'So that's what it was.'

It was the process of Imir's fist striking the undestroyed great straight sword, bursting 80% of Lian's body.

'It doesn't matter.'

The moment the single-minded intent to cut dwelt in the great straight sword, shock appeared in Imir's eyes.

'What is this now?'

Even as Lian's body flew away like porridge, the great straight sword was being drawn.

'What's left?'

What remains in the place where the body disappeared?

'Obsession.'

It was an eerie obsession.

The moment he realized it, Imir clearly saw the phantom of someone crouched, drawing in the great straight sword.

'Augent.'

An unforgettable realm was felt through his entire body, making all his hair stand on end.

Lian, having lost his body, gritted his teeth.

'I cut!'

Divine Transcendence.

Divine Sword Unity.

The great straight sword cut through the atmosphere at a speed that far transcended biological limits.

An ordinary sword would have had its iron melt from friction heat before reaching halfway, but...

'This is my conviction.'

⟨Idea⟩ cannot be destroyed.

The speed at which the shock raced wasn't something mere sound could follow, and in that moment of silence, Imir used all his strength to arch his upper body back wide.

'What?'

He definitely thought he had dodged.

But looking back, countless great straight swords were rushing in across all space.

'It destroyed my perception.'

Natasha called this negation beating.

The next moment, the atmosphere exploded with a roar.

It was undoubtedly a breaking of boundaries.
