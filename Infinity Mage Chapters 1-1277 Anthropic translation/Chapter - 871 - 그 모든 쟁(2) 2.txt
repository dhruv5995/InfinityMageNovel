All That Struggle (2)

Havitz regained consciousness after three days. While no fatal incidents occurred to him, Vulcan couldn't help but wonder if that would truly remain the case.

'What if he took his own life?' Or something equivalent to that.

"I'm bored to death. When are we going to fight?"

Smodo twisted his waist as if feeling restless.

"We've already missed our timing. The next advance won't happen until all the corps commanders are assembled."

"This is maddening. Isn't there anything fun to do?" Zetaro said.

"There's nothing we can do right now. Find something to entertain yourselves in the barracks."

"Damn! Fine, Natasha. Come with me."

Natasha pointed to herself.

"Why me? I'm tired right now."

"What's the point of being friends then?"

Without warning, Smodo grabbed Natasha's wrist and dragged her into a room.

"Hiiing."

Natasha followed with a tearful expression, while Zetaro shrugged his shoulders and left for a walk.

Only Vulcan remained, watching the back of Havitz who sat crouched outside the tent.

'I wonder what he's thinking.'

A woman's voice was heard.

"Is it okay for you to be moving around already?"

The woman walking over while breastfeeding a baby was named Deris.

Unlike when they first met, she had lost weight.

"Why? Are you worried?"

"Not particularly."

Deris asked while soothing her nursing child.

"Why do you people fight? It's like you're desperate to kill people."

"If you don't like it, you can leave."

"Where would I go? Where else would treat me as well as here? I feel like a queen."

"Then you're on our side too."

Deris looked back at Havitz.

"He doesn't seem like a bad person."

"Good and evil are merely standards humans use to judge other humans. If only one person existed in the world, they could perform neither good nor evil."

Because no others would exist.

"Of course, killing people is wrong. But from a cosmic perspective, there's no essential difference between killing a person and kicking a stone on the roadside."

"Why do we need to view things from a cosmic perspective?"

"...Because that's where the answers lie."

Where did humans come from?

"There are people like me too. Rather than everyone doing good, I simply thought it would be easier if one evil remained."

Vulcan pointed at Havitz.

"You said he doesn't seem like a bad guy, right? That's because Havitz possesses an evil that transcends humanity. Killing 100 million people, violating women and children - those are evils that presuppose others."

"Is that person different?"

"Havitz's thinking assumes a state where all humans have disappeared. His desire is so enormous that it appears as if he desires nothing at all. Of course, if humanity were to perish, the standards of good and evil that define him would completely disappear as well..."

While Deris remained silent, unable to understand, Vulcan fell into thought.

'He said they were connected.'

Link.

If humans were to achieve an integrated mental system, the standards of good and evil would disappear as well.

'No, haven't they already achieved it?'

The Gaians had reached the ultimate state.

'Something that originally existed but was lost. A specific event that evaporated between Gaia and humanity.'

Missing Link.

'What happened?'

Why do humans fight over standards of good and evil, separated into countless individualities?

The first humans would have known.

Maya, who had made a name for herself in the World Beauty Contest, had invitations booked for numerous events in foreign countries.

Of course, most of those nations had now disappeared.

"Damn! How can there be such rotten luck!"

At a meeting of Maya's team, agency CEO Palmers exploded in frustration.

"It would have been a complete jackpot! If we hadn't been defeated by the demons, we could have made a fortune!"

The coordinator said:

"With so many casualties, how can you talk about money? We should be grateful that Tormia is still intact."

"I'm someone who donated condolence money in the company's name too. Either way, the living have to keep living. All the events have been canceled - at this rate, the company will go bankrupt."

The manager said:

"How about changing our approach? Events have been canceled left and right, but consolation performances are thriving. If we connect with the holy war and perform for soldiers..."

"Oh?"

Palmers' eyes lit up.

"That's not just a good idea - it's not just good at all. Maya would definitely be a hit."

With both her singing ability and outstanding looks.

"The problem is that the competition is fierce. Not only do we need proposals from the holy war, but to make soldiers go wild, just singing well isn't enough."

That was exactly the one concern.

"You mean she'd have to show skin."

The coordinator said:

"I've seen consolation performances before. Exposure isn't the problem. The way they dance so provocatively - watching it made my face burn."

"Really? How was the reaction?"

"It was incredible. The cheering was so loud I thought my eardrums would burst."

While Maya bit her lip in thought, the manager spoke cautiously:

"We'd have to match at least that level. Valkyrie is a military force. If we can't boost the soldiers' morale, they definitely won't hire Maya."

"Mmm."

Palmers, who had subtle feelings for Maya, wasn't pleased.

But he was a businessman.

'We can't ignore the audience's needs. We have to compromise to a certain extent.'

That would be better for Maya too.

"Let's think about costumes that match the songs. Not too sexy - something lively yet healthy."

After Maya's team put their heads together, a rough concept emerged.

"The shoulder line, collarbone, and upper chest would be exposed, and instead of wearing shorts, we'd make the skirt as short as possible."

The key point was the chest.

"Maya, what do you think?"

When there was no answer as expected, Palmers clasped his hands together with a pleading expression.

"I know you want to compete with your singing. I promised you that too. But we need to seize this opportunity while you have recognition. Just the upper chest, okay? Let's stop right there."

"That won't work."

Palmers sighed.

"Ah. Yeah, honestly I also..."

"Hear me out. What I mean is, this approach is too half-hearted. There's no distinctiveness."

Maya, as someone who sang with her life on the line, thought she had to try whatever it took.

"But if we lower the line even more..."

It might explode in popularity, but he couldn't let the agency's diva be consumed that way.

"How about this instead? Rather than covering the upper chest, what if we exposed the lower chest?"

Maya's arms moved left and right around her chest area.

"Huh? The lower part?"

At first, he didn't understand.

But as the image gradually formed in his mind, he shuddered as if struck by lightning.

"...That's incredibly provocative."

The coordinator and manager nodded in agreement.

It was just a difference between upper and lower, but no one had ever attempted such a costume before.

Palmers asked with a dazed expression:

"Maya, are you really confident about this?"

"Honestly, it's unfamiliar, but with practice..."

"No, I mean your chest. You know, what should I call it - the line? There needs to be some elasticity too."

"Well, yes..."

She had never thought about it.

"It's just a woman's chest."

That level of confidence was enough.

"Perfect, we're set! This will definitely work! Manager, start choreographing right away, and coordinator, begin costume production! I'll go meet with Valkyrie officials."

Palmers excitedly rushed out of the room.

Three days later, a pre-scheduled performance was held in Bashka, the capital of Tormia.

Although the entertainment industry's scope had shrunk due to the war's aftermath, Maya was still popular in Tormia.

"Let me introduce you! The rookie singer who caused a sensation at the World Beauty Contest - Maya!"

Along with cheers, voices flew from all directions.

"Sister! I love you!"

"Maya! My beloved Maya! Please wave just once!"

About a thousand spectators had gathered, and Valkyrie's military band officials were also seated in a corner.

"Bandmaster, will this be okay? There are already too many refugee entertainers - we're at capacity."

There's no such thing as "enough" in war, but if too many entertainers were active, it would decrease the soldiers' focus.

"We can't just sit around doing nothing. We have no choice but to hope a proper idol emerges."

Meanwhile, behind the stage waiting for Maya's performance, Palmers was in a pale state.

"What should we do? What should we do? Will she do well?"

The coordinator comforted him:

"Why are you being so uncharacteristically nervous? We know Maya's abilities well."

"Her abilities, sure. But this time it's not about that. Will it really work? It will work, right?"

The manager moistened his dry lips and said:

"Let's leave it to heaven. We've done everything we can."

When the prelude flowed and the spotlight shone, Maya appeared wearing a coat.

Like a downpour from the sky... "Light Rain," which she had written the lyrics for herself.

However, to utilize the costume concept, the opening was rearranged in a ballad style.

At her voice that conveyed desperate and sorrowful emotions so directly, the audience held even their breath.

'Shirone.'

Is he still traveling the battlefield, fighting?

'I'm coming to meet you.'

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!

When the song returned to its original tempo with powerful drum beats, cheers erupted.

'Now!'

Maya threw off her coat and raised her voice.

Light is coming down!

At the provocative costume that couldn't be seen anywhere else, the cheers seemed to hesitate for a moment...

"Waaaaaaah!"

Like a downpour, the voices of a thousand spectators exploded in unison.

The costume with a collar reaching up to the neck was cut off bluntly at a point that slightly revealed the lower part of her chest.

While her waistline and navel were exposed, the actual chest exposure area wasn't too severe.

About 3 centimeters in height.

The audience was going crazy over those 3 centimeters of exposure.

"Maya! Maya!"

As everyone called her name, Maya also belted out high notes in an almost trance-like state.

"Maya! Maya!"

At this moment, neither demons nor war came to mind - only surrendering their bodies to the rhythm.

Among the volume that directly struck their hearts, the only people with expressionless faces were Valkyrie's military band members.

"Not bad. The singing is also high-level. What do you think, Bandmaster?"

The bandmaster watched Maya's passionate performance for a long time before speaking.

"Sign her. Deploy her to the front lines starting tomorrow."

"Understood."

The aide opened a file and recorded Maya's name.

Meanwhile, backstage was as chaotic as the excited audience.

"Kyah! Kyah! This is huge! Huge!"

The manager and coordinator held hands and jumped up and down.

Light is coming down!

Palmers, who had been shamelessly copying Maya's choreography, saw the two and got angry.

"Hey! What are you doing right now? Hurry up and get some sacks or hooks or something!"

"Huh? Why do we suddenly need those?"

When the two blinked at him, Palmers rubbed his fingers mercilessly and shouted:

"We need to rake in the money! Puhahaha!"

The manager and coordinator realized too.

"Oh, right! We need to rake in money! Hohohoho!"

Maya's song was reaching its climax, but the audience's voices were so loud that it was barely audible.

"Maya! I love you!"

Another magician who graduated from Alpheas Magic School joined the holy war.
