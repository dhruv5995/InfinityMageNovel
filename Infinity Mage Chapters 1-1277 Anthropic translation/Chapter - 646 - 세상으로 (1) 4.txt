[646] Into the World (1)

The Kingdom of Zive.

A kingdom belonging to the Holy Seven Kingdoms, it was a nation particularly popular with foreign students due to its strong citizen influence and free social atmosphere.

Dahlia Nane was also a foreign student.

From entering magic school at age four to becoming the world's second-ranked graduate at seventeen.

An achievement unbelievable by ordinary standards.

But if you actually peered into Nane's daily life, you'd find yourself smiling bitterly at how boringly smooth his existence was.

"Nane, have you made your decision?"

The headmaster of Zive Royal Magic School personally sought out Nane, who had made history in the kingdom's records.

"No. I haven't decided yet."

The headmaster's eyes widened in surprise at the unexpected answer.

"Three hours after today's graduation ceremony ends, it will be posted to the Red Line Personnel Management Department. If you're going to take the Ivory Tower test, you need to request rejection of the posting."

"Then I'll think about it until then."

The headmaster smiled sadly.

'As expected, he has a good heart. Even if he doesn't say it, he must want to help the Kingdom of Zive that raised him.'

Always a polite and moral student.

He'd never even heard rumors of Nane arguing with anyone or frowning.

'It's possible because he's a genius.'

The fact that he'd faced no hardships in life meant Nane's talent transcended such tribulations.

Despite achieving valedictorian in the shortest time in Zive's history, honestly, it was questionable whether he'd even used one percent of his talent.

"You just need to make the right choice for yourself. Entering the Ivory Tower and making a name for yourself would also be an honor for the Kingdom of Zive."

As the same words repeated, Nane spoke briefly.

"It's annoying to think about."

The headmaster's shoulders flinched at hearing such a blunt tone for the first time, but this alone wasn't enough to damage his reputation.

'Well, it is the Ivory Tower, not just any other institution.'

Even a genius would naturally become sensitive.

But contrary to the headmaster's thoughts, Nane truly didn't care what happened next.

Whether he joined the Zive Magic Association, took the Ivory Tower test, or died right here and now.

'Yes, now I am...'

As Nane walked away lost in thought, the headmaster's closing eyelids froze as if stuck.

Birds became taxidermied in the sky, the planet stopped rotating, and the stars orbiting the sun ceased their motion.

The entire universe hit the brakes.

'What should I do?'

If phenomena had no limits, then Nane's concentration that allowed thought to transcend time was no sin either.

In that cosmic-scale absorption, Nane threw an infinite-sided die toward the end of thought.

Having mastered every path, without any criteria for likes or dislikes.

And when the die finally stopped spinning, he realized the only thing remaining within him.

'I've decided.'

As Nane walked away down the corridor, the headmaster watched his retreating figure with fond eyes, wishing him luck.

'May you make a happy choice.'

According to Red Line regulations, Zive Royal Magic School also graduated twenty students, and when it came time for the school anthem chorus, they formed precise rows and began singing.

"We become one, the light of the world."

At the emotional climax that brought unconscious tears, Nane slowly stepped forward and removed his uniform.

'Why is he doing that? Is there some event we don't know about?'

The graduates looked on in confusion, but since Nane was the protagonist anyway, they continued singing for now...

"Nane! What are you doing right now!"

An unprecedented incident in the history of the Kingdom of Zive was about to unfold.

After removing his uniform, Nane stripped off his shirt, pants, and even underwear, then leaped onto the platform and burst into roaring laughter.

"Kahahahaha!"

"Kyaaaah!"

The female students covered their faces, but since it was their admired Nane, they couldn't help peeking through their fingers.

'Now, what will happen?'

There was only one thing Nane wanted to know.

The heretical realm he'd reached after mastering every orthodox path was a question about 'mere difference.'

A journey to define the existence called Nane as something unique in the universe through endless repetition of difference.

"Eat this!"

As Nane spun his hips to the musicians' confused playing, a stream of urine spread in circles.

"Uwaaah! He's gone crazy!"

Even as people hurriedly left their seats, they felt a strange eeriness watching Nane rotate from his center.

'How can he do that?'

Being in a natural state meant perfect composure without a trace of tension or excitement.

"Nane! Stop it! What is this behavior all of a sudden!"

'What happens if I don't stop? What will occur?'

As he sprayed a fierce stream, teachers hurriedly covered their faces and lower-class students burst into wails.

To completely escape the bounds of concept would require contemplation of far more difference than this.

Perhaps infinitely many.

Nane cast fly magic and looked down at the humans, then turned his gaze beyond the horizon and flew away.

"What should we do, Headmaster? He's heading toward the city!"

Should they report this?

The fact that he still felt conflicted after causing this incident was because Nane was the greatest student in Zive Kingdom's history.

"Contact the guards! In that mental state, there's no telling what he'll do in the city!"

"Understood!"

Meanwhile, arriving in the city, Nane lightly landed in the middle of the market where the most people gathered.

"Kyaaaah!"

Panic was the natural course, and merchants who thought him a pervert approached with clubs.

"What are you? Planning to disrupt business?"

Since he had no interest in already experienced things, he didn't urinate again, but the merchants' hearts still sank.

His eyes weren't normal.

'That guy isn't a pervert.'

Though Nane was on the smaller side, pure madness and perfect uncertainty about the future induced fear.

'What is the foundation of difference...'

Nane's actions had no reason.

That was the heretical path clearly distinguished from orthodox humans, and Nane began mastering difference starting from the most primitive level.

'Form first.'

Having made that decision, Nane headed to a tattoo shop, a specialty of progressive Zive Kingdom.

"Welcome... Kyaaaah!"

Whether the female employees screamed at discovering a naked male or not, Nane stood before the full-length mirror.

"Scribble graffiti on my body."

One hour later.

With sixty security force members surrounding and confronting the shop, the security captain raised his voice.

"Release the hostages! Dragging this out will only be disadvantageous for you!"

Even hearing this, the shop employees couldn't stop their work of tattooing graffiti on Nane's body.

Following his instruction to inscribe everything in the catalog, even severe profanity was written down his spine.

'Ugh, it must hurt.'

Though magical equipment saved time, blood flowed steadily from all over his body.

Nane only calmly observed his reflection in the mirror.

'Is my form unique now?'

Or does it still converge on some concept!

'Should I try a bit more?'

Nane grabbed all the piercings from the container, then picked them up one by one and pierced his ears.

Crunch. Crunch.

As he punched thirteen piercings straight through living flesh, the employees couldn't bear it and burst into tears.

'A state that can only be called Nane.'

"Oh!"

When he suddenly twisted his body the tattoo went awry, but Nane didn't even care and opened all the hair dye caps on the vanity table, pouring them over his head.

"N-no! Hair dye is toxic, so..."

Showering with multicolored chemicals while having wounds all over his body made his skin burn hot.

"Kekekeke! Kikikiki!"

As if dissatisfied with his exaggerated laughter, he tilted his head then cleared his throat and burst into roaring laughter again.

"Kahahahaha! Kahahahaha!"

When the work was finally finished with him on the verge of losing his mind, the employees fell to their knees and begged.

"We're done. Please leave now."

"No, there's one more thing left."

As Nane stuck out his tongue and pointed to it, two of the five employees rolled their eyes back and fainted.

"Hieeeeee! Hieeeeee!"

Hearing the horrible sounds from inside the shop, the confronting security force gritted their teeth.

"What exactly is he doing in there? Captain, can't we just storm in?"

"He's a magic school graduate. If we try to subdue him carelessly, the hostages might not be safe."

If deaths occurred, the citizen council would hold hearings.

"Hieeeeee! Hie! Hieeeeee!"

The face of the female employee tattooing a longsword on Nane's tongue was pale, and her eyes were swollen from crying so much.

'This is hell.'

She would probably retire as a tattoo artist, but would be forever remembered as the person who gave Nane's magic its singularity.

"A sword."

Nane clearly memorized the form of the longsword inscribed on his tongue, then turned and left the shop.

"Arrest him! Right now!"

The 1st Security Team, masters of schema, kicked off the ground and flew forward swinging spears.

'Combat.'

Nane thinks.

Then time stopped as soldiers floating at different heights were frozen in space.

A concentration that far transcended human bounds.

'Wind Sword.'

His magical efficiency, so excellent as to refuse comparison with anything else, shot up to extremes again through his sword obsession.

The white light sword born above his palm blurred and dissolved, then instantly slashed at the surroundings.

"Kruuuuk!"

As dozens of scratches appeared on the steel armor worn by the 1st Security Team, the 2nd and 3rd Security Teams rushed in.

"Catch him! Don't let him escape!"

Though sixty personnel blocked the escape routes, this was a mistake from not properly understanding the individual called Nane.

What truly needed to be blocked wasn't his body but his thoughts.

'Ah, I see.'

The universe stopped again, and Nane deconstructed countless concepts in the realm of difference.

'Fire Sword. Ice Sword. Lightning Sword. Earth Sword.'

Each attribute is different.

'Violent Sword. Gentle Sword. Ugly Sword. Cruel Sword.'

Even with the same attribute, the feeling is different.

'Unpredictable Sword. The Sword That Predicts It. The Sword That Breaks That Prediction. The Sword That Predicts That Again.'

Even with the same feeling, the temperament is different.

'I deconstruct everything in every moment.'

The spectrum of swords emitted by concepts instantly deconstructed into over a thousand pieces didn't duplicate a single one.

"This is insane...!"

Before the security captain could even say to retreat, countless swords spread in all directions.

Whoooooosh!

Like everything exploding from the primordial universe.

Three minutes later, when teachers from the Royal Magic School arrived, the entire surrounding area was devastated with Nane at the center.

"He finally did it."

The fact that not a single death occurred simply because he wanted to conduct a 'different' battle was only realized two hours after Nane disappeared.

Nane stole clothes from a fallen citizen and put them on.

There was no reason for it.

If the concept of wearing clothes bound Nane to some category again, he would immediately discard them.

At his brazenly committing robbery, the headmaster trembled with both fists and shouted.

"Nane! What is this behavior! You had a hopeful future guaranteed! Do you intend to disgrace your family's honor?"

'Family honor...'

Am I a concept bound by bloodline?

'No, that's not it.'

Nane deconstructed the surname Dahlia.

Then he raised his index finger to cover one eye and stuck out his tongue with the sword engraved on it toward the headmaster.

"Hieeeeee."

The one who deconstructs all truths of this world.

Psychedelic Nane.
