Breaking the Law (1)

At the starting point of the approaching black sphere, Ozent felt his mind reel.

It wasn't as fast as light, but it was the threshold of law that matter with mass could produce.

That's how it felt.

'I'll cut it.'

Time flowed slowly, and the afterimages of the black sphere overlapped as vividly as the real thing, revealing its trajectory.

At the precise point where mind and body met, Ozent's two arms, holding nothing, dropped downward.

Idea.

According to Ozent's feeling, having reached the pinnacle of swordsmanship, this was a concept that didn't exist in this world.

As the entirety of law distorted, the landscape that had remained behind Ozent split left and right.

'What is that?...'

Within the time dilation phenomenon where the halo spun at ultra-high speed, Cariel saw it clearly.

The three-dimensional landscape compressed into two dimensions as the end of the world simply opened before their eyes.

As if the world they'd experienced until now was merely a picture drawn on a single curtain.

'The universe...

was opening.'

A concept penetrating from outside the universe carved a sword into reality as it collided with the black sphere.

'It's over.'

Heaven would be destroyed.

The Seventh Heaven, Arabot.

At the tip of the spire, the massive chunk of flesh that had been pulsing, Angke Ra, suddenly opened his enormous eye.

'Breaking the law!'

Even a fleeting moment was merely a concept that could stretch like an eternity for Angke Ra, who dreamed of this world.

From his state of nothingness, he carefully observed the strongest law in this world and the point where that law was being broken.

'A mere creature tears the universe.'

If you asked how such a thing was possible, Angke Ra could only answer thus:

'What a truly human doubt.' What should truly be questioned isn't 'how is it possible,' but rather 'what kind of world is this where such a thing is possible?'

'I am the whole.'

Therefore, I question:

'Can something that transcends me exist?'

Each time his thoughts crossed mountains, Angke Ra's pupils moved rapidly.

Since time was nearly stopped, the trembling of his pupils approached the speed of light...

'It exists nowhere.'

Having calculated the Akashic Records an infinite number of times, Angke Ra finally reached a conclusion.

'I must conclude it doesn't exist.'

The conclusion he derived was logically incorrect in that it belonged to the realm of faith rather than certainty.

Therefore, it was a clear error.

But this created the paradox that the Akashic Records, being the entirety of this world, could not be wrong.

'Breaking the law is impossible.'

He just needed to make it so.

'I have opened my eyes, and everything is mine.'

Angke Ra manipulated the Akashic Records, banishing part of the great world war to the far reaches of the universe.

'As far as possible!'

Even in the unit of thought that divided one second into near infinity, the space he could banish was only a sphere about 40 meters in diameter.

"Uaaaah!"

Following Ozent's battle cry, a vertical shockwave collided head-on with the projectile of matter.

With a thunderous roar, all the trees in the lush forest were uprooted and blown away, turning it into wasteland.

"Haak! Haak!"

Ozent, having lost both arms, staggered to his knees and glared forward with terrifying eyes.

Cariel sat collapsed on the ground with his left shoulder severed.

"You..."

Even Cariel couldn't analyze the power that transcended the concept of an archangel.

"Smile."

From Ozent's shoulders where his arms had disappeared, bones and muscles began regenerating at rapid speed.

'Cell regeneration? No, this is...'

Though restoration of the body was possible through giant's power, the phenomenon occurring to Ozent was on a different dimension.

'Information is being restored.'

Signals coming from outside the universe were perfectly reconstructing his information.

'To destroy that human, I too must use the same method.'

But for an archangel who relied on Angke Ra's law, breaking the law was absolutely unacceptable.

Thinking he needed to buy time, Cariel looked around.

'Where is this?'

It was a place he'd never been to, and beyond the radius Ozent had destroyed, forest stretched endlessly.

"Give me Smile."

Ozent stepped toward the glass sphere filled with black liquid.

Though Ilhwa's technique had stopped when the space was separated, it had been enough time for a person to suffocate.

Cariel stood up awkwardly and blocked his path.

'I prevented heaven's destruction, but if I can't stop this guy, it'll be the same in the end.'

Wielding the Idea wouldn't immediately end the universe, but theoretically it wasn't impossible either.

"Will you stop me?"

Ozent slowly raised his hand.

"Then die."

Just as another breaking of the law was about to be executed, space twisted like a whirlpool at the midpoint between Cariel and Ozent.

"What...?"

Though Angke Ra had sent something here again, space tore before the phenomenon could finish.

A massive figure emitting white smoke like steam from his body flew at Ozent.

"Kha!"

The moment the fist exploded, Ozent's body vanished from that spot.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Cariel stared blankly at the sight of him flying endlessly through the forest before turning his head.

"Who are you...?"

"Kekeke, it's been a while since I've had an interesting fight."

What Angke Ra chose, recognizing the breaking of law as an error, wasn't an archangel but Ymir, the king of creatures.

He who had been frowning momentarily from the shock of transcending space looked back at Cariel.

"You took quite a beating."

Being an angel who was strictly a higher existence by law, Cariel showed displeasure.

"Don't be so arrogant. Ra sent you because..."

"Uaaaaaaah!"

A massive battle cry could be heard from afar, and before they knew it, Ozent's fist was already striking Ymir's face.

"Kuk!"

Though Ymir's pupils shook from the impact, his body didn't budge an inch from that spot.

Instead, the ground where he stood crumbled like a cookie as another shockwave erupted.

The glass sphere containing Smile flew far away, and Ozent's gaze followed it.

"Smi..."

"Is this all you've got?"

Ymir's fist created a gale as it curved in and struck Ozent again.

'Nothing special?'

Contrary to Angke Ra's command to eliminate one human with giant's pride at stake, it was surprisingly anticlimactic.

"Kruuuu..."

But then a strange light entered Ymir's eyes.

'He blocked it?'

The fist he'd thrown to the limits a creature could reach was blocked by Ozent's jaw.

"Smileeeee!"

And Ymir saw it.

The massive wave of law flying from the distant end of the universe.

'Ah...'

The moment he received Ozent's second attack, all the common sense he'd held until now shattered.

'This is him.'

Though Ymir could overcome even gravity, his mind was so confused he didn't even know where he was flying.

'The reason I exist.'

What the pinnacle of creatures, the integration of 10 billion Gaians, dreamed of was paradoxically self-destruction.

'This guy can destroy me.'

Kururururu!

When Ymir, who had applied emergency brakes to inertia, planted both feet on the ground, the soil shifted and two mountains were born.

Ymir too had reached the realm of breaking the law.

And Ozent flew in, sharply striking the center of that massive frame.

"Kahahaha!"

A free-for-all battle erupted where there was no need to distinguish between sky and earth, turning the forest into scorched earth.

While all animals cried out in terror, there was one bat watching the battlefield from right up close.

Other bats had instinctively grasped the danger and left the cave, but one lone bat still hung upside down from the ceiling, carefully observing the world.

Naturally, a bat without reason had no ability to think.

But just the scenery taken in through its eyes was enough to shake the animal's inner being.

'What could that be?'

It had experienced natural disasters several times in its life.

But this was different - watching lightning that seemed to tear the world itself apart sent endless thrills through it.

'It exists.'

It can be done.

Though creatures recognize their limits from birth, this bat, having had those limits shattered in this moment, would transform into something entirely different.

"Move! Get out of the way!"

Ozent, who needed to find the glass sphere containing Smile, grew more impatient as time passed.

'How can this be?'

Even the realm of Idea, gained after falling to the very bottom that creatures could fall to, was useless against the giant.

Each time fist met fist, Ozent's body was destroyed.

But the more serious situation was that even the Idea that comprised him was being destroyed.

"If this is the end..." Ymir raised his fist with the corners of his mouth lifting.

'That's just how it is.'

He could just destroy Ozent, destroy heaven, and destroy this entire world.

"Smile..."

His voice leaked out from beneath his shattered jaw.

"Smileeeeeee!"

The moment Ozent struck Ymir's face, incomparable power to anything before was transmitted.

"Keok!"

His molars snapped as he fell diagonally toward the ground, and upon impact a shockwave erupted.

Kwaaaaaaang!

From the powerful blow that created a massive crater, Ymir crashed down afterward.

Momentary shock came, and losing control of his body was the first time in Ymir's history.

'Truly strange.'

It seemed like the end, yet it wasn't the end.

'What is the heart?'

Though taken lightly because we already possess it, do any means exist to create something greater?

Ymir, who had crashed with a thud, had to wait helplessly until his body recovered.

'If I endure, I win.'

Though he'd realized something from the recent blow, Ozent didn't come to Ymir.

"Smile! Smile!"

Cariel blocked him in front of the glass sphere.

"Stop. This woman is..."

Before he could finish speaking, a straight punch flew out, bouncing Cariel hundreds of meters away.

"Please! Please!"

The glass sphere shattered and the black liquid mixed with Black Elixir poured out.

Smile was no longer in a living state.

Seeing her flowing down in a half-melted state, tears of blood flowed from Ozent's eyes.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

He'd believed a miracle would happen, but this world was simply cold.

Ymir, having completed his recovery, walked over with the ground rumbling.

'Is it that woman?'

One human's Idea.

"Let's continue fighting."

Though Ymir's words contained politeness, Ozent didn't even pretend to listen.

He was in a dazed state, just muttering while looking down at the ground with soulless eyes.

"Smile."

His body, hardened like a fossil of rage, began melting as it became soaked with Black Elixir.

"Is she precious enough to go that far?"

"You said you wanted to fight me?"

Ozent, whose lower body had melted away, slowly turned his head.

"Please protect Smile."

Knowing what was happening, Ymir asked with regretful eyes.

"What's your name?"

"Ozent."

As even his upper body melted away, the Black Elixir flowed into Smile as if it had gained life.

"I will disappear, but..."

Ozent looked up at the sky.

"My will shall continue through Smile."

Tears flowed from the face that was now only a head.

'I see, Smile.'

The sky he gazed at in his final moments of life was dazzling.

'Life is this beautiful.'

Ozent's body completely disappeared and the black liquid began restoring Smile's body.

'I am Ozent.'

Only his consciousness whispered quietly.

'Though I'm merely a swordsman who neither saved the world nor achieved great cause...'

His genes transcended countless generations.

'I have certainly passed it on.'

Finally reaching one man.

'Ozent... Rian.'

Rian, holding <Idea> diagonally, raised his head and glared at Faust.

"Huuuuu."

The match would be decided in a single strike.
