A Different Faith (4)

The Grand Duke's laboratory.

Lete maintained an awkward silence as she carefully examined her surroundings.

No traces could be found.

"Mercedes, it's been a while. Have you been well?"

Hiding the tension that felt like her heart might burst, Mercedes bent both knees.

"Hello, boss."

The fact that she greeted her instead of the Grand Duke was already an ominous start.

"Grand Duke."

Lete's gaze turned cold again.

"What's the reason?"

"I don't know what you mean. If you cut to the chase like that, even I can't understand."

"Why are you helping Yahweh?"

He could try to deflect, but a more embarrassing situation than this wasn't their preference.

Lete spoke.

"There's been an error in the purification system. Some human broke the chains of Gehenna. I wanted the Grand Duke to examine it, so I sent the chief secretary, but it leaked elsewhere, forcing me to come personally."

Magritte stroked his beard.

'So that's how it happened. If Monolas had come first, I would have naturally sided with the Alchemist.'

It wasn't like first-come-first-served.

'The concept of coincidence is merely human logic. Even this current situation is just the result of some cause that began 500 million, no, 1 billion years ago.'

Originally, the Grand Duke had two choices.

'Following Lete's will to maintain hell, or following Satan's will to reverse the tide of war.'

Shirone had arrived first.

'The breaking of Gehenna's chains is naturally an error to Lete. But to Satan, it's an opportunity.'

If the karma of true sound could be purified, it would mean the spiritual realm would open again.

"Lady Lete."

Magritte chose war.

"The breaking of the karma chain means human will has denied hell. This is a matter of carrying through, not solving. The era is heading toward its end. Can't we watch Satan carry it through?"

If we assume the premise not yet revealed as fact, the Grand Duke's words make sense.

"Since when has hell come to accept Yahweh? No, why are they so..."

Obsessed with Yahweh?

"Even without going as far as Lucifer or Behemoth, there were those who ultimately couldn't hate philanthropy. The Grand Duke is the same. It's something I simply cannot understand."

"Because you're not a demon."

Lete was an administrator.

"When I was first born in hell, I was a demon with the highest abilities among intelligent species. I fought without wanting for anything in the world, conquered, and researched."

Magritte recalled those times.

"I thought it was a wonderful place. A world where those who proved their strength monopolized everything. To me then, philanthropy was an illogical and even violent concept."

Lete listened silently.

"Then why do we hate? Because we are the bastard children of philanthropy. It's a systematic aspect. The fate that arises from the priority of process handling, where human emotions must exist before demons can be born."

As they entered the administrator's domain, Lete's pupils became mechanically indifferent.

"That much is fine. The problem is that Yahweh denies it. He's an entity that reverses the process. A terrorist of the system. In crude terms, he made the mess but then says it's not his, even claiming he did nothing wrong—that shamelessness makes my teeth grind."

Magritte smiled bitterly.

"Even if they can't analyze like intelligent species, demons are born with that feeling. But sometimes they repent. Why do you think that is?"

Lete had no answer.

"Because he's shameless. That confident way of speaking without a shred of remorse is so disgusting, hateful, makes you want to tear him apart, but...

Also so brazen that...

"You start to think, maybe it really is so."

"Maybe Yahweh really did nothing wrong? Maybe we're misunderstanding. If he didn't abandon us, then maybe demons too someday could..."

Magritte pointed to the ceiling.

"Reverse this system's process and reach the true world?"

With emotions of disgust, they call it 'salvation.'

Oris was bewildered.

'That kid defeated the intruder? He was a deserter who fled the battlefield in terror.'

Ishak introduced him.

"This person's name is Yufi. He's of royal bloodline who inherited Satan's spirit."

The expressions of the seven generals changed drastically.

Royals were bloodlines that could rise to the rank of legion commander or even duke in hell's army.

Itaka looked back at Oris.

"Do you know each other?"

"Huh? Oh, well..."

Shirone quickly answered instead.

"He helped me earlier. When I was running away without courage, he taught me the true demon's path."

"Well, not quite to that extent." 

While Oris scratched his nose bridge with cat claws, Moonom raised his single eye.

"So, what do you want to tell us? Are you asking for a reward for killing the intruder?"

Ishak bowed his head.

"I'd like to recommend Sir Yufi as captain of the special forces. Please let him lead us."

"Bullshit!"

Moonom smashed the table.

"Crossade was the strongest warrior. Do you think that scrawny kid can take his place?"

"Sir Moonom."

Ishak's eyes flashed.

"You can speak down to me all you want. But please choose your words carefully when speaking to Sir Yufi."

It was natural for a demon to say, but Moonom was still in a bad mood.

"Hmph! That's only if he actually becomes captain. Are you saying this Yufi is as strong as the seven generals?"

Ishak kept his mouth shut.

If he was of royal bloodline, he'd eventually reach the highest position, but compared to the seven generals, his experience was lacking.

"I think the same."

Itaka spoke with his fingers interlaced.

"I acknowledge that Yufi achieved some results, but the enemies he defeated were illusions. There's only one real body."

'Huh?'

Shirone looked back with surprise.

'Execution Captain Itaka.'

The fact that he was the only royal bloodline among the seven generals was proven by his earlier words.

'He defined them as illusions, not clones. That means his detection precision matches my senses.'

Though limited to senses, of course.

"Let's do this. Illusions are currently spread throughout the city. Only one of them is real. Whoever kills that one first will be recommended for a military decoration."

Itaka looked at Shirone.

"And if Yufi catches the real one, I'll recommend him for captain in addition to the decoration."

"Keke, that sounds good."

Moonom readily accepted.

"Lucky you, kid. If you'd competed directly with us, you'd have had no chance, but luck plays a part in this."

Itaka's voice remained cold.

"Competition is fine, but keep it reasonable. If it interferes with mission performance, I'll impose discipline. Consider cooperating as a team of four when necessary."

"Six, you mean."

All seven generals fell silent.

"There seem to be two more in the darkness over there. Very stealthy presence."

As soon as Shirone finished speaking, a voice came from behind Itaka.

"Quite sharp instincts."

It was Night Guard Captain Ilgak and Baeksail, but they still didn't reveal themselves.

"But we're sitting out of this bet. Don't worry too much. We'll help if you're about to die."

Their presence disappeared.

"A full mobilization after a while? With Crossade gone, the decoration will probably be mine."

Moonom prepared to deploy, but the first to leave the barracks was Shirone.

"Let's go, Ishak."

The seven generals looked dazed, and Ishak following behind Shirone was the same.

'The atmosphere is different from before.'

Compared to when he bore the stigma of desertion, a stronger will than anyone's could be felt.

'Well, being of royal bloodline, it's natural for his blood to boil in competition.'

The interpretation was wrong, but Shirone was indeed taking this matter seriously.

'I need to find Son Yoo-jung myself.'

The power of the seven generals he'd directly experienced was certainly not weak, but it would still be irresistible force.

'If it's Son Yoo-jung, it wouldn't take even three days to devastate Rabiet.'

Magritte's plan would also be disrupted.

"I'll skip the fakes and find the real one. You probably can't keep up, so gather the troops."

Before even hearing an answer, Shirone's body transformed into a flash of light and soared into the sky.

"Your Majesty..."

Ishak trembled with emotion.

As the seven generals were deployed in earnest, Son Yoo-jung's clones began rapidly diminishing.

"Kahahaha! What? This is nothing!"

Moonom's body, undergoing biological evolution, was gradually becoming more grotesque.

"Hyup!"

As he shot spikes from his entire body, Son Yoo-jung's clones within a 30-meter radius were pierced.

"Kiek! Kik!"

The clones that had been groping at the spikes and shrieking turned to light after a moment.

"Tch! All duds?"

Moonom's face contorted.

'Even if they're fakes, they're too weak. Did Crossade really fall to something like this?'

Demons didn't have special camaraderie, but they had acknowledged and respected each other.

"Unforgivable."

His lipless teeth ground together when a roar erupted from beyond the building.

Detecting the abnormal impact, he turned to see a seven-story building collapsing.

"There?"

"Haaaaaak!"

Oris, claws embedded in the ground, let out a threatening growl with blood streaming down her face.

In her eyes, she could see Son Yoo-jung, blazing with golden light, slowly walking toward her.

'Really strong.'

So much so that she couldn't say what exactly was strong—all her combat ability values were at maximum.

Richera burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! Serves you right, you pathetic demons. Sir Son Yoo-jung! Hurry up and tear off their limbs."

Even at the mockery of a mere human, Oris remained silent.

'That human traveling with her is the real body. The level is different from the fakes. If left alone, the city will be annihilated.'

Oris, determined to die with the enemy, stuck her rear out and raised all her fur.

"Hm?"

The moment Son Yoo-jung tilted her head, a black shadow charged at terrifying speed.

"Kiyaaaaaaong!"

The time it took for the body to reach was before a human eyelid could even half-close, but...

"Slow."

Son Yoo-jung had already spun around and was swinging her staff toward the back of Oris's head.

'Frustrating.'

It was the moment when she, having lost her will to fight, resigned herself to everything and relaxed her body.

"Hm?"

A red demon's afterimage reflected in the cat's pupils.

Without time to respond, Shirone pushed Oris away and charged at Son Yoo-jung.

'If this one is the real body...'

Ordinary power wouldn't even make a dent.

'I'll hit the incarnation directly.'

The Miracle Stream compressed into a Photon Cannon and struck Son Yoo-jung's abdomen squarely.

"Hueok!"

Struck by irresistible force, she shrieked and flew to the edge of vision.

Oris, who had been watching the scene while collapsed against the wall, slowly turned her head.

"...Yufi?"

The young demon extended his hand.

"Are you okay?"
