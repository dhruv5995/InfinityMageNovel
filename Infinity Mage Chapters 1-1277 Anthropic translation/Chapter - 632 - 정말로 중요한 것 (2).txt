[632] What's Truly Important (2)

A pilot insect with thin legs dropped to the floor with a thud, and Amy's foot crushed it.

"I won't forgive this."

Whether Shirone helped Maya or not, he just needed to take responsibility for his own actions.

The shame of having her emotions exposed and the humiliation of being manipulated by another's will awakened Amy's fury.

'Ignite!'

Her body blazed like dry kindling as the fire spirit Ifrit revealed itself.

But contrary to everyone's expectations, she charged at Shirone.

'Shirone...! Being too damn nice!'

Ifrit's fist swung with scorching wind, and afterimages of the Supernatural Psychic Science flickered through the flames.

As everyone watched this unexpected turn of events, Amy's hand grabbed Shirone by the collar.

"I'll deal with you after the exam."

Shirone gave a slight smile as Amy spun and hurled him toward Fisho.

"Tsk!"

Fisho raised his Argones, but in the future one second ahead, the photon cannon was already exploding into his abdomen.

"Gahhh!"

If this were reality, his body would be crushed but there'd be no impact - but the Supernatural Psychic Science's anti-magic wasn't physical force.

'Good, got one down!'

Atomic Bomb caused chain explosions on the staggered Fisho.

Participant number 24 has been eliminated from the Supernatural Psychic Science system.

Now 13 survivors remained.

Though Shirone and his friends had eliminated Fisho with their surprise coordinated attack, the most suitable target for the next elimination was still Shirone.

"Hah. Hah."

If not for the tension of the graduation exam, Shirone's mental strength had fallen so low he would have already collapsed from exhaustion.

"A mage..."

No voice came out.

'I can do it.'

As the participants' magic concentrated on attacking Shirone, his percentage finally dropped below 1 percent.

'Sorry, Shirone.'

Maya desperately forced herself to stand.

"Taha!"

Cayden was still guarding beside her, but her eyes saw only Shirone.

'It's because of me. Because I'm weak...'

If he hadn't rescued her from the ant nest, he wouldn't be facing elimination now.

'But that's just who Shirone is.'

Among the mages ruled by cold calculation, he was the only one who had shown her genuine sincerity.

'Because he'll never change.'

Maya's eyes grew moist.

"I love you so much."

Unconventional Formula

Only for this moment.

As her song began, the participants' movements were forcibly stopped and the VIP seats buzzed with murmurs.

"Magic power reading: 120 million magicles."

"What?"

'Only for This Moment' was the song Maya had sung when she first and last took the stage.

'It's an unconventional formula.'

Realizing their concentration was being forcibly broken, the participants sensed the gravity of the situation and looked around frantically.

'My mental strength is recovering.'

Meanwhile, Shirone's mind was experiencing a tremendous surge.

'Accept my song, Shirone.'

Though there was the extreme risk of being able to sing it only once in a lifetime, showing concentration with a magic power reading of 120 million was due solely to her genius.

'Incredible skill.'

Though Reina had encountered countless voices as a court musician, the voice she was hearing now had a resonance that couldn't be analyzed through technique.

"Maya..."

Tears formed in the tribal chief's eyes.

When she was twelve, there had been an opportunity for her to perform as the opening act for the singer Canaria.

Even then, her singing had mesmerized the audience, but all that came back was jeering.

'Being too outstanding was her downfall.'

Canaria's popularity was so immense that she had fans in other countries, so the audience couldn't accept a twelve-year-old opening act with their hearts.

Maya, who had ruined the performance, never got a second chance, and the moment she heard that only sponsorship offers from perverted nobles were coming in, she gave up singing.

"Only

for this moment."

Even the participants who had initially struggled now had no choice but to accept that they had to listen to her song.

'It feels like all my hair is standing on end.'

Collie trembled as he grabbed his hair with both hands.

'Who could call this girl weak?'

He was the one who had been captivated by twelve-year-old Maya on stage and brought her to the magic school.

'She's not singing to look impressive. She doesn't practice every day to receive some evaluation.'

That's why it was sincerity, not just her best effort.

Looking up at the world from the lowest position, sincerity that could only be sublimated through that pain alone.

'If you think such things exist, everything becomes beautiful...'

Criticizing, analyzing, comparing and ranking.

'Do we rank our emotions?'

If that's impossible, then Maya's song has no hierarchy either.

"Only

for this moment!"

As the song reached its climax, intense emotion surged in waves, shaking the participants' minds like the tide.

"Shirone's percentage is rising while everyone else's except his is falling."

"She's not stealing to give. It's a balancing ability."

Theoretically, it was emotional equalizing created through vocal resonance.

"Hnngh!"

As Maya's pure high note pierced the sky, Sabina, unable to withstand the tension from the overwhelming emotion, fainted.

'Two more to go!'

With only 2 more eliminations needed to determine the final 10, Pony bit her lips until they bled.

'This can't be! Why isn't anyone else collapsing!'

Just as the cruel pleasure born from the participants' despair was reaching its peak through the royal family's downfall.

"Hah!"

Pony's knees buckled and she crashed face-first into the ground.

'I did my best...'

What had been lacking?

Without finding an answer to that question, she pressed her forehead to the ground like the other eliminated participants.

'One more.'

As the participants' will burned even fiercer, only Cayden wore a sad smile.

'I love you, Maya.'

Looking at Maya who only gazed at Shirone, Cayden offered his farewell.

'But I don't think I can go with you.'

When this song ended, Maya would eventually collapse from exhaustion, but a completely different future from Cayden's exhaustion awaited her.

'I hope you'll be happy. I truly mean it.'

The Cross Sword fell with a clatter, and Cayden closed his eyes, accepting the song with his whole heart.

It wasn't technique.

That's why, the moment he simply accepted it, prejudice disappeared and her song became not magic but emotion that moistened his heart.

'My muse...'

As Cayden collapsed silently, a voice of 100 percent purity with no trace of artifice resonated through the sky.

"Fade

a-

way."

A thrill ran up the spines of everyone gathered in the colosseum.

'She's a genius. That doesn't even need verification.'

Reina looked at Maya with stunned eyes.

Having moved everyone in a venue filled with scouts from around the world foretold that her tomorrow would be 180 degrees different from today.

'It's over.'

Maya slowly caught her breath and looked up toward Shirone.

"Thank you for everything, Shirone."

Shirone couldn't say anything, only bowed his head with the most reverent heart.

This was a song sung just for one person by someone who would soon become the most famous in the world.

"Goodbye..."

As Maya collapsed with her eyes gently closed, the unconventional formula was released and the participants regained their freedom.

Facing reality, their minds raced.

'Wait, so what happens now?'

Participant number 26 has been eliminated from the Supernatural Psychic Science system. The final 10 have been determined.

The Supernatural Psychic Science announcement system continued broadcasting.

Mysterious Maya. Final graduation ranking 10th place confirmed. 9 participants remain.

"Waaahhhhh!"

The audience rose simultaneously in a standing ovation.

Though it was applause for the final 10 who had succeeded in graduating, the praise was greater for Maya, who had overcome adversity to finally earn her qualification as a mage.

"Chief! Sister, sister..."

As Maya's siblings couldn't continue speaking, the chief also secretly wiped away tears.

'Well done! Truly well done, Maya!'

As praise poured out for Maya who had magnificently decorated the final gateway of graduation, Elizabeth asked.

"Mysterious Maya. Please give your final evaluation."

From 10th place onward, they were official graduates eligible for actual scouting, so calling them by name rather than number was proper courtesy.

"F. She's too lacking in every aspect to work as a mage."

As Lara noted this down as if she had expected it, Baikal unusually added a supplementary explanation.

"But if I ever get a chance to attend her performance, I'd definitely want to secure an S-class seat."

The applause filling the colosseum showed no signs of stopping, and the remaining participants felt their legs go weak.

'Passed, I passed.'

Whatever else happened, the feeling of successfully graduating was thrilling beyond anything else in the world.

'Really... I graduated?'

Amy felt simultaneously an exhilaration that made everything seem unreal and a relief as if the world had lifted from her shoulders.

But that was only momentary - she quickly focused her eyes and shook her head.

'Get it together. It's not over yet.'

The moment you're satisfied is when you become limited as a human.

Looking around, the other participants also wore expressions showing it wasn't over as they gathered toward the center of the colosseum.

"Congratulations for now..."

Dante said, lifting his chin.

"But we still need to determine who's the best, right?"

As if by agreement, everyone's gaze focused on one person, and Shirone also smiled as he loosened his neck.

"Bring it on."

Maya's unconventional formula had equalized the participants' mental strength.

So this was a fresh start to the evaluation, and the beginning of a real battle where they no longer had to worry about elimination.

"Boooooo!"

Then the audience began jeering.

Unlike the participants in the center pledging their best efforts, the voices were directed at Neid, who still stood in the corner.

"Coward! How can someone like you be a mage!"

"Where in the world is there a mage who passes just by luck! You should give your spot to another participant!"

Though Shirone had stood out the most, the other participants had each fought desperately in their positions to earn their graduation.

In contrast, Neid had shown no mage-like abilities whatsoever in the first evaluation, and had even reached this position through the ridiculous coincidence of never clashing with anyone in the second evaluation.

It was natural that the audience, already moved by Maya's graduation, would be displeased with his inclusion in the final round.

"Neid isn't a coward."

Liz, observing with the credentials of an Alpheas Magic School graduate, looked at Neid with a pitying expression.

"He's just... lost his way."

Having erased the only path that remained for Neid, she felt even more regretful.

"If only I could be given one more chance."

Clasping her hands together, Liz earnestly prayed that Neid wouldn't let go of his last thread of hope.

"West Neid. He still hasn't shown any distinction worthy of evaluation. No battles either. No one tried to face him."

Lara agreed with Elizabeth's words.

"Luck is skill too. But this case is extremely fortunate. Has there ever been such a case?"

"It's not possible."

"Excuse me?"

Baikal spoke with a serious expression.

"The probability of reaching the final ranking battle while avoiding all conflicts is zero. Therefore, it's not that Neid ran away, but that everyone ran away from Neid."

"But... he didn't seem particularly skilled."

"That's why he's being jeered. I don't understand. What were those who didn't fear even death so afraid of that they avoided him?"

Something more frightening than death to a mage.

"An uncontrollable situation."

Baikal, realizing something, looked up.

"A variable that could destroy the system - what they feared was perfect chaos."
