The Great Premise (4)

Even through her dazed state, Miro could clearly see Gaold's gaunt face.

Despite surely living in even more terrible pain than herself, his eyes were vibrantly alive.

'How...'

All the assumptions she had understood intellectually were shattered, and Miro realized for the first time.

'How did you live like this?'

When even breathing right now was frightening, she couldn't believe he had endured and lived through such pain for 20 years.

"I'm not sure what's happening, butâ€”"

Miro realized from Gaold's words that there was absolutely no influence from the emotional disease.

And that meant the pain Gaold normally felt was beyond imagination.

"Just endure a little longer. Don't try to fight the pain, don't try to avoid it, just accept it."

Miro simply let herself be.

Forgetting the thought of breathing, she entrusted the basics of life to nature's order.

The magnitude of pain didn't change, but her attitude in accepting it became much more composed.

Adolf XIII's voice could be heard from the platform.

"Hnngh! I am trash! I am a worthless being. I am vermin of this world."

It seemed the king had finally abandoned his royal authority.

Moreover, this meant Adolf XIII's personality had completely changed from before.

"Please spare me. I am a pitiful wretch. Please..."

Crawling on the ground while streaming tears and snot, he no longer retained any dignity of royalty.

The people in the square were still writhing in agony.

The pain induced baseless rage, and violent acts broke out in specific locations.

Someone's nose was broken, someone was trampled and collapsed on the ground bleeding from their head.

Surprisingly, most of those who were beaten came to their senses with the pain of the emotional disease gone.

'The body.'

Since humans cherish their bodies, destroying it could alleviate the symptoms.

Miro bit her lip.

'Insane...'

She finally understood why Paimon had boasted so confidently, why Havitz had coveted Meirei's ability.

'This disease is hell.'

What makes the emotional disease terrifying is that it sickens not just the body but the mind and heart as well.

Someone shouted:

"Hit me! Then it won't hurt!"

What's learned through experience is fastest, and another method was suggested in the square.

'What they abandoned was morality.'

Destroying the body works, but giving up on being a law-abiding citizen is also possible.

The scene in the square instantly turned into a brawl.

"Aaaah! Die! Just die!"

Pain paralyzes thought, and they would do anything if it could just eliminate the immediate suffering.

The citizens were like beasts, and Sirone watched the scene with sad eyes.

'This is Havitz's world.'

The current situation isn't even tragic.

For now they might survive by abandoning a few things, but how long would that really work?

'To live, you must keep killing. First others, but then friends, family, even yourself...'

As time passed, horrible acts incomparable to simply beating someone would be committed.

"Got it."

Finally Pony succeeded.

When her friends turned to look, she was gritting her teeth with her index finger broken.

Kang Nan said to Miro:

"You should break yours too."

Miro shook her head.

"It's useless."

Wasn't the first thing she abandoned to reach the ultimate good her own self?

"I'll do it."

Thinking it had ripened enough, Sirone raised both arms and activated Miracle Stream.

Brilliant light gathered above his head, then spread out as countless particles.

"Aaaah! So annoying! I'll kill them all!"

The citizens in the square couldn't see the light.

All that entered their vision were the detestable faces of others and a blood-red world.

When Lufist appeared on the platform and cast magic, a massive iron pillar struck down at the center of the square.

KRUUUUUNG!

As the ground shook with the thunderous roar, the citizens finally stopped moving with terrified expressions.

"Hah. Hah."

Those who regained some rationality realized that breathing was no longer difficult.

"Wh-what happened?"

Most had unknowingly killed something, but those who hadn't were the same.

Gaold said:

"You did something dangerous."

Controlling people's minds through Hexa could temporarily alleviate the emotional disease.

"Pain is evidence of life that living beings possess. You shouldn't easily numb it like that."

"I had no choice."

If the structure required continuously killing something to maintain the status quo, forcibly removing pain would only raise the threshold.

That's why Sirone had waited for people to remove the pain themselves.

"A greater pain will come with the second wave. But Miro has no other method."

Miro stuck out her tongue with sunken eyes.

"Yeah, thanks. Honestly, I think I can live now."

Pony came down to the platform and showed her index finger, broken all the way to the back of her hand.

"The threshold of actions is also a problem. If my brain accepted breaking my index finger, I've already killed that. Then next time, even breaking the opposite index finger won't return me to the latent period."

Nade asked:

"Couldn't you break your middle finger?"

"That's ambiguous. Though it's a different type, the concept of 'one finger' is the same. Breaking two simultaneously might work, but we need accurate information to last as long as possible."

Sirone nodded.

"We'll need a lot of data. I'll go to the World Health Organization first and deliver it. Seriel will help. Blitz, go ahead and create the foundation for quantum transmission."

"Yes."

Blitz bowed his head and immediately flew up into the sky, disappearing beyond the horizon.

Amy said:

"Pony, you don't need to think so physically. There are many conceptual things, though we can't abandon the king. If the next wave comes, abandon me. The concept of friendship."

"I can't do that."

Pony firmly shook her head.

"I'd rather my body break. I absolutely won't do such a thing."

"But how will you endure..."

Iruki said:

"Pony's right. What makes the emotional disease dangerous is that the threshold keeps rising. You might be able to break off friendship with Amy. But what's next? The same method won't work. Eventually you'll have to go beyond breaking friendship to causing harm, and if it continues like that..."

You'd have to kill.

Everyone fell silent, getting chills just from imagining a future that hadn't yet arrived.

Nade looked up at the sky and asked:

"What will happen from now on? To us, and to this world?"

No one could answer.

"Oh, Yahweh."

By the time the brief strategy meeting ended, all the citizens were approaching Sirone.

"Your light has saved us once again. Please protect us. We never want to experience this again."

All the citizens knelt and shouted:

"Lord Sirone! Please stay at our house! Let us continue bathing in your light!"

"What are you saying! Trying to monopolize that light! I have three children!"

Surrounded by citizens approaching with trembling hands, Sirone felt breathless.

"Then let's take turns bathing in the light! That's the fairest way!"

"Nonsense! How many people are there to rotate through? Instead of that, let's create a specific place and gather there! Yes, we'll build a church here!"

Sirone couldn't respond to their voices.

"This is how it becomes."

Gaold said:

"They don't think about the people outside Basuka. Everyone's own pain comes first. Whether to eat an apple or strawberries. If you liberate all humanity from suffering, they'll accept it. Because you're giving both. But if you can't, they'll endlessly be greedy toward you."

Taesung said:

"The first wave was at a level where you could abandon one of many things. Therefore, the strength of Agape, the heart, wasn't very great either. But as people's thresholds continue to rise, there will be limits to Hexa's power too."

Sirone's Ultima System alone couldn't save all humanity.

"There's a positive aspect too."

Miro didn't miss even the smallest details.

"Watching them, I realized that opening the demon world relatively makes integrating the Ultima System easier. The more people suffer, the higher their trust in you becomes."

"Ironic. Evil strengthening the child."

At Sein's words, Miro nodded.

"The circulation of good and evil together. This is probably humanity's last remaining revolution. We don't yet know which spokes will break and which will remain."

"Let's return."

As soldiers blocked the citizens' approach at Pony's instruction, Sirone turned around.

"We need to close the demon world as quickly as possible."

Sirone's group arrived at the royal castle via Mass Teleport.

The first order Pony issued was to promote all royal castle staff.

'Most of the senior management abandoned their positions. There are far too few people to handle the work.'

They could try rehiring, but no one would apply.

"As of this moment, I declare martial law. Prohibit all citizens except royal castle staff from going outside. Minimizing the chaos from the second wave is key."

After handling urgent matters, Pony asked Sirone:

"How is it? Did you reach the World Health Organization?"

"Yeah, I just arrived. I'm talking with Seriel now. I'll relay information as it comes in."

Even those who experienced it directly hadn't yet established accurate standards for the emotional disease.

Taesung said:

"This isn't the only problem. Five demon worlds have opened in countries around the world, including this central continent. A demon world means installing a new system onto reality's system. To solve this problem, we need to remove the fundamental part."

Sirone already knew the answer.

"The other side world."

"Yes. The demon world's system pulled the laws of the other side world into reality. Therefore, if we can completely purify hell, the demon worlds will naturally disappear."

Sein said:

"After Ymir's mind, now it's the other side world? Then who will go there?"

As everyone raised their hands again, Nade pushed most forcefully.

"Me! I can't yield this time! Sirone, I'm going!"

Taesung shook his head.

"No, that won't work. The other side world isn't a place just anyone can go. Sirone can go because he opened the white paper, but for beings with five senses to fall into hell requires a special method."

"What is it? I can do it too."

"Dying."

"The other side world is where reality's extreme emotions gather. To go there in a living body, you need to contract with Satan or have emotions that the system called reality cannot accept."

"Emotions that reality cannot accept?"

"Yes. Like Sirone's universal love, you must reach the extreme of some emotion. Death is the most common and easy method, but there are special cases too. This is called sin. Those immersed in evil. Probably Shi-ok would be such a case."

Iruki rubbed his chin.

"Then that's rather troublesome. We can't accumulate sins, and we can't die either."

"Yes. That's why I'm asking."

Taesung turned his head.

"Lian, only you can fight alongside Sirone in hell. Please stop the demon worlds."

"Huh?"

Everyone realized.

Only Lian, with Idea's restoration ability, could experience hell while still alive.
