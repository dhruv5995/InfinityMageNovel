[410] Task Force (2)

About two hours by carriage from Creas City, you reach the small port town of Sanperos.

While Galliant was a world-renowned resort destination, the scenery here during the off-season was simply that of a quiet fishing village.

Arriving around lunchtime, Shirone purchased a handful of dried fish from a street vendor.

The dried fish, which was said to taste better when slightly spoiled, was chewy like jelly and infused with the deep flavor of the sea.

Since there was no regular ferry service, it seemed he would need to hire a captain separately.

The fare would be expensive, but with the money he had saved up so far, there shouldn't be any shortage.

When he asked the villagers, they said it would take about an hour for the boats that had gone out at dawn to return with their catch.

With nowhere particular to go, Shirone walked to the breakwater and gazed out at the distant sea.

This wasn't his first time traveling, and his teammates were waiting for him on the island, but he felt as if he were alone in the world.

'School would be having lunch break around now.'

Shirone didn't think about that.

There was no place to return to. There shouldn't be.

"Are you Ariane Shirone?"

A woman dressed in clothing completely foreign to the Tormia Kingdom stood behind Shirone.

Despite the warm weather, her sleeves extended below her wrists, and the hood draped behind her was thicker than winter clothing.

The sight of her sucking on a pacifier was quite bizarre, but her eyes were so deep and mysterious that it created an atmosphere where one couldn't look at her strangely.

Shirone turned his gaze to the strange creature floating above the woman's head.

It was a soft, transparent monster with a sphere inside that rotated while generating an electric field.

An Auto Prismâ€”it scattered light to create transparency effects within a specific range.

While it had virtually no combat power, it was a monster listed in the 4th tier of summoning magic due to its tremendous utility.

Shirone sent a wary look.

In the worst case, he would draw Armand and fight, but if she was a mage who could summon 4th tier monsters, he would be at a disadvantage in terms of ability.

"Who are you? How do you know my name...?"

"I am called Zulu. Gaold told me to bring you."

"Huh? You?"

Momentarily flustered by the strange way of speaking, Shirone's eyes widened as he stared directly at the woman's face.

"What? You're Zulu?"

There was no way he wouldn't know the name of the world's only and strongest summoning mage who could command 1st tier liches.

Unable to believe it, Shirone pointed at her with his finger and confirmed once more.

"...Zulu?"

"Yes, Zulu."

Zulu nodded nonchalantly and said.

"There isn't much time. We need to leave the border before dark, so follow me."

"Where is the Association President?"

"He already arrived in Galliant and is preparing with Kang Nan. Will you go or not?"

"I'll go."

Abandoning his wasteful search and approaching Zulu, she dismissed the Auto Prism and cast Mass Teleport.

The scenery seemed to be pulled into a single point before expanding into a new landscape.

They were on the middle slope of a mountain behind the port.

The breakwater where the two had been standing was visible as a small dot at the edge of their vision, and below the mountain, a settlement of fishing village people had formed.

From there, Zulu summoned the strange bird Kaidra.

It had smooth, hairless skin with a beak as long as an awl, and its massive claws supporting its body seemed to be gripping the mountain itself.

Despite its fierce appearance, Kaidra rubbed its beak against Zulu like a child, then knelt and lowered one wing.

Shirone followed Zulu, stepping on the wing to climb up.

Kaidra's spine protruded outside its skin like a shark's fin, blocking air resistance, and the recessed areas of the spine provided stable seating.

"Be careful. We'll fly high."

Flapping its wings and pushing off the ground with both legs, Kaidra took off and immediately flew straight up.

Shirone stared at the rapidly approaching sky with a pale, terrified face.

When they began flying in normal trajectory, the ground was visible only as a distant speck.

"Kaidra is a lift-based strange bird. It doesn't need much oxygen, so it can fly at higher altitudes than muscle-based creatures. This also increases the probability of avoiding detection algorithms from search-type Zoners."

For Zoners with basic Spirit Zones of 2 kilometers in diameter, searching the sky wasn't particularly difficult.

However, as altitude increased, they would need to transform their Spirit Zone shapes to target or sniper modes, naturally reducing their search range.

Shirone finally felt a sense of reality.

The person before him was truly Zulu.

"Thank you for coming to get me personally. Honestly, I didn't think such a distinguished person would come to meet me."

"Gaold said the Association will move soon. It seems there are political enemies within. They decided to prepare as quickly as possible and head toward Heaven. So I took on the transportation role. Right now, we're on our way to pick up a woman named Shiina."

"Ah, I see."

"Of course, even if the matter wasn't urgent, I would have come anyway. Sein said he would use anything that could be used to produce results. Since I'll be handling utility for the team, feel free to tell me if you need anything for the mission."

Zulu's words made sense.

From now on, they had to move organically as one team. Regardless of seniority, each person had to do their best in their respective roles.

"Yes! Please take care of me!"

Shirone bowed his head energetically.

Kentra City.

The meat produced in Kentra, Tormia's famous livestock region, was of such good quality that it was designated as royal tribute.

The restaurant business was also thriving, with an entire street filled with restaurants.

People wearing cowboy hats frequently passed by, leather clothing was fashionable, and whips sold like hotcakes.

However, Shiina hadn't chosen this place as a meeting spot because the meat was delicious or to buy Kentra specialties.

This was precisely the midpoint when departing from Creas and Bashuka.

Shiina checked the restaurant sign and opened the door.

The atmosphere was more vulgar compared to Creas, and although she had made a reservation, seats were sparsely occupied.

After finishing the glass of water the waiter had poured, she waited anxiously for the person she was to meet today.

About 20 minutes remained until the appointment time, but she still couldn't guarantee he would show up.

No, if he were in his right mind, there was no way he would come.

To arrange a lunch appointment just because she received a single congratulatory letter for achieving 5th-class certification, after having no contact since their blind date.

And by express telegram, no less.

No one would rush to prepare after receiving a telegram at dawn and come all the way to Kentra City to eat meat.

'Nothing to lose anyway.'

The door opened with a bell sound, and a man entered.

Parka Quan, an instructor at Kaizen Swordsmanship School.

His cold gaze surveying the atmosphere inside remained the same, but his appearance was considerably more carefully prepared than during their previous blind date.

Quan's icy stare only softened slightly after confirming Shiina sitting at the table.

As he moved with a limping gait, all the nobles' attention focused on him.

He had never tried to hide the fact that his leg was impaired, but at times like this, he couldn't shake the feeling of being an outcast in the crowd.

Especially when people's gazes shifted from Quan to Shiina, he felt the urge to cut down everyone in this place.

Shiina stood up from her seat and raised her hand.

True to her personality, she couldn't manage a warm smile, but her attitude showed she didn't care about people's stares in the slightest.

There was also Armin, who had sacrificed both eyes for her.

Shiina wasn't bothered at all by the fact that Quan's leg was impaired.

Since prejudiced gazes couldn't be hidden just by being conscious of them, Quan could feel Shiina's sincerity.

Perhaps that was why he had come this far without knowing his place.

"Thank you for coming. I apologize for making such a rude request."

"Since it was an urgent telegram, I thought there must be a reason. Let's sit down first."

Food was served, but the two remained silent. They simply focused on cutting meat and putting it in their mouths.

Neither had any immunity to such situations.

Still, Quan, being the man, mustered courage to speak first.

"Congratulations. A 5th-class certified mage. Truly impressive at such a young age."

Shiina could no longer delay.

She didn't have much time, and if Quan refused, she would have to leave for Galliant immediately.

"I sent the telegram because I have a favor to ask."

It was a strange response to congratulations, so Quan blinked while holding his utensils.

Then he nodded obediently and said.

"Yes, please tell me."

Shiina explained about the project.

She filtered out information that could endanger the team, but since watching the world's reactions would end tomorrow anyway, the content was essential and unreserved.

"...So we need one hitman on the team. I think you're the right person for the job."

Quan, who hadn't moved until the story ended, dropped his utensils onto his plate with a clatter. Then, as if he had lost his appetite, he gulped down water.

Shiina waited calmly.

It was no different from asking him to go die. It would leave a stain on history.

Persuasion was impossible anyway.

From now on, it was entirely up to his judgment.

Quan turned his gaze to the restaurant floor, lost in thought. Then he looked back at Shiina and said.

"May I ask one thing?"

"Anything. If it's information I can reveal."

"Why me?"

Shiina's gaze turned cold.

"As you can see, my leg isn't intact. And I'm a swordsman for whom legs are important. Why must it be me specifically?"

"That's because your skills are..."

Shiina swallowed the flattery that was on her lips.

She couldn't not know what feelings Quan had come here with. No man would travel such a distance to have lunch with a woman he didn't even like.

She had now let Armin go from her heart, but she thought she shouldn't use Quan's feelings.

She would simply reveal the truth and wait for his decision.

"Because it wouldn't matter if you died anytime."

Shiina said with a resolute expression.

"I heard you have no parents, siblings, or connections. Even if you died, there would be no forces that could move. Even if something went wrong, I thought there would be no need to handle the aftermath."

Quan stared at Shiina with vacant eyes.

To say such things to someone's face, no matter what.

Somehow, from the moment he received the urgent telegram, he had thought things were going unusually well.

"But it's definitely not because I'm overlooking your skills. Your swordsmanship is..."

"Kuk kuk. Kuk kuk kuk kuk!"

As Quan lowered his head and laughed while shaking his shoulders, Shiina stopped speaking with a tense expression.

"No need to handle the aftermath even if I died anytime? If you really thought that..."

Quan's eyes gleamed eerily as he twisted his lips into a grin.

"You came to the right person."

Now he understood why it was this woman.

Just as she had no prejudice, she also had no sympathy.

For him, who was sick of the hypocritical lives of humans, it was a refreshingly honest self-deprecation.

Quan retracted his earlier thoughts.

It seemed God was still looking after his life, at least for now.

Heaven, huh.

Could there be a more suitable place to make a grave for a sword demon?

Quan gripped the table and stood up.

"Let's go. It seems urgent. There's nothing to prepare anyway. I finished settling my affairs 10 years ago."

"I'd be grateful if you would, but at least some word..."

"Don't worry. This is a decision I've made as a swordsman. It's too late to resolve yourself at the moment of death. There's no need to look back on the path to the battlefield."

It was a somewhat extreme resolve, but it would be hard to find a more suitable person to take on the role of hitman.

Whatever the motivation, this was a suicide squad jumping into fire while carrying humanity's future on their shoulders.

Shiina sincerely paid her respects to his resolve.

"Thank you."

Quan also gripped his sword hilt like making an oath as a swordsman and bowed his head.

"I should be the one thanking you."
