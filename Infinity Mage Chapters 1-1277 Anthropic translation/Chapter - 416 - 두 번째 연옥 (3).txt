[416] The Second Purgatory (3)

Gaold, who had barged into the Mecha tribe's formation like a bandit, looked down at them arrogantly and asked.

"You're rebels, right? Where's your headquarters?"

Since finding the rebels' core stronghold was one of the reasons for going to the mainland, hearing it from them would save him some trouble.

But contrary to expectations, the woman's face, which had been terrified just moments before, completely changed upon hearing Gaold's voice.

She jumped up, raised her Arc, and shouted.

"Military Supply Community! Everyone take up arms! We die here today!"

At the squad leader's command, the members also took fighting stances.

Their expressions, with Signa and Exd at the front, showed a resolve to face even death.

"Leave this place immediately! Or you'll become food for the Arc."

The Arc's laser aimed at Gaold's forehead.

A ranged weapon of the Mechas that fired explosive orbs.

But the woman knew it wouldn't work against this opponent.

'Since I've risked my life, I might as well try bluffing.'

"Keke. Kekekeke."

Gaold's face wrinkled as he laughed, his shoulders shaking as if air had entered his lungs.

And when he raised his head again, his eyes blazed with flames that existed nowhere else.

"You're chattering annoyingly."

The Great Heat Hell engulfed the Mecha tribe.

Whether it was a misunderstanding or delusion didn't matter. Gaold wasn't benevolent enough to look kindly upon those who fearlessly attacked him.

The Mecha tribe members caught in the Heat Hell all turned pale, drooling and trembling.

When the screams of hungry ghosts could be heard, it was so horrifying they wanted to tear their eardrums.

It wasn't the kind of fear humans could endure.

Even the woman, who as a squad leader had crossed the line between life and death several times, could only sit down helplessly, her jaw trembling.

"Huu. St-stop. Please..."

Only after the Mecha tribe lost their fighting spirit did Gaold release his technique.

The woman, covered in tears, raised her head and glared at him resentfully.

"Why are you tormenting us? We're fighting against Heaven. You're human too, aren't you?"

"I don't know what nonsense you're spouting, but I'm not part of some Military Supply Community or whatever. And weren't you the ones who've been calling border people 'imitations' and looking down on them?"

"Th-that's..."

Just as the woman was about to retort, trees in the forest behind the Mecha tribe began falling.

Everyone's gaze turned toward that direction.

Something massive seemed to be approaching at high speed, but nothing was visible yet.

Magnetic field disengaged. Argon engine activated.

The forest scenery shimmered as the boundary lines of some opaque form began to reveal themselves.

What finally revealed itself was a bipedal armored tank nearly 4 meters tall.

The upper and lower body ratio was 1:1, giving it stability, with reverse-jointed short legs and relatively long, thick arms.

Hydraulic cylinders pumped in different cycles in sync with the engine sound.

Enemy detected. Preemptive strike authorized.

The tank extended its four-fingered palm and charged forward.

As Gaold stepped back, it tilted its upper body forward as if falling and struck the ground. Earth rose like an iron wall.

The tank, hit by the cascading earth, seemed unable to get up on its own given its form and weight, but it continued moving its legs forward, scooping out about 2 tons of earth to regain its balance.

Meanwhile, Shirone's group maintained their respective combat distances and spread out.

Shirone also activated his Diamond Armed and pulled up his hood, watching the situation.

'What is that?'

Each time the bipedal tank's waist turned as smoothly as oil floating on water, the cockpit on top surveyed the front.

The cockpit was an oval glass sphere with a purple luster as if electricity was flowing through it, making it impossible to see inside.

"Kuroi. It's the Mecha tribe's 2nd-stage combat system equipment."

At Kang Nan's explanation, Gaold narrowed his eyes.

"Ho, the real thing is certainly impressive."

When he had only checked the specifications on paper, he thought it was just a walking pile of scrap metal.

But encountering it in actual combat, it had excellent mobility and could be operated tactically depending on the pilot's skill.

Especially the method of erasing presence by distorting magnetic fields was cutting-edge technology not recorded in recent documents.

The upper part of the Kuroi spun around and faced the Mecha tribe.

"Is Squad 2 all safe? What about the Kergo?"

The voice transmitted through the speaker was androgynous, but judging by the speech pattern, it was likely male.

"The Kergo tribe was annihilated. But it wasn't us."

The Kuroi's cockpit turned back to Gaold.

"Who are they?"

The woman chose her words carefully.

The bearded man had clearly said with his own mouth that he wasn't from the Military Supply Community.

But the illusion he had shown was tantamount to intangible violence that could only be inflicted with blind hostility.

She thought it would be better to go mad than enter that hell again.

"They're enemies who attacked us."

The Kuroi issued orders through internal channels.

Eliminate them. Switch to strike mode. Upgrade Argon engine to gear level 5.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

The five advancing Kuroi units simultaneously changed the shape of their hands.

The four fingers folded outward, and massive gun barrels with black holes emerged from inside.

Commence firing!

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG!

As hundreds of kilograms of iron cylinders serving as chambers shook with tremendous force, a deafening roar that seemed to tear eardrums erupted.

Heavy bullets flew out at a rate of 300 rounds per minute, exploding rocks and snapping trees.

One Kuroi turned its body toward Gaold.

The black bullets flew rapidly to within 30 centimeters of Gaold before suddenly slowing down as if buried in something.

Thud thud! Thud thud thud thud!

The bullets that couldn't penetrate the Air Shield gathered together, creating a black iron barrier.

"Hmm, iron balls."

Gaold waited until the bullets lost their rotational force, then caught one with his hand.

The Kuroi unit's bewilderment was conveyed through the machine's trembling.

C-Captain! He caught the bullet with his hand!

Keep firing! They're presumed to be border people! Don't judge the enemy based on past experience!

Gaold, who had been weighing the bullet in his hand, flicked it upward with his thumb.

"Something like an air gun. It would hurt quite a bit if it hit."

Kang Nan rolled her eyes and said.

"If you're going to do it, do it. If not, don't. Or should I do it?"

Gaold caught the falling bullet.

"Take care of it. I need to try riding one myself."

At the nonsensical words, Kang Nan gritted her teeth, but she had no intention of overturning the commander's decision.

"He says so. Can you capture one without damage?"

When Kang Nan looked back at Sein and asked, the Iron Wheel Eye began spinning.

"Calculating. It'll take about a minute."

Kang Nan surveyed the battlefield worriedly. One minute seemed like enough time for all five units to be finished and more.

"Damn! Who the hell are these guys?"

The pilot of Kuroi Unit 3 was having a terrible time.

The AMOLED vision installed on the front of the cockpit had 7 split screens covering 360 degrees, but the sword-wielding man was difficult to track visually, as if jumping between screens.

'This world has many strange things.'

Quan tried cutting various parts of the Kuroi.

Each time the sword traced a line, the iron plates split like flesh and sparks flew.

'Thicker than armor? Where is the person inside?'

When he accidentally severed an engine artery, Unit 3 lost power and staggered, losing balance.

"Ugh! This bastard!"

The pilot raised both arms and regained balance.

The Kuroi, corresponding to the Mecha combat system's 2nd stage, basically required fulfilling the 1st stage to operate.

The 1st stage was none other than Piper - since the Kuroi's motor organs were connected to various parts of the pilot's body, those without strength enhancement couldn't easily move even one arm.

The pilot, flailing his limbs and barely finding stability, searched for Quan's location.

But what entered his vision wasn't Quan, but a cute woman with long brown hair and thick glasses.

"Cute my ass!"

Despite her appearance, she was a martial artist, and each time she struck, the Kuroi's frame shook and a roar exploded inside.

"Fine! I'll smash you to the bone!"

The pilot gritted his teeth and swung his fist.

The Kuroi's waist accelerated as the thick gun barrel struck at Etela.

Whooooom!

The pilot turned pale, realizing his waist could no longer rotate.

Checking the multi-vision belatedly, he saw the woman had blocked the Kuroi's gun barrel with her elbow raised to her face.

"H-how? One arm alone has 17 horsepower."

"Huuuuu."

Etela, who had calmed her arm muscles with deep breathing, moved to the Kuroi's side.

Yin-Yang Wave Fist

Wall Thunder Palm.

When she struck the Kuroi's leg with palm technique, the iron rang with the wave and the roar hit the pilot's eardrums.

"Aaaaah!"

Unconsciously grabbing his ears, the Kuroi's two arms mimicked the action and fell forward.

Damn it! Do something about that big-chested woman! She's not human! She's a monster!

This side first! He's targeting only the engine arteries! Deal with the swordsman first!

"No, who am I supposed to catch first!"

Kanya, spinning the Kuroi's waist and looking left and right, shouted with an annoyed expression.

Either way, it was chaos.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

One of Kanya's eyes closed from the impact transmitted to the machine.

In her remaining eye's vision, she saw a tentacle monster flying through the forest with tentacles embedded in trees.

"That damn monster!"

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG!

The Kuroi's bullets broke all the trees in the area where the tentacle monster was moving.

Even during this, the monster continued the engagement, constantly shooting light.

Thud! Thud!

Each time it was hit by light, the dozens of tons of Kuroi shook, and that impact was fully transmitted to Kanya, who was connected through Piper.

"That thing is really annoying!"

The bullet waste trying to catch one monster was considerable.

As the rebels' weapons decreased day by day due to Military Supply Community interference, pilots were selected only from those capable of performing maximally efficient strikes. This was why she, an Arc marksman, could board a Kuroi.

"Why is such a monster...!"

What annoyed her most was that the monster's abilities resembled the magic of someone she missed.

The incident where Shirone stopped the Ilhwa's Art wasn't simply about saving Kanya's mother.

The wind he left behind had become a massive typhoon, establishing itself as the belief of the rebels' First Principle.

The very fact of being reminded of such precious memories with that person by looking at such a monster was disgustingly unpleasant.

"No matter how many bullets it takes, I'll definitely eliminate you!"

With all the surrounding trees broken, Shirone's range of activity became extremely narrow.

Realizing there was no chance of victory in a prolonged battle, Shirone threw back his robe and began casting magic in earnest.

Light gathered along the Spirit Zone toward the center like a retina, becoming a single red beam that shot at the Kuroi's leg.

Destroying the torso would be most certain, but to inflict damage during combat, the leg's drive joints were most suitable.

Warning! Internal heat detected! Cooling system activated! Output has exceeded allowable range!

"What's this about now?"

Kanya checked the instrument panel with wide eyes.

On the interface showing the Kuroi's front view, the left leg was blinking with red light.

Energy overload! Energy overload!

The output readings on the instrument panel rose endlessly.

240 percent, 370 percent, finally reaching 600 percent when the drive joint near the knee broke with a grinding sound.

"Kyaah!"

As the Kuroi's body tilted and the cockpit crashed into the ground.

The impact felt like falling from a building shook her bones, but Kanya didn't let go of the controls until the end.

"Die, monster... huh?"

The noisy AMOLED vision cleared, automatically focusing on the target at the gun's aim point.

"Wh-what?"

Kanya doubted her eyes.

The face of a boy who had appeared even in her dreams was enlarged on the vision.
