"You can't remember?"

On the white sand beach with a campfire, Gaold, Kang Nan, and Zulu sat in a circle.

"It's happened before. I got better for a while, then it got worse. But the biggest problem is..."

Gaold raised his face, flickering in the torchlight.

"There's no pattern to what memories disappear."

Though he spoke indirectly, Kang Nan understood.

"Miro."

Even from his days as Association President, his memory would take frequent vacations, but he had never forgotten anything about Miro.

Gaold asked why he was fighting.

'Because it hurts too much - the pain has surged beyond all limits, and I'm losing my very essence.'

Kang Nan asked, "If you can't remember Miro..."

"That doesn't matter."

Gaold was resolute.

"I'm not particularly anxious about it. Even if I forget Miro, it doesn't matter. The only reason I'm being honest with you is my concern about weakening combat power. If I forget Miro, I won't be able to unleash the full power of Demolition."

"That's exactly the problem!"

Kang Nan shot to his feet.

"You don't even know why you're fighting! While suffering to the point of death! Go back to Zion right now! Go and tell Miro honestly! That this is your limit!"

"And then what?"

Under Gaold's gaze, Kang Nan shrank back.

"Leave. Take Miro and leave. Run away anywhere and live happily. Miro said she would do that."

"...She did."

Kang Nan realized it.

Because Miro had promised to do that, Gaold couldn't go to her.

"You stupid man."

Gaold smiled painfully.

"Heh, don't make me sound so strange. I'm a mage too. I can't rest easy without seeing the end. Anyway, it's not a good situation. Let's focus on solving the problem."

Zulu said, "It's just that you can't remember - you haven't lost your reason. If you assess yourself coolly, you won't make mistakes in battle. The problem is that your power has weakened."

Gaold rested his chin on his hand, lost in thought.

"Power..."

There was no way he could feel good about becoming weaker as a mage, apart from Miro.

'Is there pain greater than love?'

Most humiliating of all was that his heart was being measured by pain levels.

"Shock therapy is needed."

"Miro."

Three people entered the room where Miro was deep in meditation.

Behind him stood executives Armin and Kuan, and Lilia, who had now become a proper mage.

"You came?"

When Miro opened her eyes, the serene aura disappeared and her natural human expression showed through.

She had grown much thinner since Gaold left, but her beauty remained undiminished.

Sein asked, "Are you really okay? You're eating too little. Your sleep time is extremely short too. You can't fight like this."

"It actually helps."

The more the body withered, the sharper the mind became.

Though continuing like this would ruin her body, she was preparing for the final battle.

"Since the Psychic Realm is gone, there's no need for many people in Zion. We'll start moving now."

That's why she had called these three.

"Kuan, Armin, Lilia - go to Tormia. Block Hell's army there."

Kuan asked, "Why Tormia? The demons haven't even reached Kazra yet."

"The Small Purification wiped out half the demons, but the Legion Commanders survived. If they gather in the central continent, it's only a matter of time before they break through. Tormia is the only defensive wall. And..."

Miro's lips curled up.

"You want to go, don't you? To Tormia."

Oliver Siina was there.

While Kuan fell silent and lost in thought, Lilia nodded energetically.

"Yes. Then I'll leave as soon as we're ready."

The three who would leave for Tormia exited the room, but Sein still remained in place.

"Miro."

Knowing what Sein was about to say, Miro shook her head.

"Please leave. You're interfering with my concentration."

The conversation always ended here.

But now that the Psychic Realm was sealed and he could move freely, Sein pressed harder.

"Are you really not going to see him?"

Miro remained silent.

"It's not an exaggeration to say he single-handedly devastated the south. He doesn't have much time left."

"He'll endure."

"He won't. No matter how strong his heart is, the brain is a physical organ. There are limits to its endurance."

She couldn't not know this.

"Gaold won't come. So you have to go. Go and check his condition. This is an order as your commander."

Miro pouted.

"What if he asks me to settle down with him?"

Sein turned away.

"...It would be fortunate if he had the strength for that."

The door closed.

The Gustav Empire was empty, like when the planet was first born.

The demons were almost completely annihilated, but that didn't mean every last one had disappeared.

When the Legion Commanders left the empire, the quick-witted demons also fled in panic.

The surviving demons scattered across the world, spreading what they had witnessed.

It rained. A bombardment of light.

Everything was destroyed! Demons, the world, everything swept away without leaving a single thing!

The rumors spread in an instant.

-That Yahweh was more terrifying than ever before. Absolutely, absolutely must not anger him.

We'll all be annihilated! He won't forgive us!

They were half out of their minds.

I, I saw it! I saw something that should never be seen! Aaaahhhhh!

The demons who heard the rumors, without exception, shuddered in terror of Yahweh.

Three weeks passed like this.

It was when Shirone and Lian crossed the Arcade Desert and reached the border of the central continent.

Lian, riding a war horse they had found two days ago, spoke to Shirone who was sitting with his back against him.

"It's probably the Bornai Kingdom."

It once was, but now it was devastated by the war with demons.

Shirone was silent as death.

It was natural that he had no strength to speak after days of starvation, but more serious was the wall in his heart.

During their journey here, Lian had told him what happened in the Gustav Empire.

The bombardment that erased an entire empire in just a few hours.

If he hadn't met Gai in some world, the planet would have been destroyed.

After hearing that story, Shirone hadn't opened his mouth about anything except basic bodily functions.

'The shock must be great.'

Great power was a mage's dream, but only when it could be controlled.

The disaster of Small Purification was the first magic in Shirone's life that he couldn't control.

"Let's get food first."

Unlike the desert, the central continent was a place where civilization flourished, so they should be able to find food.

After riding for two hours, they arrived at a viciously destroyed city.

Based on its location, it was probably called 'Arca,' but there was no way to confirm.

Stepping over the gate that had fallen inward along with the wall, they saw the remains of buildings reduced to rubble.

Rotting corpses, and the fact that rats were scurrying among them actually relieved Lian.

"Hm?"

Lian gently pulled the horse's reins.

'Killing intent.'

It was crude killing intent that anyone with some war experience could sense, but there were quite a few of them.

"A horse, it's a horse."

From all directions, people in wretched condition appeared holding spears.

Abandoning ambush to rely on numbers meant they were untrained civilians.

"Get, get down. That horse is ours."

They seemed to have no experience with robbery either.

"Who's the leader?"

Based on these circumstances, Lian realized these were survivors making a living in the ruined city.

A toothless old man shouted, "I told you to get down! That's ours! Do you really want to die!"

It wasn't threatening to Lian, and Shirone wasn't even interested, just staring at the ground.

"Stop it. He's a soldier. You can't handle him."

Looking up at the collapsed building, a woman with short, masculine hair held a longsword.

She nimbly jumped down from four meters high and strode toward Lian.

"A remnant soldier? How did you get here?"

"On our way home. If you let us pass, we'll leave quietly too."

"Where's home?"

"Tormia."

The woman's lips curled coldly.

"How nice. You still have somewhere to return to. Hand over the horse and leave. We'll use it for food."

The horse was Lian and Shirone's food source.

"I can't do that. I'll say it again - I don't want to fight. You're not bandits either."

"Bandits?"

The woman was displeased.

"I can see how you survived, having some measly conscience left. Hey, have you ever properly fought in a war?"

To her, Lian and Shirone looked to be in their early twenties at most.

"You noble lordlings probably don't know, but the justice you used to cry about is already dead. If you don't hand over the horse..."

Lian didn't even show killing intent, but if she crossed a certain line, the woman's neck would be severed.

"Give it."

Shirone spoke up.

"Just give it to them, Lian."

"Shirone."

"I don't want to fight with anyone."

Shirone needed time to think.

"Hehe, the young master is quick-witted after all. Right, how could you throw away a life you barely saved here?"

Lian proposed, "I'll hand over the horse, so give us some meat. You can do that much, right?"

"Some meat? You're crazy. Even a handful of burnt seeds weighs as much as life here. And you want meat?"

The woman turned and said, "We'll butcher the horse and dry it. Follow me. I'll at least treat you to a bowl of the porridge we eat."

Since they had to eat something, Lian got off the horse and carried Shirone on his back.

They arrived at a temporary shelter with sections divided using building debris, where a campfire was burning.

A hundred survivors were doing their respective tasks - repairing positions or cooking porridge.

Though the place with burning wood was warm, Shirone insisted on a cold corner.

"Are these all the survivors?"

The woman smiled bitterly.

"There were more at first. Most died of disease. There were so many corpses. Those still alive should be considered to have strong vitality."

The woman threw two blankets.

"Use them. One per person. Meals will be distributed in an hour. Follow the rules while you're here."

Lian returned to Shirone without complaint.

"Shirone, cover yourself with this and get some sleep."

One blanket wrapped around Shirone's shoulders, and he covered Shirone's knees with his own.

A man watching from afar chuckled.

"Are they lovers or something? Such devotion."

In this shelter, caring for others was a luxury, and it was even established as a rule.

"Newcomers arrived?"

A man's voice came from behind Lian.

Turning around, he saw a cold-faced man approaching with the woman.

"We got a horse. They'll leave soon."

The woman said, but the man didn't even respond, alternately examining Lian and Shirone.

"What are you doing right now?"

The man immediately frowned, pointing at the two blankets covering Shirone.

"I instructed one per person, didn't I?"

"I gave him mine. What's the problem?"

"No. In this shelter, there's no concept of 'mine.' Only the concept of 'ours.' Take it back right now and cover yourself."

He could give up the horse, but he couldn't compromise on Shirone's comfort.

"How I use what I was supplied is my freedom. What right do you have to interfere with that?"

"Because I'm the manager of this shelter."

When the man opened his palm, flames rose up.

"I'm a mage. Is that qualification enough?"

While Lian remained silent, Shirone just stared ahead with indifferent eyes.
