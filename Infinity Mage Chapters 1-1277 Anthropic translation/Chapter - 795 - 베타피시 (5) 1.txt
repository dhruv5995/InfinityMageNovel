[795] Beta Fish (5)

"Aryan Sirone."

That was the name of the only person in this world currently capable of wielding the Grand Unified Theory.

'Is it really possible?'

It was the amalgamation of all laws presumed to have existed during the Planck epoch, that fleeting moment when the universe returned to its "on" state.

'They wouldn't stand a chance against him.'

Not to disparage Bodhidharma and Huike's abilities, but the Grand Unified Theory was poison to seekers.

'Even the most righteous Buddha couldn't destroy it. But what about an irregular technique?'

The 10th seat of the Ten Elders - her realm couldn't compare to the higher ranks, but the universe within her heart was entirely different.

"Your Yahweh doesn't exist within me."

Mortasinger, having landed on the ground, charged toward Sirone while casting her magic.

"Hidden Piece."

As ether waves spread, a giant mechanical cube fell above Sirone's head.

'I can't avoid it.'

Such was the law, or equivalent exchange.

"Kugh!"

Sirone watched with incomprehending eyes as his right hand disappeared.

"What...!"

Simultaneously, the world shattered like a puzzle and his bodily sensations began tangling chaotically.

'The world didn't shatter.'

Sirone's body - academically speaking, his schema - had been fragmented.

"It's begun."

Bodhidharma, after checking on Huike's condition, looked at Sirone who appeared as if someone had scrambled a cube puzzle.

The irregular technique Hidden Piece.

Mortasinger, who used ether waves as her base, could fragment targets into 98 cubes.

By taking away one piece, the puzzle was completed, scrambling space like a cube.

'It's Estas!'

Sirone simultaneously recalled both the mechanical structures he'd seen in Heaven and the Estas from magic school.

With his eyes having moved to where his ankles should be, he concentrated his senses and the blocks began to move.

'The nerves are still alive.'

There wasn't a schema as clear as a swordsman's.

However, the body schema of where each organ should be located was embedded in his unconscious.

"Ho ho ho! It's futile!"

By the time Sirone barely managed to move one eye back to its original position, his lower body had become even more scrambled.

With one side scrambling the puzzle while the other tried to solve it, Sirone's thinking accelerated further.

'I've got the hang of it!'

The blocks charging toward Mortasinger created waves as they began returning to their original form.

'What is he thinking...'

Sirone's cognitive ability, having trained his brain functions throughout his lifetime, was world-class.

"Give me back my hand."

Though he'd solved the puzzle, the Hidden Piece of his right hand was still in Mortasinger's possession.

'How do I release it?'

Given the nature of irregular techniques, there would be conditions, but before that, Mortasinger switched Hidden Pieces.

Including the radius surrounding Sirone, the area above both eyes disappeared from the space divided into 98 parts.

"It's over!"

Just as Mortasinger was declaring victory, a single photon cannon rushed toward her.

Sirone's brain, having become a Hidden Piece, emitted special brain waves just before sinking into darkness.

'She won't be able to avoid it.'

The speed of the photon cannon itself put Mortasinger in a state of Movement Zero.

'Because it's the ultimate speed.'

Though only an instant remained until collision, he was confident in this established law as he sank into darkness.

"Kyaaah!"

Having hastily released Hidden Piece, she twisted space with ether waves to deflect the photon cannon.

'As expected.'

As Sirone's vision returned, he saw Mortasinger collapsed while clutching her shoulder.

'Even with the same ether waves, her realm is shallower than Sung's.'

Even for a non-believer, how much one could twist the laws was an entirely different matter.

'Lian would have dodged it.'

Lian's conviction completely breaks the world's laws.

"Sirone!"

At the call from the stage direction, Sirone's Spirit Zone rapidly expanded.

'Is this the limit?'

Though he'd been monitoring continuously during battle, the guards could no longer protect the stage and had given way.

"Kyaaak! They're coming! They're coming!"

As the Eternals charged forward, Justin blocked their path while the contest participants made a fuss.

"What the hell are you doing! You took all that money! You're supposed to protect us!"

No matter how much they yelled, the already decimated guards couldn't help them.

"Get it together! We protect our own bodies!"

Pony, supported by Maya, struggled valiantly while drawing up her water power, but the collective magic of the Norse tribe exceeded her capabilities.

"Why should we protect our own bodies! Who do you think we've been cultivating these bodies for! Get up already!"

As the Eternals climbed onto the stage, it instantly became pandemonium and even Justin couldn't exert his power.

'These guys are really strong...'

They were skilled enough to commit national terrorism, not just participate in a world beauty contest.

"Kyahahahahaha!"

As the Kergoin raised their curved swords and let out battle cries, Rangi kicked off the ground and leaped out.

"No!"

Rangi's teeth clenched.

'I know schema too...'

The moment she flew like a hawk to deliver a kick, the Kergoin's upper body bent like rubber.

"...Huh?"

Despite moving at close range, Rangi's face went blank at the speed she couldn't even confirm with her eyes.

"Weak creatures of the earth."

The crescent blade drew a flash of light, and Rangi's body was pushed back with tremendous force.

The Kergoin frowned as he looked toward where Sirone was embracing her.

"Are you okay?"

"Huh? No, well..."

Though it was the same Sirone she'd seen a few days ago, the cold aura in his eyes was something she'd never encountered in her life.

"Hey! Sirone!"

Pony shouted.

"You asked me to stop guys like this! These aren't criminal level - they're way beyond that!"

"You stopped them anyway."

As Pony gritted her teeth, a water barrier rose high then came crashing down.

"Now it's your turn."

As nearly 200 individuals took control of the stage, Sirone shot forward.

The flash of Scatter Movement spread like a net, instantly collapsing the Eternals' formation.

"Wow..."

Everyone was stunned at the sight of enemies that even the guards couldn't handle falling en masse.

Flashes rained down, and the Eternals' numbers dropped from 200 to 100, then to 50.

'Pony lied.'

Rangi captured in her eyes Sirone moving through enemy ranks like electricity.

'She couldn't deny it?'

When Sirone was a mage, he emitted the most beautiful light in the world.

"Mortasinger-sama, let's retreat."

Bodhidharma approached while supporting Huike.

"I don't know why you're here, but this is Hexa - someone even other executives couldn't handle. We cannot win."

"Hmph! Who said anything about winning?"

Being the youngest in the Ten Elders anyway, she didn't care about depth of realm or magical skill.

"Just kill those things!"

The world's beautiful things.

"Hidden Piece!"

As the irregular technique activated again, the entire stage was divided into 98 blocks.

In the process of scrambling like a puzzle, the block containing the participants was pushed toward her.

"I'll burn your faces!"

With fire ignited in both hands, she charged toward the space as sparks flew from Sirone's distant eyes.

With a bang, flames swept over the participants.

"Kyaak! Help...!"

That was 1 second.

'Time Vibration!'

And as that 1 second vibrated endlessly, this time Mortasinger clutched her head and screamed.

"What, what is this?"

As the repetition of 1 second was contained within a single second, the world appeared to the participants as countless fragments.

After the section where information danced in massive waves passed, the world gradually began to take shape.

'Found it, the last puzzle piece.'

Sirone's back, which had been turned toward Mortasinger, created ripples like an eruption as front and back reversed.

"Who are you?"

If the source of trauma was beauty, then the release condition for the irregular technique was revealing one's face.

As Wind Cutter headed toward Mortasinger's face, Hidden Piece was released and the scenery returned.

"No! Don't look!"

Having lost her fighting spirit, she flew toward the mountains as Bodhidharma and Huike followed.

"Now's our chance! Arrest them!"

Listening to the sounds of the recovered guards capturing the terrorists, Sirone looked toward the mountains.

'The Eternal Community. Have they lost their place to go?'

With Ankera gone, the situation for them would be like being abandoned by god.

'They seemed unable to find meaning in fighting.'

Except for one person.

'Judging by the power of her abilities, she's at least on par with the Ten Elders. But why do something like this?'

The more he thought about it, the less sense it made.

The evening papers were issuing special editions after a long time.

Every newspaper featured the World Beauty Contest terror incident as their headline, and people's attention was entirely focused there.

"Phew, what a mess."

When Justin returned to the guild, Sirone, who was eating with the members, asked.

"How did it go? What did the organizers say?"

"The contest continues. Most of the terrorists being captured seems to have convinced the higher-ups."

Sirone was dumbfounded.

"But there are still some left, right? Including the ringleader. And they're still continuing the contest?"

"Because it makes money. You know how it is."

"What about the participants?"

Justin showed signs of fatigue for the first time.

"I thought my ears would bleed. Saying they need psychological counseling, asking for psychiatric prescriptions."

He could imagine it without seeing.

"Are they agreeing to continue?"

"What choice do they have? It's not just about picking pretty people. The official slogan is about making the world peaceful through beauty. Anyone who runs away from here will face a storm of criticism."

Sirone recalled the street protests.

"There are quite a few people who view the contest unfavorably. This would be a golden opportunity for them."

"Right. So they're doing it, but..."

Justin sighed.

"You absolutely have to provide security. To deliver the official message: they absolutely won't do it without that handsome guy."

"I have no choice. I have acquaintances there too. Please include me."

Justin shook his head.

"That's not it - they want you to be dedicated to protecting them. So you need to be in the waiting room too. They even want you to accompany them to the bathroom, shower room, and dining hall."

Sirone's eyes widened.

"What? Are they crazy? I'm a man! How can I accept such a request? And tomorrow is swimsuit day!"

"Then you go tell them yourself! Grown women crying 'mommy, mommy' - what am I supposed to do! They don't trust anyone but you - not the guards, not anyone! They're in complete panic!"

A groan escaped Sirone's throat.

"I'll try to persuade them."

"Do what you want. But it won't work. Word about who you are has already spread among all the participants. No one would refuse protection from the world's greatest mage."

His head was already throbbing.

"Tonight everyone will stay in the bunker, but the problem is tomorrow when the contest resumes. What will you do? Even the guards are hoping you'll do it. I heard it was no joke? These terrorists - aren't they the ones who released demons all over the world?"

It was the organization that had decimated special forces from various countries.

"...Fine. I'll do it."

Though participating nations would quickly take measures upon hearing the news, Sirone was the only one available to guard the stage immediately.

"Excuse me, young man."

One-Eye placed his hand on Sirone's shoulder.

"By any chance... don't you need an assistant?"

Turning his head, Sirone read the bright, eager gazes of the other members.

"No, I don't need one."

Sirone firmly stated as he removed One-Eye's hand.
