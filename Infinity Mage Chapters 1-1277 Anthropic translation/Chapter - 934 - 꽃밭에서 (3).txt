In the Flower Garden (3)

Satiel, having received Ankera's orders, returned to the place where Ikael was hiding.

"You've come. I was worried since there was no word from you."

Not even a trace of suspicion could be found in Ikael's smile.

'No, not one of them is foolish.'

She must already be considering all variables in her head, even assuming the worst-case scenario.

Yet the fact that she still smiles means...

'She trusts me.'

The months Satiel fought for humanity, the longing they all had to become gods.

Satiel tried to act composed.

"Yes. I'm sorry for being late. Actually... I still haven't been able to choose a name. It feels burdensome too."

Ikael showed gentle eyes.

"Hehe, it's alright. You're an angel with a kind heart, so I'm sure you'll be able to give a wonderful name."

Satiel couldn't respond.

"Come inside. You're like a sister to me, so you'll be an aunt to our child. You should see your niece's face."

'Aunt...?'

Her eyes grew hot with tears.

Even though she couldn't share love with Guffin, it could have continued that way.

'No, that's not what I wanted. I don't want this kind of relationship with Guffin.'

But then why do the tears keep coming?

"What are you doing? Why aren't you coming in?"

Having coldly cut off her heart, even that small connection had become so precious.

'I should have just endured it. I should have lived my whole life watching from beside them like this.'

It was already too late.

"I'm sorry."

Ikael tilted her head seeing the tears of light flowing down Satiel's cheek.

"Please don't forgive me."

A roar exploded in the distance.

Though the source of the sound wasn't even visible yet, Guffin sensed danger from the wind pressure alone.

"Get away!"

Maternal instinct erasing countless thoughts, Ikael flew in the direction opposite to the sound.

Though the air resistance alone indicated tremendous speed, she probably wouldn't have been able to escape.

If Ymir's target had been Ikael instead of Guffin.

"Found you."

Guffin, taking Ymir into his sight, watched the fist coming as if tearing through space.

'Miracle Stream!'

Golden smoke wrapped around Ymir's arm, and a command that transcended worlds was input.

'Stop.'

As their signals collided, vibrations occurred, but no one felt any trembling.

The entire world shook.

"Graaaah!"

Though his face contorted, joy filled Ymir's eyes at the first resistance he'd ever felt in his life.

'Is this what it feels like?'

To actually do something.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

As he stretched out his arm with a roar, power that even he couldn't measure its limits came rushing in.

The world's vibrations disappeared, and Ymir's fist stopped firmly before Guffin's eyes.

Ymir's elbow bent about 20 degrees.

If his elbow had fully extended, Guffin's face would have been blown away.

'He broke through Miracle Stream and got in.'

Breaking through the external world's signal, the artificial implementation of ideas called Hexa, meant...

"Are you a Gaian?"

No matter how he thought about it, there was only one conclusion.

"I am Ymir."

Ymir, charging energy into his muscles again, thrust out one foot as he attacked.

"King of Giants!"

Guffin first created distance.

'This is strange.'

Though this was the strongest enemy he'd ever encountered, he felt an odd nostalgia from Ymir's appearance.

'...Is that so?'

He realized it from Ymir's eyes.

Though certainly one feeling, it was deep enough to contain 10 billion emotions.

"So that's what you've become?"

Guffin's eyes blazed as he realized he had become the last remaining Gaian in the world.

"I'm sorry."

Stopping his retreat and pulling both arms back, Miracle Stream gathered between his palms.

A streak of light rushed toward Ymir, who was charging at tremendous speed.

'Photon Cannon.'

The moment near-light-speed mass struck Ymir's abdomen.

"Graaaah!"

Ymir grabbed the sphere of light with both hands and destroyed its inertia with his grip strength.

'He caught it?'

No, catching it wasn't the problem.

If a biological body produced near-light-speed, the friction heat should have vaporized the flesh.

The moment he saw Ymir's arms glowing red-hot, chills ran down Guffin's spine.

'Mass incomparable to the Photon Cannon...'

Moving at near-light-speed, a shockwave spread 4 kilometers in radius around Ymir.

Satiel's body, which had been standing dazed after Ikael fled, was instantly blown away...

"Graaaaaaah!"

In the place where everything had been swept flat, only Guffin and Ymir glared at each other.

"Strange."

Ymir brushed off his throbbing abdomen.

Though pain also came to him as ecstasy, the current problem wasn't his body.

"I don't feel good."

He could be enemies with everything in this world, but Guffin alone was an exception.

"It feels like... I'm harming myself."

Guffin asked.

"Do you remember what happened before you were born?"

"Not at all. But I can guess. Seeing you, what I'm thinking is probably right."

"Let me go. I must protect my wife and child."

Ymir looked toward the sky.

"Family."

At this point, which could be called the beginning of birth, he wanted to settle everything.

"I have no family. And never will."

"If you help me, you could also..."

Ymir extended his hand.

"No, whatever it is, I don't want to care. I just want to fight."

That's what he decided, and now only one thing remained.

"If you don't have much time."

Ymir kicked the ground.

"Let's end it with this."

With one kick, the earth collapsed into an endless abyss and a massive explosion occurred.

If watched from space, one could have seen light flicker like a matchstick in the planet's northern hemisphere.

Rumble rumble rumble!

The shockwave reached even heaven, and before that destructive power, even angels turned pale.

'This giant is dangerous.'

Uriel turned toward the direction of the explosion.

'No compatibility. No natural enemy. Not even standards. Just strong. His very existence is destructive.'

Even if it were Guffin...

In Uriel's mind as he surveyed the battlefield from above, he saw a sea of lava where all matter had melted.

Ymir was floating in mid-air 10 meters above that hot surface.

The external gravity caused by simple muscle vibration showed no signs of returning even after 10 minutes.

'Guffin, I definitely gave you a chance.'

Just before they prepared their decisive attacks and collided, Ymir abandoned his attack.

If Guffin had killed him with his strongest strike, he thought that kind of ending would be fine too.

'But I survived. And...'

With this, the only nagging feeling that had interfered with his fighting spirit completely disappeared from his heart.

"I am Ymir."

He finally felt like he had become himself.

Before Guffin, who had driven Ymir down to the planet's mantle, left, he said:

"Thank you."

Ymir, slowly rising from the lava, showed his face and snorted.

"Was the awkward feeling mutual? Anyway, this is the worst outcome for you. As long as I exist, you can achieve nothing."

"That might be so."

Guffin had no intention of denying it.

"But hearts continue endlessly. Someday, someone will appear to replace me. And..."

Guffin's body turned to light, then became transparent as if dissolving into the air.

"I will liberate my people from the prison that is you."

Ymir emerged from his recollection.

"Continue, he said."

Waiting for the external gravity that showed no signs of returning while sitting cross-legged in mid-air, he rested his chin on his hand and muttered.

"I hope that's the case."

Above Nane's head as he meditated at the mountain peak, clouds spun in a perfect hole.

Sura, watching that scene, muttered.

"A Buddha with worldly desires."

No, rather because they were a Buddha's desires, they would be the last problem remaining in this world.

'That's Amy?'

What about her had been so impressive?

Since Amy left, Nane had been concentrating solely on thought without rest.

'It doesn't matter.'

Sura turned away.

'I just want to know the world's secrets. If this helps the Buddha achieve enlightenment, I have no regrets.'

Though she organized her thoughts that way.

The feeling of not being acknowledged still remained.

"Sura."

Nane's voice pierced down from the sky.

"Come to me."

She flew vertically up the high peak and knelt before Nane.

"Did you call for me?"

"I can sense your inner demons."

Sura gathered courage.

"Forgive my impertinence, but I want to ask. Why Amy?"

How could the Buddha of this age, one who preaches the emptiness of all beings, come to love one human?

Nane plucked a flower from its roots.

"I wondered how I could throw away my heart."

Then, gently covering the flower with his other palm, he continued.

"Even praising this flower's color, extolling its fragrance, and admiring its form, I couldn't truly love it."

The flower was crushed between his palms.

"It was only emptiness."

Sura listened silently.

"No matter what method I used, everything was false before emptiness. I couldn't love the flower. I thought Sirone, who opposed me, was foolish. But one day, 'that woman' came to me."

Carmis Amy.

"I simply wanted to understand Sirone. I thought that would lead me to complete emptiness. And I realized."

Nane smiled at Sura.

"It wasn't that I threw away my heart because I loved. It's that I could only love because I had thrown away my heart."

As Nane slowly lifted his palm, the crushed flower began to come back to life.

Sura's expression became blank.

'This is...?'

It was just like Sirone.

"I throw my heart to this flower. Color, fragrance, form - none of it matters. Because I threw it away, whatever this flower is, it's the most beautiful to me."

Nane replanted the flower in the hole he'd dug.

"This is Sirone. The reason we must exist in this empty world."

Sura bowed her head respectfully.

"Then have you decided your intention?"

"I told Miss Amy I would carry it through. My intention lies solely in the suffering of all beings."

Nane rose from his seat and put his hands behind his back.

"But the heart is truly strange. Now that she's gone, I feel regret. I wonder what it would have been like if I had accepted her proposal. I miss her. My heart aches as if it's being torn apart."

Sura was certain.

"Buddha."

"Yes. I understand Sirone now. I can observe everything from the most objective perspective. So now I must go out into the world. I'll see and judge with my own eyes whether the world needs a Buddha or Yahweh."

Sura sensed that a decision determining this world's fate would be made soon.

If Yahweh was right, Nane would gladly help Sirone and annihilate all demons.

'On the other hand, if Buddha is right.'

The world closes.

'No one can stop it. Not Yahweh, not absolute good, not absolute evil - no one will be able to stop the end. If there's anyone who could...'

One person's name flashed through her mind.

'Gaold.'

The one who defeated Buddha.

"That's right."

Nane, reading Sura's thoughts, smiled with his eyes.

"The only one who can stop me from liberating humans from suffering is humanity itself - Gaold."

As if everything was being drawn before his eyes, he looked down at the earthly scenery and gave his order.

"Bring me Ikael."
