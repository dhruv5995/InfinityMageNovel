[784] Alpha Fish (2)

Amy arrived at the training ground that overlooked the dormitories where the female applicants would stay.

Male applicants were bustling about on the other side of the iron bars, but they were too far away to get a proper look.

'Do they train separately too?' If so, Amy felt a bit disappointed in Valkyrie.

"The Commander is entering!"

A massive man with dozens of scars carved like medals across his face walked forward, accompanied by instructors.

"Salute the Commander!"

As salute calls from various nations erupted simultaneously, several applicants didn't move.

Either way was correct.

Nevertheless, Gomez, the commander of Valkyrie's new recruit training unit, growled like a tiger.

"Complete rabble! Huh? Rabble!"

Among the nearly 100 women standing in formation, none showed signs of displeasure.

"From now on, you'll experience terrible gender discrimination! Because I'm a seriously severe male chauvinist! For one reason only! Because I'm a man!"

Gomez thrust his face toward the first applicant.

"Does that upset you? Huh? Answer me!"

"No sir!"

A clear voice rang out.

"Definite failure! What, no pride at all! What kind of war do you think you can fight, crawling in here like that?"

Before the first applicant could object, Gomez moved positions and asked the next person again.

"How about you? Does it upset you?"

"Yes! It upsets me!"

"Shut up! What are you going to do about being upset? I'm the superior, and you're just a grunt! If you don't like it, you become a commander too! Then you can discriminate against men all you want! Got it!"

"Yes sir!"

Gomez turned to the instructors.

"As you all know, this place is hell! And it'll be especially hellish for women! I'm a nasty male supremacist with severe anger management issues!"

Opening a box containing recommendation letters, he pulled out a bundle of documents and waved them at the applicants.

"Know what this is? Recommendation letters with royal seals. Of course I didn't bother reading the damn things! What is this, kindergarten? Throwing one of these at me and expecting me to do what?"

The recommendation letters were torn to shreds above Gomez's head.

"Don't need scraps of paper! Know what demons are? Exactly like me! When they see soft little things like you, they'll go crazy wanting to torment you! So either tear the demons apart...!"

Gomez, who had been delivering his speech, stopped mid-sentence with a bewildered expression as he stared at someone.

"Hey, you."

At first, no one reacted.

"You! Red hair!"

Amy turned her gaze, confirmed he was pointing at her, and stepped forward.

"Recruit Carmis Amy!"

After a long silence, Gomez asked.

"...Why are you wearing makeup?"

Amy was momentarily flustered but quickly regained her composure and lifted her head.

"I'm not wearing makeup!"

"Oh, really?"

Gomez approached closer to examine her.

"Not wearing makeup, is that it? Absolutely stunning! The demons will go absolutely wild! Why exactly did you come here? Did you come to seduce me with that face?"

"No sir!"

Sparks flew in Gomez's eyes as he swung his fist and struck Amy's face.

Amy fell to the ground and tried to assess the situation, but her body stood up before her mind could catch up.

"I ask again! Are you trying to seduce me?"

Amy had come here to become a general.

"No sir!"

Gomez's face contorted as he struck Amy with even greater force than before.

"Get up!"

Amy rose like a roly-poly toy.

"I'll ask one last time! If you don't want to be the first dropout, you better answer well! Are you going to seduce me?"

A near-demonic roar erupted.

"No sir!"

Clenching her jaw and squinting one eye, Amy heard Gomez return to his position and shout.

"Listen well from now on! I demand only one thing from you all! Just die! That is our profession!"

Everyone snapped to attention.

"Who in the world wants to die? That's exactly why we're needed! Being paid to die in their place - that's what a soldier is! Let's do our job! Death is most noble!"

The 100 women had also fought through fierce competition to reach this place, but their eyes were different from when they first arrived.

"That's all! Enter the dormitories and receive your supplies! We'll begin the entrance ceremony as soon as you finish lunch!"

As Gomez gave his orders and headed toward where the male cadets were, an instructor followed and asked.

"How do you think it went? We were worried about foreign circumstances, but reading the recommendation letters, much more exceptional individuals have gathered than expected."

"What's the point of talking about it? War is the enemy. Do you think those flower-like kids came here dying to die?"

Gomez was also a devoted husband and father of two daughters at home.

"These are resources that will become Valkyrie's core assets in the future. Fighting demons is completely different from dealing with humans. Train them so harshly they shed tears of blood. Otherwise..."

A murderous glint flashed in Gomez's eyes.

"They'll shed tears of blood on the battlefield."

As the instructors left, the women finally relaxed and sighed.

"I wondered what a world army would be like, but it's nothing special."

"There are limits to discipline through military bearing. What kind of training we receive will be important."

Amy rubbed her swollen, throbbing cheek while listening intently to the other applicants' conversation.

"Looking at the last Valkyrie recruitment notice, they were recruiting general-level officers besides NCOs and officers? It's a good opportunity to learn under skilled people."

As expected, there were no weak people, Amy thought, steeling her resolve when someone tapped her shoulder.

"Oh...!"

Amy's eyes widened at an unexpectedly welcome face.

"Tess! You applied too?"

Tess of the Elzaine family.

Rian's friend who had formed a trio with Amy and Arin in Heaven was smiling brightly.

"Wow, Amy. You really got attention from day one, huh?"

Amy smiled bitterly.

"Yeah. I think I'm totally marked."

"That guy's definitely a pervert. If he'd hit you one more time, I would have stepped in and beaten him up."

That would be just like Tess's personality.

"It's okay. At least he hit me with his fist. If he'd slapped me, I would have beaten him up too..."

She would become stronger.

If she climbed higher and became a general, then she could meet Shirone with confidence.

Seeing Amy speak so calmly, Tess felt an aura from her and smiled warmly.

"Right. Let's definitely pass and show them what we're made of."

Suddenly realizing, Amy asked.

"But what about sword school? Did you have some motivation for suddenly applying to Valkyrie?"

Tess's face darkened.

"My father passed away. It seems he died defending the colony when the altar opened, struck down by a demon army."

Amy felt her vision go dark.

"Oh..."

"It's okay. I'm not sad. Father simply carried out his duties as a territorial commander. But I can't forgive the demons. That's why I applied to be an NCO after seeing the notice."

"NCO? Not an officer?"

With Tess's sword skills, she could easily become an officer in Valkyrie's army.

'She wants to fight.'

To avenge her father.

"Amy, are you going for officer?"

"Yeah. The Valkyrie magic unit side doesn't recruit NCOs. Even as an officer, field deployment is the same anyway."

Magic specialties belonged to special categories, so they had to be smaller in scale than infantry.

Promotion was faster, but even lieutenant colonels were often directly deployed to hand-to-hand combat.

"But..."

Tess asked hesitantly.

"Have you heard any news about Rian?"

"No. Complete radio silence. The Ogent family doesn't seem to know either. No contact with you either?"

Tess answered with silence.

"How inconsiderate. He could at least send word."

Amy's heart ached more because Rian would be the only one who could fill the void of losing her father.

"It's okay. That's just how he is. Since he's gotten stronger, wherever he is, he's probably eating well and fighting well."

Amy was in the same boat, having a male friend who couldn't read women's hearts.

"Hmph! We don't need such a blockhead anyway. Now you have Amy, right? If nights get lonely, you can date me instead."

As Tess pulled her arm close and pressed their bodies together, Amy's face went pale.

"Wait, what did you just say..."

"Oh come on, no need to pull away like that. This is the military anyway. We have to be self-sufficient among ourselves."

Being dragged along by Tess's strength, Amy asked anxiously.

"Tess, you're joking, right? Right? It really has to be a joke..."

"Hohoho! I don't know! I don't know how I might change either!"

Tess's laughter decorated the training ground among the still-awkward applicants.

"Who's laughing so cheerfully?"

The window of the command control room opened as a general who had personally come to attend the entrance ceremony looked down at the training ground.

"Those kids?"

Luda Garcia, the world's strongest flame mage.

She had stepped down from her position as president of Nameymond's Magic Association and currently served as commander of Valkyrie Magic Unit's 2nd Corps.

"Who is it? Why are they so relaxed?"

"Major General."

The duty officer watched the two women running around giggling, then searched through files.

"Carmis Amy and Elzaine Tess. Both from Tormia, they seem to have known each other for a long time. Also..."

The duty officer licked his lips.

"According to intelligence, these two women's lovers are Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars, Saint Aryan Shirone, and Knight of Maha, Rian."

Garcia's eyes became sleepy.

"Knight of Maha? The one sweeping through demons while advancing straight south from Kashan's northwest region?"

Rian's location was classified top secret.

"Yes. We understand Valkyrie offered him a general position, but he refused."

"Which one is the Five Great Stars' lover?"

She owed Shirone a debt.

"The red-haired one over there."

Garcia fixed Amy's face in her memory.

"Could you compile and send me everything about her training scores, performance, and specialty items?"

The duty officer stood at attention and answered.

"Yes sir!"

It was the Major General's order.

What the Republic of Cotria gained in exchange for handing over Excamachina was the full support of the Holy War.

The Holy War struck the western part of Gustav Empire with 30% of the Valkyrie forces fighting demons.

Even Balkan's military had to pause momentarily before objective numbers, giving the Republic of Cotria breathing room.

"It won't last long."

As Shirone flew toward Aganos, Minerva flew alongside on a jet.

"Even with the Eastern Jincheon Empire, Western Holy War, and Southern Republic of Cotria striking simultaneously, we're barely containing the expansion. Balkan's military power truly has remarkable aspects."

"He's someone who picked a fight with the world. Ultimately, eliminating Habits is the fastest solution."

And now, information that they had threaded the first button of that solution was delivered to Shirone and Minerva.

"...What kind of person do you think they are?"

The Excamachina team had found Alpha Fish.

"Whatever kind of person, they can't be sane."

Extreme evil, chaos, ignorance.

Someone who truly loved Habits, who embodied every unpleasant concept.

'Is such a thing possible?'

Even Gustav's 4th Armored Division was merely drawn by the scent of their own kind, far from love.

"You came quickly. How did the altar go?"

Using free passage to cross the walls and arrive at the imperial palace, Iruki was waiting at the entrance.

"I came while sealing it. Heard it was urgent business. Has Alpha Fish arrived?"

"Yeah. They're waiting in a room now."

"What kind of person are they?"

"Well..."

Iruki's lips twitched, but he eventually gave up on explaining and turned toward the inside of the imperial palace.

"Let's go. See for yourself and judge."
