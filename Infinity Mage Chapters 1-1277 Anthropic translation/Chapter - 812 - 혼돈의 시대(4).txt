Age of Chaos (4)

"Now this is where it really begins!"

Benoff tapped Rian's guard to check his defense, then launched into a full-scale assault.

Unlike jabs, these felt like hammers flying in, and Rian's upper body swayed as it was buried into the ring.

'Schema.'

And it was a considerable level at that.

'Can't he go a bit easier?'

Even while thinking this, Benoff's fists were pounding his guard like a downpour.

'What an iron wall.'

Even if he had set up his toughest subordinates and hit them this hard, bones would have broken and incident reports would need to be written.

"Even so!"

Benoff's leg came up to head level.

"I'll just smash through it!"

As the impact came from the side, Rian's body staggered back along the line.

'His guard is open.'

Detecting the impact, Benoff pressed forward, but Rian's real fighting was just beginning.

'Getting warmed up now, are we?'

The countless practical techniques he had learned fighting demons were hidden deep within.

'Let's see what you've got.'

As fist met fist, sounds like hitting leather water bags echoed through the security headquarters.

"Wow, he's going toe-to-toe with the captain."

The exchange of punches without hesitation left everyone mesmerized.

"His technique is excellent too. He's not allowing any clean hits."

Heavy fists like iron grazed shoulders, and each time he lowered his stance, attacks cut through empty air.

"Uho! Uho! Uho!"

Benoff pressed forward, repeatedly driving left hooks into Rian's ribs.

"Urgh!"

Just as a stiff feeling washed over him, a right straight came toward his face.

Rian reflexively twisted his body and grabbed Benoff's arm, attempting a shoulder throw.

Benoff tumbled to the opposite side as if being wound up, hitting the ground with a thud and sprawling spread-eagle.

"This bastard...!"

The moment he raised his upper body, Rian moved behind him and applied a triangle choke.

"Alright, let's see about that..."

Benoff bounced his upper body to escape the choke and tackled into Rian's embrace.

"This is it!"

For the next 2 minutes, countless ground techniques flew back and forth as the two large figures rolled around on the floor.

'Damn! What kind of strength is this?'

Though he trained his muscular endurance daily, after just 2 minutes against Rian, he could feel cramps in his muscles.

"Let's call it quits. Fighting while exhausted is dangerous."

"Kahaha! You youngster!"

Benoff's muscles bulged.

"Did you think this was child's play!"

As he squeezed out every ounce of strength to break free from the restraint, Rian wrapped his arms around his waist.

'Idiot! Your face is wide open!'

Just as Benoff twisted his waist to swing his elbow, both legs suddenly floated up.

"Huh?"

As Rian's upper body arched backward, the guards squeezed their eyes shut.

'German suplex! It's over!'

It should have been an impact severe enough to break his neck, but strangely, no cracking sound was heard.

"Wh-what?"

The guards who opened their eyes stared blankly with mouths agape.

"Grrrrr. You, you..."

Benoff's head was floating about a span above the ring floor.

"Is that even humanly possible?"

Stopping mid-motion during a German suplex couldn't be explained by sheer strength alone.

"...How is this even happening?"

With his rear end pointing skyward, Benoff asked.

"It's a prosecutor's conviction."

It was the power of will to endure in this position.

"Conviction?"

Lost in thought, Benoff wore a troubled expression for a moment before breaking into a bright smile.

"I lose. Let's end this."

Benoff rolled backward on the floor and stood up, while Rian raised his upper body from the backward position.

Benoff, who had watched the miraculous process, said:

"How about it? Feel refreshed after working up a sweat?"

"Yes, thanks to you."

It had been a while since he'd released stress like this.

"After sweating, I need to wash up. I heard you bathed just before, but shall we go together?"

"Sure. You can never bathe too many times."

It was a lesson he'd learned since coming here.

The next morning.

It would be disrespectful to compare a security guard's bed to an underground pit in the desert, but Rian's eyes opened early at dawn.

When he went outside, guards he hadn't seen before were sitting around, apparently having finished the dawn shift.

"You're up early. Feeling better from the journey?"

Security Captain Benoff seemed to work day and night.

"Yes. I should depart early."

"You said you're returning home. Do you have any other business remaining?"

"No. Not particularly..."

He was simply curious about his family's well-being.

"I see. Sorry, but I need to say something that might hold you back. Since this is also fate, I was wondering if you could help me out."

"The serial murder case."

"Since you've heard about it, this will be quick. First, follow me. I'll explain as we go."

Heading toward the morgue, Benoff told a story that wasn't much different from what the guard had told him yesterday.

"Civilians aren't allowed in, but you're trustworthy enough to show this to. Here it is."

As the coroner moved aside, Benoff grabbed a cabinet-like handle and pulled it out.

"Hmm."

Rian's face contorted.

"Getting a feel for it?"

The corpse, completely shriveled with dried blood, looked like a mummy with its mouth wide open.

It was impossible to tell if it was fear or ecstasy.

"Vampire."

Benoff nodded.

"A likely suspect species. Actually, vampire attacks have been reported in Zaib before. But this time is a bit unusual. They don't usually suck blood to this extent."

In Rian's opinion, it wasn't normal either.

"Even if vampires feed primarily on blood, don't stomachs have limits? That's why it's ambiguous. Maybe it's the work of a human pretending to be a vampire."

"If it's human, they're definitely a pervert."

"Right. The royal palace is slowly realizing the seriousness too. But I want to solve this with my own hands. Not out of ambition, but honestly, scum like this needs to be caught and smashed to pieces."

"It could be a vampire. Maybe a big eater who needs lots of blood."

He wasn't dismissing the possibility.

"I'm keeping both in mind. If it really is a vampire, this becomes a big problem. If it's a pure-blood vampire, the security force can't handle it. We'd need the royal guard unit 'Divine' at minimum."

Now Rian understood why Benoff was asking for help.

'A vampire...'

He had nothing to do other than going home anyway, and vampires were definitely part of the demon race.

"Understood. If it's something I can help with."

Benoff patted Rian's shoulder.

"Haha! I knew you'd say that. I'll arrange a temporary spot for you in the department, so wait there. Though you probably won't be sitting at a desk much anyway."

Rian unpacked his things again and sat in the spot Benoff designated, waiting for several hours.

After lunch, he was called.

"Get in the carriage. I have somewhere urgent to go."

Benoff's face looked worse than it had in the morning, but Rian got in the carriage without complaint.

They arrived at a grand mansion that anyone could tell belonged to the wealthy.

Though the grounds weren't larger than the Ozent family's, it was an excessive size to build in the heart of Zaib's capital.

"Where is this?"

"Zaib's first-class family, the Bark household. When I reported the Maha knight matter to headquarters, they contacted me."

"Is this related to the vampire?" He had no interest in being dragged around for political matters.

"It could be, or it could not be..."

A butler opened the door for them.

"Welcome. The head of house has been expecting you. The young lady is waiting."

Entering the mansion, they found a teenage girl with folded arms being escorted by knights.

"Ugh, what! I have shopping to do today! Why won't you let me go out?"

It was Bark Airin, the head of house's only daughter.

"Miss, don't you know? With the recent terrible incidents, you were told to refrain from going out..."

"But how can you not let me out even during the day? Dad is really too much!"

"Ah, today there's a special matter, so..."

The butler turned to look at Rian and Benoff, then bowed to Airin again while introducing them.

"From today onwards, the Maha knight who will guard you, Sir Ozent Rian. From the finest family in swordsmanship..."

"Enough! My current knights are sufficient! Just how much more suffocating do you plan to make me?"

Rian hadn't expected this situation either.

"You want me to guard a civilian?"

Benoff scratched his head awkwardly.

"Strictly speaking, she's not a civilian. She's the minister's daughter. The lady of the house is an advisor to the economic department."

Even so, it didn't make sense to him.

"An anonymous warning letter arrived the day before yesterday. It warned to beware of vampires. Whether it's a prank or not, we can't just ignore this matter."

That was why he had held back on the details.

"Do me this favor. I'm going to form a task force to hunt down the culprit. Just stay with her during that time."

Airin, who had overheard the conversation, spoke with a haughty expression:

"So what, am I being babysat now? How ridiculous. Listen here, mister. Do you know who I am?"

"The minister's daughter."

Airin snorted.

"At least you know. But I don't just let strange men near me, you know? And I hate big, bulky people. That alone already disqualifies you from the audition!"

"Audition?"

Those guarding Airin were all handsome men with slender builds.

"Listen, kid. First, I'm not a Zaib citizen. Second, having a good physique doesn't mean strong combat ability. Lastly, I'm not a mister, I'm an older brother."

"Puhaha! He says he's an older brother. How old are you?"

Rian answered confidently:

"Twenty-two."

"Eww, you're totally ancient."

For a different reason, he didn't want to be here.

"Hey, Maha knight. If you don't want to do it, get lost. We're enough for the young lady."

A knight in a stylish suit waved his hand dismissively, motioning for him to leave.

Being the minister's daughter, gaining attention here meant a smooth path in life.

'Most importantly...'

If their eyes even met, it would be hitting the jackpot.

"No, fine."

Airin stepped forward.

"I'll hire you. We happened to be short on manpower anyway. Protect our Tomas."

"Who's Tomas?"

Airin shouted toward the outside of the mansion:

"Tomas! Come here!"

A black-furred Doberman came running with its tongue hanging out and leaped into Airin's arms.

"This is maddening."

As Benoff held his forehead, Airin pointed at Rian with confident eyes.

"There! Protect him!"

Rian was resolute.

"No. Either apologize for your rudeness and accept my protection, or I'm just going back."

"Hmph! Who decided that? Didn't you come here under my dad's orders anyway, mister?"

"You don't want to die either."

At Rian's cold gaze, Airin's shoulders flinched.

"Your father called me because there's a severe shortage of personnel capable of subduing vampires. You know this too, which is why you've gathered only these pretty boys to hold out."

Vampire victims were mostly beautiful.

"Wh-what..."

As Airin's eyes darted around, the knights standing behind rushed forward.

"Hey, muscle head. I hear you've been annoying us since earlier. Did we ask you for your opinion on our looks?"

"Small fry should back off."

"...Miss, may we audition in your place?"

Airin hurriedly regained her composure and shouted:

"Fine! Show him what's what!"

As the knights cracked their knuckles and stepped forward, Rian's eyes widened.

Divine Transcendence.

Heart Fist Barrage.

The heart strikes first.

Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Fist!

There was no need to take action.

"What are you doing? Hurry up and deal with that arrogant mister..."

Airin frowned and looked behind her, then stared blankly with her mouth agape, doubting her own eyes.

"Hnnnngh...!"

The knights, feeling as if they'd been struck by dozens of punches, were all kneeling and breaking out in cold sweat.
