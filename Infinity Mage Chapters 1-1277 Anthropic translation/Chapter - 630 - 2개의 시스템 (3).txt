[630] Two Systems (3)

The impact of two-thirds the power of a Photon Cannon cast with Ataraxia concentrated into a single point was not something that could be endured even with 2,000 lives.

"AAAHHHHH!"

As Fermi collapsed to the ground writhing in agony, everyone stopped fighting without a word and turned to look.

"Fermi is..."

Screaming and suffering in agony.

Students who knew him as well as teachers had never seen such a sight before, and the Colosseum was engulfed in silence.

"12 million crashes?"

In reality, the entire surrounding area would have been reduced to ashes. It was fortunate that it was converted to numerical 2,000 lives instead.

"The power isn't the problem. The mass wasn't large, but it struck down at speeds far exceeding the speed of sound."

If Divine Punishment uses high-altitude potential energy, then Angel's Punishment creates kinetic energy through the reversal of time and space.

The power itself couldn't compare to Divine Punishment, but the precision strike capability using incarnation and the ultra-high-speed projectile that couldn't be avoided even with teleportation was beyond what could be explained even by the term "overpowered."

"Hah, hah."

Glaring at Fermi sprawled and trembling on the ground, Shirone exhaled roughly.

Incarnation was enlightenment, but Angel's Punishment incorporated magic, so it couldn't avoid consuming mental power.

"Percentage dropped to 27 percent."

'Musangsim.'

In an instant, the meaning of the world was cut off and mental power began recovering through Immortal Function.

"30 percent. 32 percent. It's rising again."

Elizabeth was no longer surprised.

"A nearly perfect mechanism."

It wasn't just wielding highly efficient magic, but countless functions were endlessly combining as needed.

"AAAHHHHH!"

As Fermi screamed and stood up, the spectators felt fear as if reading a scene from a horror novel.

"He withstood that?"

Elizabeth reported.

"Mental power gauge at 50 percent. It's magic."

Without equivalent exchange, it would be impossible to replenish half of one's mental power.

Depreciation Deal.

The devil's penalty fee.

By giving up ownership of all assets earned through irregular methods, magical efficiency could be doubled, but once cast, the magic carried the risk of contract breach.

"I've changed my mind."

Fermi glared only at Shirone.

"I'll eliminate you."

Depreciation Deal.

Explosive Season.

Rumbllllle!

Dark storm clouds gathered in the sky like a whirlpool, then filled with flames as if on fire, and a blizzard charged with lightning swirled violently.

"Climate magic Explosive Season. Damn Black Line."

Red Line archmages received support from kingdoms, but Black Line mages always needed money.

Of course, Archmage Pentaros, who was among the world's 100 most dangerous individuals, wouldn't hand over magic for mere gold coins, but it was also true that if he found it interesting, he'd lend it for free.

"He made the deal intending to destroy the balance of the graduation exam. This is a clear attack on the Red Line. The association should protest to Pentaros."

"He didn't break the agreement. He didn't intervene directly. Anyway, that's not the problem. Explosive Season controls all phenomena of nature."

Fermi floated like a god and looked down at Shirone.

"Die."

Flames of fire fell simultaneously with lightning, and sharp hail poured down relentlessly like a localized downpour.

As wind sharper than blades swept through, Shirone's mental power gauge began dropping miserably.

'Tremendous power. I'll be pushed back at this rate.'

It was time for a counterattack, but buried in the storm clouds, Fermi wasn't even visible.

"Hahahaha! How does it feel to be a frog in a well?"

Facing the ferocious phenomena created by nature, other participants didn't even dare to push through.

"Annoying. What kind of magic is this for a graduation exam?"

As Luman said, it was Black Line's highest level magic, and even the magic school teachers couldn't fathom the omnipotence of magic that went against nature's order.

"Tremendous overpowered. Fermi won't last long either."

"Percentage is dropping rapidly. At the current rate, he'll be exhausted in 5 minutes."

Ignoring the consequences, he was only thinking of eliminating Shirone.

'I can't give up here!'

As he pushed into Explosive Season's storm clouds, massive electrical charges stuck to him and electricity flowed through his entire body.

"To catch a demon, you have no choice but to enter hell."

"Shirone's mental power is rapidly depleting. He'll be exhausted in 3 minutes."

The thunder from the storm clouds echoed throughout the Colosseum.

'I won, Shirone.'

Fermi looked with pleasure at Shirone's gradually paling face.

'You'll have to repeat another year, right? Let's have fun playing together.'

After this battle ended, he too would be eliminated, but wouldn't even hell become an interesting place if he was with Shirone?

"Heuuuh!"

As Shirone opened Immortal Function and squeezed out a Photon Cannon with all his might, Fermi quickly retreated.

'I just need to dodge.'

Then his head spun and the scenery twisted dizzily.

"What...?"

"Time's up."

Boyle, sitting in the spectator seats, looked at Pandora.

"Time's up?"

"Fragrance magic, Paralysis of Pleasure. A strategy Master Maeil taught me. It's colorless and odorless, so you get poisoned without knowing. It has the disadvantage of taking a long time though."

"You used that on Fermi?"

"I accumulated it bit by bit. It was the only way I could fight. In the end, I couldn't even reach that level though..."

Pandora looked up at Explosive Season.

"At least I should bite his heel."

"Kuuuh!"

As Fermi wrinkled his nose bridge, a Photon Cannon flew toward his eyes.

"Aaahhh!"

As he screamed and bent his upper body as if it would break, the flash of light grazed past his ear.

'I'm not someone to be bitten by a mere bug!'

As Fermi spread both arms wide, Explosive Season rumbled and powerful lightning struck Shirone.

"It's over!"

That was 1 second.

'Shibalssangpokmae!'

Spreading countless golden trajectories as he approached, Shirone compressed a single-shot Photon Cannon.

"Damn it...!"

Front, back, left, right - every time he calculated escape routes in his head, Shirone's afterimages scattered in all directions, and finally a flash of light pierced Fermi's abdomen.

"Kueok!"

Participant number 1. Eliminated from the 2,000 Lives system.

Shock filled the eyes of everyone looking up at the storm clouds.

"Fermi... was eliminated."

As Explosive Season's storm clouds disappeared and Fermi crashed to the ground, everyone who knew him was stunned.

"Fermi's irregular magic is certainly excellent."

Alpheas said bitterly as he watched his student's end.

"But a mage's pride can't be bought with money."

In his fading consciousness, Fermi captured in his eyes Shirone floating in the victor's position.

'Incarnation technique.'

And the countless magics linked to that incarnation.

"That is..."

Fermi's eyes closed.

'No amount of money could buy that.'

His body crashed to the ground with a thud.

No one caught him, and they only watched indifferently as he lay unconscious.

"Is he, is he dead?"

To the spectators' question, Olivia answered.

"The impact sound is smaller than expected. It's an automatic response algorithm."

Alpheas let out a hollow laugh.

"Really can't match him."

Being so confident yet still considering the possibility of defeat was indeed typical of Fermi.

"Kuuk!"

Shirone, who had descended to the ground, clutched his chest and trembled.

"Quite drained. Well, that's natural."

No matter how excellent the system, recovery efficiency would inevitably continue to decline.

'Now 15 remain. Fermi was eliminated and Shirone is exhausted too.'

In everyone's minds, graduation was becoming reality.

'5 people, I need to eliminate 5 people.'

While everyone was watching each other, Luman raised the corners of his mouth.

'The team disbanded, but...'

A crowd control specialist never needed allies from the beginning.

'I control the battlefield!'

Crowd Control.

Ant Hill.

As Luman concentrated his mind, his flesh trembled, and a massive amount of earth rose from the Colosseum's perimeter, covering everything in a dome shape.

"Tremendous scale."

"It's a maze with anti-magic applied. That would be difficult to escape from."

A crowd control mage stepping forward meant he had perfect confidence.

"Damn it! What the hell is he thinking?"

Trapped in the hemispherical maze where even light couldn't enter, participants each cast Shining magic.

'Kukuku, cunning bastard.'

Only Fiord, positioned at the dome's center, realized the intention and shrugged his shoulders.

"He dares to use me?"

But it was such an excellent strategy that he had no choice but to go along.

"Then gladly..."

Fiord's hands emitted green light as they drew a round circle.

Mass Destruction Magic - Fryers.

Centered on him, gas with tremendous toxicity exploded outward and raced through the complex tunnels.

"It's poison magic! Most participants' mental power levels are dropping rapidly."

"Do those who endure graduate?"

"Aaahhhhh!"

Though they couldn't see inside Ant Hill, the screams penetrating the walls made the spectators' faces turn pale.

'Exit! Where's the exit?'

It was a three-dimensional maze with anti-magic on the walls, making it impossible to accurately determine position even with Spirit Zone.

"Not a bad situation."

Detoxifying the poison entering his body, Richard expelled gas through a vent in his side, and Pyscho wore a large beetle like a gas mask as he wandered the dark tunnels, detoxifying poison.

"I'll end it here."

Insect Magic.

Parasite.

Half of his right arm crumbled like soft dough, then transformed into the upper body of an insect resembling a pill bug.

It was a parasite called Argones that his master Cailer had passed down.

"Pyscho!"

Amy burst out from one of the six branching tunnels and stopped abruptly.

'Of all people, Pyscho.'

Her red eyes blinked rapidly, but the shock of the deadly poison was dropping her mental power faster than that.

'I'm at a disadvantage here.'

Fighting Pyscho, who could detoxify poison, in an enclosed space was disadvantageous.

'Is Amy the sacrifice?'

If he categorized his feelings about her as like or dislike, it was always closer to like.

'She's always a hardworking child.'

To use an analogy, it was like an older brother's compassion for his younger sister.

"It's unfortunate. Your luck was bad meeting me."

"Nonsense! What luck is there in a graduation exam?"

Seeing Amy still spirited, he could feel somewhat less guilt.

"I won't handle you too roughly."

As Pyscho raised his right arm, Argones opened its jaws wide and let out a strange cry.

'I need to find Maya!'

Cayden raced frantically through Ant Hill's tunnels searching for Maya.

'She won't be able to endure it.'

Unlike other participants, it wasn't a shock that Maya, with her weak mental power, could handle.

'Wait! Maya!'

Steadying his mental power that was wavering from the deadly poison's shock, Cayden moved his feet even faster.

'This is as far as I go.'

Maya, collapsed in Ant Hill's clearing, was only blinking her eyes like a dying animal.

She had done her best, but it was a pathetic exam that was all about luck rather than ability.

'I won't be able to attend school anymore.'

Since she had to feed her siblings too, she'd probably have to return to the mystical tribe and do business or something.

Then footsteps were heard and someone's silhouette flickered in the deadly poison gas.

'I can't even fight anyway.'

"Maya?"

The moment she heard the voice, her eyes snapped open.

"Shirone?"

Seeing Shirone's face approaching without wariness, her heart began pounding.

'No. I've endured so hard all this time...'

A person perhaps more precious than life.

"Maya, are you okay?"

The gentle voice undid the latch.

"Hieuk, huk."

In the end, Maya made a tearful face and burst into foolish crying.

"Shirone..."
