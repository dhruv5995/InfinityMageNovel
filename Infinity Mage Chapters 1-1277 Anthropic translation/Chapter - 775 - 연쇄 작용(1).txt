[775] Chain Reaction (1)

As the heat of the explosion subsided, Miro's group and Shura moved a little closer to Gaold.

Faced with the unprecedented situation of a Buddha being broken, their senses concentrated to not miss even the smallest signal.

"I reached the state of Buddha after experiencing the entirety of fortune and misfortune that exists in this world."

Zulu said.

"But... it wasn't more painful than Gaold."

He understood human suffering but didn't understand all suffering, and the outcome was decided there.

Sein said.

"Unless Gaold permits it, Nane cannot close this world."

That was why the sermon was broken.

"Yes. For now."

At Zulu's addition, people turned their heads again to listen to the conversation between Gaold and Nane.

"Does it hurt?"

Gaold asked, looking down at Nane.

His entire body had suffered serious fractures and blood continuously gushed from his mouth, but his eyes looked peaceful.

"The most in the universe."

Gaold burst into a chuckle and plopped down beside Nane, pulling out a cigarette from his pocket.

The moment he put it to his lips and lit it, coughing erupted.

"Cough! Cough!"

As the aftershock of transcending fullness rushed in, it felt like all the bones in his body were being crushed.

"Even with such a body, you still inhale fire?"

Gaold stopped coughing and inhaled the cigarette with his eyes narrowed as if it tasted delicious.

"Compared to the pain of living, cigarettes are nothing. You're the one who won't last long."

Gaold lowered his gaze.

"Are you afraid? Of dying, I mean."

It wasn't something to ask a Buddha, but that's exactly why Gaold wanted to hear it directly.

"Not particularly. Life and death aren't different."

Gaold exhaled cigarette smoke long and looked toward the wide-open horizon.

"...Don't you have any thought of just living? Throwing away all that merit stuff, struggling and fighting, bumping into people?"

Kang Nan's eyes filled with sadness.

'Of course.'

How could Nane be hateful?

'The person who wants to die the most is actually you. And Nane is...'

The one who understood Gaold's feelings most deeply.

"My thoughts won't change. Your pain can indeed be said to be endless, and you still chose life, but..."

As Nane recalled the lives of sentient beings, a red liquid mixed with blood flowed from his eyes.

"Not everyone in the world is as strong as you."

Even if the weight of pain is the same, not everyone endures with strong will.

"...I suppose so."

Gaold, who had thought of death with every breath he took, couldn't not know that fact.

"Damn it. Why is everything so complicated?"

Gaold threw away his cigarette.

"Why is it so important that others suffer? Then what about your pain? Why do you live so difficultly?"

Nane was resolute.

"Because I know it's right."

Though he knew he couldn't change Nane's mind, Gaold maintained silence for a long time.

"No way?"

At the thought that Gaold might actually let Nane live, Miro suddenly became anxious.

'The chain reaction of the law.'

If Buddha exists, then Yahweh also exists, and ultimately good cannot completely erase evil.

"I'll do it myself."

"Miro."

Zulu said coldly.

"You know, don't you? We don't have the qualification."

Only Gaold had suffered more than Buddha.

Therefore, whether to acknowledge or deny Buddha would be his alone to decide.

"The future of humanity is at stake. If we can't end the game, countless people will suffer."

"That's also your belief, not Gaold's belief. He's not humanity. He's human."

"But...!"

"Miro, just accept it."

Zulu looked back with emotionless eyes.

"Humans have won."

It was in the Middle Eastern language.

What broke Buddha was ultimately human.

Faced with an undeniable fact, the extremist bit her lips.

'Gaold, please listen to me...'

Nane said.

"Just end it. Since this is the world you've established, I too will hand it over to humans and depart."

Gaold looked up at the sky.

"You're not a bad guy either."

Miro's face turned into a crying expression.

'Gaold, please...'

"However."

At that moment, as if telepathy had connected, Gaold turned his head to look at Miro.

"The woman I love seems to have difficulty doing something if you're living here."

"Huh?"

Those who were listening simultaneously turned to look at Miro, but the more they did, the less she could even move her gaze.

Nane raised the corners of his mouth.

"That's sufficient."

Since humans won, shouldn't the standard for defining the world also be utterly human?

"I'm glad the one you love is an extremist."

Extremist, one who must give.

"I don't know about that stuff. Don't want to know either."

To Gaold, Miro was just a rotten woman who would even rip out her heart and offer it for humanity's happiness.

As Gaold raised his hand, the air split sharply and condensed with the hardness of a blade.

"Farewell."

The moment Nane closed his eyes, the air cut sliced through the wind, aiming for his neck.

Crack crack crack crack crack!

Sparks flew in the air as the blade stopped, and shortly after, a faint shield phantom materialized before their eyes.

"Hah! Hah!"

Shura, hidden behind the shield, looked down at Nane with a confused expression.

'He's about to die.'

It wasn't a decision made after clear judgment.

'I don't know.'

When Nane's death became reality, a trace of doubt bloomed in her heart.

She felt she needed time to organize her thoughts, and that was sufficient motivation for action.

'First, I'll escape.'

Just as she tried to push Gaold away with Gestalt's shield, unbelievable pressure crushed her.

'What is this?'

Even though he had exhausted his mental power against Nane, the power of breaking the precepts was not something Shura could handle.

"Kyaaah!"

At the same time a giant divine strangling made of hundreds of inverted crosses was born, she was flattened.

Kuuuuung!

A massive explosion occurred due to the friction of solid air compressing the ground directly.

"Catch Shura!"

Since it wasn't Gaold's intention, now even Zulu didn't stop Miro from heading to the ground.

A small crater formed in the center of the giant pit in Jungcheon-dong, and Miro's group entered through the smoke.

"What happened?"

Gaold stood looking into the distance.

"I caught her."

And pointing to the ground, he said.

"Half of her."

Miro lowered her gaze.

"Tail cutting? How cunning..."

Shura's lower half, cleanly severed below the waist, was convulsing while spurting blood.

Rough breathing leaked through Shura's clenched teeth.

"Hik! Hik!"

Though she was crawling with only her upper body remaining, shaking her shoulders, her speed was as fast as wind.

After passing the cliffs of the Jungcheon-dong mountain range and going through complex tree paths, Nane, lying on her back, asked.

"Why did you save me?"

"I don't know! I don't know! I'm going to think about it from now on!"

Nane smiled broadly.

"Sometimes you're clumsy at lying."

This is why doubts arise.

'Where in the world is there anything eternal? If you die, you die! But... but...!'

Shouldn't she know what it is before going?

'Lies! Lies! Lies!'

As Shura kicked off the ground with both arms and launched her body, blood poured like a downpour from her waist.

"There's no such thing as truth in this world!"

All things are merely frequencies, and what we believe to be real are just illusions created by those signals.

"Everything is lies!"

From being born as a snake to mastering transformation techniques to become human, Shura had repeated countless lies.

'But if that's the case...'

The final conclusion the god of lies ultimately reached was.

'What exactly is real?'

That something must exist anyway.

"Hng. Hng."

Shura, having stopped the blood trail, gritted her teeth and climbed the steep mountainside to reach the summit.

"Haak! Haak!"

Resting her chin on the ground and sticking out her 1-meter-long tongue while panting, she craned her neck toward her back.

"Are you okay?"

"...I haven't died yet."

Nane added.

"I'll die if you don't take care of me."

Shura's eyes narrowed.

"Hmph! Even Buddha doesn't want to die, it seems? So everything you've said until now was all lies?"

"If you look at it as lies, everything is lies, and if you look at it as truth, everything is truth."

Nane turned his head.

"In reality, what you and I see isn't different."

"..."

Like when dealing with Beron, she couldn't lie in front of Nane's gaze either.

"Ugh, wait. First we need to hide..."

Shura, who had created an illusion barrier with Gestalt's ability, bit Nane's collar and crawled into the cave.

Looking up at the sky, Nane smiled.

"The weather is nice."

Nane was alive.

After hiding in the cave for about three days, Shura's lower body had regenerated up to her thighs.

Since walking was still difficult, Shura filled her mouth with water and crawled through the cave with both arms.

"Mmph. Mmph."

When Nane, whose bones hadn't yet mended, opened his mouth, she transferred the water from her mouth to his.

"Good water."

"Of course. I specially fetched bedrock water. Can't you get up now? You can heal with sermons."

"I've been thinking."

Shura, who had been licking her dirt-covered body with her tongue, showed interest and turned her head again.

"Did you figure out the secret of the world?"

"If I had, I would have already closed the world. Rather, it's about why I couldn't be perfect."

Shura was disappointed.

"Eh, that was already broken."

"Looking back, it seems to have been wrong from the beginning. Righteousness isn't something you reach. It just is right."

Shura blinked.

"So whether you climbed up through lies or truth, you couldn't reach the real thing."

The 11th sense, the sense ofÍ∂Å.

"Yes. Whether you call that the sky or not the sky, you can't know without becoming the sky."

Shura mimicked Buddha.

"Don't look at the idea, become the idea. That is true righteousness."

Nane stroked her head.

"Since you understand integration, you can be called Buddha."

"Hehe, so what will you do now?"

"First, I must tear down everything I've built. If it can't be reached, I have no choice but to wait for righteousness."

"Hing, what a waste."

There was one way to tear down the state of Buddha.

"Now I feel the suffering of sentient beings with my heart. Since I can shed tears, it's not wasteful at all."

When he activated Sermon Recovery, Nane's bones reconnected and Shura's lower body regenerated instantly.

Shura was a bit embarrassed.

"I hate looking like this..."

Nane smiled and comforted her.

"Let's go. This is what I must do."

Nane, who went outside the cave, briefly adjusted his eyes to the sunlight, then formed hand seals and declared.

"I announce to the entire universe."

It was Nane's final sermon.

"Since the current law cannot completely save the suffering of sentient beings, I will take special measures."

It was a massive voice.

"I permit the breaking of precepts for all beings."

The fact that the world's master had given up maintaining the system echoed throughout the entire universe.

Conversely, it meant that Nane could no longer be the manager of this world.

'This makes Buddha disappear, but...'

Shura watched the sword of words shoot into the sky, creating waves of law.

'He's gained the possibility of becoming a true Buddha.'

Perhaps that's why.

Even though he had become an ordinary human who lost truth, Nane was embracing the world with warm eyes.
