Simultaneous Incident (3)

Adolf XIII and the royal family emerged from the underground bunker.

The royal family was deeply displeased by the collapsed ceiling, but there was no time to grumble.

"What in the world is going on? A battle occurring in the capital that the king knows nothing about. Summon everyone involved in this matter immediately."

"However, the current priority is to manage the situation..."

"Uncle." Anger flared in Adolf XIII's eyes.

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"I am the king. Even during wartime, what use is a nation if royal authority is not restored?"

He understood the impatience of one who had just become king, but that made it all the more difficult.

'They all refused.'

Despite sending those with high direct lineage rankings, their refusal to respond to the summons was proof they didn't trust Adolf XIII.

Robbins, first in direct lineage ranking and Adolf XIII's younger brother, spoke.

"Your Majesty, the people already regard you as a great king. When the people follow, politicians will follow, and eventually officials from each institution will fall in line quickly."

"Hmm."

At least it was pleasant to hear.

"Moreover, having the holy war's army stationed in Bashka is a great opportunity. If we make Tormia the central power of the world war, we can receive massive support funds from other nations."

The royals voiced their agreement.

"That's right. Especially the southern continent should be charged heavily. Aren't we serving as their shield?"

Adolf XIII nodded.

"I think the same. Come to think of it... I heard someone from the Ivory Tower is here."

"It's Arian Sirone, one of the Five Great Stars of the Integrated Space Management Department. He's from our nation and holds the title of Compassion of the Age, playing a major role in the world war."

"Hmph, compassion indeed."

Adolf XIII didn't believe in things he couldn't see.

"In any case, treat him with utmost respect. Money is no object."

After all, once they gained the Ivory Tower's recognition, they could cover expenses with support funds from other nations.

"Understood. But before that, there's one matter we need to resolve."

"Resolve?"

Robbins narrowed his eyes as he spoke.

"Direct lineage ranking 127, Pony."

"Ahem."

Anger also flared on Adolf XIII's face.

"Currently, the Five Great Star here and Pony studied together at magic school. If she manages to recruit Sirone first..."

A royal who had imagined something sinister shouted.

"We must kill her! Didn't you see earlier? She cast magic without hesitation. She only yielded royal authority to survive for the moment. Now that the city is stable, she'll surely cause trouble."

Adolf XIII stroked his chin.

"But what could someone like her possibly do? It's already difficult to recruit a first-class Ivory Tower resident, let alone a Five Great Star."

"Who knows, she might even use a honey trap."

Though it was words that diminished royal dignity, if the target was Pony, it was a different story.

"Hasn't there always been signs? She's a woman who even entered the world beauty contest to get into the royal direct lineage ranking. She knows her appearance is outstanding and acts accordingly. This time too, she won't be choosy about means and methods."

Finally, the possibility of royal overthrow felt real.

"...Can it be done? The Magic Association won't help us, and military command authority has currently been transferred to the holy war. If we don't kill her for certain, we'll be the ones to suffer."

Robbins said.

"I have a plan. We'll use criminals."

"The prison. But aren't A-class and above criminal detention facilities also managed by the Magic Association?"

"There's a suitable candidate in the western prison, Inferno."

He never expected the card he had prepared in case he might need to kill his father or brother someday would be used like this.

A royal asked puzzledly.

"Inferno? No matter how vicious, that would only be B-class, wouldn't it?"

"That's true, but..."

There was no need to mention that the person wasn't imprisoned for committing crimes.

"I can guarantee their skills. It's the son of Gunjo Bedium, the world's greatest hitman. He's also from the same magic school as Sirone and Pony."

"Gunjo Bedium? The Black Line?"

It was a name that made the royals' teeth chatter just hearing it.

'The son of such a person is imprisoned in Inferno? No, before that, how does Robbins know about him...'

For a moment, the royals' faces turned pale, but they soon regained composure.

'Well, it's only natural.'

Anyone in the top 10 of direct lineage ranking had the possibility of becoming king and held at least one card of their own.

'Let's not show it. Right now, eliminating Pony comes first.'

No danger could compare to the crisis of Pony potentially recruiting Sirone.

Adolf XIII showed no change in expression.

Of course he would know, but he was the king.

"Good. Robbins, I'll leave the Pony matter to you. However, it must be handled with certainty."

"Yes. Don't worry, Your Majesty."

Just as Robbins bowed his head, a voice came from outside the door.

"The Five Great Star of the Ivory Tower requests an audience."

It was an urgent voice, and the royals stirred.

'Too fast?'

From Tormia's perspective it was an opportunity, but trouble always followed hidden behind good fortune.

"Bring him in."

As soon as the order was given, Robbins slipped out the back door and the main entrance opened.

Adolf XIII personally rose to greet Sirone.

"Please come in. A novice king meets a star of the Ivory Tower."

The sincerity felt in his actions and speech meant he was that desperate.

"Yes. I'm Sirone, one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower."

"I apologize for the humble conditions. As you can see, we've just experienced great turmoil and haven't had time to prepare."

'Great turmoil.'

He probably wasn't unaware of how many people had died, but Sirone didn't show it and sat at the table.

The maids hurriedly brought out hastily procured premium tea.

"We should properly hold a banquet, but there wasn't time to prepare..."

"That's fine."

He didn't want to waste time.

"The reason I came is to hear the vision of Tormia's new king. Humanity is currently in a precarious situation."

"Of course."

Adolf XIII straightened his posture as if what he'd been waiting for had come.

"The Kingdom of Tormia achieved an unprecedented victory in the world war today. We annihilated the demons and drove out the giants. This is an achievement accomplished by the combined efforts of the holy war and Tormia's people."

Sirone let it pass for now.

"We will announce this historic moment to the world. With Tormia as the center, humanity will be revived. Star of the Ivory Tower, please entrust that role to me."

'Adolf XIII.'

His real name was Adolf Tenar, age 44.

Sirone knew his history up to age 22 through Omega.

'He was ambitious from childhood, and his problem-solving methods were typically swift, secretive, and cruel.'

Adolf XIII said casually.

"Tormia will also do everything possible, that is, with all our heart and soul, to assist the Five Great Star."

This could be called blatant, but Sirone recalled the words Guffin had left.

Listen to everyone's story.

"I understand for now."

Adolf XIII breathed a sigh of relief.

'What? I heard Ivory Tower people were eccentric, but he's actually a pushover?'

Hiding his thoughts, he said.

"If there's anything you need, please just say so. Anything at all."

"No. I've heard your vision, so I'll be going. But where is Pony? She doesn't seem to be here."

The royals' expressions stiffened slightly, and Sirone didn't miss that momentary change.

"Could you call her? I have something to discuss with her personally."

"Of course she should be summoned. Pony is truly a brave royal. She's probably out there working directly. As soon as she returns, we'll have the Five Great Star... Ugh!"

The moment he looked at Sirone's face, electricity ran down his spine.

It felt like being pierced by a gaze alone.

'What's this suddenly?'

He was seasoned in poker faces in both politics and social circles, but this level of being observed was a first.

Sirone asked.

"What are you hiding?"

Adolf XIII opened his mouth with a perfect smile.

"Hiding? How could I tell lies before a star of the Ivory Tower?"

Sirone chuckled and said.

"You still haven't fixed that habit."

"Pardon?"

"That distinctive smile you make when lying."

"That's absurd. Smiling is something I always do."

"But in specific situations, you close your eyes once before opening them. Because of a memory ingrained from childhood. You were once hit hard on the head by your predecessor for lying, weren't you?"

Amid the silence that enveloped the room, Adolf XIII's Adam's apple gulped.

'How does he know that?'

It was a fact no one knew except his father and himself.

'No, even if father were alive, would he even remember?'

It wasn't significant enough for even himself to remember while living, so how could Sirone know?

"I know you trained blood and sweat to make perfect smiles. But there's exactly one thing you couldn't practice. Well..."

Sirone pointed at him.

"How many people could flick the forehead of a Tormian prince?"

Adolf XIII's fist on his knee trembled.

'Is the Five Great Star of the Integrated Space Management Department a ghost?'

This wasn't insight or analysis.

'It's such a trivial matter. Even a mental-type mage would have to wander in my depths for at least a month to find it.'

It felt like his soul had been stripped bare.

"I'll give you one last chance. What are you hiding?"

Adolf made his gamble.

"Haha. I have no idea what you're talking about."

The eyes of Adolf XIII, who was smiling while breaking out in cold sweat, closed once again.

Bashka's western prison, Inferno.

Pony, who had arrived after receiving an urgent telegram, handed documents stamped with the royal seal to the administrative director.

"This way."

There was no citizen under heaven that a king couldn't rule, and all national kings had the authority to write pardons.

'What an unpleasant task to be stuck with.'

Pony, who had been preparing to leave Bashka, received urgent contact.

The message was to release a criminal from Inferno as essential personnel was needed for national restoration.

She complied readily knowing the manpower shortage situation, but given her great disappointment with power, she felt skeptical.

"Please go this way."

The gloomy underground facility of Block E, the deepest part of Inferno, greeted her.

It was where special criminals were detained, all vicious individuals.

'What kind of talent are they looking for in a place like this?'

Resolving to return to Alpeas Magic School without regrets once this matter was handled, she walked down the long corridor.

From the room at the very end came the sound of a woman's moaning.

Though she knew co-ed housing was impossible, between the sultry woman's voice, a man's breathing leaked through.

'What bastard?'

Since he was called talent, it was obvious he was a specially treated prisoner.

But her voice, already filled with disgust, could only be cold.

"Prisoner number 3824. You've been designated for special protective custody. Come out."

The moaning stopped abruptly.

'Special protection?'

One of the five keywords promised with Prince Robbins, meaning... Kill the one who came looking for you.

'The time has come.'

A guard's voice came from the ceiling.

"The mana control device in Block E will be disabled for 30 seconds. Anyone acting suspiciously while the siren sounds will be immediately executed by royal command."

The siren sounded immediately and the mana control device could be felt shutting off.

"Oppa, who's outside?"

Hearing the sultry voice from the criminal detention facility, Pony could no longer hold back.

"Come out, you bastard."

The moment she turned the key received from the guard as if it would break and opened the door.

"Kugh!"

A hand flew from the darkness and grabbed Pony's neck.

Even as she was slammed into the detention facility wall with a bang, Pony couldn't resist.

"Kuk! This bastard...!"

The moment she tried to cast magic, electricity surged through her entire body.

"Huuuugh!"

"Shh."

A familiar man with disheveled hair brought his face close and placed his index finger to his lips.

Pony's eyes widened.

"You are?"

Electric Monster Rycon.

"Oh?"

Rycon also grinned with drug-intoxicated lips as if finding it interesting.

"Pony? Long time no see?"

"You, you bastard! Let go of this!"

The woman, not even covering her naked body, shook Rycon.

"Oppa! Who's this bitch? Don't tell me you called another woman besides me? You said it was only me... Huk!"

Simultaneously with Rycon swinging his hand, the woman's face exploded with a thud.

'Tremendous electric shock.'

"Well, you were royalty too. Pitiful. But have some pride. It's proof you've grown enough to be a threat."

Rycon showed his rotten teeth as he smiled.

"Die."

Just as electricity coiled around the hand choking her neck, Pony's eyes widened.

'That is...'

Behind Rycon's back, a familiar figure was glowing golden.

'Sirone?'
