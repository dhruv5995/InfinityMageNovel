Strike of Destruction (4)

The demons rushed toward Gaold.

"Now! Kill him!"

The moment red and blue bodies formed a seamless dome around Gaold.

"Kugh..."

Air Press exploded outward.

With a thunderous roar, the demons' bodies were torn to shreds, and the sky became visible in Miro's field of vision.

"Gaold, you..."

Before she could finish speaking, Gaold grabbed Miro by the collar and suddenly screamed.

"What are you doing, you idiot!"

The relief that had been in his eyes vanished, replaced only by surging hatred.

Miro, her desire to make excuses completely gone, broke free from his grip and shouted back.

"That's not what's important right now! I had no choice! The dimensional barrier...!"

"Watch out!"

The moment Kang Nan screamed, all the demons rushed toward Gaold.

"Damn it!"

Gaold's hair turned white, and powerful atmospheric pressure crushed the entire radius.

Kuuuuuuuung!

Unable to even make a sound, the demons were flattened, and blood gushed from their corpses like fountains.

"Let's get out of here!"

Gaold grabbed Miro's hand and flew into the sky, with Kang Nan and Zulu following behind.

Miro shouted urgently.

"Let go! I need to tell you something!"

The reason the avatar of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara had completely collapsed wasn't simply because her heart was shaken.

'The gateway has been breached.'

Though it wasn't as intense as the old samadhi state, it was true that even Nane couldn't easily destroy it.

'They came with full intent.'

Miro, gathering her scattered thoughts, shook off Gaold's hand and stopped in midair.

"Wait."

When Gaold turned around, Kang Nan and Zulu quickly approached his side.

Kang Nan pointed accusingly.

"If you're just going to keep interfering like thisâ€”"

"I have to go back."

Since Miro had endured all sorts of humiliation and stayed, Kang Nan narrowed her eyes.

"Go back?"

Miro looked behind her.

"Probably Middle Heaven, the Gate of Guffin that Nane was trying to use has been breached. Heaven's army has invaded."

It was one disaster after another.

"Zion needs to move before they meet Nane. No, perhaps..."

Their target might be Zion as well.

'Their combat power itself is supreme. Moreover, humanity's strength is weakened right now.'

What they feared wasn't strong enemies, but a state where collision itself was impossible due to dimensional barriers.

"I'll go check it out first. Once the central continent is stabilized..."

"Wait."

Gaold said.

"You going there won't solve anything. But it won't be solved without you either."

To fight Heaven's army, Miro's mind needed to be in a proper state at minimum.

"Can't we talk about this later? I'm in a hurry right now."

"If you go like this, only death awaits. Either stay here, or abandon me and leave for Zion."

Naturally she should go to Zion, but the emotion that had briefly crossed Gaold's eyes held her back.

"I won't abandon you."

Miro bit her lip as she spoke.

"Because you won't abandon me. I'll never abandon you either. Got it?"

Gaold turned around.

"Zulu, Kang Nan. Go with Miro."

Once they arrived at Zion, Miro would have no choice but to make a decision.

"Why should we?"

And Gaold was the person who knew the woman called Miro best.

'She'll understand what's right.'

Having sent Miro away with that thought, Gaold passed by Zulu and Kang Nan and said.

"There's no other reason. Check the results at Zion. I'm going to the central continent."

It sounded like he was looking for a place to die.

"You don't mean..."

"It's not like that. Go and come back quickly. The demons are a problem, but Heaven's army is truly a serious matter."

Zulu grabbed Kang Nan's shoulder.

"Let's go. We don't have time."

All Kang Nan could do was handle Zion's affairs as quickly as possible.

"I'll just escort Miro there and come back. Don't think about doing everything alone and wait for us."

Only after confirming Gaold's smile did Kang Nan board Zulu's summoned beast Kaidra.

Kiiiiiiiii!

Watching the monster bird quickly disappear toward the south, blood burst from Gaold's mouth.

"Kack! Kack!"

Not much time left.

"Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh."

The reason he could still laugh was because what he hated most was his own body.

"Yeah. Do more, more."

Gaold glared at the phantom of himself standing before him, revealing his killing intent.

"I'll kill you horribly."

The final fireworks of burning his life awaited.

Alphonse Mountain Range.

"This place is..."

Sirone, who had crashed toward the planet from the Great Temple, looked down at the mountain range that twisted like a snake's corpse.

Even before entering magic school, this was the dragon habitat he had stayed up all night talking about with Rian.

"The Core sleeps here."

Blitz, who had transformed into human form, flew beside Sirone and pointed to the mountain range.

"Do you remember? We met you at the point when human history began."

Andre's World Number 1.

It wasn't a period that normal creatures could remember, but dragons knew no forgetting.

"After you left that era, the Mudeung Dragon told me. Find Sirone, he said."

Sirone looked back at Blitz.

"But why now? If it was after I entered Andre's World Number 1, any time would have been fine."

Because the promise became valid from that point.

"There was a condition. When you could understand the emptiness of the universe, we would be needed. It was close, but we seem to have made it in time."

If opening Mootae had been just a little later, they would have faced the angel army without being able to awaken the Mudeung Dragon.

"Now, go. Access our Core. There you will hear about everything in this world."

He had a guess, but asked anyway.

"How do I wake it up?"

"The Mudeung Dragon only set conditions."

Sirone nodded, opened his Mootae senses, and looked down at the ground.

'There is no form.'

The mountain range disappeared, and he could see something sleeping in the void between that information.

'Whoa...'

Massive information made of golden light.

'That is Karathorsa.'

Time itself.

'I'm going.'

Since distance had no meaning in the realm of Mootae, Sirone's figure disappeared instantly.

Blitz looked up at the sky and muttered.

"End of time..."

Sirone, who had passed straight through the material and material domains, arrived before the massive golden information.

"I heard you wanted to meet me."

The light forming the dragon's shape showed no response, and Sirone slowly extended his hand.

'A collision might occur.'

If the Mudeung Dragon's consciousness caused a backlash, the physical force equivalent of that information would be close to catastrophic.

'But that won't happen.'

The fact that he had set the 10th sense, the realm of Mootae, as a condition meant he had foreseen today's events.

Sirone's hand decomposed into signals and gently touched the surface of the golden information.

"Ah..."

Karathorsa's information rose like a mirage, and two eyes opened, emitting white light.

"Information of Yahweh."

A voice transcending language penetrated Sirone's consciousness.

"You who seek meaning at the end of emptiness, what is your reason for seeking me?"

"Heaven's army will invade this world. I heard you have something to tell me."

"Angels..."

Karathorsa, awakening after a long time, recalled the battles with angels that had continued from long ago.

"Are you omnipotent?"

Can you decompose all signals in this world?

"Yes."

When Sirone nodded and answered, Karathorsa slowly raised his body.

'I feel like I'm becoming huge.'

An indescribable sense of elation flooded into Sirone's consciousness, which was connected by signals.

"Then I shall tell you."

Golden Karathorsa looked down at Sirone and ignited both eyes.

"All information of this world."

This is called omniscience.

Riding the super-magic amplification circle Ataraxia, Ikael's voice rang out thunderously.

"The reason we came here is to dye this land again with God's mercy. The omnipotent Ankera has entrusted that task to one human."

Ikael took a breath and said.

"The Enlightened One."

Dalia Nane.

"Therefore, what we must do is find that person first. Now, according to the Archangel's command..."

While Ikael's voice echoed, the giants sitting on the ground grumbled.

"Always so talkative. We should just fight."

Though he didn't have mountains under his feet like other giants, that was proof of his strength.

"Isn't that right?"

Giant Corps Commander Girshin looked at the figure sitting cross-legged with his chin propped up.

"King of Giants."

Ymir raised the corner of his mouth thickly.

"Keke, leave it be. Once we start, even the Archangel won't be able to stop us."

For someone who had been trapped in Helheim's ice waiting only for today, he was surprisingly relaxed.

'Freedom.'

He couldn't even remember when he had last set foot on a battlefield in his true form.

"Let's enjoy it. This kind of entertainment too."

Ikael gave his orders.

"First, the angels will survey all terrain with Guperbogi..."

From the ground, Son Yoo-jung shouted.

"Ah, hey! So noisy!"

The fact that she had interrupted while Ataraxia was expanded made the Maras tremble.

"Is that really human?"

More precisely, a monkey.

The Nyoi-bou held by her toes extended long, reaching Ikael's altitude.

"We're in Buddha's palm anyway, so if we're needed, he'll find us himself. You think I came here to meet that stuck-up guy? Satan, where's that bastard! Find him quickly!"

"Yoo-jung, there's an order to things. If you defy the Archangel's command, even you..."

"Ah, I don't care! I'll find him myself!"

When Yoo-jung pulled the Nyoi-bou and flew through the air, a sonic boom immediately followed.

Flying while compressing the atmosphere, she looked like she was riding clouds.

Ikael's lieutenant, Triangle Mara Ashur, asked.

"Should I chase and kill her?"

"Leave her be. More importantly, we need to control the laws of this world. Uriel."

"Command me."

Ikael amplified his senses to examine the planet.

"South. Where human law is operating most powerfully. Go handle it."

Uriel turned toward Zion.

"...Complete destruction?"

"As you heard."

"Understood."

Uriel, spinning his Paradise Lost, rose diagonally and quickly left the army.

'Is Miro there?'

Arriving at the South Pole, he looked down at Zion's landscape covered in white ice.

'It doesn't matter.'

Whatever was there wouldn't exist anymore.

'Ragnarok.'

Uriel's judicial halo rotated at light speed, collecting the concept of destruction.

"Uoooooooo!"

As the angel's armor was covered in white electricity, lightning struck and thunder roared from all directions.

"Wh-what!"

The monks of Zion, put on emergency alert, discovered the lightning filling the sky and clasped their hands together.

"W-we must stop it!"

Kwarrrrrrrrrrung!

With a roar that seemed to tear the heavens, Uriel's body struck down like lightning.

"Oh no!"

And the next moment.

'Damn it!'

The strike of destruction that would collapse the entire Antarctic continent struck the planet.
