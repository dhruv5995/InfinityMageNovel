Simultaneous Events (2)

Ikael clenched her fists tightly.

Rather than looking combative, she seemed to be desperately clutching onto something.

Finally, the sobs she couldn't hold back began to leak out.

"Hnngh."

It would be nothing short of a miracle.

For a dead child to return alive and tell their mother it wasn't her fault.

"Lady Ikael."

Satiel asked coldly.

"What is the meaning of this? If it's true that you've regained your memories, then you owe us an explanation..."

Uriel cut her off.

"Wait."

Satiel glared at him with frightening eyes.

"What's with you? Are you talking to me right now?"

"Whatever the lost memories may be, they're already in the past. Lady Ikael hasn't chosen anything yet."

"Nonsense."

Satiel snorted.

"In the past? Lady Ikael deceived us. She knew everything and pretended not to."

"Hey, you."

Shirone spoke with anger.

"Be quiet. I'm talking right now."

Though his anger had reason, Satiel found it absurd.

"A mere human dares to challenge an archangel? Shall I kill you right now?"

Ikael spoke.

"Satiel, Uriel is right. I will judge and I will decide."

"Grrr!"

Satiel felt a tremendous sense of humiliation rising from the depths of her mind. Guffin and Ikael, Shirone and Ikael. The latter relationship was endlessly stimulating the lost memories of the former.

'I hate it. I hate it so much.'

Because it wasn't clear, it drove her even more insane, and finally Satiel's reason evaporated.

"Shut up."

Ikael's eyes twitched.

Using abusive language toward an archangel was one of the most notable incidents in heaven's history.

Uriel turned around with murderous intent, but Satiel's face was already distorted like a monster.

"Why? What are you people to me?"

Though it seemed like words out of context, Shirone and Ikael understood perfectly.

"Just how great do you think you are to treat me like this?"

The purity disappeared from her photon body, and instead of light, tears of blood flowed from her eyes.

Third-rank Mara Ionas warned.

"Lady Satiel, please compose yourself. You must remember the mechanism of fallen angels."

Could an angel fall?

Perhaps the only possibility would be when a heart takes root in a pure spiritual being.

A heart that causes pain.

And a heart that torments oneself only emerges when one is already prepared for it.

"What did I do wrong that you ignore me?"

Satiel didn't stop.

Every time Shirone and Ikael reached an agreement, her mind felt like it was being torn apart.

'Yes, now I understand what it is.'

Though it was a vague feeling.

"I was always just a supporting character! You people ruined me! Because of you!"

This time even Shirone kept her mouth shut. She knew how much Satiel had done for humans before Guffin and Ikael had their child.

'Poor angel.'

But she also knew.

The fact that she had driven a nameless newborn baby to a terrible death.

'She killed me.'

Satiel screamed.

"Tell me! What did I do wrong? You know! Did I trample on the archangel's authority? Or..."

Suddenly her words stopped.

"Ah."

From the memories scattered like fragments, countless images came flooding back as if drawn by a magnet.

Ankera, secret conversations, the child's death.

'No.'

Her fingertips trembled, and her mind burned so hot her whole body felt on fire.

"That can't be."

She tried to look away, but for an angel who was a being of categorical imperatives, delusion was impossible.

"There must have been... a reason. Right?"

Ikael didn't answer, and the longer her silence continued, the more Satiel went mad.

"No! It was because you were bad! Yes, that's the feeling. You're the one who did everything!"

Ionas shouted.

"Compose yourself! If your spiritual body collapses any further...!"

"Aaaaah!"

Satiel clutched her head neurotically as her photon body began losing its circular form.

"Kill him!"

Her blood-soaked eyes targeted Shirone.

"Kill him, I said!"

The moment the command was given, Ionas disappeared and appeared before Shirone's eyes.

Ultimate Decomposition.

Atomic Movement.

"Don't resent this."

Ionas raised his right fist, and his arm decomposed into atomic units before shooting out at the maximum speed of the physical world.

Enemy Zero.

A military term meaning absolute safe zone.

It was also the state that Shirone's Hand of God had temporarily created inside Bashka.

"We won! We won!"

Though no one knew how the information had leaked, citizens poured into the streets cheering.

The demons had been annihilated, and the giants that had been shocking just by their size had also disappeared.

"Long live Tormia! Long live Tormia!"

They were curious about the light of Agape that had exploded in the sky, but no one was the first to bring it up.

For now, they just screamed and ran from the unpleasant truth that the war wasn't over yet.

"All citizens of Tormia, listen!"

A carriage carrying a tall platform crossed the main street and stopped at the center of the square.

On the platform stood an elderly man who was 17th in the direct royal bloodline, holding a megaphone.

The citizens didn't know him, but seeing the royal garments embroidered with Tormia's symbol, they knelt.

The square fell quiet, and that silence spread like ripples, eventually engulfing every block.

"Beloved citizens of Tormia, today the great king of our great nation, Adolf XII, has passed away."

The citizens' eyes filled with shock.

"This can't be..."

The old man who had momentarily captured their attention opened his mouth.

"Remember only this, citizens. Against the villains who invaded Bashka, our royal family did not retreat even an inch."

The reality was that there had been no information about the elemental bomb, and the old man secretly gritted his teeth.

'How dare they bypass the royal family? Whoever's behind this, just wait until I catch them. I won't let this slide.'

He still couldn't grasp what was happening, but recovering royal authority was the immediate priority.

"Adolf XII fought giants until the very end and died valiantly in battle."

"Ah, Your Majesty."

Among the crying citizens, one person stood up.

"Then perhaps the light that defeated the demons was the light our king bestowed upon us as he passed?"

One of the old man's eyes twitched.

'What nonsense? How annoying.'

But no matter how rational a person might be, when life and death are at stake, they seek god.

"I think so as well."

The atmosphere became solemn.

"Even in the moment he drew his last breath fighting giants, the king worried only about his people. And that is precisely what the royal family of Tormia is."

"Waaaah!"

As the citizens cheered, the old man rode that momentum and shouted loudly.

"The bloodline of the great king shall never be broken! I officially proclaim: welcome Adolf XIII, eldest son of Adolf XII, as our new king! Let us fight! We, Tormia, will never run away!"

"Long live His Majesty King Adolf XIII! Long live Tormia!"

The citizens' voices chanting long life didn't cease, and riding the waves, they reached even Alog Street.

In the Guild Master's office of the Magic Association, Rufist, who had been wrestling with documents, frowned.

"So damn noisy."

When Flu closed the window, the noise decreased.

"The royal family's movements are quick. Though it was lucky, really. Either way, the succession seems like it won't be a problem."

"Of course there shouldn't be problems. It's the only thing those guys know how to do besides eating."

Someone knocked forcefully on the door from outside.

"Guild Master! Rufist! Are you there? Talk with me for a moment! It's urgent!"

It was the voice of someone 7th in the direct royal bloodline, and the reason for their visit was roughly predictable.

The voice grew louder.

"Open the door! You knew, didn't you? That Bashka would soon become a wasteland! How dare you deceive the royal family?"

Flu, who had been standing with his hands behind his back, pointed at the door and asked.

"What should we do?"

"Get rid of them. I don't have time to wrestle with politicians."

Quickly assessing the damage and reorganizing the city's forces was the immediate priority.

Flu opened the door halfway and said.

"I apologize. The Guild Master is busy with official duties right now, so please arrange to visit separately later."

"What's this about? Right, you're the chief secretary. You know who I am, right? I'm 7th in the direct royal bloodline... Ack!"

The security chief approached and twisted the royal's arm.

"I'll be rude for a moment. Since this is the special case of wartime, please understand."

"It hurts! I said it hurts! Ahhh!"

As Flu watched with a sigh, Shirone walked from the end of the corridor.

"Let go! I understand, so please let go! It hurts!"

Shirone turned his head to follow the royal who was being dragged past him on the floor.

When he turned his head back, he had already arrived in front of the Guild Master's office.

"Sister, who was that person?"

Flu opened the door wide with a smile.

"Someone unimportant. Come in."

As Shirone stepped into the Guild Master's office, Rufist stood up and asked.

"Quantum transmission?"

"Spatial movement. It's inconvenient if it's too close. Bashka is familiar anyway."

There were various landmarks too.

"You were looking for me?"

"Right. As you saw coming here, the royal family has begun their activities. They'll try to steal all the credit from this war for a stable succession. Your achievements too."

"It's fine. I don't mind."

"Of course. However, it's uncertain whether the current royal family can properly lead during wartime."

Since it was quite provocative coming from the Guild Master's mouth, Shirone blinked.

Rufist revealed his true intentions.

"We want to back Pony."

"Hmm."

Shirone neither affirmed nor denied, but seemed to be thinking carefully.

"Is there a particular reason?"

"She's one of the few people who figured out the elemental bomb project on her own. I thought she might use this opportunity to stage a coup, but apparently not."

Shirone chuckled.

"Because she's a mage."

"Exactly. That's why we need her. For the Ultima System Project. If Pony becomes Tormia's king, it would greatly help humanity's unification."

It was an irrefutable truth.

"Then what about the current king? Do you think he lacks qualifications?"

"Qualifications."

Rufist looked out the window.

"The former king Adolf XII wasn't a sage king. But he was a practical person. He even accepted that madman Gaold as Guild Master."

That explained everything.

"He had three sons. Their personalities are all different, but they're all far from practical anyway. That means they're also far from war. It's foolish to expect character from humans, but it's problematic when actions are openly displayed. There might be disturbances."

Shirone also knew all about the history from before she was born.

'Still, I should see for myself. Their personalities might have changed as they aged.'

Having made her decision, Shirone nodded.

"Then I'll go take a look."

"Remember. Concepts like philanthropy or messiah don't work on them. If you want to control them from the start..."

Shirone tapped her inner pocket.

"Yes, I'll use this."

No royal could ignore the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower's Integrated Universe Management Department.
