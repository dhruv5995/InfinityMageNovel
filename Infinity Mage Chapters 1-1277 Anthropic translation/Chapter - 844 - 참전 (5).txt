War Participation (5)

Amon emerged from beneath the building debris, lifting a house-sized boulder to reveal himself.

"Kukukuk."

The area hit by the photon cannon was deeply caved in, with surrounding bones protruding outward.

"Detestable Yahweh."

Having lightly tossed aside the massive debris, he spread both arms with his tattered body.

"Do you know who I am?" Amon's voice resonated majestically through the silence.

"I am hell."

From the 1st to the 10th.

The reason Satan's direct lineage is special is because they transcend individual entities and approach being systems themselves.

This is called Satan's 10 Great Calamities.

The demons call these calamities the demon system, or the demon realm, and once the demon realm is opened, individual consciousness completely disappears.

'Does it matter?'

They become calamities.

"Curse your own foolishness." As the demon realm opened, worm-like tentacles wriggled through Amon's skin.

The demons fled in terror at the sight of his body growing at a terrifying speed through multiplication.

"The demon realm has opened!"

In contrast, humans didn't realize the impending disaster and watched in a daze.

"Wh-what is that thing?"

Kurrrung! Kurrrung!

Amon's legs took root and expanded in all directions, penetrating the ground.

Buildings fell like dominoes, and the main body multiplied as quickly as the roots expanded.

Uorin's head turned skyward.

"My goodness..."

A tree large enough to dominate Kashan's capital was growing, twisting its black trunk.

Holes opened along the trunk, and tens of thousands of mouths of different shapes and sizes opened simultaneously.

"Hoooooooo!"

At the otherworldly sound, Uorin's shoulders trembled.

'That's definitely...'

The demon realm tree Argantis.

In Theraje's memories, the demon realm tree's descent into the world was from the distant past.

The era when dragons and angels opposed each other.

The demon realm tree destroyed seven ancient nations and sought endless expansion.

No one cared about humanity, which was still in its infancy.

Eventually, humans organized a world coalition army and barely managed to defeat the calamity after sacrificing one-third of humanity.

'Now is different from then. But...'

Looking at Argantis piercing through the clouds, it felt like there was no future left.

"Oh God."

Humans who had given up even fleeing knelt one by one and offered prayers.

It was the only action they could take.

"Hoooooooo!"

The sound the demon realm tree made was truly horrifying, but Shirone was imagining something even worse.

'No creature can be this large.'

Because a planet's energy has limits.

'Therefore...'

The demon realm tree that had taken root in Kashan's capital sucked up the earth's energy.

"Oh God, please save me... Keurk!" Simultaneously, humans whose moisture had dried up collapsed in place, withered like mummies.

Building foundations crumbled to sand, and rumbling sounds of collapse echoed from all directions.

The death toll was approximately 20,000.

What was even more horrifying was that the demon realm tree was gradually growing larger after absorbing such nutrients.

"Damn it!"

Shirone spread his light wings and charged forward. He couldn't know the Ivory Tower's situation, but Taeseong's condition was certainly not normal.

'Angel's Punishment!'

He maximized the Archangel's incarnation, but it didn't even reach one-hundredth of the demon realm tree's size.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Spears of light struck down relentlessly.

'It's not even budging!'

The demon realm tree's base, spanning 20 kilometers in diameter, appeared as merely a wall to Shirone's eyes.

"Hoooooooo!"

The second absorption.

Tens of thousands of humans turned into mummies again, and the ground encompassing all of Kashan's capital crumbled away.

Pssssss!

A city-sized dust cloud rose, blocking Shirone's vision.

'If I leave it like this, the world will end.' The demon realm tree Argantis.

It was the system corresponding to drought among Satan's 10 Great Calamities.

'I have to finish it before it's too late!'

If it were a matter of technical difficulty, he could cover it with learning, but in cases like this, it was meaningless.

"Kill Yahweh!"

The demons' voices could be heard from within the dust.

As he fluttered his light wings and retreated, the clouds cleared and flying demons swarmed in groups.

'Ataraxia!'

The information of amplification gathered in an instant unfolded in a massive circle before Shirone's eyes.

Just as the demons filling his vision were about to throw their spears, a photon cannon passed through Ataraxia.

"Kiiiiiiiii..."

The flash fired with a roar swept away the demons and struck Argantis's trunk.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

The flash amplified to maximum output moved horizontally, scraping away the demon realm tree's trunk.

Kwakwakwa kwakwakwakwakwa!

'This won't work! Stronger, stronger!'

As explosive sounds from Argantis shook heaven and earth, people crouched and covered their heads.

"Heuk! Heueueueuk!"

It already felt like they had fallen into hell.

When the photon cannon's flash had traveled approximately 10 kilometers, the amplification energy disappeared.

"Haa! Haa!"

The tree, gouged by the flash's shockwave, couldn't support its weight and began tilting sideways.

"I-it's falling!"

When the top tilted 15 degrees, black branches spewed from the mouths on the trunk.

"Kueeeeee!"

Hundreds of thousands of black branches extended from the falling direction to support the weight.

Though it was fast, to Shirone's distant eyes it appeared slow, making it even more disgusting.

"Hoooooooo!"

Argantis, now rooted in a position like supporting itself with one hand on the ground, absorbed nutrients again.

As the ground sank further down, the imperial palace Aganos swayed precariously.

"Your Majesty! We must go now!"

Led by the Wind General into the sky, Uorin shuddered at the sight of the ground below.

The entire city was withering away.

"Heueueu!"

In the empty Grand Temple, Taeseong knelt and embraced her body with both arms.

Each time the planet's nutrients were drained, it felt like dozens of syringes simultaneously drawing blood.

'This won't do. I have to stop it.'

As Gaia's incarnation, she had the ability to cut off the planet's energy circulation.

But stopping a massive planet's engine was only a last resort.

Not only would it take time to restart circulation, but countless places would rot in the meantime.

'Destroying is easy, but restoration is difficult. I can still endure. Still...' Taeseong's shoulders flinched.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

The planet's energy was sucked away with twice the suction power as before.

"Quickly, quickly..." With a haggard face, Taeseong checked the ground and saw four of the Five Great Stars rapidly approaching.

After Freed's strike cut down demons, Kashan's capital came into view.

No, could this still be called a human city?

"Damn it! That's supposed to be a corps commander?" Civilization had disappeared, and only one massive, crooked black tree stood there.

Minerva, flying on a jet beside the running Freed, said:

"No, that's a phenomenon. A calamity. It's the demon system you said didn't matter, Freed."

Freed gritted his teeth.

"...I get it, so stop nagging me."

Amanta, sitting cross-legged on the rotating World Wheel, said:

"Without Buddha, such things run wild. Anyway, what will you do? It's a bit much to handle with force alone."

Indeed, without Nane's sermon, there seemed to be no easy way to resolve this.

"What choice do we have? We have to try. First, let's rendezvous with Shirone and then figure out a method."

"There is a method." Sein approached in a standing position, trailing dozens of afterimages.

"My law can suppress the demon realm tree's growth temporarily. Then we seal the capital and blow it up."

"Blow up the city? Where will we get that firepower?"

Amanta agreed.

"World Wheel. If we sacrifice the city's population, the firepower should be sufficient."

"Shirone won't allow it." Freed said.

"If the demon realm tree grows bigger, it'll be troublesome. We have to accept some sacrifice. They're all dying anyway, aren't they?"

"It's not a matter of numbers." As the Five Great Stars fell silent, Sein spoke:

"I'll try to persuade Shirone. If he won't comply, we'll have to fight individually."

Finally penetrating the city, a hell of different dimensions from what they'd seen from afar unfolded.

"Koaaaaaaah!"

People withered moment by moment, and the sky above buildings was filled with demons.

"Shirone!"

Minerva increased her jet's propulsion and flew skyward.

"Minerva!"

Shirone, who had been fighting alone, looked back at her with a tired face.

"How did it go?"

"No matter how much I pour on, it's useless. Even when it takes damage, it absorbs nutrients to recover."

Minerva glanced at Sein and said:

"There's one method. Go down for a moment and with Sein..."

"I know what method you mean."

Shirone spoke without taking his eyes off Argantis.

"But we can't stop it that way. No, we can't beat the demons that way."

"This isn't the time to worry about such things."

"Listen."

At Shirone's words, Minerva quietly listened.

From the countless mouths on Argantis, whispering voices were leaking out.

"I want to eat. I want to eat more."

"I'm going to eat it. Only I will grow. I won't give it to anyone. Only me, only me, only me!"

Hidden within the screams, at those countless voices, Minerva gulped.

"It's a demon created by humans. If we turn the World Wheel to destroy the city, that monster will surely disappear, but..."

The hatred of humans sacrificed here would become demons again and bring even greater calamity.

"I agree with that."

Sein had approached at some point.

"But if we can't stop it now, we'll pay an even greater sacrifice. This is the best choice."

Shirone bit his lip.

"There's a way to destroy the city without necessarily sacrificing humans."

Shirone looked back at Sein.

"How long can you hold out?"

"At the current size... roughly 5 minutes?"

Freed shouted while cutting down massive roots protruding from the ground with his sword:

"Whatever it is, hurry! It keeps growing!"

Further thought was a luxury.

"Leave it to me. I'll try."

As Shirone and Minerva descended to the ground, Sein looked at Argantis.

"...An illusion."

Having taken in the demon realm tree that manifested imaginary size into reality, she slowly raised her hand.

"I forbid demons. I forbid predation and digestion. I forbid activity and freedom."

Sein's law began pressing down on Argantis's law.

"Hoooooooo!"

Crack. Crack.

As nutrients were suddenly cut off, the massive branches twisted viciously like breaking bones.

"Therefore..."

Sein held out the bracelet on her wrist.

"I forbid all of you."

Law, enforcement.

"Kraaaaaaah!" At the screams that burst forth simultaneously from the demon realm tree's mouths, many lost consciousness.

"Kueueueu."

Law is a kind of seesaw game.

At Argantis's miserable writhing, wrinkles also appeared on Sein's face.

While fighting demons, Minerva assessed the situation.

'Anyway, we've bought time for now. But what method could possibly deal with that monster...'

Her eyes widened as she looked back at Shirone.

'Ataraxia!'

Shirone, displaying a massive magic circle above his head, was frowning as he calculated something.

"Don't tell me..."

Shirone's eyes flashed open.

'Here!'

A massive red beam shot up at light speed, penetrating the sky and extending to space.

As mass condensed at high altitude, a gray spear weighing 10 tons began forming.

"Shining Spear!"

Gaold had called it God's Punishment.
