God's Brain (2)

The ground began to tremble.

"What?"

Guffin's body, which had been scattering into light, began to return to its original form once more.

'There's not enough propulsion.'

To break through the universe, the thoughts of all Gaians must be unified.

'Ultima is wavering.'

This meant that a small number among those who could link to the Idea held different opinions from the whole.

'But why?'

Guffin, glowing in human form, fell deep in thought and immediately found the answer.

"Is it because of you?"

Guffin's gaze pierced sharply toward Ikael.

'Because I protected the Archangel.'

Even among the same Gaians, Guffin's thinking was clearly different after experiencing the depths of hell and returning.

'I should have either forced it through or persuaded them. Like this, we can't break through the cosmic realm.'

It would be possible to achieve 100 percent allocation by deleting user codes with different opinions.

But if it wasn't approved within the unified consciousness, Ultima would shatter instead.

'Lucifer, you've left me with a terrible debt.'

He realized why Lucifer had been satisfied with just the promise to never harm Ikael.

'This was bound to happen anyway.'

The time for choice had arrived.

Should they try to pierce the cosmic realm with 99.8 percent allocation, or stop to ensure perfection?

'Ultima is...'

Almost everyone's thoughts aligned.

"Damn it!"

As the Idea link weakened and normal signals returned, the blue sky spread out once more.

"Ah..."

Ikael, who had been watching the process of the world closing, asked.

"What happened?"

"Just as it looks - we failed."

As Guffin displayed his displeasure openly, Ikael closed his mouth.

"What was that trembling from before?"

As he looked around for his companions, Taesung emerged from the ground.

"Ankera has made a decision."

Argones had left humanity, but Taesung, being their mother, still couldn't abandon them.

"Gaia."

Taesung approached.

"Argones. He will annihilate you who would turn this world to nothingness."

The ground trembled again, and a massive monster filling the sky revealed part of its body.

"What is that?"

Even looking at just the portion that descended below the clouds, they could guess it was in the shape of a gigantic sphere.

"Cell Buster."

Taesung said with a sad expression.

"Argones will reset all humans."

The monster split apart, dividing into countless spheres that began plummeting toward the ground.

"Tch!"

Guffin launched his body upward, followed by Ikael ascending high into the sky to observe the situation.

"This can't be..."

Gray spheres sprouted tails dozens of times longer than their size and began attacking the Gaians.

"I refuse!"

The Ultima system activated, creating a massive dome barrier that blocked the Anti-Cells.

The moment of impact caused each sphere to split in two, doubling not only their numbers but also their mass.

"Block them! They can't break through!"

Taesung approached Ikael's side.

"You won't be able to stop them."

Each time they collided with the barrier, the Anti-Cells continued to multiply, eventually covering the entire dome.

"It's a characteristic of biological signals. If they can't achieve their purpose, the Anti-Cells will keep multiplying until they fill the universe."

"Fill the universe?"

Ikael's face hardened.

"You were born in the cosmic realm, so the biological realm might seem insignificant to you, but the true power of life lies in adaptation."

Taesung's gaze turned toward the tadpole-like spheres gradually boring into the dome.

"Theoretically, Argones can spread biological signals to any cosmic realm. Angels are no exception."

Ikael bared his teeth.

"Angels giving birth to creatures? I'd rather annihilate myself than suffer such humiliation."

"I'm talking about special circumstances. If you could create biological signals, it would be possible to implant angelic offspring in human bodies."

"I have no interest in such things."

Even as they conversed, the Gaians' barrier continued to crack.

"Is this how Gaian history ends?"

"There is one way."

Taesung said.

"Ra, Gaia, and Argones independently oversee the cosmic, natural, and biological realms. Even Ankera cannot directly activate the Cell Buster."

"Meaning this is a special situation."

"Probably a special measure to suppress acts of cosmic violation. If the Gaians abandon their will to break through, I might be able to intervene."

"But that would be..."

Ikael didn't think it was possible.

"Everything the Gaians have, right?"

Taesung knew this too.

That's why he remained silent, only waiting for Guffin's decision.

"There's no end to this."

Sweat beaded on Guffin's face as he flew around the dome's perimeter, firing photon cannons indiscriminately.

No matter what attack he launched, there seemed to be no way to stop the Anti-Cells that multiplied twofold.

'With the strongest attack...'

Guffin gritted his teeth and raised both arms to the sky as light with mass gathered like a sun.

"Yaaaah!"

A flash that seemed to devour the world swept across where the dome stood.

"Did it work...!"

Guffin's confident smile froze.

Each time the storm of mass passed through the Anti-Cell colony, they grew like cancer cells.

'Can't it be stopped?'

The colony's size had grown to encompass a radius of several dozen kilometers, with individual numbers seemingly reaching astronomical figures.

The astronomical number of Anti-Cells moved in perfect unison, transforming into the shape of Argones' face.

But that was only momentary.

After looking at Guffin with a raised corner of his mouth, he dispersed again and poured down toward the barrier.

Cracks appeared in the dome, and Anti-Cells that squeezed through the gaps struck the Gaians.

"Aaahhh!"

Guffin saw it clearly.

The process of cells devouring themselves and annihilating in what seemed like reverse evolution.

'I can't resist.'

Even the strongest humanity that had reached Ultima were ultimately biological at their core.

Before the code that annihilated the vessel containing consciousness - the body - even Gaians were helpless.

'I need to make a decision quickly.'

Guffin watched the spectacle of countless Anti-Cells spreading throughout the entire world.

They truly intended to make humanity extinct.

"Don't give up!"

The voice of a Gaian elder rang out.

"This is what we chose! Beyond infinity! Finding our true selves is the only way!"

Guffin bit his lip.

He knew that having achieved a unified mental system, the Gaians wouldn't give up.

'I have to stop this.'

But Guffin couldn't do it.

'This is my fault.'

The small crack that began with his promise to Lucifer had led the situation to this point.

The Gaians shouted.

"Freedom! Selfhood!"

The moment the black Anti-Cells broke through Ultima's barrier and attacked the Gaians.

"I surrender."

Guffin implanted a thought in his mind that was extremely opposed to the unified mental system.

CRASH!

In an instant, Ultima collapsed and the barrier disappeared.

"What...!"

The Gaians were more shocked by the collapse of their unified mental system than by the annihilation before their eyes.

"Huff! Huff!"

The Gaian elder watched as the Anti-Cells before his eyes froze motionlessly.

"Why?"

"Why?"

Before Argones' eyes, Taesung stood with both arms spread wide, glaring upward.

"Stop here. They've abandoned breaking through. Are you really going to annihilate those children?"

"It's Ra's order. Even if I'm not subordinate, this is a cosmic-scale problem. His judgment takes priority."

"What about your judgment?"

"It's no different. If the universe is broken, no life form can exist. You might find all life born on Gaia precious, but..."

Argones' eyes turned cold.

"I have a mission to maintain the biological realm. Compared to that mission, one species is a trivial matter."

"One species?"

Taesung said bitterly.

"It's the name you gave them. Gaia."

"...A sentimental conclusion."

"No. This might be our mission. You and I exist to create them."

"Then what about us?"

Taesung couldn't answer.

"Did we exist merely to create humans? No, we are the gods. At least in this universe. What do you gain by denying that?"

"To know the truth..."

Argones cut him off.

"Truth? What exactly is truth? Is opening the lid truth? Do you really think that's real? What if that too is a lie covered by another lid?"

It probably was.

"Gaians are just creatures too. Just one of the many things we created. Why should I care?"

"Because those children will eventually reveal the truth."

"You know it too. They're foolish, arrogant, and their evil tendencies are unmatched, but..."

A sad smile spread across Taesung's lips.

"They realize what's wrong and ultimately move in the right direction."

Humans.

"They're our greatest masterpiece."

The reason he couldn't refute Taesung's words was that he too had watched Gaia's history.

Why do they exceed expectations?

Why can't they be stabilized unlike other creatures?

"That's exactly why I dislike them."

Among Argones' children, only humans were different.

Taesung answered.

"In a way... I'm proud of them."

"Hmph."

Argones' body, which had been moving away with his back turned, seeped into the ground.

"This is your last chance. Whatever the outcome of the coming war, I'll be watching."

Just being freed from the Cell Buster was a blessing for the Gaians.

"Whew."

After seeing off Argones, Taesung sighed and looked toward the distant sky.

"We've passed this crisis, but..."

A war between gods and humans was about to begin.

"They're disappearing."

The Anti-Cells that had filled their vision were converging in reverse and rapidly diminishing.

"What happened? Why?"

The Gaian elder, who had been muttering, looked around and found Guffin.

"What is the meaning of this!"

Guffin approached and bowed his head.

"I'm sorry."

At that moment, all the Gaians who had survived the Cell Buster let out anguished groans.

'It's wrong.'

Guffin's behavior was clearly independent action that had deviated from the collective consciousness.

"Ultima is broken?"

The elder shook his head.

"No, that can't be! What sacrifices we made to reach that state! And you, Guffin, you...!"

The moment the elder closed his mouth, a nearby Gaian spoke as if understanding.

"Anger won't help. If we split here, we'll return to being the old humanity."

A society of conflict where countless opinions clashed.

"I'll take responsibility."

Guffin declared.

"I won't open my consciousness for the time being. Then the Ultima system will become perfect again."

"What do you intend to do?"

Looking up at the sky, Guffin exchanged glances with Ikael, who was coldly surveying the ground.

"...I'll fight."

An era where gods and humans coexist.

Sirone, having received Omega's information, realized this point was a singularity.

'Guffin has left the Gaian race.'

Though the records read in Babel couldn't reveal exactly what events would unfold...

'One thing is certain.'

The fact that Guffin was the Gaian who remained by humanity's side until the very end.
