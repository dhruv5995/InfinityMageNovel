[798] Complex (3)

As they entered the waiting room, the events Beron had already experienced began to unfold in sequence.

"Sorry, it's because of me. Yesterday while talking with Rangi, your name came up..."

Beron's prediction was correct.

'She's saying it exactly word for word without a single mistake.'

Humans cannot change the future.

The gears of law that govern this world were meshed together with such precision.

'A world where even the nuance of words is determined by law. I understand why Uorin considers Habits dangerous.'

If it were chaos, it would show different reactions each time.

'Now what should I do?'

Rangi approached.

"I thought it would be reassuring to have you here. I spoke honestly."

Shirone nodded and walked over to Miss Yakma, the elf Lora.

"Hello?"

He planned to observe her reaction first.

Lora turned her head with an expressionless face.

'Of course. She must be in a hypnotized state.'

Remembering the perpetrator of terror and the horrific murders she had committed made his teeth chatter.

"20 minutes until the competition."

The moment the official spoke, before he could even attempt anything, a chilling murderous intent spread from Lora.

'Damn it!'

The terrorist's psychology was so extreme and sensitive that just greeting her was enough to trigger her irregular formula.

'I have to kill her!'

Drawing upon the realm of Yahweh, he cast Wind Cutter, and Lora's head fell with a thud as a fountain of blood gushed forth.

"Kyaaaaa!"

The participants screamed, and Pony made a bewildered expression at the unexpected situation.

"What the hell do you think you're doing!"

Shirone examined Lora's face.

"Guk!"

As the hypnosis was broken, she showed a shocked expression, then stuck out her tongue and died.

'I killed the main body. Is this the one-armed monk's doing?'

Mortasinger, who had already experienced the baptism of Time Vibration, had set up insurance.

'If you kill me, I'll kill the hostage - that's the declaration. This makes it impossible to do anything.'

He had to turn back time again.

'Testing reactions won't work. I need to approach this differently...'

Then the door opened and the security guards burst in.

"What, what is this?"

Justine's eyes widened, and Marsha looked at Shirone with incomprehension.

"...Did you kill her?"

Shirone didn't make excuses.

"Yes."

"Why?"

What about asking Marsha for help?

'Not yet.'

Like the 1-second loop that Ugo and the terrorist experienced, Time Vibration could shake other people's time as well.

'That's resonance.'

But for now, he preferred to be alone.

'If I resonate Marsha's timeline...'

She would be trapped with Shirone in an endless cycle of time until the desired result was achieved.

'Ten times? A hundred times she could endure.'

But what about a thousand times, ten thousand times?

'She'd eventually go insane.'

A life where one hour repeats tens of thousands of times was unbearable for anyone but an infinite mage.

"I can't tell you right now."

While the participants hurriedly covered themselves, the security guards seized Shirone and dragged him away.

With 20 minutes remaining, the competition was canceled.

"Talk! What the hell is going on!"

Sitting in the empty spectator seats, Shirone silently counted time in his head.

"5 minutes 39 seconds. 38 seconds. 37 seconds."

While they couldn't arrest a star of the Ivory Tower, the security guards still surrounded him.

"I'll do it properly from now on."

Realizing it was time, Shirone raised his head.

"What do you mean do it properly?"

This was plus 30 minutes.

"See you again, sister."

As soon as he finished speaking, the timeline snapped back, flowing in reverse toward minus 30 minutes.

"Ugh! Damn it!"

His head reeled from the fluctuation of the timeline, but now Shirone didn't collapse.

'The competition hall entrance.'

It was 30 minutes before the terror occurred.

'The one-armed monk will be near the waiting room. He'll kill the hostage the moment the terrorist dies.'

If even the realm of Yahweh couldn't detect him, his ability must truly be close to nothingness.

'Therefore, if I don't kill the terrorist, there's a possibility the one-armed monk won't receive external information either.'

Shirone ran to the waiting room.

'The boundary between the terrorist and Miss Yakma. If I can cut exactly at that point, I can save the hostage.'

Having made this decision, Shirone opened the door and the participants set off paper poppers.

"Surprise!"

Ignoring everyone, Shirone rushed inside and applied Wind Cutter below Lora's neck.

"Guk!"

The terrorist died instantly, followed by Lora's death.

'The time it takes to understand is 1.43 seconds.'

That was enough time.

"Kyaaaaa!"

At the women's screams, security guards burst in and Shirone sat in the empty spectator seats.

"Talk! What the hell is going on!"

Shirone looked up at Marsha and said,

"See you again, sister."

Third round.

"Surprise!"

This time too, the terrorist died.

'No one should die.'

Within the plus-minus 0.3 centimeters that Shirone could grasp, he had to cut exactly along the boundary line.

17th round.

"Surprise!"

Blood spurted like a fountain from the terrorist's neck.

68th round.

"Surpr..."

Leaving behind the no-longer-surprising greeting, Shirone activated Wind Cutter.

'It went over.'

If the terrorist had died in all attempts so far, this time it was Miss Yakma's neck that was severed.

'The boundary line is between them.'

Though invisible to the naked eye, if examined microscopically, there would surely be a gap larger than atoms.

Marsha always said the same thing.

"Talk! What the hell is going on!"

"..."

Without answering, time flowed backward.

287th round.

After roughly 287 hours of cutting people's necks, Shirone's mind was in a daze.

'I found the 0.6 centimeter range, but cutting exactly between them is too difficult.'

Just as there are a thousand 0.0001 centimeters in 0.1 centimeters, without knowing the scale, attempts would continue.

"20 minutes until the competition."

The terrorist's murderous intent was felt, and participants began changing clothes and making jokes.

"How is it? Now that you see it, it's nothing special, right? Still, since you got a good look, should you watch until the competition ends?"

Having repeated one hour and seen this scene dozens of times, it no longer conveyed any emotion.

"Miss Lora."

As Shirone extended his hand and spoke, murderous intent rose from Lora's body.

'Wind Cutter.'

The body and face separated with a snap, but it was completely indistinguishable to the naked eye.

"Found it."

It was exactly 0.3736 centimeters.

'The hostage didn't die.'

Hyega felt nothing, and Mortasinger's body flailed in apparent confusion.

'I can't stop it this time anyway.'

Wind Cutter would split the torso at the same time the terrorist destroyed Lora's face.

From the empty spectator seats, Marsha shouted.

"Talk! What the hell is going on!"

"Sister."

For the first time since the regression began, Shirone resonated her timeline with his own.

"Come with me."

288th round.

As soon as he opened the waiting room door, Shirone rushed in and separated Lora and the terrorist at the neck boundary.

'If I know the boundary line...'

He could move the position of the Hidden Piece.

"Now!"

Mortasinger's face, covered by cloth, returned, and Hyega appeared in the corridor.

'How?'

Shock was swirling in Hyega's eyes.

'Oh no! The hostage!'

Realizing belatedly, he raised his hand seal, but faster than that, Marsha snatched Lora away.

"I don't know what's what, but..."

Shirone's explanation became more incomprehensible the more she listened, but it was clear he had regressed one hour.

"Hide and seek is over!"

Sliding past Hyega, she twisted her waist and stabbed the Parricide Dagger into his back.

"Gruk!"

He felt no pain.

"Irregular formula?"

Smoke of desire was escaping from Hyega's back at a rate of 1 percent per minute.

"Don't worry. You can fight for 100 minutes."

The clear positioning of each other was a disadvantage of the Parricide Dagger, but this time it worked as an advantage.

"Marsha, what's going on?"

Freeman, who followed into the building belatedly, protected Marsha with agile movements.

'He really doesn't know.'

Marsha had experienced it once, but Freeman seemed puzzled by the sudden situation.

'You've grown close to godhood, Shirone.'

If regression was possible, it would have been better if he had told them in the first round.

'My wish is to properly punch that guy's face once.'

Watching Hyega's movements, Marsha said,

"There's one more outside. Take the hostage and stop that guy. No one should die."

Being trapped in endless time was not appealing.

"Did you say 100 minutes now?"

As Hyega raised his hand seal, the air he touched crystallized into diamond and sparkled like a famous sword.

"Go."

Gunner's movement was like wind.

"You won't last even 100 seconds."

As Hyega raised his hand seal and charged, Marsha brought her hand to the tattoo carved on her body.

"Parricide Dagger."

A dagger was grasped in her hand.

"How dare you interfere with my work!"

Mortasinger, hit by Shirone's Photon Cannon, flew through the wall into the sky.

'How exactly did he figure it out?'

Even if releasing murderous intent was unavoidable, accurately gauging the neck's boundary line should have been impossible.

"Hidden Piece!"

She tried pressuring with her irregular formula, but it didn't work on Shirone, who had already faced her dozens of times.

"Just stop it already!"

Shirone bound her with Shining Chain and plummeted vertically toward a mountain visible on the ground.

"Kyaaaaa!"

An immortal wouldn't die from this much.

"What exactly bothers you so much!"

He continued slamming her left and right until she was exhausted, only then stopping the attack.

"Grrrr."

Unable to move a single finger, Shirone still didn't release the magic.

"It's all over. If you show your face, the irregular formula disappears too, right?"

Mortasinger's body trembled.

"Please, just kill me! You don't want to see such an ugly face either!"

"Shut up! Do you know what you've done!"

If he hadn't turned back time, she would have killed everyone at the competition hall.

"What do you know about me? Pretty things can die for all I care. No, I'll kill them all!"

Shirone's heart ached.

"No matter how ugly you think you are, if you don't love yourself..."

As he roughly tore away the cloth covering Mortasinger's face, she screamed.

"Noooo!"

"What?"

The woman's face, with eyes tightly shut, was smooth as pearl without a single scar.

"Please, don't look. Let me cover my face."

Shirone didn't think human beauty could be measured numerically.

But one thing was certain: if you asked 100 people, they would all say the crying Mortasinger was beautiful.

"You're pretty, aren't you?"

She was beautiful enough to compete in a beauty contest without shame.

"Don't lie! What's pretty about this? Where in the world is there anyone as ugly as me!"

He got a little annoyed.

"No, I'm saying you're really pretty!"

Mortasinger wouldn't listen.

"Why are my eyes so narrow? Why isn't my nose more prominent? Look at my lips, these dull lips."

"Ah."

Shirone realized.

'Irregular formula.'

Mortasinger was beautiful, but her heart was so twisted that even she appeared ugly to herself.

"My dirty, hideous, disgusting face!"

She was the embodiment of complex.
