[716] What Do You Gain? (5)

Imperial Palace, Aganos.

Wuorin rushed back to her room with frantic steps, slammed the door shut, and gripped the vanity table with her hands.

"Hah! Hah!"

Her heart was still racing.

'Why is my heart...?'

This was the first time in 800 years that a Theraje's heart rate had exceeded normal levels.

"No! This can't be!"

This was an empire built through thousands of years of preparation, and the supreme body created from the genes of thousands of people.

And what of her mind?

Her superhuman psyche dominated all emotions in this world, and conversely, no one could touch her emotions.

"I won't give it! No one can have my heart!"

Gando opened the door and entered.

"Your Majesty! What on earth is happening?"

This was the first time Gando had ever seen Wuorin in a state of panic, leaving him nearly terrified.

"We must end this now. If we miss this opportunity, we'll lose our means to subdue Shirone."

"......"

Wuorin looked into the vanity mirror.

'Would he like it?'

The thought that Shirone would judge this appearance made her dizzy and nauseous.

"Your Majesty."

Wuorin suddenly turned around.

"Gando, am I ugly?"

"Pardon?"

Gando frowned in confusion at Wuorin's flushed expression.

"Am I pretty? How pretty am I?"

'What in the world is happening?'

Wuorin had scraped together all the superior genes that existed in the world to obtain the most beautiful female appearance.

'Absolute confidence. A perfect human being.'

The fact that such a Theraje would doubt her own appearance, and even ask others about it, was unbelievable.

'This is dangerous. No, it's not dangerous. She's still powerful, still perfect.'

A Theraje is a Theraje.

Gando had no idea what consequences the tiny crack carved into the Empire of Glory might bring.

Shirone followed Panica into the temple.

In a circular hall resembling a small Yore church chapel, stood a statue presumed to be the god of Codename.

"Ikael?"

With exquisite features, fully spread wings of light, and a halo floating above its head, it was unmistakably an angel statue.

'No, am I mistaken?'

Most angels were beautiful, and the statue before him had simplified detailed expressions, making it impossible to be certain.

'But why does this feel so familiar?'

A sense of intimacy washed over him, as if he had touched and polished this statue every single day.

Codename No. 1, Drain, stood beside Shirone and looked up at the statue.

"Our goddess Ataraxia."

Shirone's head whipped around.

"Ataraxia?"

What suddenly came to mind was the statue that grave robber Arius had tried to steal by infiltrating the maternal psyche.

It was the source concept of Ataraxia that Ikael had directly placed in Shirone's mind through possession.

'But why is it here?'

Unaware of why Shirone was puzzled, Drain continued his explanation.

"Codename is a city presided over by the goddess Ataraxia. That's why people from other cities don't have codes. Like you."

Drain, the person most beloved by Ataraxia, smiled kindly and placed his hand on Shirone's shoulder.

"Don't worry. Anyone who enters this city can be embraced by the goddess. When you receive her grace, you can perform miracles with a human body. Your lifespan extends, diseases are cured, or you gain divine knowledge."

Codename No. 9, Gale, snorted.

"The biggest problem is that not just anyone can obtain it. You should start praying earnestly to the goddess right now. You'll need at least a rank in the 200,000s to live like a human being, won't you?"

Shirone turned to Gale and shot back.

"They're not unhappy because their rank is low. They're unhappy because people like you torment them."

"Hahaha! You've gotten mouthy, haven't you? Just admit you're scared. Whatever code you receive, it'll be lower than mine anyway."

Receiving the ninth highest code among over 420,000 people was indeed a difficult feat.

The existence called Ikael gave some hope, but without knowing the criteria, one couldn't be certain of their rank.

"How can I receive a code?"

"The method is simple. Kneel before the goddess and pray with all your heart. We call this Gwoncheong."

In Codename, where one's life changed depending on what code they received, Gwoncheong was the most important ritual.

Panica whispered softly.

"This is something only rankers know, but you can perform Gwoncheong multiple times."

"What? Then you receive a different code each time?"

"Yes. That's why rankers gather in the temple. If middle-class people came here, they'd die."

It made sense why Gale had shown killing intent when he learned Shirone was codeless.

"However, ranks rarely change among rankers. The gaps aren't that big. Rather, ranks often fall."

If one could live in the top 1,000 out of 420,000 people, there would be no need to gamble.

'But it would be different from the middle class onwards. In the end, they're all gathered here to prevent class reversal.'

Even Shirone wouldn't have been able to set foot here if not for Panica, who was Codename No. 97.

Panica spoke cautiously.

"The standard Gwoncheong involves kneeling and offering prayers. But there are rumors that you can obtain high codes through special methods. Some people take off all their clothes, and others prostrate themselves with every step from in front of the temple."

Panica's voice grew even quieter.

"I fasted for 10 days before performing Gwoncheong."

Since they didn't know the exact criteria for Gwoncheong, it seemed humans had tried everything they possibly could.

'No. This isn't about that.'

While Codename was the only world for these people, to Shirone it was just one of the 19,000 that Guffin had sealed.

If the existing spacetime had been isolated and developed into a completely different world, this place would be from the era when Ikael had stayed long ago.

'Ikael......'

Shirone knew the terrifying history of the Archangel who, as the trusted commander of Ankera, had brought destruction to the human world.

'What was Guffin thinking when he sealed that era?'

As Shirone stalled for time, Gale pressed him.

"Hey, hurry up. Don't try to act the same as those born in Codename when you're just codeless!"

While the method of Gwoncheong might be superstitious, Gale, who wanted Shirone to receive a low code by any means, wouldn't wait indefinitely.

"Gale! You know how important this is, don't you? You should give him time to prepare mentally."

Though Panica took his side, Shirone actually didn't care about Gwoncheong at all.

"I'll begin."

Shirone approached Ikael's statue and extended his hand.

"Hey, that's......"

Since irreverent Gwoncheong was strictly forbidden, Gale stepped forward, but Drain shook his head and stopped him.

"It's fine. The goddess will judge."

Thinking it would only be Shirone's loss if he incurred the goddess's wrath, Gale didn't pursue it further.

Shirone looked up and asked.

"Ikael, stop and go back."

The artificial brain Oega vibrated and translated Shirone's words, but to the people of Codename, it sounded like strange incantations.

"Hey, what nonsense are you spouting? And Ikael? To the benevolent goddess Ataraxia......"

Just as Gale couldn't contain himself and stepped forward again, the statue trembled and the temple shook.

"Wh-what!"

At this unprecedented event in Codename, the rankers looked around anxiously.

"The goddess is......"

Drain, who never lost confidence in any situation, stared blankly at the statue shedding tears.

"Huuuuk!"

As a code began to be carved on Shirone's forehead, rankers entered the temple.

"What's happening?"

No one could answer, and Drain, Gale, and Panica stared intently at the code wrapped in dim light.

'Ikael! This is......!'

The moment Shirone felt an uncontrollable amplification of his heart and gritted his teeth while raising his head.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

The statue shattered into pieces, and a massive Ataraxia unfolded above Shirone's crown.

'It's expanding endlessly!'

Though nothing had passed through magic circles, the world was shaking just from the concept of amplification alone.

'I see.'

As the code on his forehead appeared clearly, the secrets of Codename flowed in at the speed of light.

'This world is......'

While Shirone was lost in thought, the rankers stared wide-eyed at the code carved on his forehead.

"Wh-what is that?"

427,621

The rankers who confirmed Shirone's code murmured among themselves.

"That's the lowest class, isn't it? No, wait. If it's number 427,621, isn't that the very last number?"

Drain, who had been anxious due to the unprecedented reaction to Gwoncheong, breathed a sigh of relief.

'Of course. Was what happened earlier the goddess's curse?'

"Pff......!"

Gale burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! Dead last! You're dead last!"

Faced with such a dramatic number that didn't even evoke sympathy, even the rankers seemed to be holding back laughter.

"This is really crazy. I've never seen such a number in my life. From now on, I'll teach you what kind of human you are."

Panica blocked Gale's path.

"Stop it! To someone who's already having a hard time!"

There would be no need to harm someone who had been sentenced to the most miserable life in the city.

"No, that's not it. The fact that the dead last person came to the temple is itself a rebellion against rankers, isn't it? I'll set an example here."

After pushing Panica aside, Gale glanced around as if asking for understanding, and Drain stepped back.

'This is punishment for startling me.'

Mercy was only possible when one's first place was maintained.

"Now then, which part should I break first?"

Just as Gale was about to grab Shirone by the collar, the rankers suddenly panicked and looked around.

"What! Why is this happening?"

The codes carved on each of their foreheads began to emit light, and even Drain was not an exception.

'This is code conversion......'

Before the thought could finish, he felt his authority draining away along with a tremendous headache.

"Uaaaah! My head! My head!"

The rankers nearby were horrified when they saw the number newly carved on Drain's forehead.

427,622

"N-no way!"

The chain reaction that started with Drain reached Gale, converting his code to number 427,630.

"It hurts! My head hurts!"

The rankers collapsed to the floor in order of their high codes, all clutching their heads and screaming.

"No! My authority! How hard I worked to obtain it!"

The codes of all 427,620 people living in the city were being pushed back by one place with Shirone as the starting point.

The fact that no one could use their authority meant that everyone in Codename had become equal.

As the screams that had spread throughout the city subsided, sobbing sounds flowed into the temple.

"No. This must be a dream."

Those who had been rankers just moments before were shedding tears while bearing the numbers of the commoners they had despised.

"Even if it's just a dream......"

As Shirone approached, Gale backed away on his bottom.

"Hiiik!"

"That's not how it should be."

Shirone passed by Gale, who was trembling in terror, and looked back at where the statue had been destroyed.

The existing Ataraxia had been destroyed, but another Ataraxia remained.

'This place is Ikael's dream.'

The criterion for Codename No. 847, which Guffin had isolated, was the very existence called Ikael.

"And now......"

The new Ataraxia—Shirone looked at the people collapsed outside the temple and said.

"I am the criterion."

In Shirone's world, things like authority did not exist.
