[603] To Someone (1)

The sight of Istas transforming was spectacular.

"Pretty cool, right? This is Alpheas Magic School's famous Istas."

"Well, I'll be. My school had something like this too."

Liz casually dropped her alma mater's name while Oscar simply referred to "the school he attended."

Even in casual conversation, the difference between prestigious and non-prestigious schools was apparent.

Oscar was a native of the capital, but unless it was the Royal Magic School, it wasn't at the level to present a business card to the kingdom's top five prestigious institutions.

But Liz was proud of Oscar.

With this self-made man who had earned certification, she felt they could overcome any hardship together.

"Follow me. I'll introduce you to the research club filled with my memories."

"Let's head back now. We already greeted the headmaster."

"Oh come on. Hurry up. It'll be fun."

Unlike Liz, who was excited like a child, Oscar's mind was only on their dinner appointment.

"This place really hasn't changed at all."

Countless memories flashed through Liz's mind.

"How do you find your way? It's like a complete maze."

"One of the former presidents was a Servant ability user. That person created the master equation."

"Really? What's the principle behind it?"

Liz put her hands behind her back, turned around, and stuck out her tongue slightly.

"Secret."

The door to the Supernatural Psychic Research Club opened and Liz's face popped in.

"Ta-da! Huh, no one's here?"

"Of course they're in class. Let's go back. We have dinner plans with the association people too."

Just as Oscar was about to turn around, Liz grabbed his wrist and spun him back.

He sighed as he turned back, but faced with Liz's meaningful expression, his eyes couldn't help but light up.

"Are you really just going to leave? You might regret it."

"Hmm, what do you mean?"

Oscar played dumb.

"I spent more time here than in my dorm. In other words, you could say my scent is thoroughly soaked into this place."

When Liz pulled him, Oscar's legs moved as if hypnotized, and shortly after, the door closed.

"Ah, this is driving me crazy."

Nade, who had finished his evaluation earlier than his friends, had come into Istas looking for Shirone.

'I can't concentrate at all.'

His head was completely filled with thoughts of Liz, leaving him unable to do anything.

'If I knew this would happen, I would rather not have run into her at all.'

If he hadn't dropped out of Scramble Royale, if he hadn't gone to the bathhouse that day - countless regrets flooded in.

But in one corner of his heart, there was another Nade who was happy about reuniting with Liz.

"I wonder if Shirone's here?"

Nade's hand stopped dead as he was turning the doorknob.

At first he thought it was Shirone, but the sounds leaking from inside were clearly a man and woman's voices.

"What?"

Nade opened the door and entered the research club to see Liz and Oscar kissing.

"Senior Liz?"

It was a shock that felt like having his heart ripped out without anesthesia, a situation where he couldn't think of anything as if his brain had been extracted.

"Liz! Mmph! Mmph!"

Oscar, who spotted Nade, hurriedly pushed Liz away.

Liz, who realized belatedly, rolled her eyes in panic before approaching with an awkward smile.

"Oh my, Nade! When did you get here?"

"What are you doing right now?"

"Ah, how embarrassing. Sorry. I suddenly remembered the old days and the mood was right and all..."

"Get out."

When Nade became serious, Liz's mouth shut tight.

"Don't ever come here again."

Oscar frowned.

"What kind of way is that to talk to a senior? The research club isn't yours either, and Liz graduated from here too."

Nade's gaze lingered on Oscar for a moment before returning.

"Outsiders get out."

The two of them knew nothing.

About what kind of battle he and his friends had fought to protect the research club.

"Outsider? Get out?"

Oscar couldn't tolerate it any longer either.

"You'd better think before you speak from now on. The person standing in front of you is a professional mage who earned certification in the kingdom. You, who doesn't even have a mage license, are in no position to speak so carelessly."

Nade didn't even want to exchange words.

"I'm telling you for the last time. Get out. Unless you want to get hurt."

"This kid... after I've been so patient..."

Oscar's eyes widened as he stepped forward aggressively.

But the moment his gaze collided head-on with Nade's, he felt like his heart had stopped and couldn't move his body.

'What the hell is this kid?'

A cold aura that could freeze blood.

He had never experienced this level of killing intent even when carrying out missions in actual combat.

"Come at me if you're confident. You're a professional mage, right?"

Literally speaking, Oscar was a pro, and what had frozen him was an amateur senior student.

Regardless of how he felt, it was something he couldn't let slide, so as Oscar was about to step forward again, Liz intervened.

"Stop it! Don't fight."

After first pushing Oscar away, she turned to look at Nade and spoke.

"Alright. I'll go. I'm sorry if I upset you."

"Liz, you're going to put up with this kind of treatment? He's a guy who only thinks about his own feelings. Talking back to his direct senior and all."

"Oscar, please stop. Let's get out of here quickly."

As Liz led her boyfriend by the hand toward the door, Oscar spat out a curse.

"Delinquent bastard. No wonder he's always last place."

The door slammed shut roughly, and Nade, who had stood there for a moment, sat down on the sofa as if dizzy.

"Haah."

Contrary to his initial expectation that he would feel relieved, only regret flooded in after it was all over.

"Argh! Really! Really!"

Nade hit his own head like crazy and buried his face deep in the sofa.

Two hours later, when Shirone and Iruki arrived, Nade had already become a wreck.

"What's wrong? What happened?"

To Shirone, it was amazing that a person could change so much in just a few hours.

"It's over. Everything's over."

"So what's over?"

"Senior Liz came to visit..."

After hearing the full account from Nade, Shirone and Iruki remained silent for a long time.

Coldly driving them away was a mistake, but thinking about being in that situation themselves, they couldn't just criticize him.

"Think of it as a good thing. She had a fiancé anyway, right? Getting your hopes up would only make you suffer."

Iruki's advice was realistic.

"I know that too. But I can't give up. I'm angry enough to die, but I absolutely don't want to let her go."

Shirone administered shock therapy.

"Even after seeing that, you still like Senior Liz?"

"Yes! I like her! I think I'm going crazy from liking her so much. Do you know why I wanted to open a magic shop? Because Senior Liz works at the armory! I was going to confess properly, but like this..."

Nade clutched his head.

"I was stupid! I should have responded coolly. Now she must completely hate me, right?"

"Whether she hates you or likes you, she has a fiancé. That means she's going to get married soon."

"What's the big deal about an engagement? Maybe her heart could change and she could come to me. Iruki, what percentage chance is there of that?"

"Zero percent."

He didn't even want to calculate such a thing.

"Shirone, you tell me. What should I do now? Your insight is supposed to be for times like this."

"If you really can't give up, there's only one way."

"Really? What is it?"

"Go right now and apologize to both of them."

"Apologize?"

Liz might be one thing, but bowing his head to Oscar was the last thing he wanted to do.

"You were harsh, that's a fact. If you can't do it, you have no choice but to give up."

Even Nade thought it was the only solution.

"But I don't know where they are. I can't search every inn in the city."

"The headmaster would know. I'll ask."

Shirone ran to Alpheas and found out that Liz was staying at the Dolphin Inn.

Nade left Istas repeatedly thanking him, but when he actually arrived at the inn, he wasn't in his right mind.

'Stay calm. I'm just here to see my senior. I wasn't like this before.'

With the feeling of jumping off a cliff, he raised his hand to knock on the door, and Liz's voice could be heard.

"Who is it?"

"Um... it's Nade."

"Nade?"

The door opened and Liz appeared in comfortable clothes.

It might not be as beautiful as when she was dressed up, but that rarity made his heart pound even more.

"How did you know to come here?"

Liz's face as she looked at the speechless Nade was, as expected, not very favorable.

"Want to come in?"

"I'm sorry! Senior!"

Thinking he couldn't delay any longer, Nade immediately bowed his head and apologized.

"I must have lost my mind. Not even recognizing my senior. I'm truly sorry."

This couldn't resolve all emotions, but there was no reason not to accept an apology.

"Alright. Thanks for coming to find me. Actually, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. I was wondering if I shouldn't have gone to the school."

"That's absolutely not the case. It's all my fault."

"I understand. Let's meet once before I leave."

"Um, but where is Mr. Oscar? I'd like to apologize to him directly."

"He went out for dinner plans with association people. Don't worry. He's not the type to hold grudges."

"Still, could you tell me where? I absolutely won't cause any trouble."

From Liz's perspective, it would be good for Oscar to cool down too.

"He should be at Gold Ocean Restaurant. That's where we agreed to meet. It's an important occasion, so you can't interfere."

"Yes. Don't worry. Thank you."

Thinking he might make another mistake if he stayed longer, Nade hurriedly left the inn.

'It worked! It worked!'

There was still some distance between them, but it was a hundred times better than severing their connection.

'Getting happy over just this much. Just a few days ago, she was smiling at me.'

Why do humans only realize something's value after losing it?

'I'll have to be satisfied with just seeing her again.'

Nade confirmed Oscar's presence through the window from across the street where the restaurant was located.

At a gathering of five or six people, he was conversing with confident gestures.

"Tch, must be nice."

Did Oscar know what a great blessing it was to receive Liz's love?

He might get annoyed and sometimes find it bothersome, but to someone else, she was a noble woman whose eyes he couldn't even easily meet.

"But when is this going to end?"

Having to wait outside to apologize to his beloved woman's boyfriend was the epitome of wretchedness.

Whether it was because of his thin clothes or not, the autumn cold was harsh, but it surely wasn't just because of the weather.

'Hurry up and finish. Hurry up and finish.'

After waiting about an hour with his hands tucked under his armpits, Oscar, having finished dinner, stood up from his seat.

'He's coming out.'

Oscar personally opened the restaurant door, waited for his party to come out, straightened his clothes, and bowed his head.

"Thank you for the wonderful dinner, Branch Manager. Next time I'll take you somewhere nice."

"Ha ha! I'm glad it was to your taste. I'll be looking forward to your discernment."

'Wow. That person was the branch manager?'

Nade looked at the middle-aged man whose belly protruded so much that his suit buttons were barely fastened.

Getting certification was impressive, but having dinner with the Creas branch manager of the Magic Association was exceptional.

'Well, I guess he has some skills. After all, to live with Senior Liz... huh?'

A blonde woman in a red dress put on a fur coat, approached Oscar's side, and gently linked arms with him.

"Dad, can I walk with this person for a bit? To help digest too."

"Sure. Please escort my daughter well."

"Don't worry."

Judging from the conversation, she was definitely the branch manager's daughter.

But what he couldn't understand was why such a woman was walking arm-in-arm with Oscar.

"...What the hell?"
