Omega (4)

'I see.'

Shirone had once met Argo when he fell into Apocalypse due to Valhalla Action's debt.

Moreover, this meant that the Eternal Life Program had not activated in reality.

Of course, for Shirone to reach that memory, he would need to accept much more Omega.

'Eternity is not infinite.'

Having already grasped Gaia's reasoning, he could understand without experiencing it.

'No matter how endlessly time is divided, ultimately time in higher dimensions still flows.'

He suddenly recalled the horrific situation when he entered the 19,000th world of Maze Andre.

The sight of all humans losing their reason and writhing like worms in narrow passages.

Perhaps that was humanity's final fate that the Eternal Life Program would bring.

'The Eternal Life Program cannot be eternal.'

That's why Guffin sought to break the cycle of reincarnation and leap to higher dimensions.

'But Ankera doesn't acknowledge the outside world.'

Ultimately, it would obstruct the Gaians' escape, as proven by the era Shirone lived in.

'The beginning of war.'

In other words, the beginning of tragedy.

"Hmm."

Yoruham sighed.

"Must it be us?"

There was no answer, but for Gaians, answers weren't particularly necessary as a means of communication.

"If not us, then who?"

Guffin rose from his seat and looked around at the gathering.

"Let's go, to the end of the world."

The moment he finished speaking, all the Gaians present raised both hands high.

"Waaahhh!"

As a tremendous roar shook the walls, Yoruham shouted loudly.

"The Gaians shall extend infinitely!"

Shirone knew what great sacrifices the Gaians would make because of this decision.

'But they're already prepared.'

The reason they weren't afraid was...

'Because they are one.'

Though their ages, genders, and tendencies were all different, their reasoning was perfectly unified by absolute standards.

It was a qualitatively different unity from the dragons who could access each other's information.

'The pinnacle of intelligence.'

What would it feel like if all humanity in the world supported only me, and that me became the whole again?

'How magnificent.'

Knowing what is right and acting upon it.

Tears flowed from Shirone's eyes, who had to bear so much to save the world.

'I want to be there too.'

He wanted to burrow into the group of Gaians.

'It's too hard. Too lonely.'

Someday, humanity in the world Shirone lived in would also be unified as one.

After countless conflicts and endless counterarguments, the day would come when they found the answer.

'I must fight.'

Shirone wiped away his tears and groped for Omega.

Countless individuals were celebrating Gaia's new beginning in their own ways.

"Beyond infinity."

Within Omega's signal, Guffin's voice seeped into Shirone's mind.

Uriel, left alone on the Antarctic continent where all life had disappeared, pondered Maze's words.

'My destruction has no emotion?'

When did she, the strongest archangel in the universe, begin to be swayed by human words?

Still, the reason she couldn't leave was because her words were true.

'Archangel Ikael.'

For the archangels of birth and destruction, Kariel and Uriel, only she was the cause.

'I don't care who you love.'

What was wondrous was simply the fact that an archangel could love someone.

"What is love?"

Kariel, who had obsessed over it and pondered endlessly, ultimately self-destructed.

'Did she realize it though?'

Did Uriel's only partner find the answer she so desperately wanted at the moment before extinction?

'Unpleasant.'

Adrias Maze.

Every time she thought of her, an indescribable unpleasant feeling disturbed her luminous body.

"Next time I will kill her."

Murder, not destruction.

Having opened the Judicial Halo, she concentrated a concept of destruction on a completely different level than before.

"Is this sufficient, human?"

The moment white lightning struck down, Uriel's body penetrated the Antarctic continent.

Grrrrrrrr!

The impact was among the top five in the planet's entire history.

"Gasp!"

Before even her death rattle could fully escape, Taeseong collapsed with her eyes rolled back.

"Lady Taeseong!"

The four Great Stars gathered in the Earth Temple rushed to her in panic.

"Pull yourself together!"

Though she was the planet's avatar anyway, they now felt anxious that even that avatar could perish.

"This is impossible."

The Antarctic continent was disappearing from the planet visible below the Earth Temple.

Amanta said.

"This is just the beginning. If those monsters rampage here, destruction is only a matter of time."

"Freed..."

At Taeseong's voice, Freed, who was supporting her, quickly lowered his head.

"Are you conscious?"

"There's no time. At this rate, the planet will stop functioning. Please take me to the Central Continent."

"The Central Continent?"

Minerva raised an eyebrow.

"There's no need for you to go to the battlefield personally. The Ivory Tower's stars are sufficient."

"No. There's someone I must meet."

Freed asked.

"You mean Shirone?"

"No."

Taeseong shook her head and said with strength in her eyes.

"Augent Ryan. I must meet him."

A body glowing red-hot like a meteor breaking through the atmosphere streaked across the sky.

"Those bastards..."

Son Yoo Jung, ranked 2nd in the Ten Lords.

"Messing with my friend?"

Though a normal life form's body should already be burning up, her temperature kept rising endlessly.

"There."

Finding Extreme Evil Satan was easy.

The sight of hell's army, easily 200 million strong, massed together and advancing was visible even from the sky's peak.

"Intruder!"

Demons guarding the sky flew at her with flaming tridents.

"Hmph, demons?"

Having lived for over 10,000 years, she was sick of encountering demons from this side world.

"Ruyi."

The moment her red staff began spinning rapidly, it started extending to tremendous length.

"Invincible Windmill."

As the staff reached 4 kilometers in diameter and rotated, the sky was dyed deep red.

The extendable length matched exactly the range the user's scale allowed.

"Get out of my way!"

Theoretically near-infinite, the Ruyi Staff swept away the demons without loss of tension.

"What's that?"

Havitz's group, who had entered the Abyss Cliff, simultaneously looked toward the distant sky.

"Huh."

A massive red sphere clearly visible from the ground was approaching, sweeping away demons.

Vulcan's eyes grew serious.

'Size isn't the problem.'

No, maybe size was the problem?

Even roughly estimated, it was the strength to swing a 4-kilometer staff fast enough to create afterimages.

"She's coming."

As Yoo Jung crashed to the ground with a demon underfoot, she slid as if on ice.

"Graaahhh!"

A brigade commander with a split face writhed in agony before dying, and Yoo Jung turned toward the enemies.

Like a heated rock falling, the surrounding temperature rose noticeably.

"Huuuuu."

The demons watched hot steam pour from Yoo Jung's mouth.

"Satan, come out."

Vulcan thought.

First, judging by the unreadable crowd presence, she definitely came alone.

Second, she was dangerous nonetheless.

"Hurry..."

Yoo Jung took a deep breath, clenched both fists, bared her teeth and roared.

"Come out I said!"

Her voice, tearing through the air, carried the bestiality symbolizing violence.

As Vulcan frowned and considered how to deal with Yoo Jung, one figure stepped forward.

"I'm Satan though?"

Havitz stroked his mustache and said.

"You?"

Even Yoo Jung lowered her voice at this moment.

Her animal instincts caught the scent of chaos reaching back to the most ancient times.

"Well, fine."

The moment she spun the Ruyi Staff with her finger, Yoo Jung's body vanished from before their eyes.

'First I'll beat them up and...'

As she approached Havitz and swung her staff at his side, in that instant.

'Huh?'

Following a faint afterimage, a girl with severed eyelids was caught in Yoo Jung's vision.

Natasha, who had deflected the Ruyi Staff with the back of her hand, crouched low and burrowed into her embrace.

'She blocked it.'

Yoo Jung was chilled.

In a situation where most demons couldn't even perceive her movement, only she was looking directly into her eyes.

'This is it, right?'

As Yoo Jung thrust her staff, the wrinkles in the air became clearly visible in the slowly flowing time.

Natasha twisted her upper body to avoid the attack and threw a straight punch at Yoo Jung's abdomen.

'Why is she so hard?'

The hardness was unlike anything biological - her fist was nearly breaking instead.

'Hmph, with just a punch like that...'

As Yoo Jung pushed force into her abdomen and pulled back her staff to counterattack again.

'Damn!'

Still with her fist against Yoo Jung's stomach, Natasha kicked off the ground and bent her arm.

Like hammering a nail, she struck with her elbow using her pelvis, sending Yoo Jung's body flying back.

'Got it!'

Having disrupted the enemy's balance, Natasha flew at mach speed and unleashed a barrage of attacks.

Havitz's army could only imagine the battle while hearing sounds invisible to the eye.

"Ow!"

Natasha's widely swung fist struck Yoo Jung's jaw head-on.

Crack crack crack crack crack!

Only after Yoo Jung slid far along the ground and glared forward were their figures captured again.

'Is Natasha capable of this level?'

As Vulcan judged without showing emotion yet, Natasha raised both hands.

"You're really tough."

Blood flowed profusely down her hands and broken bones protruded.

Vulcan's expression crumpled.

'A hard-to-break type.'

If Natasha's fists couldn't destroy her, she was practically immune to physical attacks.

Yoo Jung also corrected her stance and rested the Ruyi Staff on her shoulder.

"Hmph, you're pretty fast too."

Though there were ways if they looked for them, Vulcan didn't want to waste power before the great undertaking.

"What do you want?"

Yoo Jung, who had been touching her slightly swollen cheek, wiped the blood from her lips and said.

"Release my friend. Mortasinger. You guys dragged him into hell, didn't you?"

"Mortasinger?"

Vulcan, uninterested in the shadow world, looked at Havitz.

"Don't know."

There was no way Havitz didn't know about Mortasinger, whom Satan had personally taken to hell.

He was merely a means to mock Yahweh, so it was bothersome even to recall.

"Really?"

Yoo Jung wrinkled her nose like a monkey and bared her teeth.

"Then I'll make you remember."

As terrifying killing intent spread, Vulcan, predicting the next moment, hurriedly extended his hand.

"Wait. Havitz..."

But before that, a purple Satan's avatar surged from Havitz's body.

'Vanishing.'

As all causality connected to Havitz was severed, no one could perceive him.

Yoo Jung also felt no sense of unease.

"What will you do? Bring my friend back quickly. Before I smash everyone here to pieces."

Havitz dismounted and drew his long sword, then circled behind Yoo Jung.

"An interesting human."

A cold blade touched her nape.

"No, not human?"

He slowly moved the sword left and right, but like a dull blade, her skin wouldn't cut.

"Aha."

Havitz's eyes curved like a seagull's.

"You're connected."

He attacked the Idea directly.

"Slice slice slice."

And finally, red blood began flowing from Yoo Jung's slender neck.
