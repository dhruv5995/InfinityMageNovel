[734] Two Gazes (3)

"Whoa!"

Kido let out an exclamation of admiration.

There wouldn't be a soul who wouldn't call that strike the pinnacle of artistry—not even Ymir, who had just lost half his torso.

"That... that was..."

Unlike Seong-eum who was a mage, Moon-gyeong, who had pursued the ultimate in physical prowess, understood exactly what Rian's punch had contained.

'He encompassed everything.'

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

'Then what's the shortest distance between two moving points?'

That too is a straight line.

'Therefore, within an already perfected straight line, infinite curves are all contained.'

That's what Rian's punch had been just now—a strike that no one but Rian could ever imitate.

'He didn't choose not to dodge. He couldn't dodge.'

Among the swordsmanship Moon-gyeong had learned was something called the thousand-move technique.

But watching Rian's attack just now made him feel self-deprecating about what use ten thousand curves could possibly have.

"Puuuuuu!"

Ymir, who had been obliterated in a circular pattern from his right shoulder through his chest to his side, sat down with his back against the wall.

"Are you in pain?"

Instead, Ymir asked about Rian's well-being.

"Graaaah!"

In his Yaksha state, his muscles twisted and bulged grotesquely before the tangled muscle fibers began returning to their original state.

"Pain, you see..."

Hearing Rian's groans, Ymir lifted his head.

"Is the extreme of sensation. If the state of feeling nothing is called death, then pain is life itself."

"Hnngh!"

Watching Rian writhe in agony while clutching his shoulder, Ymir's lips curved upward.

"Treasure it. It's proof that you're alive."

The moment pain disappears, life disappears too.

"Wait..."

Rian gritted his teeth and lifted his head.

"I still haven't heard it. Why did Ojent..."

Did Ymir know something?

"You'll find out soon enough. At the peak of pain."

We shall meet again.

Ymir's eyes closed and his body's cells began to shrink as if consuming themselves.

When the process of annihilation was complete, only a single molar remained in that spot.

"Wait! Urgh!"

As Rian returned to his human body and curled up from tremendous pain, Kido made a fuss.

"Wh-what do we do! We need to get out right now!"

"I'm fine. More importantly, Shirone..."

Though Ymir had been annihilated, Shirone's condition had worsened even further than before.

'It's not an explosion.'

Seong-eum felt genuinely afraid.

'Could he actually be dying?'

She thought that perhaps Shirone might burn everything white and disappear just like this.

"It's blocked."

Shirone muttered in his fading consciousness.

"Something... is blocked."

If he couldn't break through, he would die, but that was something for one of the 19,000 Shirones to handle.

"Shirone! I'll go treat Rian first!"

With the Maga bandits and Baeknyeo dead and even Ymir gone, it was the right decision.

Kido tried to carry Rian on his back, but due to their height difference, he ended up crushed underneath.

Seong-eum stepped forward.

"Wait. I'll..."

Suddenly her words cut off, and Kido, who had been turning around, hurriedly stopped and stared ahead.

"Wh-what is that?"

Ominous flames that no artist could ever express flickered in a spherical form.

"Too late, Shirone."

What emerged from those flames was a young man with tattoos covering every visible part of his body beyond his rags.

"Really... too late."

The moment their eyes met Nanae's, both Rian and Kido simultaneously vanished from sight.

Even a master wouldn't have been able to keep up with that speed, but Nanae's gaze remained indifferent as ever.

'I can't win. I absolutely cannot win.'

Having reached the maze wall in one sprint, Kido couldn't calm his pounding heart.

'It's not because I'm weak. No one in this world could handle that person.'

That's how certain those eyes had made him feel.

"Your Highness, those tattoos..."

"Yes. I know."

Seong-eum, who had the most superior intelligence network among the Ivory Tower candidates, blocked Shirone's path.

"Dahlia, or rather Psychedelic Nanae. That's what they call you, isn't it?"

"What does a name matter?"

Ever since devouring Ankera's dream, everything in this world had been converging on Nanae.

'Something's different.'

Finally all three Ivory Tower candidates were gathered in one place, and all three had changed from the beginning.

Nanae looked toward Shirone, who Seong-eum was blocking.

"Thinking of suffering sentient beings, I cannot delay even a moment, but I've come to keep a promise, Shirone."

Shirone desperately grasped his fading consciousness and forced himself to stand.

"A promise? What promise?"

"I will be where you seek."

Shirone's brow furrowed at the words La Enemie had spoken.

"How do you know that..."

"Do you still not understand?"

Nanae formed a circle with his index finger and thumb.

"I am the whole."

Though it didn't lead to a sword-word, it felt like truth piercing his mind through language alone.

"Ankera..."

Though the form and feeling were different, if he was ultimately the whole, there would be no need to particularly distinguish between Nanae and Ankera.

Seong-eum stepped forward.

"I don't know what you're talking about, but if you too are our competitor, shouldn't we settle this with a match?"

Seong-eum had already grasped Nanae's depth, but in terms of determination, she was more comfortable than Shirone.

"Stop. You're no match for him."

This wasn't dismissing Seong-eum.

"You'll die."

"...I don't care."

Though her time with Shirone had been short, if she had to choose an enemy, she would choose Nanae.

"You are a good person. Please enter the Ivory Tower in my place and fulfill your dreams."

Moon-gyeong's face turned pale.

"Your Highness!"

"Moon-gyeong."

Seong-eum smiled at him for the first time.

"You may bury my corpse."

"Aaaaaaah!"

Screaming, Moon-gyeong drew his sword and charged at Nanae.

'Not because I couldn't reach you, Your Highness!'

Even while swinging the greatest sword strike of his life, Nanae simply watched the descending flash.

'Because I couldn't bear to reach you!'

Moon-gyeong's sword instantly crossed space and approached within one centimeter of Nanae's forehead.

'I'll kill him! I'll kill him! I'll definitely kill him!'

The gap narrowed further—0.5 centimeters, 0.1 centimeters, finally 0.0000001 centimeters.

'I'll cut.'

And at that point, Nanae declared.

Sermon.

The Cutting Sword.

As if born by splitting time itself, a gray sword was born and vertically split space before Moon-gyeong's sword could reach.

'I'm dead...!'

Moon-gyeong's vision filled with brilliant colors before he struck the ground twenty meters away from Nanae.

'How?'

When he came to his senses, Seong-eum was already lunging toward Nanae.

"Do not mock my subordinate."

Though Nanae, who had realized emptiness, had no emotion called mockery, Seong-eum's ability was interesting.

"A wonderful realization."

"Hmph! Don't mistake yourself for being on high ground."

Ether Wave.

Great Twist.

The space around her and Nanae distorted and its directionality became completely twisted.

'Now, try anything.'

Any attack would reach Nanae.

"Space."

As Nanae extended both arms and formed different hand seals, a pitch-black sword that absorbed everything appeared.

"Gravity."

All the space twisted by Great Twist was sucked into the sword.

"Waves."

The formless sword shot high above his head and created powerful vibrations that disrupted the Ether Wave.

"And..."

As Nanae clasped his hands together with a benevolent expression, thousands of brilliant swords spread like a halo.

"Everything."

Sermon.

Paradise Rebirth.

Swords of countless elements existing in the world spread in a circle before all shooting toward Seong-eum.

On the threshold of death, the question that naturally arose was:

'Is he a god?'

The sword of light pierced first, followed by swords containing various concepts that tore Seong-eum apart.

'Huh?'

With her life extinguished, what entered her eyes was Shirone's figure.

"I'm dead though?"

"You're not dead."

In that instant moment, what the two were staying in was the boundary between life and death—the Chonyid Bardo.

"Bak-ji?"

Though Paradise Rebirth had failed, not a ripple stirred in Nanae's heart.

"Destroy death."

As the sermon activated as a sword-word, a pitch-black sword pierced through the veil of the other world and aimed at Shirone and Seong-eum.

'This was it.'

Staring at the rushing sword, Shirone realized what had been blocking the sensation of explosion.

'It was me all along.'

Immortal Function.

As his mind expanded into the realm of infinity, Valhalla Action once again reversed cause and effect.

"Time explosion this time?"

Nanae changed his hand seal.

"Neither beginning nor end."

A sword with pale radiance swam like an eel before transcending time to chase Shirone's result.

'Is he a god?'

Shirone couldn't help but think the same thing.

Goblin Avatar Technique.

Earth-bound Spirit.

"Aaaaaaah!"

As Kido rolled in front of Shirone and activated Earth-bound Spirit, the time sword slightly twisted and pierced through the cave wall.

KWAAAAANG!

While everyone was stunned by the thick earthen wall being completely pierced through, Nanae stopped his attack.

"I do not understand."

Just hearing his voice made everyone flinch, when Rian, supported by Moon-gyeong, joined them.

"What are you clinging to?"

Though these were five people who would compete for the top anywhere in the world, they all stepped back in unison at Nanae's single step.

'This isn't just being strong or that level. This is...'

No words came to mind to describe it.

"Is this not a world that simply ends when you close your eyes? Why do you struggle to live?"

Shirone mustered courage and faced him.

"There's no reason like that. Because I'm alive. That alone is qualification enough to live."

To Nanae, who had realized everything, Shirone's words foretold one of two things:

Either Shirone was wrong, or he himself didn't understand.

"The reason I promised to come to you is also to make you keep a promise."

"What promise?"

Nanae's Karr value was still rising toward perfection, but it was an endless journey of 99.99999... percent.

"You have an obligation to answer the question that remains."

Nanae pointed at Shirone.

"Why can I not become a god?"

A moment of silence fell over the maze.

"God..."

It was the word Kido hated most, but honestly, if it was Nanae, there was no choice but to acknowledge it.

"Shirone, I am nearly right."

A single sword emitting red light rose vertically above Nanae's head.

"Therefore I carry irreversible karma and try to save this world. But because I am nearly right, this will also be your last chance. If you have no means to deny me, I will end this dream with that."

It was probably a sword containing such a concept.

"Shirone, stay back. I'll smash that cult leader-like bastard myself."

Though Rian raised his sword despite his aching body, Shirone shook his head and took another step forward instead.

"I don't know if it's the right answer."

Including what he couldn't remember, this was the third time Shirone had heard this question.

And for the first time, he felt like he might be able to answer something.

"But you'll never be able to thrust that sword."

Nanae nodded.

"I understand that much. But what's really important is missing. Answer me. Why can't I thrust it?"

After being lost in thought for a moment, Shirone slowly turned his head and took in the sight of his companions.

Rian, Kido, Seong-eum and Moon-gyeong.

"And the countless lives existing in this world..."

"No! Shirone!"

The moment Rian realized something and shouted, Shirone spread both arms toward Nanae.

"This is my answer."

Immortal Function.

Not for magic.

As he opened his mind with the heart to embrace all life, Shirone's body radiated light in the shape of a cross.

"Wh-what?"

Simultaneously, the entrances to worlds sealed in Andre shook and light bloomed like fire flowers.

"That's..."

Nineteen thousand crosses were rising.
