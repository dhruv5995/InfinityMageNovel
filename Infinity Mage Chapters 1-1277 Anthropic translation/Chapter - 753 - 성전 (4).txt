[753] Holy War (4)

Sirone looked up at the sky.

'The Law.'

The mechanism of <Law Kill> that inevitably led to death resembled Minerva's fate, who was destined to become a witch.

'Can one escape from it?'

If he chose bread for lunch today, was that human will, or the combination of infinite variables unknown to humans?

'Even if I thought about eating bread and suddenly changed the menu...'

If that too was the workings of the Law.

'Since it's too vast to analyze, Uorin's expression of calling it a curse is accurate.'

Until Veron's experiment was complete.

Sirone, who had soothed his heavy heart with the sound of insects' music, read the end of the letter.

<Law Kill> was given to Minerva around the age of twenty.

And that vicious weapon wandered the world, killing countless people.

Its destructive power was truly terrifying.

At some point, high-ranking officials from various countries began dying one after another, caught up in strange incidents.

By the time the leaders began investigating the truth, it was already too late. The revenge was perfectly successful.

As many killers emerged as there were dead, but the true killer was Minerva.

That's how revenge works, isn't it?

Minerva, who could no longer turn back, chose to become a true witch. She caused the great disaster recorded in history as the 'Walking Dead.'

An unspeakable number of people died, and humanity nearly faced its end at that point.

Here's where the Ivory Tower stepped in.

Was this too part of the Law's wheel?

The Ivory Tower, which stopped the Walking Dead, presented her with two choices.

To face humanity's judgment. Or to become a resident of the Ivory Tower and work for humanity.

Minerva was one of the Five Great Stars of the Human Safety Enforcement Agency.

At first, Minerva chose the first option.

She didn't want to fight for the humans she so terribly despised.

But there seems to have been some kind of deal. According to my speculation...

It must have been an order from Taeseong.

They probably promised not to prosecute even those who became killers due to <Law Kill>'s law.

When Sirone read Uorin's letter, the first thing that came to his mind was his interview with Taeseong.

The Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower can register one item instead of commanding satellites.

What she said then wasn't just a simple example, but was speaking precisely about Minerva's case.

Minerva didn't destroy <Law Kill>.

The Ivory Tower naturally would have suggested it, but she insisted on keeping it to the end.

This caused tremendous worldwide controversy.

These were the words of someone who lived through that era.

Minerva was transported to the Ivory Tower in a wooden prison, protected by the stars.

It was truly an enormous crowd. Over 20,000 people, each hurling curses and throwing stones.

I could understand their grief too.

The Minerva I saw just looked calm.

Even with the barrage of reporters' questions, she silently looked straight ahead.

Then one reporter broke through the crowd and reached Minerva.

The crowd instantly fell silent, and the question the reporter asked was...

The biggest issue.

Why didn't you destroy <Law Kill>?

And Minerva, for the first and last time, turned to look at the reporter and said this:

If there is truly someone who must die, then they must die.

This was the wish that a ten-year-old girl with no power or backing would have carved into her heart while being violated by countless adults.

Thus <Law Kill> still wanders the world today, taking lives.

Now you understand what it means to fight extreme evil with evil.

If you seek <Law Kill> with desperate longing, the Law will move to eliminate extreme evil.

Actually... I'm not telling you this story to make you sympathize with Minerva. Though I'm sure you've already forgiven her.

What I want to say is that I think the core of <Law Kill> lies in those who truly must die - in other words, in desperation.

<Law Kill> won't activate without desperation.

Now the category narrows.

Those in power or with wealth only track <Law Kill>'s location but never try to obtain it.

If it came into their hands, they'd have to suspect someone activated it to kill them.

A weapon that's the natural enemy of power.

Most cases where <Law Kill> caused deaths involved the weak killing the strong.

By tracking the routes of these incidents and figuring out the movements, we should be able to confirm where it is now and in whose hands.

By rapidly tracking across the world, I arrived here - the Northern Eymond Republic.

If ultimate good exists in the real world, then ultimate evil would naturally be in the other world. Probably Satan.

And like you, he exists outside the Law. That's why even Ankera couldn't interfere.

If you and Miro follow the Law, then Sirone and Satan form perfect balance by denying the Law.

But according to Heaven's reports, Satan must also pass through a living body to materialize.

At that time, it was someone called Frankwine.

It's a race against time.

Satan is probably scouting numerous candidates. There are too many to narrow down with History Search abilities.

That's why <Law Kill> is needed.

Uorin planned to use <Law Kill> to eliminate everyone Satan had marked.

I know it's difficult, but I really need your help.

If you help with this, you won't owe me any more debts.

It was a bill worthy of Uorin, telling him to do his best.

I miss you.

The letter ended with Teraze's seal, and Sirone threw the paper into the bonfire.

Watching the paper turn to ash, Sirone's eyes filled with firm resolve.

'I've been tracking by checking records of death incidents so far. If my prediction is correct...'

It should be here, 2 kilometers from the capital of the Northern Eymond Republic, at the 48th Military Facility.

'I can meet them tomorrow.'

The unfortunate someone who possesses <Law Kill>.

The second morning of the holy war dawned.

The previous day's conference had ended with Gustav's rampage, and by majority vote, additional talks were scheduled.

Gustav was thinking of world war, and to stop their dominance, representatives from various countries hadn't slept a wink.

"Well then, though unprecedented, let's begin the second conference."

As Uorin declared, the representatives sat at the round table, and the guards moved to the back with more killing intent than before.

"I apologize for yesterday. Coming to such a wonderful gathering seems to have awakened the passion of my youth."

Gustav's Fourth Knight, Interior King Smodo, bowed his head toward the round table as he walked to his seat.

Though unexpected, this too was likely a cunning scheme from Smodo's mind.

"We were all excited. Let's end yesterday's matters with yesterday, and have a more constructive conversation today."

"The Empress of the Empire is truly benevolent."

Smodo wore a servile smile as he headed to his seat where the other Fourth Knights were already sitting.

Natasha knelt with bulging eyes, and beside her sat a middle-aged man cross-legged with his chin resting on his hand.

Now even Uorin openly examined them.

'Gustav's Fourth Knight, God of War Balkan.'

The bearded man like a bandit boasted a muscular body despite being in his fifties.

But what was truly frightening was his brain.

'A genius military strategist of the continent who combines literary and martial arts. It's no exaggeration to say Habitz wages war because of him.'

Balkan, who made eye contact with Uorin, grinned showing his teeth without changing his chin-resting posture.

'He has no intention of giving up.'

Today's conference would also be turbulent, and what remained was other nations' choice to oppose Gustav.

'We must prevent world war if possible. But if they cross the line, we don't need to be too submissive either.'

Guidelines had already been established through secret channels with not only Jincheon but also the heads of the Seven Royal Stars.

"Then I'll announce the agenda first. Of course, we were discussing the Valkyrie budget yesterday, but there's a more urgent matter to address."

Amid everyone's silent approval, Uorin stared straight at Habitz and said:

"So... are you really going to have a showdown?"

It was a preemptive strike to seize the initiative, but Habitz was still Habitz.

"I said we would. Didn't we talk last night? Or what, did you beg for help?"

But Uorin had now finished her assessment.

"You must be anticipating how many people will die. Gustav's side won't be unscathed either."

"That's fine. It's not like I'm the one dying."

Faced with the powerful narcissism that sustained Habitz, Uorin chose practicality.

"Then we'll absorb the Gustav forces currently belonging to Valkyrie into the remaining nations."

"Hmm."

Interior King Smodo rubbed his chin for the first time, and God of War Balkan nodded with a meaningful smile.

While Habitz XVII would never make such a choice, the previous emperor Habitz XVI had invested considerably in Valkyrie to prevent war with Heaven.

'If we give up Valkyrie, the Empire's power weakens by one-seventeenth. A world war in this state. The tax increase rate needed to stably supply time, manpower, and materials would be...'

As Smodo's thoughts raced frightfully fast, Habitz said indifferently:

"Then take it. We'll just do it without Valkyrie."

The holy war hall was shocked.

Even Blitz and Enox, who had been watching the human struggle with interest, turned their heads with puzzled expressions.

"Are you serious?"

By objective analysis, pushing this far should force Gustav to retreat for now.

Kashan's analysts had worked all night to conclude Gustav's victory rate was below 10 percent.

"If we've gathered in the plaza..."

Habitz said irritably.

"Shouldn't we do something? If we just keep deciding all day, the sun will set. I need to go home. I just want to do anything quickly. So don't waste time and let's just have a war."

Without considering calculations at all, his head filled only with the desire to play chaotically.

Balkan shrugged his shoulders.

"Haha, as expected of Your Majesty. An excellent judgment. Of course, when it comes to killing people, we should rush out even while eating."

Uorin's eyes calmly sank.

'Did he say plaza?'

Uorin too was one of those who had stayed longest in this vast plaza.

'People waiting for promises, people reading books, people watching the plaza's crowd.'

But sometimes there are humans like this.

'People who, purely for their own pleasure, create chaos without caring about others' thoughts.'

Habitz spoke like a child.

"Let's have some fun."

"..."

As representatives from various nations were disgusted, he stood up and grabbed the round table.

"Still can't decide? Then I'll cleanly settle it. From now on, the Gustav Empire is... Heup!"

Habitz exerted all his strength, but the heavy round table didn't budge.

"Hehehe! How disappointing, Your Majesty. You should include me in such fun activities."

Balkan approached Habitz's side and grabbed the round table.

"From now on!"

The two men exchanged glances, nodded, and simultaneously raised both arms wide.

"It's war!"

With Balkan's tremendous strength, the round table spun 10 meters high, and Natasha raised her head and burst into cackling laughter.

Beyond the spinning, falling round table, the distorted faces of representatives from various nations were visible.

"Let's kill spectacularly!"

The moment the holy war's round table crashed down with a thud, killing intent flashed in Uorin's eyes for the first time.

'Ultimate evil.'
