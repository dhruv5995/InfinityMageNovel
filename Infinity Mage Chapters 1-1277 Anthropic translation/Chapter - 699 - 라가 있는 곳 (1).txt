[699] Where Ra Is (1)

Even as Rian and Kido passed through the meta gate, Sirone and Uorin remained motionless.

Though they weren't particularly fond of each other, time flowed slowly because they both instinctively knew they could never be excluded from each other's lives from now on.

'She's matured.'

That's what it meant to live as the Empress of Kashan.

They had met when she was fourteen, and though she was still the tender age of sixteen, she had grown into a beautiful woman who had shed much of her childish demeanor.

Thanks to Sirone receiving all the attention, Rian and Kido were free to observe Uorin.

'Is that woman Theraze?'

Thinking that she was the person with the most powerful authority in the world, even the space around her seemed to ripple.

'She's certainly incomparable to Orkamp.'

Though he'd heard she was his daughter, he could confidently say she hadn't inherited any of his genes.

"Uh, so..."

Before he could say anything, Uorin quickly ran over and embraced Sirone.

"Sirone, oppa!"

It was an unexpected situation, and Gando, who had entered the room late, also blinked in disbelief.

"Do you know how worried I was that something might happen to you, oppa?"

Sirone looked down at Uorin's earnest eyes and pulled her back tightly as he spoke.

"Thank you, Uorin."

Though hidden against his chest, a hint of shock flickered in Uorin's eyes.

"I heard what happened - that you saved me. I don't know how to repay this debt."

Kido turned his head as if asking whether this was okay, but Rian just carefully observed the situation.

Gando cautiously spoke up.

"Your Majesty."

The imperial palace Aganos was a perfect fortress equipped with all defensive facilities against magic, law, and physics.

Moreover, Uorin was humanity's most important figure, protected by guards divided into close, middle, and distant units, as well as the Wind General.

Yet now she was in someone's arms, ignoring all those defensive barriers.

'This is why I tried to stop her.'

Uorin leaving a meta gate in Kazura was tantamount to placing the world's most valuable life in someone else's hands.

'To summon Sirone here.'

Jealousy.

The word briefly crossed Gando's mind, but he immediately shook his head.

'I must protect Her Majesty.'

Just as he made his decision and tried to approach, Uorin first hunched her shoulders and slowly pulled away.

Gently pushing against Sirone's chest with her slender fingers, she smiled with a different expression than moments before.

"You've grown strong, Sirone."

Not calculating meant having no fear.

Gando's steps stopped, and Sirone gazed intently at Uorin's unmasked face.

'So it was false after all?'

Why was it?

Even though he had already expected this, why did he feel disappointed?

"It's thanks to your help. With Armand, and saving me from the moratorium too."

Sirone belatedly asked.

"But... is it okay to speak casually...?"

If their childhood games were over, what stood before him wasn't a sixteen-year-old girl but Theraze, who held thousands of years of history.

"Of course. It's awkward for fellow candidates to act stiffly around each other. Sit over here. Gando, bring tea."

Since he was a being born from Theraze's purpose from the beginning, even while watching Gando head to the tea room, he felt no sense of betrayal.

"Let's see, the blue-haired one must be Rian..."

Uorin sat in a chair with her legs crossed, then looked at Kido and raised one eyebrow as if seeking explanation.

Kido bared his teeth and pointed to himself.

"Kido of Consumption. King of the Goblins."

Kido thought this level of title was only natural when facing Kashan's ruler.

"Hmm, King of the Goblins."

Uorin looked Kido up and down, then pouted her lower lip and said.

"You look really funny."

"..."

Seeing Kido's expression, she burst into giggles and turned to Sirone to ask.

"I thought you'd visit Kazura someday. So, have you shaken off the guilt now?"

"I just told them the truth. Though it caused quite an uproar."

While he spoke about what happened in Kazura, Gando brought the tea.

"I know I did cruel things to them. But I didn't want to leave any room for doubt. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to live my own life."

Uorin said while looking into her teacup.

"How foolish. You didn't kill the prince."

"But he died because of me."

"That's why you're last among the Ivory Tower candidates."

When Sirone's eyes narrowed, Uorin tilted her head toward the ceiling and said.

"Why not just not care about it - guilt and such? Whatever circumstances you were born under, you are you."

"But..."

"Right, it's not easy. That's what emotions do. They complicate everything. Good and evil are just matters of emotion too. That's why those who control emotions control humans."

Uorin lowered her head again.

"There are plenty of psychopaths without emotions in this world. But those who can make cold decisions while embracing their emotions are extremely few. What comes first - humans or truth? That's where you and Nane diverge."

Theraze seemed to know everything humanity knew.

"What kind of person is Nane?"

"First, he's strong. Even if you fought him, I couldn't guarantee the outcome."

It was a more generous assessment than Zuo's.

"But Nane's true talent lies elsewhere. Like you, he moves forward observing everything, but he doesn't judge right from wrong. That's why he's very fast. How fast, you ask..."

Uorin smiled.

"By now, Nane has surpassed you."

It was only 5 seconds since the first evaluation.

"...I see."

He thought he understood what kind of person Nane was.

"Orkamp and Eliza's feelings, your feelings, countless emotions. You always worry in your head and follow the optimal conclusion. But Nane acts first. Whether humans can or cannot do something, whatever extraordinary thing it might be, he tries it first and draws conclusions. Therefore, his realizations are accurate and surprisingly fast. He's just a machine that absorbs truth."

It was a chillingly intense description.

"For example, this: You eliminated Ra Enemy's random numbers as event bubbles, but Nane would have accepted Ra Enemy with those same random numbers."

As silence fell over the competitor's strength that exceeded expectations, Kido pointed at Uorin.

"What about you? Among the three Ivory Tower candidates, who would you vote for?"

Uorin's eyes curved like a seagull's.

"Ahaha, that's a difficult question. In front of the person involved."

"You don't care about such things anyway, do you?"

From just a brief conversation, Kido had grasped that Uorin was on a different level from ordinary humans.

"The stars' votes, you mean? Nane got seventeen votes, Jinseong got nine. And Sirone received just one measly vote. If it were me..."

As Uorin brought her finger to her lips in thought, tension appeared in everyone's eyes.

"I probably would have given a vote to Nane or Jinseong."

A shadow fell across Rian's face.

'So he's still not enough.'

Since it was none other than Mitochondrial Eve's assessment, he couldn't just dismiss it.

"But if I had to bet my entire fortune..."

Anticipation filled Kido's eyes again.

"Obviously Nane. Do you know how much my fortune is worth? It's only natural to bet on the side with the highest probability."

'This woman's a pervert too.'

Uorin scratching her head and sticking out her tongue couldn't have looked more irritating.

Though he didn't show it, Sirone could only bow his head with a gloomy expression.

'That's how strong he is.'

Uorin watched him affectionately and said.

"But... if I had to bet my life?"

She pointed at Sirone.

"Then I would definitely vote for you, Sirone."

Sirone, realizing something, quickly raised his head.

"That's how it is. Others' opinions when they have nothing at stake don't matter at all. Depending on reputation, money, or life, thoughts change countless times. Only you can evaluate your own life."

Something hot surged in Sirone's chest.

"Nane has destructive experience. Jinseong has unwavering integrity. Of course, both are fast. But you have the prudence not to hastily judge right from wrong. So it's okay to be a little slow. That will guide you not to 99 percent, but to 100 percent."

Sirone clenched both fists.

'For perfection.'

"You've just chosen a slightly difficult path. I don't know who cast that one vote for you, but they must have thought the same as me. If they had to bet their life... Only that is real. You have more than enough qualification to become a star."

Rian looked at Sirone, whose eyes were growing moist.

'Kashan's Empress is truly great.'

The people in this world who could comfort Sirone from the heart could be counted on one hand.

Sirone took a deep breath and calmed his mind.

"Thank you, Uorin. I really have confidence now. I'll definitely pass the Ivory Tower test."

"Fufu, of course you should. Do you know who picked you?"

"Huh?"

Saying it outright then acting coy by shaking her head was just Uorin's confidence.

"Never mind. So now getting to the main point, you want to know where Ra Enemy is, right?"

"Ah, right."

That was indeed his business.

"Gando, bring paper and a pen."

While Gando ran the errand, Sirone asked.

"Do you know where Ra Enemy is?"

"No, unfortunately I don't know the exact location. But I can make a rough guess."

"A guess?"

Uorin placed the paper and pen Gando brought on the table and began explaining.

"Ra Enemy's location is important to Kashan too. So as soon as the third reset began, we traced its history. But we got properly fooled. What I grasped was ultimately just Ra Enemy's fake events, not the real thing."

If even the great Uorin was deceived, Sirone catching Ra Enemy could be called a miracle.

"So I used a different method."

"What other method?"

Uorin spun the pen and said.

"I investigated the complete history of every human except Ra Enemy."

Sirone's mouth fell open.

"You investigated... everyone?"

A fist-sized circle was drawn on the blank paper.

"It's not as difficult as you'd imagine. Humans have free will, but biological patterns exist. This is called probability."

She dotted dozens of points inside the circle, then connected them with lines drawn by her pen.

"Some humans spend their entire lives in their hometown, others wander the world. They marry and start families, or their homes fail and they move."

Sirone watched the lines being drawn at tremendous speed.

She seemed to just casually scribble with the pen on paper, and the circle filled with countless lines.

"If this circle represents the world we live in, human movement according to probability becomes this complex. However..."

As the lines continued to fill the circle, they highlighted a particularly white, empty area.

"When you analyze movement patterns in the trillions, regions where probability breaks down inevitably appear."

Uorin put down the pen and crossed her arms.

"Simply put, regions people have entered but never emerged from again. I call this a hole in causality."

A place where once you enter, you can never escape.

"Where is it?"

Uorin held up three fingers and said.

"Jessica. Andre. Pytharos."

At names everyone had heard at least once in their lives, Sirone looked up from the paper.

"Don't tell me?"

"That's right. The World's Three Great Labyrinths. The real Ra Enemy is in one of these places."
