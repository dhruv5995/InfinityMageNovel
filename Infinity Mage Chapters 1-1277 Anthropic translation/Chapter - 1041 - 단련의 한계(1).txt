**Limits of Training (1)**

Oris, who had been staring at Shirone's face for a long while, came to her senses and clasped his hands.

"Oh, right. Thanks. But..." Even with her dynamic vision, nothing remained in her memory.

"How did you do it?"

There was no way to explain the realization of Avatar Destruction following Quantum Movement.

'I shouldn't explain it either.'

Right now, he was Yupi, not Yahweh.

"It's not over yet. This isn't an opponent who can be dealt with so easily, so please get away from here for now."

Oris pouted her lips.

'What? Now he's just ignoring me? That's too much.'

Still, she couldn't argue back because she had directly witnessed Son Yoo-jung's prowess.

"I lost in a head-on fight, so I can't say much, but how about we fight together? If it's me, I could at least serve as bait..."

Just then, the side wall exploded with a bang, and Moornom, who had evolved into a grotesque body, arrived.

"Huuuuu!"

One arm was huge like a fiddler crab's, and his head was stretched long with the back of his skull touching his back.

Shirone realized.

'Super evolution.'

It wasn't simply a mutation applied to the body, but a state where even brain function had evolved.

As if to prove this fact, Moornom grasped the situation with just one glance around.

"Did they fly over there?"

It was an incredibly deep bass voice.

"Moornom, the enemy is stronger than imagined. All seven generals must combine their strength. Especially Yupi's power."

Moornom's single eye focused on Shirone.

"...Is that so?"

The violent temperament he had shown in the barracks was controlled by intelligent eyes.

"If you say so, then it must be royal bloodline. But I am a warrior who has trained for 100 million years. I'm not the type to retreat without even fighting."

Moornom's evolution was based on mutation.

"I broke through a 2.7 percent probability and reached the 4th generation catastrophe. I can kill them."

It would be embarrassing before Crusade if someone other than the seven generals defeated the enemy.

As Moornom looked ahead, Son Yoo-jung was walking toward them, blowing smoke from her mouth.

"You."

Her expression was serious.

"That thing you just did to me, what kind of technique was it?"

The reason the belligerent woman had initiated conversation first wasn't simply because of its strong power.

'The avatar cracked.'

Feeling the weight of Buddha from a mere demon's attack was not something that could happen by mistake.

'It was a strike infused with enlightenment. And that too...'

If it felt like being hit by Nane, it meant the depth of enlightenment was comparable to Buddha's.

Even Son Yoo-jung, with her fearsome abilities, couldn't help but feel uneasy before such enlightenment.

While Shirone remained silent, Moornom approached her.

"Did you kill Crusade?"

He literally had an appearance one might see in hell, but Son Yoo-jung didn't give him more than a second's glance.

The red staff pointed at Shirone.

"Answer me. What's your identity? How do you know the true meaning of breaking..."

Bang!

Moornom's giant fist struck Son Yoo-jung's side, slamming her into the wall.

"Tch. Nothing special."

As he withdrew his fist, Son Yoo-jung was frowning, imprinted like a stamp on the organic wall surface.

"Do you want to die?"

As Son Yoo-jung finally focused on him, the satisfied Moornom rolled his shoulders in circles.

"You're certainly tough. But..."

The air vibrated with a whoosh as Moornom launched his massive body and unleashed a barrage of strikes.

"I'll just keep hitting until you break."

Just as Son Yoo-jung nimbly twisted her waist to approach, her eyes widened.

"Huh?"

As if he had anticipated it, Moornom's fist suddenly changed trajectory and struck her hard.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

As dozens of attacks landed almost simultaneously, her mind became complicated.

'He doesn't seem that fast, so how is he predicting my movements?'

Moornom, who had reached the 4th generation catastrophe through super evolution, had an IQ approaching 1,700.

'I can see it, all the variables. No matter how you move, I will never miss.'

The speed of his barrage increased.

"Kahahaha! Die! I am the strongest demon!"

Oris muttered.

"4th generation catastrophe. He repeatedly evolved with the resolve to die. But with that ability..."

He might be able to defeat Son Yoo-jung.

"No."

Shirone shook his head.

"That level won't be enough."

Indeed, the one whose face was contorting was Moornom, who was repeating the barrage.

"Grrrr!"

Tough?

No, he definitely felt the sensation of hitting flesh.

'Then that means it's a creature made of blood and flesh. But, but why?'

Moornom, who had reached his limit of breath-holding, screamed.

"Why won't you break!"

Oris, realizing that Yupi's words were correct, immediately kicked off the ground and launched her body.

A coordinated attack by two of the seven generals was carried out, but it was Son Yoo-jung who was overwhelming them instead.

"This won't do, you two. You're unqualified."

Son Yoo-jung, who had been brilliantly wielding two clubs, suddenly twisted her waist.

"Die."

Tremendous kinetic energy was generated, time slowed down, and the surrounding buildings curved outward.

'Huh?'

Oris pursed her lips.

'I can see it this time?'

The red club was approaching along space as if splitting into multiple pieces.

In the seesaw of time, she couldn't move even a fingertip, and neither could Moornom.

'I can't dodge.'

His IQ of 1,700 analyzed the current situation with cruel clarity.

'It's over.'

They would die, and neither Oris, Moornom, nor even Son Yoo-jung doubted this fact.

A clear future.

And Shirone cast Miracle Stream on that law-like frozen event.

Hand of God - Hand Technique.

The moment the hand of light swept up Oris and Moornom, the seesaw of time was released.

Kwaaaaang!

Buildings within a radius of dozens of meters were blown away, but the seven generals were not included.

Son Yoo-jung, who blew bitter smoke from her mouth, glared ahead over her shoulder.

"What's this now?"

The feeling that a specific event had disappeared.

But since it was impossible, making it seem like it had disappeared was probably the answer.

'That's possible? At the level of law?'

A shiver ran through her, but the bizarreness beyond normal range actually made her thoughts cold.

'Buddha wouldn't do such a thing.'

Because it's not truth.

'But I absolutely don't think his enlightenment is lesser than Buddha's. Then...'

A god?

Shortly after, the hand of light that had set down Oris and Moornom bleached white and evaporated.

"Huh? What?"

Oris looked around, and Moornom opened his mouth with a dazed expression.

I don't know how his IQ of 1,700 analyzed it, but he never opened his mouth in the end.

Shirone blocked their path.

'This is the limit.'

If Son Yoo-jung activated Hwaan Geumjeong, even Yahweh's identity would be exposed.

"I'll handle the intruder. You two generals go to Itaca and receive new strategy."

Power entered Moornom's single eye.

"Don't talk nonsense. We are demons. Don't you know what it means to run away leaving the enemy behind?"

Shirone was not a demon.

"Hmph, royals are always like that. Itaca too. Always calculating efficiency like humans..."

"Moornom."

Shirone said coldly.

"Go."

Probably 90 percent Yahweh - Oris trembled at the feeling of being pierced by his gaze.

'For me, one of the seven generals, to be scared.'

On the other hand, a sweet and strange emotion she had never experienced in her lifetime enveloped her entire body.

'I... that demon...'

Of course, if this energy amplified to 100 percent, affection would turn to hatred.

Oris grabbed Moornom's arm.

"Let's go. It's better to leave it to Yupi for now. Itaca will think the same."

"Grr!"

Eventually, Moornom, who bent his will, left the place, and Oris looked back at Shirone.

"Be careful, Yupi."

Faced with the expression of a cat expecting a gentle touch, Shirone felt heavy-hearted.

'I shouldn't have chosen the name Yupi.'

It wasn't meant to mock them.

"I'll be right there."

Oris, whose face brightened at Shirone's smile, nodded and launched her body.

Son Yoo-jung asked.

"Will you tell me now?"

The reason she had just watched until now was being told by the look in Shirone's eyes as he slowly turned around.

"Huhu, now you're finally showing your true colors."

They were clear eyes that seemed like they would cleanse one's heart just by looking into them.

"...Did Nane send you?"

"Hmm."

Son Yoo-jung, who felt like she was talking with Buddha, stroked her chin and fell into thought.

'I really don't know. Since he's not reciting Gingoju, he doesn't seem to match Buddha.'

Shirone knew Gingoju, but to be effective, he would need to become 100 percent Yahweh.

"Go back and tell Nane. I'm busy enough as it is, so handle annoying baggage yourself."

Son Yoo-jung's eyebrows twitched.

"Fine, whatever. From now on I can just ask the staff directly. Are you ready to fight?"

"Let's change locations."

Preferably somewhere without Oris.

"Location?"

Son Yoo-jung, who had lowered her center of gravity, shot her body like an arrow, heated like molten metal.

"Kekeke! Why should I care about such things?"

'What a damn hothead.'

Shirone, who wrinkled his nose bridge, activated 93 percent Yahweh and struck upward at her.

Kurrrrrrung!

The city shook and huge dust clouds rose to the sky.

Lete slammed the table.

"Whatever Yahweh's essence is, the Ministry of Fire's position remains unchanged. The Grand Duke is making a big mistake right now."

"What do you mean..."

Lete, tired of the hamster wheel-like situation, rose coldly.

"If the Grand Duke doesn't know shame, I'll do the same to you. I'll wait here. Whether it's one year or a hundred years, the Grand Duke's lies will be exposed."

"I am a demon who prefers quiet research."

Lete smiled coldly.

"Are you finally getting scared? The fact that it wasn't caught by the informants means Lian is still in the laboratory."

As Lete carelessly examined the laboratory equipment, Magritt quietly warned.

"It's sensitive machinery."

"Then talk! Don't make me shame the Grand Duke!"

"I'm not deceiving anyone. I understand your feelings, boss, but this is a waste of time."

"Hmph!"

Lete approached Mercedes.

"Tell me honestly, Mercedes. Have you ever seen Yahweh or Lian in this laboratory?"

"N-no. There isn't anyone."

Magritt's eyes narrowed.

If it were the Grand Duke's mind, he could resist Lete, but Mercedes wouldn't be able to endure it.

"Don't worry. I'll make sure no harm comes to you. Just say one word."

"No. I haven't seen them."

Mercedes looked almost ready to cry.

"You know. Don't you? Come on, don't turn your head away and look at me. Look into my eyes."

The succubus, hit directly by Lete's gaze, felt terror as if her mind would fly away.

'Huh? Huhhuh?'

No matter how much a child tries to make excuses, they ultimately cannot deceive their mother's eyes.

'At this rate, I'll be caught.'

Mercedes, realizing that signals of lies were appearing in her pupils, made a decision.

"Lete-nim."

She smiled faintly.

"It's really true."

Just as Lete, who had read the look in her eyes, was about to scream, Mercedes' head exploded.

"Ah...!"

Lete, whose body swayed back and forth from the mental shock, stared blankly at the faceless corpse.

"Me, Mercedes."

The memories of laughing and chatting with her passed through her mind without missing a single scene.

Magritt approached.

"Please go back now. I need to clean up the laboratory. I'll send word separately."

Lete turned her head with force in her eyes.

"Grand Duke, just because you do this doesn't mean I'll..."

"Would you like me to ask you as well?"

Though the Grand Duke wouldn't make the same choice, his words infinitely increased Lete's guilt.

'I'm sorry, Mercedes.'

Just like Gaia in the real world, to Lete, all demons had equal value.

"This is the last time. When I come looking again next time, I absolutely won't back down."

To not make Mercedes' resolve meaningless, Lete promised a future meeting.

As the laboratory door closed, Magritt took the faceless corpse's hand and kissed the back of it.

"Rest in peace."
