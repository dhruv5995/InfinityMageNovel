**Friend or Foe Identification (3)**

After finishing lunch, Shirone walked through the corridors of Delta Headquarters, lost in thought.

'I'm a bit anxious.'

It wasn't that he doubted Ikael and Ashur's abilities, but this was a matter on which humanity's future hung.

'I have no choice but to trust and leave it to them. Now I need to work out a full-scale strategy with Tormia.'

Just as he was anticipating the Wizard's arrival, Satiel approached from the end of the corridor.

"Shirone."

Their relationship was awkward.

"Where is Ikael?"

Shirone kept his mouth shut, but Satiel had already guessed there would be no answer.

"You know this too. Ikael and I have issues to resolve. If you tell me where Ikael is, I won't lay a hand on you. I might even help you."

"Why?"

Shirone asked.

"Is it because you still have some lingering affection for me? Or is it because you've already killed me once?"

Strength entered Satiel's eyes.

"Say whatever you want. I don't regret my decision. Even if I went back, I'd do the same thing."

"I know it couldn't be helped."

Though her expression didn't change, she couldn't stop her halo from wavering.

"The only archangel who sided with the Gaians. When Guffin chose Ikael, your sense of betrayal was..."

"What are you trying to say?"

"Because it can't be undone, one mistake leads everything to ruin. But now it can be undone. I'm alive like this right now."

"It can't be undone. Even so, the fact that I drove you to death doesn't change."

"I won't resent you."

Satiel bit her lip.

"So can't we start over from the beginning? A child's death must have been great pain for Ikael, but now I'm by her side. It can be reversed."

The air vibrated.

Satiel's vibration was a sound wave that felt both reverent and supernatural.

'It can be reversed?'

It would be a lie to say she wasn't shaken by Shirone's words, but she had come too far.

'The road back would be just as long.'

She was exhausted, and what moved her now was a will that had petrified even her anger, hardening it like a mission.

'Guffin.'

If it could be reversed.

'Even so, Guffin won't come back. She took everything. Ikael stole everything that was mine.'

Shirone called out with force.

"Satiel."

That voice seeped into her halo like thunder, and Satiel furrowed her brow.

"What do you want me to..."

At that moment, the 2nd-tier Mara Gallio appeared beside Satiel.

"I found Ikael!"

His eyes, which possessed an extreme-grade analysis vision, were spinning like whirlpools.

"You found her?"

Even as Satiel hurriedly turned to him, Shirone couldn't understand the situation.

'How?'

The fact that Gallio had located her position meant Ashur's signal had been broken.

"Ikael!"

Venom filled Satiel's expression again, and without time to stop her, she broke through the window and flew away.

'Simultaneous events...'

Shirone, who had been about to go there using Amy's cognition, bit his lip.

"Gah!"

Due to the characteristic that two people cannot exist in the same space, their signals were colliding.

"Blitz!"

The moment he shouted, the Thunder Dragon Blitz appeared before him, kneeling while generating lightning.

"You called, Messiah?"

"Right now..."

Just as Shirone was about to give his orders, he saw hundreds of flashes of light shooting up outside the window.

They were lower-tier angels.

"Follow me."

The moment Shirone threw himself out the window, the twelve apostles followed behind him.

Aruta and Amy weren't moving, but they had already exchanged countless combinations.

'Here it comes.'

The virtual Aruta threw a straight punch, and Amy twisted her body attempting a counterattack.

'Failed.'

Amy's head exploded.

In over thousands of simulations, the number of times she had successfully counterattacked was zero.

'I can't win.'

If it was Uriel's 2nd-tier Mara, it would naturally be far from weak, but his strike transcended the category of Mara.

'I'll die.'

She hastily grabbed hold of her wavering spirit.

The reason Aruta couldn't attack was because Amy still held the possibility of counterattack.

'The moment I waver, it's over.'

Only a tense balance without even a speck of error was the sole path extending her life.

'There's no way to avoid his strike by any method. His aura is so powerful it gives me that certainty.'

Cold sweat dripped steadily.

"Huuu."

Even as she barely suppressed the tears that threatened to burst forth, time continued to flow.

In that gradually weakening spirit, Aruta discovered Amy's opening.

'There it is.'

The insight born from his lifelong understanding of nothingness guided his body.

'This ends it.'

As Aruta kicked off the ground and charged, Amy felt her consciousness fading.

"Ahhh..."

Her mind went blank white, and an unavoidable strike approached before her eyes.

Because there was no thought, even if she died like this, she wouldn't even be able to recall the word "death."

'Therefore...'

She was no different from already being dead, and Aruta's strike contained that meaning.

At the boundary of emptiness where the world returned to nothingness, Amy heard a voice that wasn't her own.

Mahaprajna.

It was the Buddhist sutra that Nane had recited beside her when she first opened the Fire Realm and lost consciousness.

Her consciousness opened and fire entered her red eyes.

'Immortal Function.'

In a state where she had forgotten even her own existence, she naturally became fire itself.

Aruta's fist had reached right before her nose, but distance no longer mattered.

'Ignition.'

Crimson flames wrapped around Aruta's arm, entering his mouth and burning his internal organs.

"Graaaah!"

Before he could even feel pain, his body evaporated and a massive whirlpool of fire ignited in that spot.

'Aaaaah!'

Amy shed tears of overwhelming emotion.

'So this was it.'

She understood Shirone's heart, and perfectly grasped the meaning Nane had tried to convey.

'Burn everything.'

The flames that had scorched a vast radius spread explosively before disappearing without a trace.

At the center, a beautiful female form transformed entirely into fire sat with her eyes gently closed.

Realizing Aruta's annihilation, Uriel slowly lowered the foot he had been aiming at Ikael.

"Rise."

Though he hadn't withdrawn his killing intent, Ikael carefully raised her body.

"I thought I had thought beyond the point where I could think no more... but it seems I was mistaken."

"Uriel, that is the heart."

Ikael said.

"Thoughts are merely thoughts. All angels think according to the laws of the universe. But you didn't follow Satiel."

This was why Ikael had placed her hopes in him.

"Because you have a heart. You can change something with your will. You came to me knowing this, didn't you?"

"Yes. To annihilate you."

"That anger is also heart. But you're hesitating. That means you haven't thrown your heart away."

Guffin had taught her this.

"When you can throw away everything, you will find your path. Until then, don't..."

A resounding sound came from the sky.

"Ikael!"

Satiel, leading countless angels in flight, was plummeting at a terrifying speed.

"I'll kill you!"

The moment she landed, she shot forward and raised her fist, prompting Uriel to draw his Gokrakgon.

"What..."

Though Satiel hit the brakes at the unexpected situation, her fist still crashed into the Gokrakgon.

A tremendous sound erupted, and a powerful shockwave centered on the two angels swept across the ground.

Satiel's eyes widened.

"What the hell are you doing?"

"...Ikael was in conversation with me."

"I asked what the hell you're doing. I'm the Archangel now. If you don't obey my command, I'll consider you a traitor too."

Uriel looked up at the sky.

Hundreds of lower-tier angels were preparing to bombard with their Judicial Halos activated.

Looking forward again, he said.

"So be it."

"You..."

As Satiel spread her Judicial Halo, Uriel's halo also expanded into rings of light.

Light rotated between the two clashing figures, sending out another powerful shockwave.

Satiel was blown away, and Uriel swung his Gokrakgon, casting Ragnarok.

"Is this the only way to satisfy you?"

Even as lightning crackled, Satiel gave orders without thinking to defend.

"Kill Ikael!"

KRRRRRRRR!

White lightning shot up above Satiel's head, and hundreds of angels bombarded the ground.

A battle of angels unfolded.

The ground shook from collisions of concepts far more advanced than those of humans or Mara.

The twelve apostles flying through the sky at tremendous speed shouted to Shirone at the front.

"Messiah!"

"Right."

Shirone, confirming with his eyes, grimaced.

The angels' battlefield resembled a disaster that might occur somewhere in the universe.

"I'll handle this. First check on the Wizard's life and death. And if possible..."

Ikael and Amy too.

"Understood."

Blitz, understanding the Messiah's intent, bowed his head, and the remaining apostles scattered in all directions.

Meanwhile, Ikael was surrounded by hundreds of angels, blocking their attacks.

"Revered Ikael."

Though not the Archangel, the fact that Ikael was the source of all angels remained unchanged.

"Why do you abandon us?"

Zariél, the angel of form, used an infinite hexahedron to bind both her feet.

The binding force containing the concept of spatial kalpa was so strong that no physical force could break it, but.

"Transcendence."

Her body, with Ataraxia opened, was a concept that inevitably surpassed any limitation.

Destroying the shackles, she took one step forward and stretched out her slender arm.

Her fist stopped firmly in front of Zariél, and angels charged from all directions.

Zariél said.

"Strike me."

Seeing his halo prepared for annihilation, Ikael felt her heart tearing.

'Those who have lost their source.'

In the sight of angels charging toward her with those eyes of emptiness and void.

'It's because of me.'

Ikael hesitated.

'No, this won't do. I've already resolved myself. I will fight for Shirone.'

The thought was instantaneous, but the angels' attacks pressed her at a much faster speed.

Shirone rushed at near light speed.

"Ikael!"

In a landscape where everything seemed frozen as if time had stopped, a single flame bloomed.

'What?'

The moment he realized it, Amy arrived in front of Ikael, her red eyes blazing crimson.

'Red Jewel.'

A sphere of fire huge as the sun was born, dominating the entire radius where the angels stood.

"Gah!"

Shirone, shielding himself with Hand of God, showed an expression of dismay at the tremendous heat.

"Amy?"

The flame's form was definitely Amy, but it was a realm of completely different dimension from what he knew.

'It's not phenomenal fire. This is an idea.'

Handling fire signals freely meant that she too had mastered Avatar techniques...

The sphere of fire disappeared, and Amy, having regained human form, turned to Ikael.

"Are you alright?"

Unable to answer, Ikael stared blankly ahead.

"Grrrr..."

Countless lower-tier angels caught in the flames sat collapsed on the ground, their wings of light melted away.
