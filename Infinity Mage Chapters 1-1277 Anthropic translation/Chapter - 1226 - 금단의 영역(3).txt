Forbidden Territory (3)

"Shing."

Taesung called out, but Shing showed no reaction.

"This is your last chance. Soon..."

"I know."

Just as Taesung forced out those words, the door split in two and fell apart.

Baal, First Corps Commander of Hell's Army, entered.

"What a delightful sight."

Eumji and Yangji frowned at his brazen entrance after destroying the door.

'How?'

This was the same door that even Laska from the Human Safety Enforcement Bureau had risked his life to bypass the self-destruct circuit.

Yangji gritted her teeth.

"He cut through the laws. He's become too strong."

Even Eumji thought that in the physical realm, Baal might now overwhelm even Satan himself.

Baal approached.

"Now my blade can cut the world itself. Thanks to the humans. That's why this ending feels rather disappointing."

He too could sense that Taesung and Shing's laws were perfectly intertwined, rendering them immobile.

"Taesung. Star of Wisdom."

Even as he watched Baal approach, Taesung couldn't move a single fingertip.

Shing bit her lip.

'Please...'

In this gamble staking humanity's final moment, there was no room for variables to interfere.

'Please, someone convince me.'

In this moment, she who possessed the world's strongest willpower wished for the first time in her life to be persuaded.

But since no such person could exist, she ultimately couldn't release her restraints.

Baal raised his sword.

"Evil's victory."

At that moment, the floor bulged upward and a soft, slime-like figure burst forth.

Taesung's eyes filled with intensity.

'Mimoon!'

A 1-star satellite of the Human Safety Enforcement Bureau, a shapeshifter capable of liquefying her body.

Unlike Shirone who was fighting demons, she had climbed the tower slowly but steadily in a straight line.

'I'll take his head.'

Mimoon's leg, transformed into a blade, moved but caught only empty air.

"What...?"

Before she could grasp the situation, light streaked diagonally along her body.

"No!"

Taesung screamed as her body, split in two, writhed in different spaces.

"Graaah!"

Though she endured by liquefying her body, Baal's strike was on a completely different level from anything she'd experienced before.

'It won't regenerate. He cut my ability itself. At this rate, I'll become a single-celled organism.'

She could maintain her brain cells for only a few more minutes.

"Don't worry."

Baal approached with his sword raised.

"I'm not one for bad taste."

As Mimoon's head fell cleanly, Taesung bit his lip and shed tears.

"Hmph, is this humanity's final struggle?"

As Baal wiped his sword clean and stepped toward Taesung, Shing's expression went blank.

"Huh?"

Mimoon's viscous matter was rising again, and Baal, realizing from her expression, twisted his body.

"Really persistent... Gah!"

The viscous matter struck at tremendous speed, sending Baal's body crashing into the opposite wall.

"Grgh!"

An impact too much even for the strongest demon to handle.

"You..."

Clutching his throbbing chest, Baal glared at the writhing viscous matter.

"You're not human."

The viscous matter gradually took shape, revealing not Mimoon but a man.

Taesung gasped in surprise.

"Argoneth."

The Father of Life, another Administrator.

---

The Elven Forest.

Green Ocean was shrouded in darkness by the black dragon Abyris's breath.

'Still holding out, I see?'

The white dragon Asraiker sensed Uriel approaching from beyond the abyss.

"...Wouldn't it be better to rest? Fighting within the shadow of the abyss is meaningless."

Uriel didn't stop walking.

Having taken three consecutive breath attacks from fire, black, and white dragons, his condition wasn't great.

"I will destroy."

But his anger was proportionally greater.

"At the end of this war."

Uriel's movement suddenly stopped.

"Do you truly believe there's victory at the end?"

He didn't know what action he was taking, but it was probably terrible destruction.

"God has denied the angels. Even if Ikael enforced it, there's no reason to follow now."

"This is my fight."

"Hehe."

Asraiker's eyes grew distant.

"A fight, you say. Come to think of it, I've fought you for so very long. Now I think I understand a little."

"Understand what?"

"Well, you're the most human, perhaps?"

"Eight Archangels born from the first concepts. But you're the only one who doesn't follow your source concept."

"Me?"

"Ikael is certainly the head of the White Order, but that's only conceptual superiority. You're the only Archangel with the power to annihilate other Archangels."

Uriel didn't object.

"How simple must be the thoughts of one who can destroy everything? Yet you're burdened with all sorts of worries. Probably because there's something you cannot destroy."

"Are you speaking of Ikael?"

"No."

Asraiker spoke with deep eyes.

"Longing."

---

Terrible screams echoed from the fairy laboratory where Crown resided.

"Kyaaaah!"

Then silence.

"Hmm."

The elf woman captured during the day stood before a mirror with a doll-like, emotionless expression.

Even the reflection fairy who made the mirror trembled, unable to believe the current situation.

"Is this..."

As her voice cracked, she cleared her throat.

"Is this me?"

She awkwardly examined her body, her solemn tone incongruous with her beautiful appearance.

The elf man captured with her asked:

"Who... are you?"

Slowly turning around, she spoke:

"Crown."

Though he'd suspected, hearing it from her lips brought tears flowing.

'I'm sorry I couldn't protect you, Erin.'

On the surface, it was a simple experiment.

Just drill a small hole in the elf's skull and transplant Crown's brain.

The reason this experiment, impossible even with human technology, succeeded was entirely due to Crown's ability.

"Not bad."

Erin, who had been alternately examining her hands, spoke with satisfaction.

"Becoming an elf, that is."

"You horrible creature! Do you know what you've done? You've denied the natural order... Urgh!"

When a nearby fairy activated a binding ability, Crown—no, now Erin—raised her hand.

"Enough. Release him."

"But Crown-sama, this one is—"

"I want to try an experiment."

Though her body had changed, she remained a king, so the fairy complied.

The freed elf stood and said:

"Give Erin back."

"If that's your wish, I'll consider it. But only if you defeat me."

"What?"

"Don't you understand? There's only one reason to transcend species barriers, isn't there? To become a superior being. If I'm weaker than when I was a fairy, then elven intelligence and physicality are useless."

"Fine. I'll beat you at anything."

Saving Erin was important, but he couldn't tolerate species disparagement during wartime.

"I'll accommodate you. Choose your weapon."

"Bow."

At Erin's instruction, a fairy brought a bow.

"The method is simple. Hit any part of my body with even one shot and you win. You can't aim for the head anyway."

Hitting the head would kill Erin too.

"...Fine."

The distance was only 4 meters.

With the man's skill, he could hit even a fly at this distance, let alone an elf.

'The shoulder...'

He focused on Erin's right shoulder.

'I won't aim there.'

Placing three arrows on the string simultaneously, he shot straight for Erin's forehead.

'Forgive me.'

This was the only chance to kill Crown.

'Wind Art: Aruore.'

The wind spirit-blessed arrows shot forth at Mach speed, followed by a delayed sonic boom.

"Crown-sama!"

The fairies cried out in alarm, but the situation was already over—though not as they expected.

"What?"

Erin stood at the tent entrance, having torn the elf's head from his neck.

"If it's this easy, there's no value in experimenting."

"Gurgle... gurgle..."

The elf man gasped.

More than fear of death, the terror of his species' extinction was far greater.

'This thing is neither fairy nor elf.'

It's a monster.

'Wind magic Aios. Even the most basic magic transcended elven limits.'

More than the elven fairy Enoch... no, even angels couldn't subdue Crown.

The biggest problem was that his body belonged to Erin, whom the elves cherished and loved.

'This thing isn't Erin. I mustn't be deceived.'

If the elves, unaware of the truth, accepted Crown into their stronghold, it would mean total annihilation.

"E-Enoch... -sama."

Unable even to cry out his final words, he died shedding bloody tears.

"Tsk."

Throwing aside the head, Erin made a disgusted expression.

"Too fast is also annoying. I intended to dodge barely, but it was so boring I just killed him."

The fairies didn't dare even breathe.

"Anyway, the implant was successful. Incomparable to a beast's body. Even superior to humans."

The highest-grade body obtainable on this planet.

"C-congratulations on your success."

"Heh."

Remove part of the pineal gland between the elf's left and right brain and implant Crown's brain.

Normally, biological self-preservation instincts would cause the immune system to go into shock...

"I am capable."

Crown, born with the essence of 'supremacy,' instantly controlled the implant subject's system.

Crown called this state 'boarding.'

"...Curious."

Erin's eyes deepened.

"Is this life?"

No one had ever viewed life from outside life before.

What exactly had he seen?

The curious fairies listened intently, but he was absorbed in his own thoughts.

"Well, fine. I'll ride this body for a while, until a stronger body appears."

"Um, Crown-sama. What shall we do with this body?"

Crown's corpse lay intact on the table tray, skull opened.

The fairies couldn't even approach.

Crown's gaze was cold as he looked at the body that had been his just 10 minutes ago.

'What defines me.'

Body? Mind? Thoughts? Memories?

'Even that is thinking I can do only because I am me. If I'm no longer me, even such things...'

Are meaningless.

'What defines me is.'

Only the specific concept that I am me, the idea descending from that transcendent place.

'It was the missing link.'

The moment I board myself, the idea goes missing, but Crown sees clearly.

'Therefore I am...'

The Illuminati

Crown grasped the corpse on the table, put the torso in his mouth, and bit it off with his teeth.

"Hiiik!"

Crunch crunch

As bone-grinding sounds echoed from his mouth while the fairies trembled, he muttered:

"This is not me."

Now it was merely an energy source needed for feeding.

"Stand by until I give orders. We're going to the elven stronghold."

"What do you intend?"

And if the reason for feeding was for reproduction...

"Domination."

Crown spread both arms.

"I will become king. My offspring shall prosper on this land and rule from behind humanity's throne."

It was the moment the world's master changed.
