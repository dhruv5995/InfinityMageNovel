The Weight of Existence (2)

Just before losing consciousness, Maya saw a trail of light streak across her retina.

'Am I dead?'

That thought was brief—when she felt the weight of her body, she hastily regained her senses.

"Shirone?"

Perhaps that's what it was?

But when her vision returned, Caden stood before her.

"Are you okay?"

Though his tone was as gentle as always, Maya instinctively sensed that something had changed.

"Yeah. I'm... sorry."

Caden simply smiled, then erased his expression and walked toward Constantine.

"Why did you try to kill Maya?"

"Grraaah!"

Both arms had been severed, but there was no bleeding thanks to divine power.

'It's nothing.'

He didn't even mind the pain.

'Because God exists.'

Evidence of the outer world rendered all values in reality meaningless.

"I don't even fear death." Using his life as fuel, Constantine drew upon divine power, and golden shields arranged in double rows materialized before him.

"God's Army."

The ability of the Pope, who within the Lamie Church was said to be the only one capable of opposing Satan.

Of course, Havitz had ignored it, but Constantine's achievements in the Demon War were legendary.

"Come, heretic."

Caden didn't move.

As if standing before a loaded bow, tension could be felt from within the shield of light.

'Probably... something like spears.'

Caden's intuition was correct.

The moment he entered the radius, spears of light would shoot out between the shields to create a honeycomb of death.

That was the ability of Lamie Church's strongest warrior.

Caden spoke.

"You were once respected by the world. Even now, go back and receive treatment."

Constantine's eyes softened with kindness.

"Hehe. Young man."

Then immediately his eyes filled with madness as he gritted his teeth and took a step forward.

"There is no home for me here."

Countless spears of light shot out from between the shields at tremendous speed.

And Caden moved before those spears could advance even 10 centimeters.

Demon Sword Technique

Lightning Bone (Wandering Flash).

Light flashed.

The flash was so fast and light that it bent at dozens of acute angles as if lost.

"Gasp!"

When it finally reached its destination, an art of golden lines was spread across the stage.

"I'm sorry."

I didn't want to send you off like this.

"The sword was too light."

Constantine's spear had extended only 13.7 centimeters.

"Grrk..."

Red blood seeped from Constantine's body as it separated into dozens of pieces and fell.

The thoughts of officials from each nation were the same.

'What kind of monster is that?'

The prophecy of the future was wrong, and another formidable enemy that kingdoms would struggle to face had appeared.

"Let's go back."

Albino rose from his seat.

"That was a decent finale."

Wasn't that an ending perfectly suited for humanity's apocalypse?

As those who had been watching the situation while holding their breath left their seats, Reina looked back into the darkness.

'Rai.'

Thanks to Caden, there had been no major incident, but her younger brother was still protecting her.

'The wound must be deep.'

Since Reina had once learned swordsmanship herself, she could estimate the degree of shock Rai had received.

'Just remember this. Whether you're excellent or not, we're family.'

That was what it meant to be an Ogent.

As Reina left the annex out of consideration for her brother, Rai also quietly disappeared into the darkness.

'Flash.'

Such a level existed too.

'Cut the fastest. Cut the most secretly. Cut the most powerfully. The most, the most, the most.'

When everyone was devoted to one path, what exactly had he been doing?

'Damn.'

Perhaps... he thought he might be the only true shame of the Ogent family.

Meanwhile, Caden, who had come down from the stage, walked toward Maya, who had taken refuge in the audience area.

"Maya."

Just like when he had saved her from the demon Miyo, Maya could guess what Caden was going to say.

"I love you."

Maya answered with words she had prepared.

"Sorry. As I said before, I'm not ready yet..."

"I'm sincere."

Maya lifted her head.

"I won't run away anymore. If you can't accept me, I'll bury it in my heart. It will be hard and difficult to endure, but I'll live bearing it all myself."

"Caden..."

For the first time, his words struck her heart.

'He's giving everything.'

As Caden approached, Maya's mind became as frantic as her rapidly beating heart.

'What should I do?'

She too had reached the point where she needed to make a choice.

'Is this okay?'

Things like being Shirone's substitute or being indebted to her life savior would only leave wounds for both of them.

"I..."

The moment she uttered the first word, all the memories from the day she met Caden until now...

'Shirone.'

...gave her certainty.

'Thank you.'

As Maya, finally able to smile, closed her eyes, Caden kissed her.

El Kiana, who had been sitting on the stage, looked haggard.

"You're all having quite the fun."

But that too was brief—soon she smiled and cast a wistful gaze.

"Yes, love is good."

Does fate... truly exist?

Caden had overcome the fate of the Red Cross and achieved what he wanted for the first time, but...

Whether his escape was from sincere feelings or simply because the law had changed.

We are still lost children of the universe, and the one holding that answer...

"Beep beep beep beep beep!"

Only God.

"Beep beep! Beep! Beep beep! Beep beep beep beep beep!"

Right after Constantine died, Kitra knelt in the corridor making strange sounds.

"Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!"

Calculation impossible! Calculation impossible! Calculation impossible! Calculation impossible!

No matter how many imaginary functions he input, it was a contradiction that couldn't produce the desired result.

"Beep beep"

He searched the infinite universe.

In minus time, the birth and death of the universe was but an instant, so calculation time was zero.

"Beep beep beep beep."

The probability of this universe's end result was transmitted to Kitra's mind.

99.9999999999...percent.

"Beep..."

The sound stopped briefly.

If he were human, he would trust the overwhelming odds and push forward, but...

"Beep. Beep."

God has no heart, so he cannot believe.

No matter how many times he repeated the same calculation, when 100 percent didn't appear, the route split in two.

1. Repeat calculations under the current system until 100 percent appears.

2. Change the system through learning.

These were the two conditions for reaching the concept of perfection.

Execute.

Blue electricity flashed in Kitra's eyes as he calculated both cases simultaneously.

"Beep beep beep beep!"

Was this God's scream, or simply a system warning sound?

"Beep beep beep beep!"

What was certain was that the god of the outer world seemed unable to put heart into sound.

Green Ocean.

As the Twelve Apostles and Archangels engaged in fierce battle, the tide of war tilted rapidly.

Blitz's eyes flashed.

'We're winning.'

With the fairy population dropping to less than half, it was the moment when the small elite forces shone.

'The power asymmetry is intensifying. At this rate, the fairies will soon be extinct.'

The small creatures that had enforced Heaven's laws would only appear in fairy tales in the future.

And at the same time.

The elf hideout was in a state of devastation.

"Fight! That's not Erin!"

Crown, who had 'boarded' Erin's body, was killing almost one elf per second.

"Haha."

Erin laughed coldly.

"This is too easy?"

Enox, the leader of the elves, asked.

"Who are you?"

"Don't you know?"

Crown approached with both arms spread.

"It's me, Erin."

Enox grimaced, but his legs remained planted on the ground, unmoving.

'Victory isn't important.'

It was a fight of who would go extinct first.

"Protea."

Enox spoke to the chief of the Fire Tribe.

"Take as many as you can and run. Even one more survivor means there's a future."

Now only dozens of elves and Fire Tribe members remained.

'With uselessly long lifespans.' What had they been doing during all that time instead of thinking about reproduction?

'Singing songs, praising nature, having discussions.'

Enox realized.

'Is that it?'

Humans' futilely short lifespans, strong sexual desire, insatiable greed...

'I sometimes thought them pathetic, but.'

From a species perspective, it was the strength to maintain and develop the race through countless crises.

"Protea."

Enox gripped his sword and shouted.

"Go!"

At his forceful cry, Protea surrendered to extreme passivity and shouted.

"Follow me!"

Simultaneously, Enox charged at Erin.

"Estacion!"

Thousands of sharp winds swept everywhere, and fresh blood spurted from Enox's neck.

"I told you it won't work."

Erin, now standing far away, wiped the blood from her sword and pursued the Fire Tribe.

Looking up at the sky, Enox thought.

'Strong.'

He vaguely sensed it was Crown, but it felt neither like an elf nor a fairy.

'A third species.'

He had no regrets.

'It's natural for the strong species to survive.'

With a thud, as his upper body collapsed, red blood began to spread quickly yet slowly.

'Yahweh.'

At the last moment of life, what remained was...

'Save the Fire Tribe.' Only faith.

Crown, having extinguished the elves, wiped the blood from his cheek.

'Is it a draw?'

The fairies were probably extinct by now too, but he was no longer a fairy anyway.

"You're the last one."

Crown approached Protea.

"Since this is also a historic moment, I'll let you say something. Speak your species' last words."

"...You've made a grave mistake. The Fire Tribe is this world's only hope. You'll surely regret this."

"I'll record that."

With one sword stroke, Protea's head fell.

"As the death throes of an extinct creature."

Thus the species war ended, leaving neither elves nor fairies, but a third humanity.

"I am superior."

What Crown wanted was to control humanity from the highest place in the human world.

'That is the Illuminati's destiny.'

The role of a control tower maintaining balance between God and humans.

"I should go to the Holy See."

He didn't know that only about an hour remained until humanity's end.

Indeed, when he found out, would Crown side with God or with humans?

"I will be the one to rule the world."

Though perfection had been broken by the escape, God's odds were still 99.99 percent.

Son Yu-jeong, who had opened the path for Lethe, sat blankly in the wasteland, unmoving.

Her hair had turned white from the choice that would determine the universe's fate.

"Yu-jeong."

Mortasinger placed a hand on her shoulder.

"You made the right choice. Yahweh said it—everyone has righteousness in their heart."

"No."

Son Yu-jeong shook her head.

"It wasn't righteousness. I couldn't handle it. The fact that the universe would disappear because of my choice—I couldn't decide. So, so I passed it to Yahweh."

"Yu-jeong..."

Son Yu-jeong turned her head, sobbing.

"How can I endure this?"

When she had to make the choice, she realized what Shirone had been carrying.

"The weight of all existence, something that can't be taken responsibility for even with death—how can Yahweh endure it all?"

What does one take responsibility with?
