[691] God's Eyes (3)

The Kashan Empire.

Uorin awoke in a secret room of the imperial palace Aganos that no one except her closest confidants knew about.

Feeling the cool sensation of the water bed, she turned her head to see Gando—biologically a stranger but mentally her son—reading a book.

"Have you awakened?"

When Gando brought water and offered her the cup, Uorin stretched.

"How long has it been?"

"Approximately..."

Gando regretted saying "approximately."

"One hour and forty-two minutes have passed."

"Hmm, quite a while."

After drinking the water, Uorin put on her slippers, got down, and walked past Gando.

"You've been going in frequently lately."

Recently, Uorin had been spending time in the Under Coder.

"It's fun. Getting stronger is fast too."

The program she linked to was a virtual reality world called "High Gear" created by professional coders.

It was one of the most popular paid content in Under Coder. You could enter by taking a Dream Star exclusively for High Gear code, with each pill costing over 2 million gold.

There, you could freely modify your body, and there were even cyborgs who had completed 100% mechanization.

"Is changing your body fun?"

Having never encountered Under Coder, Gando felt a sadistic sensation first when thinking about body modification.

"You get stronger as much as you modify. It's a kind of competitive psychology."

Uorin pointed to her ear and grumbled.

"I need to upgrade my infrasonic detection function. Those coming in stealth mode are incredibly annoying."

She wanted to buy it with real-world gold, but High Gear's operators strictly cracked down on cash transactions.

"Well, if I could buy everything with money, I might get bored quickly, right?"

Seeing her truly absorbed appearance, Gando asked worriedly.

"...What do you do there?"

"Just, you know, meet people and chat, share items and modification information, fight with opposing factions, stuff like that."

Uorin said as if suddenly remembering.

"Right, I leveled up this time! Level 260. In other words, I can equip Magnan."

Gando didn't know what Magnan was.

"Is that so?"

"Still, it'll be hard to get into the top 10 rankings. The top 10 figures are complete monsters. Especially 'White Snake's' control is so amazing you lose your mind just watching."

In High Gear, Uorin's current ranking was 17th, and her user code was "Little Witch."

Excitedly chattering, Uorin pointed at Gando and said.

"Want to do it together? I'll support you fully. We're short on attackers in our faction anyway."

This was the first time Uorin had requested to do something together.

It was certainly touching, but Gando felt bitter instead.

'Is it because it's fake?'

In reality, there was nothing he could share with Uorin.

"I appreciate the offer, but I'll decline. I will help Your Majesty in reality."

Uorin blinked.

"Huh? Reality?"

Understanding her intention, Gando added.

"Of course, this reality I'm living in might also be someone's dream, all fake."

Lost in thought, she smiled and shook her head.

"No, that's not it, Gando. You shouldn't think this world might be fake."

"Then...?"

Uorin raised her index finger.

"This world is fake—thinking like this is the correct answer."

"Fake... you say?"

Watching Gando's reaction with amusement, Uorin sat on the sofa and crossed her legs.

"When you link to High Gear, you can appreciate technology at a level far superior to reality, but the coders didn't create all of that. They pull in countless modules floating around in Drimo."

These were technologies that couldn't be applied in Uorin's current world.

"So there are crude parts, but I don't feel the difference from reality. Because I'm a brain in a vat."

Only what the brain accepts as reality is real.

"But High Gear has one interesting system. Before modifying your body, there's a service that lets you see on screen how you'll change."

Uorin tapped her head.

"It's called AI simulation. An avatar with the same information as me appears and shows how I'd respond to various situations."

Gando just listened.

"It's so precise that just by looking, you can't distinguish between the me on screen and the me outside. The problem lies at this point. If I hand over control to the me on screen and command it to create a new AI simulation, what would happen?"

Uorin spread both arms wide.

"Virtual worlds are created endlessly. The beings in those worlds would live their reality without even knowing they're just programs. If billions of such worlds have already been created..."

Uorin asked.

"What's the probability that this place we're living in is real reality—the beginning of everything?"

Gando couldn't answer.

"Almost none. It's reasonable to think we too are at some middle point in an endlessly drilling system. Might be fake? No way. This world is fake with 99% probability."

Seeing Gando's face frozen in shock, Uorin chuckled.

"Of course, there's a tiny chance this place might be real. It's a good method to believe and live that way. But I want to suggest a slightly different approach."

"What's that?"

Uorin smiled with her eyes and pointed at the bed with her thumb.

"Don't worry about it, and let's play High Gear together."

Shirone's group quickly ran and escaped the concealment facility area.

Occasionally, remnants of Spectrum blocked their path, but they were no match for them.

Entering Ladum's slums, starving residents wandered around like stray dogs, but their appearance actually relaxed the tension, and the group traveled on foot from then on.

Taking in the shabby scene of emaciated people rummaging through trash cans, Kido asked again.

"Hearing your story makes me feel a bit hollow. Being in Speed Killer, I thought I was living a better life than those people. But if this world is also like a dream..."

"That's not true, Kido."

Shirone said with conviction.

"Whatever kind of world this is, what matters is that I exist."

I'm breathing and living, and I'll die if I don't eat.

"To me, this world is everything, and even if there's something outside the world, that's not the end either."

"Hmm, is that so? Well, thinking about it seems meaningless anyway."

Rian said.

"We survived combat. We will continue to do so. Because everything we love is here."

Even life itself belonged to this world.

"Right. That's why we're trying to stop La Enemy. If Ankera becomes a god, all the standards we thought were important will collapse."

"Fighting to protect standards."

Kido shouldered his spear and laughed.

"I don't know what it is, but it sounds grand and good?"

The core members of Shirone's mercenary group each visited Brooks' mansion after the mission ended.

Since Jane had died, an association employee sent by Lufist was waiting and collected the Nemesis processed into ring form.

However, the one Nemesis that Shagal took never returned.

Kargin and Joshua, who escaped from Ladum, found Brooks Mercenary Agency two days later.

When they safely returned alive, they were worried about how to carry on mercenary life in the future, but when they heard that they were the only survivors besides the core members, they were grateful for their cowardice.

After drafting a contract for mission failure and exiting the main gate, Kargin felt refreshed, contrary to his initial expectations.

"Ah, it's like being reborn."

"What senile nonsense? An old man about to enter his coffin soon."

Even hearing Joshua's harsh joke made him feel good.

"Hehe! That's true. How much longer could I live anyway? But this is the first time in my life I've felt like this."

Joshua felt the same way about the sprout growing in his heart.

"I'm going this way. Contact me if you get work that pays. We losers should help each other."

They had to work diligently to pay back the penalty.

"I was serious."

Kargin said with sincere eyes.

"Won't you come with me? If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have gotten even this life."

"Forget it. Let's pretend it never happened. We came back alive anyway, right?"

He didn't think the emotions from Ladum would continue here.

"Take care."

Kargin grabbed Joshua's wrist as he was about to leave.

"I love you."

And with an expression like he was about to jump into Joshua's wavering eyes, he said.

"Have our child. A beautiful child who looks like you."

Tears flowed down Joshua's cheeks.

"Really... have you gone senile? Why would I with you..."

There's nothing more important than living in this world.

"Waaaah!"

Joshua jumped into Kargin's open arms.

"Look at them fooling around. How much debt do they have to be acting like that?"

Brooks, watching from the mansion window, muttered spitefully.

'They should be expelled...'

At the request of Shirone, the mercenary captain, they were recorded as "mission failure" rather than "battlefield desertion."

With his heart aching from Benecia's death, he wanted to impose a hefty penalty fee, but Lufist's statement that mercenary group matters followed Shirone's opinion entirely was decisive.

Especially since Lufist's mood at the time was really bad—if he had uttered even half an objection, his head would have rolled right then.

"Boss, Miss Aria has awakened."

At his subordinate's words, Brooks immediately turned from the window and walked to her room.

After treatment, Aria, who had regained some color, was preparing to leave.

"Leaving already? Why not rest a few more days?"

"I've rested enough. I need to enter the royal castle. Have to write reports too."

Lufist probably handled it, but she also had things to take care of.

The doctor said she should rest for a week, but her demeanor as she put on her coat showed no disorder.

'What a wonderful woman.'

Who would have known that a relationship that started as a fling would light a real fire in his heart?

"Thanks. I'll contact you."

Brooks blocked Aria's path to the door.

"Wait. I have something to say."

"Let's talk later. I'm a bit busy now."

"I love you, Aria."

"Huh? What did you say?"

"Let's get married. I want to share a future with you. Have children too."

Aria looked at Brooks with his arms spread wide in bewilderment, then coldly turned away.

"Take care of the kids you already have, you bastard."

"..."

The door slammed shut.

The simultaneous death of the masters of the Kingdom of Tormia's three great magic guilds was the talk of the capital.

Only after disbanding the mercenary group and submitting reports to their respective guilds could Shirone depart on his next journey.

"Phew, it's tough. Forming a team isn't ordinary work either."

Kido, wearing his hood pulled deep to hide his face, munched on street food and said.

"Humans are a species that assigns great meaning to death. Actually, when you die, you just need to eat, but..."

Shirone looked back at the lamb skewer Kido was holding.

"Do memories come back even when you eat that?"

"No. Memories disappear when cooked over fire. It's not like sorcery. I digest the memories contained in biological cells."

Rian looked back at Kido.

"That is sorcery."

Kido, who swallowed the skewer in one bite and sucked his fingers, said.

"Whatever. Anyway, where are we going now? We don't even know where La Enemy is hiding."

"I have something in mind. But first, let's stop by somewhere briefly. There's someone I really want to meet. I have a favor to ask too."

"Huh? Who?"

Shirone smiled and pointed toward the royal castle.

"The Mercordain family."
