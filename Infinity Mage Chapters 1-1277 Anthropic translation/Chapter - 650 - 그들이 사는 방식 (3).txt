[650] The Way They Live (3)

Rian didn't understand what Sirone was saying, but that was exactly what Sirone wanted to convey.

"I'm glad I came to the guild. I think I was taking things too lightly."

"Hmph, even if that's true for La Enemy, I can't agree about the guild. Of course, I acknowledge you, but if they're trembling just from hearing your name, there's nothing to worry about."

Rian vented the dissatisfaction he'd felt on the first floor.

"Same with the information cards. They say no one has accessed them, but who knows? Once we leave tomorrow, they'll sell them again for 2 gold."

"Haha! Actually, with a system of this scale, it's not easy to deceive people. If we're suspicious, then everyone's suspicious."

"Hmm, but losing 50 silver just for one viewing is still a loss. What if we need to buy hundreds of cards?"

"I'd still buy them."

Sirone held the information card in his hand.

"People usually think of long periods of time vaguely. For example, if they had to do something for a year. But when you think about it, even a year is ultimately made up of accumulated seconds."

"That's true."

"Let's assume it takes us 1 year and 30 minutes to find La Enemy. What if someone else takes 1 year and 29 minutes?"

Rian blinked.

"It's too far in the future to grasp intuitively, but situations like this can happen all the time. And it's actually happening right now in our world."

Sirone stood the card upright.

"A difference of 1 minute. Victory or defeat can be decided by whether you access information even one day earlier. If 1 minute could make a year's worth of effort go to waste, then paying an extra 50 silver isn't a loss."

That was the philosophy of those living in this world.

No one would show them the way, and they had to accomplish everything from one to ten by themselves.

'I was too young.'

He realized anew how many capable people had been by his side until now, and how much easier things could be with them there.

Sirone threw the card onto the bed.

"Of course, rest is important too. You can't run for a year without eating or sleeping. You'll have to make countless correct judgments."

"So you're saying that obsessing over trivial things might cause us to miss what's really important. That's why you bought all the information cards."

"Yeah. We don't know which ones might help us. I think mages from other guilds probably made similar decisions."

Just then, Estera knocked.

"Sirone, are you in there?"

"Yes, please come in."

She waited until he finished speaking before entering with a guild membership application and a pen.

"I've filled out all the necessary forms. Just check them and sign here."

Sirone looked over the terms.

Guild member grades were divided into Rookie, Senior, Veteran A, and Veteran B, with vastly different fees and benefits.

"Hmm."

As Sirone examined the Rookie grade, the perceptive Estera provided additional explanation.

"The guild will promise you the absolute best treatment. However, even so, we can't arbitrarily raise your guild member grade. This is... like life itself to guild members."

The higher the grade, the easier it became to earn money, and it was directly connected to honor as well.

"That's fine. I expected as much."

Honestly, if they had offered the privilege of raising his guild grade, it would have reduced their credibility.

"Instead, the guild will pay all incidental expenses for any requests you take on. If you're planning to make deposits with the guild, we can offer dramatically increased interest rates too."

Sirone spoke honestly.

"Ms. Estera, actually I don't plan to be active with the Silverling Guild for long."

"I know. All world-famous mages are like that. As long as you don't withdraw, the contract conditions we've offered will last for 5 years. You can even join multiple guilds in other countries."

What Estera wanted was a single document proving that Arian Sirone had joined the Silverling Guild.

That alone would give them an advantage over War Chariot and Blood Rose, the kingdom's three major guilds.

Since Sirone was thinking the same thing, he didn't feel particularly burdened.

'Within the country, a guild is definitely more convenient.'

Taking the pen, Sirone asked.

"But withdrawal is free, right?"

"Of course. I'm a mage too. I'm not that stupid."

Of course, even if the possibility of keeping Sirone was slim, she had no intention of giving up easily.

'At least I've done everything a manager can do.'

The real match would come after Sirone arrived in Vashka, where the Silverling Guild's headquarters was located.

"Oh, and about the request."

Estera pulled out a letter from her jacket.

"Guild activities aren't your main purpose anyway, right? Then this should be the most convenient. The compensation is pretty high too."

"I just need to deliver a letter?"

"Yeah. Go to the address written on it and hand it directly to someone named Brooks. There's a confirmation slip enclosed, so get that person's signature and take it to the Silverling Guild in the capital. They'll give you 87 gold. That's after deducting fees, of course."

"87 gold? That's quite a lot."

It was, just for delivering a letter.

"Request fees aren't always determined by danger level. Sometimes finding a lost cat for a noble pays more than risking your life in battle."

"I see."

"Of course, we don't entrust requests like this to just anyone. I'd like you to think of it as the guild showing its trust."

"May I open it?"

He had no hobby of reading other people's letters, but since it wasn't sealed, problems might arise later.

"It's fine. The client didn't specifically request otherwise."

"Because it would actually make it more suspicious?"

It was human nature to want to dig deeper into things that were hidden away.

"It depends on what kind of business it is. They might really have no particular thoughts about it. But this time your guess is probably right. The letter is written in code. It's a personal code, so I can't read it either."

"A code."

Even for an easy request, it felt like there might be 87 gold worth of danger involved.

"Understood. I'll deliver it when I reach the capital."

Estera stood up and asked.

"What time will you be departing? We'll have a carriage waiting on our end."

"Huh? You don't need to go that far..."

As far as Sirone knew, even the lowest grade carriage cost over 10 gold per day to rent.

"It's fine. I told you earlier, the guild will pay all incidental expenses."

Sirone's name value would more than pay for itself, but more than that, there was a greater calculation to naturally guide him to the Silverling Guild's headquarters.

Since he had joined the guild to travel as efficiently as possible, Sirone didn't worry about minor details.

"We'll depart as soon as the sun rises tomorrow."

"Good. Then I'll prepare accordingly. Come find me anytime if you need anything."

After Estera left, Sirone and Rian looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders.

Everything was definitely convenient.

The two woke up before sunrise, washed up, and went down to the first floor.

The guild members hadn't arrived for work yet, and a small carriage was waiting in the clearing outside the back door.

Estera approached with a man in his 50s who had deep wrinkles on his forehead.

"Let me introduce you. This is Austin, the guild member who will guide you to the capital. He's 53 years old. His specialty is flame magic. His guild grade is Veteran A."

"Hello. I'm Sirone."

"I'm Austin. Please take care of me."

His gaunt frame and stern expression spoke of a stubborn life.

"We'll depart right away, so get in the carriage."

As Sirone and Rian entered the carriage, Austin glared at Estera with bulging eyes.

"What the hell is this? You want me to be a coachman for some rookie who joined yesterday?"

"He's not just any rookie."

Austin knew who Sirone was, but the pride he'd built up over 30 years as a mage wasn't easily broken.

"Even so, why me? There are other guys available."

"Oh my, why are you being like this when you know better? I'm not asking you to be a coachman, I'm asking you to bring Sirone to headquarters. Then the guild expands, and it's good for you too, isn't it? I'll pay you handsomely."

"Do you think I'm sticking with Silverling at my age because of money? Even if he's an Archmage, he can't tell me how to live my life."

When he wouldn't budge, Estera let out a sigh.

"Austin, have you ever seen an Archmage?"

"No."

"Right. I haven't either. So..."

Estera spoke through gritted teeth.

"Can't we both just shut up and do it? I'm bleeding dry here too!"

She had no intention of treating someone who'd devoted 30 years to the guild harshly, but Sirone was a different story.

The meaning was: if you don't want to do it, get out.

Faced with contempt beyond his expectations, Austin bit his lips but eventually turned around with a forlorn expression.

"...Fine."

A Veteran A couldn't not know that this was a world where money was everything.

"I'm sorry. I haven't slept a wink preparing for this, so I guess my nerves are on edge."

Estera didn't feel comfortable either, but business was business.

"I know you're having a hard time. Being a manager isn't something just anyone can do."

To make a living, one had to work.

Austin, who had boarded the driver's seat, adjusted the harness and then opened the passenger compartment window to speak.

"Well then, we'll depart. I'll take the fastest route, so rest comfortably."

"Yes, thank you."

Sirone wasn't insensitive, but whatever he said would only irritate Austin more, so it was better to just rest obediently.

The carriage that left Kentra city passed through the wide plains of Sadia, Nade's hometown, and entered the edge of the Jijeo mountain range.

It meant there were 3 hours left until the capital.

"Huh?"

For the first time, an expression appeared on Austin's face as he drove the carriage without stopping once.

"What's that?"

A woman who seemed injured and was staggering was walking straight toward the carriage.

Austin, who had been through all kinds of hardships, stopped the horses at a distance.

'We're quite far from the city, so why is there a person here...?'

"Please save me! Please save me!"

The woman who spotted the carriage ran toward them, holding her torn clothes together with one hand.

"Stop right there!"

A fireball flared up in Austin's hand.

When the woman didn't stop despite this, he threw flames at a point between them.

"Kyaaah!"

This time Austin shouted with fireballs loaded in both hands.

"Don't try any funny business! My flame magic shows no mercy!"

Sirone and Rian opened the doors installed on both sides of the carriage and got out.

"What's happening?"

"Stay inside. It's a minor problem."

To Sirone, it didn't look like a minor problem.

"She looks injured."

"She is injured. But we're not the ones who got hurt."

Since Sirone understood what the veteran meant, instead of approaching, he cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted.

"Hey there! What happened?"

The woman who had collapsed in front of the wall of fire shouted back.

"I was kidnapped by bandits! Please help me!"

"There are bandits?"

Then this place wasn't safe either.

"I'll go check."

While Austin provided cover with fireballs at the ready, Rian approached the woman.

She was wearing only one completely torn shirt, and had many scratches as if she'd rolled down a mountain.

"What happened?"

The woman grabbed Rian's pant leg and said.

"I barely managed to escape! We need to run away from here quickly! They'll come after me!"

When Rian looked back at the carriage as if leaving the decision to them, Sirone asked Austin.

"Can we take her with us?"

"You're the ones who rented the carriage. But I wouldn't recommend it."

"Are you saying that woman is lying?"

"She might be. But suspicion doesn't matter. Whether what she's saying is true or false, if we don't get involved, nothing will happen to us is what I'm trying to say."

Perhaps that was the creed of someone from the guild.

"But if there really are bandits, we should avoid them and take a different route, shouldn't we?"

Austin had nothing to argue with regarding that point.

"Rian!"

When Sirone gave the signal, Rian took the woman's hand and helped her up.

"Get in the carriage for now. Let's hear your story."

"Thank you! Thank you so much!"

Shivering from the cold, the woman burst into sorrowful tears.
