Clan of Darkness (1)

The knights escorting Irene eventually couldn't hold on and collapsed onto the cold floor.

"What's going on?"

Irene asked in bewilderment, but even Captain of Security Benov couldn't understand the current situation.

'Eye technique? No, this is different.' The knights' faces, who seemed to have taken actual damage, clearly showed vivid pain.

"Don't worry. There's no physical impact."

If the Mind Fist had truly activated, their bodies wouldn't have just collapsed—they would have been completely shattered.

'Even so, I didn't expect them to be such weaklings...'

Ryan clicked his tongue.

While it was true he had grown stronger crossing the desert, even accounting for that, the knights' skills were below standard.

"Fine."

Irene changed her mind.

"You seem to have decent skills. I'll have you take charge of my escort. Starting today, protect me 24 hours a day."

As Ryan said, she didn't want to die.

'He said a warning letter came.'

If the contents were true, Ryan would be the one feeling uncomfortable when Irene died.

"If you want to be my escort, apologize for your rudeness."

She wasn't one to hold grudges, but if he was going to properly escort her, she needed to change her attitude too.

"Apologize? What did I do wrong that I need to apologize?"

Ryan turned around as if he had nothing more to say and walked toward the door.

"Alright, alright! I got it!"

Though her personality was rough, if she could change tactics quickly, it would be better to call her shrewd.

"I'm sorry. There, satisfied?"

"Tell me exactly what you're sorry for."

Irene was disgusted.

"Can't you be a little cool about this? This is why I hate old men. Always being so persistent."

"Should I be even more persistent?"

Getting into a deeper relationship would be unwise.

"I was a bit..."

Irene turned her head and said,

"I acted arrogantly toward you. Do you really need to hear that?"

Ryan nodded and extended his hand, thinking it was a decent start.

"Good. You said a warning letter came? Let me see it."

As Irene pulled out a letter from her chest, Benov approached Ryan's side.

The next victim is you.

Ryan tilted his head at the short sentence made by cutting out letters from newspapers.

"What's this? It looks like something the culprit wrote."

Benov shook his head.

"That's unlikely. First, the serial killer has never sent murder warning letters. There's no reason for him to suddenly reveal himself."

"Then it could be a prank. A minister would have many political enemies. It could be a political scheme or..."

Irene put her hand on her hip and stepped forward.

"No. My dad has no political enemies. Because he's someone no one can challenge. And that warning is probably real."

Ryan handed back the warning letter and asked,

"Why do you think that?"

"Do you know what the characteristics of all the victims so far have been? Between their teens and twenties. Beautiful and wealthy. Most importantly, they have such good skin they don't need makeup."

"So what?"

Irene pointed to herself as if frustrated.

"It's me! I'm pretty! I'm rich! My skin is smooth! If the killer has to kill someone, who else is there but me?"

She seemed to be campaigning to be killed.

"Miss Irene has a point. One characteristic of the victims is that they weren't wearing makeup."

Ryan cupped his chin and fell into thought.

"Either someone extremely sensitive to smell..."

"You mean a vampire. Certain chemical components that humans can detoxify become weaknesses for them."

"It could be a strategy to direct attention toward vampires. If so, they're thorough."

"Right. The problem is there haven't even been any witnesses yet. We can't narrow down the investigation, making it even harder to solve."

"I understand."

He roughly grasped the situation.

"Tonight will be exactly the seventh day. For now, I'll guard this place."

Relief showed in Irene's eyes.

"Well, I'll ask for your help then. Since the warning letter might be fake, it's difficult to concentrate our forces."

"Don't worry. I alone am sufficient."

If a knight of Maha was standing guard, the Bark family wouldn't need to worry for a while.

Benov said to Irene,

"Miss, please follow Ryan's words well. You won't be able to find someone with skills like this anywhere."

"We'll see what this old man can do."

As Benov clicked his tongue and left the mansion, Irene revealed her true nature and said,

"I'm going shopping from now on, so get ready to go out. Please take off those tacky clothes and wear a tuxedo... Kyah!"

Since Ryan also had his true nature, he carried Irene over his shoulder and went up the stairs.

"Shopping, what nonsense. From now on, go into your room and don't take a single step out."

"Pervert! Touching a woman's body without permission! I'm going to tell my dad everything later!"

"Please do."

Since no one had ever handled Irene like this before, the butler gaped with his mouth open.

"What are you doing? Show us to the room."

"Ah, yes!"

The butler, who ran up the stairs at Ryan's gesture, guided them to a room at the end of the corridor.

"Oh my!"

Irene, who had been thrown onto the bed, immediately turned around, bent one leg, and smiled.

"Tell me honestly. You feel really good right now, don't you? You're getting pleasure from roughly handling a pretty girl like me, aren't you?"

Ryan looked back at the butler.

"Bring all the mirrors in the house. And tell those knights scattered in the hall to come to me as soon as they wake up."

"Understood. But why the mirrors...?"

"We're preparing for infiltration."

Vampires could make themselves appear transparent by controlling human vision.

But that was only for living eyes—they couldn't hide their reflection in mirrors.

"Understood."

While the servants brought thirty mirrors and eliminated blind spots in Irene's room, Ryan repositioned the knights.

'This should be enough...'

He dusted off his hands and looked back at the bed to find Irene staring at him with a sulky expression.

"What, do you have something to say?"

"Can I call my friends?"

"No."

As Irene hung her head dejectedly, Ryan spoke in a low, soothing tone.

"Just bear with it. Your life is at stake."

"I'm scared being alone. If the killer is really targeting me, then I..."

Despite acting tough, she was still just a child.

"That's why you should listen. If I'm by your side, you won't die."

If you died, I'd be the one who died.

'They're not coming.'

As the sound of bells announcing midnight rang from the first floor of the mansion, Ryan's eyes narrowed.

'Was it really a prank after all?'

"Um... can't I go to the bathroom?"

As Irene squirmed and spoke, Ryan pointed to a jar placed in the corner of the room.

"It's right there."

"Are you really a pervert? How can a grown woman do her business in a place like that!"

"Then come with me."

"No! Absolutely not! This isn't a trivial matter, so..."

Ryan sighed.

"Then what do you want me to do?"

"I'll just go quickly and come back. Okay?"

Looking at Irene's cold sweat, it seemed like disaster would strike at any moment.

"Follow me."

In front of the bathroom, Irene confirmed once more.

"You absolutely cannot come close. Got it? Wait over there at the end of the corridor."

"Hurry up and go in. Isn't it urgent?"

After she stamped her feet and closed the door, Ryan sat with his back against the door.

"...!"

When the sounds of her relieving herself could be heard, he couldn't help but chuckle.

'Are all kids these days like this?'

Well, when Ryan was young, the world didn't feel as heavy as it does now.

Soon, the sound of water could be heard.

"Phew, I almost died."

Perhaps due to tension, her digestive system had been too active.

'He didn't eavesdrop, did he?'

If he had, she would have to consider him someone not worth associating with, she thought as she approached the sink.

'I should stay a little longer before going out. It's been a while since I had freedom.'

She washed her face, which was covered in cold sweat, with water and looked in the mirror, where a man was standing.

"Huh?"

Irene's eyes widened as she reflexively reached for more water.

'What, what is it?'

Irene, who didn't have the courage to look in the mirror again, slowly turned her body and then quickly turned her head.

No one was there.

"Phew, of course."

Then Ryan's words suddenly came to mind, and she fearfully looked back at the mirror slowly.

A handsome man in a suit was smiling, licking his red lips.

"Uh, uhh."

"Shh."

The man in the mirror put his index finger to his lips.

'Save me!'

In her mind, she wanted to scream with all her might, but her throat seemed blocked and no breath came out.

The man who had approached silently placed his hands on both her shoulders, and cold breath touched her nape.

'He's biting. He's biting.'

Through the mirror, she could clearly see the man's fangs.

"Mister!"

As soon as she screamed, the door shattered and Ryan burst in with his great sword.

'Vampire.'

The bathroom was empty, but in the side mirror, a man was turning around.

He positioned himself and brought down his great sword, causing black smoke to be pushed against the wall before revealing its true form.

"Mister! That bastard kept trying to..."

"Get out."

The energy contained in his voice was different, so Irene immediately slipped out through the broken door.

"I can't let you escape!"

As the creature, whose lower body had dissolved into black smoke, went outside, Ryan also kicked off the ground and swung his sword.

"Annoying bastard!"

The vampire, enraged at missing his target, spun around Ryan like a whirlwind.

'Fast.'

Among all the demons he had faced so far, only those of division commander level or higher had comparable speed.

'Even so.'

Ryan's sword was the shortest straight line.

'Cut the moment I sense it.'

As the sword was swung at the speed of lightning, a sonic boom exploded and the vampire was split in two.

"Grrrahhh!"

However, the two bodies dissolved back into smoke and gathered in the center of the corridor.

'Half-body, half-soul. Definitely troublesome.'

Even so, the fact that he had performed transformation magic just before his body was split meant he was high-ranking among vampires.

"...An Almas?"

The vampire's eyes twitched.

"So you were a hunter."

Purebred vampires have a hierarchy.

"No. A wandering swordsman."

The Archdemon's projection Lord, Lord's projection Almas, Almas's projection Vesica.

"But how do you know the hierarchy of darkness?"

"Living in the desert, you hear many stories."

Raika, who had been the interior minister of Spectrum, the subspecies organization of Radum, was also of Almas rank.

"Hmph, a mere human..."

The vampire moved, creating afterimages.

"How dare you discuss demons!"

All the glass windows in the corridor shattered, and sword marks and claw marks were carved into the walls as if from nowhere.

"Over there! Catch the culprit!"

From the end of the corridor, the self-proclaimed Irene Guard was climbing the stairs with long swords.

"Don't come!"

As the saying goes, ignorance breeds courage—since they couldn't see the battle, there was no room for fear.

"Where are you! Come out!"

The moment the knights, seized by ambition, swung their swords at empty air, three heads fell off.

"Aaaahhh!"

Now they were afraid, and they all made the mistake of showing their backs and returning to Irene.

"Idiots!"

Even if they were knights, shouldn't they protect their employer by choosing death?

"Got you!"

In Irene's field of vision, massive smoke shot up vertically, and the vampire's face fell like a waterfall.

'Divine Transcendence!'

With an explosive burst of wind, Ryan, who had somehow blocked Irene's front, swung his sword horizontally.

'Mind Sword!'

The heart cuts first.

"Graaahhh!"

An infinite horizon slashed through the vampire.

"Ah, mister..."

For a moment, the illusion of the world being divided up and down flickered in Irene's eyes.
