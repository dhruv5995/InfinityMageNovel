In the Flower Garden (1)

Flu approached Rufist, who was waiting for hell's army, and reported.

"As of now, the asylum processing for all 286 surviving targets has been completed."

Some people like Neid remained in the Kingdom of Tormia, but most had fled to other countries.

And the other survivors, Rufist and Flu, chose to remain on the battlefield.

If the elemental bomb exploded, they would likely get caught up in it, but running away without even fighting was out of the question.

"Well then, shall we go?"

With the Tormia Allied Forces joined by the Holy War forming a crane wing formation, Rufist stepped forward.

"Let me join in too."

Looking back, Dante was approaching.

If Rufist's memory wasn't failing him, he was definitely an unassigned force.

"How unexpected. I thought you'd be in a bunker."

There was no intent to mock.

What was needed to lure the demons to Bashuka was the sacrifice of many, not elite operatives.

"I was sick of being cooped up in a small room. If not now, when else would I get some fresh air? Rather, I'd like to ask you. Why are the Association President and Secretary General here?"

The Rufist that Dante knew wasn't someone who would be swayed by emotions no matter what situation arose.

"Of course, I'm not here on willpower alone. I suppose you could say I considered efficiency."

"Efficiency?"

"Anyway, I won't die."

Overconfidence perhaps? Maybe so, but his statement changed the look in the surrounding commanders' eyes.

'Being able to speak positively even in the most desperate situations. That's what makes a general, I suppose.'

A messenger's shout came from the flank.

"Enemy spotted!"

Looking forward, hell's army, red as blood, was surging from the horizon.

"First, we need to break their morale."

Rufist transmuted steel above his palm and was about to move when Dante stepped forward.

"Please leave that role to me."

"You?"

It wasn't that he didn't know Dante's abilities, but the enemy they were facing now wasn't an ordinary demon.

The fact that the demons' numbers had decreased compared to when the war broke out meant, on the other hand, that the surviving demons were elite veterans.

"If you fail, it won't end with just your death. The army's morale will be crushed."

Dante said as he passed by Rufist's side.

"Do you know why I'm the final administrator of the flower garden? Despite having a low Red Line grade."

He did have exceptional abilities in handling information, but...

"Because I'm the kingdom's greatest defender."

As the demons approached within 2 kilometers, the ground began bouncing like a rubber mat.

Flu looked at Rufist.

"President, are you really going to let him go?"

"Let's watch for now."

If he was the type to act without knowing his place, he wouldn't have made it this far.

Like a sailboat floating alone in the middle of the vast ocean, Dante stood guard over the plains by himself.

'Central Calculation Magic Circle.'

Taking the great army into his sight, he activated Pascal, creating a magic circle over 200 meters in diameter.

"Graaaah!"

Then countless magic circles began rotating and rising, assembling into a three-dimensional mansion.

"General! Over there!"

Balkan was far from the vanguard, but he could still clearly see it.

"Damn! What the hell is that now?"

The sight of lasers spreading like a net and starlight bubbling and boiling was amazing, but the problem was the size.

'Something enormous.'

Dante's eyes widened.

"Information Castle!"

The starlight burst forth with blinding white light, then transformed into an object of unbelievable size.

"Huh?"

The demons who noticed the shadow cast on the ground simultaneously raised their heads high.

"It's a castle?"

When a real-sized ancient castle that could only be seen in reality appeared, bewilderment took precedence.

"It's just magic anyway! Just push through it!"

Like a school of anchovies charging at a massive ship, the demons increased their charging speed.

*Welcome to Information Castle. Entering user settings mode.*

Dante sat in the control room chair and observed the demons through the multi-screen in front of him.

Not only were there no blind spots, but it also provided close-ups and around-view with high visibility angles.

"Automatic control and strike. Strike priority from closest distance. Firepower level maximum."

*Settings configured. Please enter approval password.*

Dante interlaced his fingers and stretched his hands.

"Playground."

*Entering fortress defense mode. 287 target entities secured. Artillery fire in 4 seconds, 3 seconds, 2 seconds...*

"Shall we have some proper fun?"

The moment the guidance voice finished counting, 3,000 gun ports on the outer castle walls opened.

After Ikael left with Guffin, heaven experienced a period of great chaos.

Anchera remained silent about the reason for Ikael's departure, but the angels had their suspicions.

'It's all because of humans.'

When hatred toward humans settled deep in their minds, expansionist policies became popular.

Giants were transmitted to various parts of the universe, and it was at this point that giants entered the world where Sirone lived.

The giant who reached the 6th stage of Ilhwa's Sake decomposed his body that reached the clouds to make humans prosper.

A new humanity.

But Adam and Lilith, who had settled here long ago, no longer existed.

Again, vast time passed.

Omega Year 987.

Heaven, rising from the absence of the Archangel, boasted its greatest prosperity in history.

Besides giants and fairies, cities of divine citizens were created, and fallen angels were managed separately.

"Haah."

One day, as Satiel was lost in worry, something happened behind her.

"What?"

Turning around immediately, dozens of glass panels were sparkling, revealing translucent boundaries.

Like a puzzle, Ashur's body was assembled, and as the glass panels disappeared, the real form began walking.

"Lady Satiel."

"Ah, Ashur?"

She wasn't surprised that a 3-star Mara had dared to infiltrate an Archangel's room with his abilities.

'Ikael.'

Coming to her senses, she rushed to Ashur.

"What happened? Is the Archangel safe? And what about Guffin? What happened to him?"

"Everyone is safe. Fortunately."

Satiel breathed a sigh of relief.

"Do you know how much time has passed? If there's some reason preventing your return..."

"Lord Ikael is looking for you. If you're willing to accompany me, I'll guide you."

Satiel's eyes moved left and right as she stopped speaking.

"Without reporting to Lady Anchera?"

"Yes. That's why I came."

Though not as permanent as Guffin's Hexa, Ashur was also capable of blocking signals.

"Phew!"

Puffing her cheeks and exhaling deeply, Satiel paced around the room in conflict.

'I wish she would refuse if possible.'

Even if Satiel sided with humans, taking away the being at the highest point of heaven was dangerous.

But Ikael had reasons to meet Satiel, and understanding this logically, he had no choice.

"If you're worried..."

"I'll go."

Satiel, having made her decision, approached.

"I need to meet now. Take me to the Archangel."

The only comfort for Ashur was that she still called Ikael the Archangel.

"Yes. Then excuse the discourtesy."

As Ashur activated his signal, hundreds of glass panels that appeared flat from any angle trapped them.

'Transfer.'

The moment all glass panels shattered with a clear sound, they were already gone from their spot.

"Where is this?"

Satiel, who arrived at her destination in an instant, took in the scenery of wilderness where forest and sea harmonized.

"Please follow me."

Without explanation, Ashur urged them along the path, and Satiel followed without complaint.

Meeting Ikael was the priority now.

'Will Guffin be there too?'

Feeling groundless excitement as they crossed the forest, Ashur stopped in front of a cave carved into a cliff.

"Lord Ikael, I've brought Satiel."

"Good. Tell her to come in."

As Ashur stepped aside, Satiel walked forward with a tense expression.

Even without holy light bodies, the interior was bright, and reaching the end of the cave, she saw the person she had dreamed of.

"Guffin..."

He was busy soothing a crying newborn and looked up with a tired expression.

"Hey, Satiel. Long time no see."

Even then, she hadn't thought about it.

'A human child? Who is it?'

It was probably some event that could never be reached by angelic thinking.

"Satiel."

Coming to her senses, she knelt before Ikael.

"Archangel! Why are you hiding in such a humble place! Return to heaven with me."

"Yes, thank you. But before that, there's something I must tell you first."

Ikael extended both hands to Guffin.

"Hand him to me."

"Wait a minute. I think this little one wet himself? I need to change his diaper again."

"It's fine, so give him to me."

Satiel watched blankly as the child moved from Guffin's hands to Ikael's hands.

"Archangel, that child is?"

"My child."

Satiel felt like she had heard words she didn't understand.

"What?"

But when she looked up, Ikael was holding the child with such a happy smile.

"Can you believe it, Satiel? My child. Proof that Guffin and I are connected."

Satiel's mouth fell open.

"How can an angel and a human..."

Guffin brushed back his hair and smiled.

"Hehe! I really am a genius. It's Hexa technology. I'll specially call him Agape."

Satiel finally grasped reality.

"The Archangel and Guffin..."

Turning to show the child's face, Ikael spoke with an excited expression.

"Yes. Guffin and I succeeded. Now we can all be connected. No one has to be left out."

Of course, but...

"Satiel, help us. Since our child is proof, Lady Anchera will have no choice but to accept it. We can go further. This isn't the end."

Naturally so, but...

"The reason I called you is because there's no one but you. No one else could accomplish what you have done, fighting for humans through these long years. Please, Satiel."

Just ending with the blessing of two people was too small, because what they had achieved was too wondrous.

"And one more thing."

Ikael added with tender eyes.

"Won't you give this child a name?"

"A name."

A human born from an angel.

Since it was a being that could link to Idea, it was more than qualified to have a name.

But the moment she heard Ikael's words, the first word that came to Satiel's holy light body was:

'...Why?'

And at this point, Sirone stopped accepting Omega's records.

Records accepted beyond the five senses through eleven senses weren't clear by human standards, but...

'I can feel it.'

Rather, because of that, it approached Sirone with true clarity that transcended human thought.

'How much Guffin and Ikael cherish and love this child, I can feel it with everything.'

That's why he couldn't go any further.

'I know.'

That Ikael's child eventually faced a terrible death without even having a name.

'I also know how venomously Satiel hated humans after a very long time had passed.'

Even without confirming directly, he could sufficiently guess what would happen to them.

'But...'

That child who would soon face death was not Sirone.

'Then why?'

When Igor revived the greatest fear from within Sirone, he had definitely experienced that child's death.

'It wasn't injected information. It was my memory.'

It was from the child's perspective.

Also, Ikael's face, clutching his chest and sobbing bitterly, was still vivid in his eyes.

Sirone accepted Omega again.

'What could have happened?'

To understand what meaning the name Hexa held within their sad tragedy.
