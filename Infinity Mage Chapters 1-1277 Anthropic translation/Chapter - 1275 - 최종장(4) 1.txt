Final Chapter (4)

Adam, connected to Richard—or more precisely, the Holy Brain—sent a signal to the main body.

"My role is finished. You may shut down the power now."

"Are you okay?"

Even though his entire body was mechanical, his heart was still human, so Richard asked back.

"I've seen all of Lilith's life, so there's no need for me to remain. I've simply fulfilled my responsibility to this world. At the very least, I wanted to protect what Griffin left behind."

"Will you awaken in the outside world?"

"I don't know. As long as the Missing Link is still operational, I won't know until I see for myself."

"What if you do awaken? You could help this world. It's a world you've lived in, after all."

"Well..."

The Holy Brain thought for a moment.

"Honestly, I'm not confident. Even the most beautiful dream is quickly forgotten in the face of reality."

"...I suppose so."

"What about you? If Shirone wins, there will be no god in this world."

"Then I guess I'll have to shut down my power too, won't I?"

"You're giving up the chance to become god?"

"Haha."

Richard said.

"God exists for the sake of humans, after all—"

Adam bid farewell.

"I must go now."

"Yes. Please have..."

The sound of power shutting down could be heard.

"...a good dream."

The brain that had held blue electricity grew dark.

Good and evil, merit and love clashed.

"Graaaah!"

Under humanity's united attack, Harvitz was retreating while letting out horrible screams.

On the other hand, his form became even more grotesque.

His lower body melted and connected to the ground, while the universe orbited within his black upper body.

"I absolutely won't lose! I absolutely will not lose!"

Right, Mom?

The ground connected to Harvitz undulated like water, and hundreds of hands burst forth.

"Gah!"

When Son Yoo-jung was caught by one of them and slammed into the ground, Harvitz let out a terrible roar.

"Graaaaaaah!"

Tremendous pain rushed in as Son Yoo-jung's body began to burn up.

Gaold frowned.

"This is maddening."

His very existence was chaos, worse than when his mental state had been chaotic.

Taesung and Lete entered Richard's chamber.

"He's going berserk."

Discovering Harvitz on the screen in front, Lete spoke with a serious expression.

"Hidden Code is originally meta-code that shouldn't be directly applied to the main ground. It's the master language that operates processes before the world is implemented."

Taesung said.

"That's the Reverse World."

"Right. Satan's definition is the central control device that oversees the Reverse World's source. Even so, the final authorization belongs to God, the core of the Five Great Systems, but currently Harvitz is recklessly abusing God's authority."

Richard asked.

"Is that possible?"

"It's possible. If you're an Illuminati."

"Even I, as an administrator, don't know the realm beyond God. I can only speculate through God's data. It would require quite high-level authority among the Illuminati. Otherwise, they couldn't freely change God's security protocols like this."

Taesung said bitterly.

"Harvitz... his Missing Link has been severed."

"It wouldn't be voluntary. But it's not something that can be done against his will either. This isn't normal synchronization. He's an illegal accessor. The Missing Link signal was weak."

Richard observed Satan's battle.

"Is he really a child? His handling of code is too clumsy and intuitive."

"Even though Harvitz has lived here for over 40 years, his original tendencies are emerging as the Missing Link weakens. Of course, an expert wouldn't handle it like that, but they wouldn't do such things in the first place. It would be meaningless, and attacking a world where users are connected would be a serious crime."

Taesung asked.

"Could Harvitz's inexperience become a breakthrough?"

"It would be difficult."

Lete was pessimistic.

"Even if he's inexperienced, it's still God's authority. Even if there were a human who understood all Five Great Systems, there's a difference between growing and using something already complete. As Teraforce said, the battle between good and evil will end with evil's victory. Even if love defeats merit and the world is maintained."

"Love and merit are..."

Richard changed the background on the screen.

Shirone and Nane were pouring attacks at each other while maintaining a distance of 400 kilometers.

It was a long distance for humans, but considering their projectile speeds, it was practically point-blank range.

"They're evenly matched."

This time Taesung stepped forward.

"If Harvitz broke God's regulations, then Nane is God's regulations themselves. That's why he's right."

"It's a complicated situation. Even if Shirone wins, if evil triumphs, that means suffering for the users. In that case, they should naturally be disconnected."

"That's why Teraforce exists."

When Richard turned the screen, Lete was dumbfounded.

"What is that now?"

Their fleet, which should have been resetting human history, was flying while swaying unsteadily.

Taesung said.

"Illuminati have boarded. It appears they've severed the Missing Link from the real world. In that case, punishment is impossible under user autonomy regulations. Of course, if they knew the outside world, they wouldn't have any attachment to this place. But why are they doing this?"

Richard theorized.

"There must be something remaining in this world. In any case, I hear this universe is the only one among God's multiple universes where Griffin's signal has been received."

"This is completely ruined."

Lete grabbed her head.

"This universe is chaos. I feel shame as an administrator of one of the Five Great Systems."

Richard said.

"Judgment seems impossible. Then it will ultimately be decided within the gears of good, evil, merit, and love. As a system administrator, if you were to predict the final outcome?"

Lete shook her head.

"Even God cannot calculate that. Good, evil, merit, and love are just directions written on a compass. Four people who have reached their extremes are each presenting different directions. What rotates at the center is ultimately..."

Taesung said.

"The heart."

It would be humans who decide where to go.

The planet was like a nucleus wrapped in a cell membrane.

From Anti-Cell's outer layer burning in sunlight, tremendous gas was being generated.

Hissssss!

Trillions of entities burned every second, but they divided into even more cells, and the cell membrane grew thicker.

The sunlight that had illuminated the world with reflections inside the mucous substance gradually weakened.

"Shirone!"

Under that gray sky.

"Nane!"

Yahweh and Buddha were engaged in aerial combat, flying at speeds exceeding Mach 40.

'Photon Cannon!'

Depending on their turning angles, their distance moved between 400 and 1,200 kilometers.

"Sermon."

At the center, tens of thousands of flashes and corresponding swords of light were crossing.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Flapping his wings of light, Shirone evaded the swords of light flying from beyond the horizon.

Nane wasn't visible to the eye, but his sermon spoke in his place.

'No, Nane.'

You can't close it off like this.

'There will be pain. No one can take your place. You might even wish for death.'

Because Shirone had lived such a life too.

'But you're living again like this. Even if it's painful...'

Hand of God.

Photon Cannon.

"There can be plenty of happy days too!"

A flash as huge as the sun instantly crossed 700 kilometers and reached Nane.

Nane clasped his hands together.

"River! Dog! Salvation! Advance! Break! Crack! Extreme!"

The harmony of sermons transformed into a sword of tremendous size and exploded the Photon Cannon.

"Heavy! Crack! Nothing! Sorrow! Dragon! Tears!"

And then the vibrating sword multiplied by the number of its vibrations and was fired.

"Yes."

Nane knew too.

'You might have been happy when you were born. Watching a clown's performance, holding hands with a lover.'

But someone...

'Starves. Gets violated! Falls ill! Gets murdered for no reason!'

Nane's attacks intensified.

"Not knowing if it will come or not! Just to receive that single drop of happiness!"

If sentient beings are those who wait with mouths open, enduring all kinds of pain.

"Isn't it the right path to abandon greed and worldly desires and choose the tranquility of impermanence, rather than the cruel illusion of happiness?"

Tremendous sermons were fired.

Boom boom boom boom bang!

Explosion sounds erupted above the Nameimond Republic, probably where Shirone was.

The citizens of Nameimond watched the rain of swords with fear and awe.

The sermon swords were so bright they couldn't even see them piercing Shirone.

"Oh, Yahweh."

They knew.

In the final regression, Shirone had embraced all the world's sins with love.

"Whooooo."

The smoke in the sky cleared, and Shirone, wrapped in Miracle Stream, exhaled quietly.

"Nane."

Compromise was impossible anyway.

"It's not up to us to decide that."

"Kekeke!"

Harvitz evolved endlessly.

Ku—

Death Fields spread everywhere, and the resistance writhed in the agony of becoming charcoal.

"Aaaaah!"

Harvitz, containing the universe in his body, spread both arms wide and declared.

"I am God! I can do whatever I want!"

Right, Mom?

If it weren't for Wizard, this annoying world—I'd smash it all to pieces.

"Charge! Don't stop!"

Though facing Harvitz was terrible agony, the resistance didn't retreat.

"Grgh!"

Pain! Pain! Pain!

Between real and fake, good and evil had already lost even their meaning.

"Endure! Hold on! We can win!"

Only pain was proving this moment.

"Harvitz!"

Miro's Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara landed 120 million consecutive hits on Harvitz's body.

Pop pop pop pop pop bang!

"I believe in God!"

Eden clasped both hands in prayer and spread a massive barrier across the entire radius.

"It seems to be working!"

When Harvitz brought both hands down again, even more powerful pain spread through the field.

As human screams spread in concentric circles once more, Gaold threw himself forward.

'Don't mock us.'

As Gaold stomped the ground with both feet, his hair began to turn white.

'Don't mock humans.'

Even knowing the tremendous pain that would come, he took another step toward that pain.

The desperate struggles of humans fighting to live were quite beautiful.

"Aaaaah!"

Miro thought.

"Gaold!"

Tremendous atmospheric pressure struck the earth, and Harvitz's face was crushed like an accordion.

Argh argh argh argh!

Thud! Thud thud thud!

Under the endless Air Press, Kang Nan bit her lips and tears welled up.

'It must hurt.'

Life was convulsing.

As if thrown into the boiling water of good, evil, merit, and love, life itself was writhing.

'Pain is nothing more than...'

Gaold's eyes completely rolled back.

"Just nociception."

"Don't talk nonsense!"

Harvitz finally realized Gaold's characteristic.

'That guy gets stronger the more pain he feels. And...'

There was no limit to his pain.

'Then.'

White holes opened in Harvitz's eyes, and pure white beams struck the ground.

Pain Code 17 (Test Version).

Hot steam rose from the earth, and pain that didn't exist in this world exploded.

"Kyaaaah!"

As Eden's barrier melted, bubbles began forming on people's bodies.

Harvitz shouted.

"Did you think you could win?"

Because you're right, because you're good, because there's no sanctuary for demons.

"Did you think you could defeat God!"

Harvitz's giant hand grabbed Gaold, and tremendous pain was inflicted on his mind.

"Grh..."

That scream...

"Graaaaaaah!"

It was so horrible and desperate that it chilled the listeners to the bone.

Miro ran with tears streaming.

"Gaold!"

Blood tears were also flowing from the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara filling the sky.

210 million hits. 370 million hits...

As terrible pain as the number of strikes flowed into Miro through the avatar.

Gaold.

Miro thought.

'Why are we struggling so much? Can't we just live like everyone else?'

'Miro.'

Gaold, screaming in Harvitz's grasp, was also thinking.

'Living is painful. Everyone carries their own burden through life.'

'Are we not more painful than them?'

'Let's believe that.'

If we deny even that...

Gaold used all his strength to raise his pain threshold.

"Aaaaah!"

What would remain of our lives?

Rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble boom!

Under the insane Air Press, Harvitz's body gradually flattened.

"Grrrgh."

Finally, with a thud, he lay flat under Gaold's feet again.

"Grrrrr..."

The resistance, with parts of their bodies turned to charcoal, stared blankly at the scene before them.

"G-Gaold."

Gaold, staggering at the center, retched and slowly turned his head.

His eyes were completely unfocused, and red blood was pouring from every orifice in his body.

"Huh??????"

Seeing Miro sniffling without even thinking to wipe her tears, he chuckled.

"Living long enough, I even get to see you cry because of me."

My Idea.

"Gaold..."

Miro's heart sank.

Gaold's eyes, which had been shaking in shock, began rapidly returning to normal.

They were the eyes of someone prepared.

"I leave the rest to you."

Miro's head unconsciously moved side to side, and Gaold looked at Harvitz.

"Shall I tell you why you can't move?"

"Grrr! You..."

"To beat me, you'd have to hurt more than I do."

His tone was calm, but his face was already convulsing from neurological shock.

Miro was terrified.

"Gaold, wait."

"It's okay."

Even while trembling as if about to explode, Gaold forced a smile.

"Because pain is lonely."

It can't be shared or passed on.

'Actually, I'm not sure. I don't know how hard things are for me either.'

I've never measured another person's pain, and I couldn't anyway.

'But one thing is certain.'

Whether strong or weak people, those who pursue good have strong responsibility.

'So...'

They carry unbearable burdens through life.

"No! Gaold!"

As Miro reached out and ran toward him, Gaold slowly closed his eyes, preparing for the end.

"So I don't..."

Nociception.

Infinity.

"Hurt that much either."

Air Press.

The moment the magic activated, Gaold's form sank deep underground with a thud.

At the same moment.

Taesung suddenly curled up and grabbed her head.

'This is the strongest yet.'

As if foreseeing the coming situation, Lete looked at her with a pale expression.

Taesung screamed.

"Kyaaaaaaaaah!"

Tremendous vibration occurred at a single point, and Richard watched the enormous pillar of fire on screen.

'The maximum threshold this world can give. And the magical power from that threshold is...'

Even Satan was on the edge.

He had probably sung thousands of songs and performed even more pieces.

Sizzle sizzle! Sizzle sizzle!

Divine Transcendence was still in effect, but now Ranstin had no songs left.

'Repetition is impossible.'

The control of the Four Gates would weaken.

'But he held on.'

The face of the man that came to mind at this final moment was ironic.

'Panier.'

Three-tenths of the songs he played were composed when he worked with Panier.

'I thought I'd never bring them out again.'

But when he actually played them, they weren't bad—rather, he quite liked them.

'He must have known.'

That person.

Rin couldn't sing.

Her vocal cords, which she had cherished like life itself, were completely ruptured and could no longer make sound.

'Why was I so stubborn?'

The fact that all those experiences, all that time, formed who she was now.

'If I had realized a little sooner.'

Ranstin's guitar melody began to change softly as he smiled briefly.

Feeling the change, Rin's eyes settled.

"Ooh ooh. Ooh ooh."

Ranstin began to sing.

"Ooh ooh. Ooh ooh."

It was just an eight-bar melody without even lyrics, but it definitely felt different from before.

To his daughter, to his wife, to Panier, to all the people in the world he had been angry at.

"Ooh ooh! Ooh ooh!"

It was sincerity conveyed through sound.

When Ranstin's voice spread through Anti-Cell to the world, a miracle happened.

"What's that?"

Countless people began looking at the sky.

And that music flowed even into the deep underground where survivors were taking shelter.

A song sung with all his heart.

Ooh ooh. Ooh ooh.

Having heard all of Ranstin's music until now, Panier's lips curved upward.

'Yes, that's your soul.'

Ooh ooh. Ooh ooh.

Taking a deep drag of his cigarette, Panier looked up at the ceiling and muttered quietly.

"...Where's that contract?"

The song ended.

Perhaps because he was satisfied, Ranstin removed his guitar, which had been his other self, and threw it to the ground.

What remained was Anti-Cell's total attack.

Watching the rain of countless cells falling, Rin turned around.

Having already conveyed everything.

Words weren't necessary, and the two embraced each other in a deep kiss.

And then.

Rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble!

Cell Buster devastated the ground.

Air Press explosion area.

Thanks to Taesung's desperate defense, the resistance's casualties weren't too severe.

Siena grumbled.

"Crazy bastard. He told us not to come near, but he was planning to blow up the entire city?"

Rufist said.

"Anyway, it's definitely the strongest explosion in history. I hope this finished Satan, but..."

There was still no movement.

"Big trouble!"

Nade and Iruki, who had been fighting demons in other areas, ran to them.

"What's wrong?"

"The sky. Look at the sky."

Only after the smoke cleared did they confirm countless Anti-Cells.

"...I see."

Judging by their numbers, they wouldn't last even an hour.

"Iruki!"

Flames gathered in the air and transformed into a fire avatar as Amy appeared.

"The music stopped! They'll invade soon."

"We know too. But..."

"I'll try to stop them."

Having been burned by the sun, Amy's flames would surely work.

"All of that?"

Even Amy was dizzy looking at the sky.

"I can't block them perfectly. Let's spread the flame layer thin to make a filter. Even if we only stop seven out of ten, we can buy time."

Iruki nodded.

"Then I'll look for a way with Fermi. Help us hold out as long as possible."

"Got it."

Flying up, Amy witnessed cells pouring down in chains from the North Pole.

"My goodness."

But her avatar had also reached the level of receiving Phoenix from the sun.

"As far as possible..."

And wide, her body began transforming into a curtain of fire to cover the planet.

At the roar of Gaold's explosion, Ikael looked toward the Holy War.

'Tremendous power.'

Considering Taesung's endurance.

Ashur said.

"If you wish to confirm, I will stand guard."

At that moment, the landscape crumpled and Jinseongeum appeared, crossing spatial boundaries.

"Angel, this is urgent."

Behind her, a brown-skinned woman and a man with a sword waited in formation.

It was Maya and Kaidene.

"Cell Buster will soon invade the ground. We must establish countermeasures before then."

At Jinseongeum's words, Ikael asked.

"Is there a method?"

Maya said.

"My friend Fermi, well, anyway, told me to sing instead of the Guitarman."

"Sing?"

As far as Ikael knew, the songs that had blocked Anti-Cell until now were a type of magic.

"Can you block them too?"

Maya shook her head.

"No. But God dislikes this incident. Fermi said he saw information from the future. Of course, now it seems different from the original future he knew."

Ikael looked around the battlefield and thought.

'Uriel.'

Whatever action she took would continue Uriel's will.

"Would helping you be more beneficial than helping those currently fighting?"

"Yes. Only you can do this, Ikael-nim."

"What?"

Maya said with intensity in her eyes.

"Please amplify the song."

So it spreads across the entire world.

As the explosion smoke cleared, the resistance despaired at what they saw floating in the sky.

Kahahaha!

It wasn't the previous hideous appearance, but a human figure with cotton-white skin.

"They call it the base type."

"Not even a scratch?"

Even that was despair-inducing, but Miro and the other strong fighters realized at a glance.

'He's gotten stronger.'

Do you understand now, insects? What kind of being I am? I am a god capable of anything!

As Harvitz spread both arms, things like fish eyes flowed over his white skin.

Calamity Code 23 (Test Version).

His body swelled tremendously, transforming into a disgusting monster with tens of thousands of eyes.

Now then, where...

"You bastard!"

And the next moment, Miro ran forward alone with eyes blazing with hatred.

The moment Jinseongeum's space connected.

Magic Swordsman.

Non-Flash.

Kaidene's sword cut through space at tremendous speed, defeating the surrounding Anti-Cells.

"Quickly!"

Unlike the Guitarman, Kaidene could only widen the radius with his thin sword.

The two who had once sung to the entire world had vanished without a trace.

'Thank you.'

But Maya intuitively found where they had sung.

Ikael placed a hand on her shoulder.

"Begin. I don't know much about singing, but I hope your heart can be conveyed."

Nodding, Maya closed her eyes briefly.

Kaidene's battle, Ashur's teleportation preparations—everything gradually faded into the distance.

In perfect concentration, she began to voice with all her heart.

Ooh ooh. Ooh ooh.

It was the Guitarman's posthumous work.

The battle between Buddha and Yahweh became even faster.

Their trajectory orbiting the planet passed through as many countries as their journey.

Tormia, Kazra, Ferris, Biden, Zaive, through to Kashan's desert.

"Yahweh."

And every time flashes passed, people came outside and looked toward the sky.

A song heard from somewhere.

Ooh ooh. Ooh ooh.

The melody was the same, but the voice was much gentler—a woman's voice.

"She sings well."

People around agreed.

"Nice song."

That too.

Shortly after, someone shyly opened their mouth.

"Ooh ooh... ooh ooh."

Starting with that, one by one they joined in until everyone on the street was singing in chorus.

From 10 to 100 people, from 100 to 1,000 people.

Ooh ooh! Ooh ooh!

Tormia, Kazra, Biden. Jincheon, Namhyang, Iron, Kesia, Yakma, Paras, and more.

Voices spreading simultaneously across the world made Shirone and Nane look down at the ground.

'This is?'

What both realized simultaneously was the now-erased future information of Apocalypse.

'All of humanity's song.'

At that time, God had frustrated humanity, but now the Beron problem was resolved.

'The future can change.'

Shirone clenched his fist.

'If everyone decides not to fight, it can happen like magic.'

It seemed so easy, but it was something humanity had never achieved in its entire history.

Ooh ooh! Ooh ooh!

Mica said.

Ultima System possibility detected. Integration rate 2%. Participating entities: 54,067,984.

"Mister! Mister!"

Kang Nan, who hadn't evacuated when the explosion occurred, searched for Gaold.

He was stirring at the center of the crater.

"Mister!"

Confirming all his limbs were broken, Kang Nan immediately turned.

"I need to get someone right now..."

"I had a dream."

Gaold seemed peaceful.

"I was with her. It was a happy dream. We built a cabin in the forest—I hunted, she cooked. There was a wolf that went hunting with us, and I really liked that guy."

Kang Nan smiled.

"...It was a wonderful dream."

"When I woke up, it felt a bit empty. I missed that dream. But that wasn't right."

Gaold looked at Kang Nan.

"If this were a dream, I'd have to miss this place again. Whether reality or dream, I just need to live the moment I'm in with all my might."

Kang Nan nodded through tears.

"Yes."

Self-compensating mutation.

Perhaps the reason he could endure countless shocks wasn't superhuman will?

Whether he might live decades more or end in just a few minutes.

Even if only one second remained, he would live this place with all his might.

"Thank you."

Kang Nan was satisfied with that.

"Don't worry."

Having reached infinite nociception, Gaold felt what ordinary people feel.

"It doesn't hurt anymore."

For the first time, the air was sweet.
