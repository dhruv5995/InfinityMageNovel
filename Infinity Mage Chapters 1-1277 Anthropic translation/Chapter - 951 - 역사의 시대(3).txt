Age of History (3)

In Gerfin's eyes, having lived through eons of time, Miro was nothing more than a child, but he acknowledged her exceptional insight and will toward righteousness.

'She's worthy material to entrust the world to.'

He liked both her sky-high self-esteem and her completely open way of thinking.

'The only question is...'

Would Miro be prepared to sacrifice everything for the world?

"I'll do it. I'm the only one who can anyway. Unless there's another way."

If it was the only method to solve the problem, the mage could lay down her own life.

"No, that's not enough. This isn't a role I can entrust to someone just because they can do it or want to do it."

She might have to endure being alone for a lifetime, perhaps even much longer than a human lifespan.

"The human heart has no limits, but it breaks just as easily. If you regret it even a little, humanity will fall into the worst possible situation."

"Even if it's work that requires the heart rather than the head..."

With her arms crossed supporting her chest, Miro swayed her upper body left and right.

'It's her nature.'

He liked how she didn't lose her sense of humor even in desperate situations.

"Who would want to willingly take on something like this? I'm doing it because I'm the only one who can. It's a matter that requires a cold approach, and I can endure it."

"For how long?"

Miro closed her mouth.

"I know you're amazing. A hundred years? No, you could last a thousand years. If I told you to endure until then. But this isn't like that. You'll have to fight the thought that you might be alone forever. No matter how vast the space, you'll feel trapped in a coffin, and in that state, your sanity can't remain intact. I guarantee you'll go insane within ten years."

Unable to deny it, Miro asked.

"What do you want me to do?"

When Gerfin extended his palm, a hexagonal shape of Hexa appeared and transformed into a metal box.

"Meta Gate. Equipment from Heaven. It stores coordinates and bends space. Currently this planet is distorted by dimensional walls, so without this, you can't return."

"You want me to go to Heaven?"

"I'll give you one year. You need to see and feel it yourself. Reason alone isn't enough. Without a mission that says you'll absolutely accomplish it, I can't make you my successor."

As Gerfin handed over the Meta Gate, he added.

"You must never let it be taken. Of course, the dimensional walls can't be easily penetrated, but a system without an administrator will eventually be conquered. That's why someone must be trapped in what might be eternal solitude."

Miro, who had been staring intently at the Meta Gate, raised her head.

"I'm not complaining, but why can't you do it? You could become the administrator."

"I have a greater mission than that."

Though it was a brief answer, Miro asked no further.

"Then I'll go and come back. Where should I go?"

"Galiant."

One year later, a black sphere appeared in the warrior's resting place prepared in Galiant.

Having pierced through space to arrive at her homeland, Miro's appearance was more gaunt than a year ago.

Gerfin, who had been sitting on the bed, closed his book and asked.

"Was it an enjoyable trip?"

Examining the eyes of Miro, who silently stared straight ahead, Gerfin realized that more than just her appearance had changed.

'She's ready.'

A sense of mission that transcended reason had taken root.

"I'd like to hear your impressions at least."

At Gerfin's words, Miro's first utterance was:

"No one should approach Heaven. At least current humanity cannot bear the truth of the world."

Gerfin nodded obediently.

"Have you made your decision?"

"I'll do it. I'll manage the dimensional walls and prevent the beings of Heaven from entering here."

Miro turned her body toward the outside.

"The same goes for Gerfin's gate here. If someone unqualified goes to Heaven, it could provide a pretext for invasion. I should at least install some kind of trial gateway."

Gerfin extended his hand as if offering.

"Do as you wish. From now on, you're the one protecting the world. The methods for doing so are also your freedom."

Miro created trial gateways to judge the qualifications of those going to Heaven.

Gerfin prepared to leave.

"Then I'll see you on the promised day. I'll handle the Istas side. And this might be meddling, but..."

After hesitating briefly, he said.

"If there's anything left that you think you'll regret later, don't hesitate and do it now. If there's someone you keep in your heart, convey your feelings. Share your love."

"You really are meddling."

Gerfin chuckled.

"I don't think you'll make mistakes either. It's just... it would be too sad to leave regrets behind."

Because it would be unbearably lonely.

'Regrets, huh.'

Someone's face floated in Miro's mind.

When her mouth didn't open for a long time, Gerfin asked as if he'd expected this.

"As I thought... there is someone, isn't there?"

Miro, emerging from her thoughts, answered firmly.

"There isn't."

Though the judgment of the Council of Twenty hadn't been handed down yet, she already anticipated the result.

The world would push her into cold solitude, and if that was fate...

'I'll just accept it.'

This time Miro asked.

"Don't worry about Istas. There's a capable ally there. By the way, what are you going to do?"

"I need to prepare to leave."

Unlike a year ago, this time Gerfin was the first to turn away.

"It won't take long."

The first place Gerfin visited was the Lifeless Zone located in the southern hemisphere of Heaven.

Though it got its name because all life had dried up and died, it was actually a place where forgotten beings dwelled.

"Karatorsa."

A massive presence passed through the sunless darkness, and after a moment, radiance was born.

The majesty of the dragon lord looking down at Gerfin with its enormous body was admirable as always.

"Gerfin."

Behind Karatorsa as the light dimmed, the silhouettes of the Twelve Apostles could be faintly seen.

'Still a powerful race.'

To be this mighty without undergoing special evolution since the early days of Omega.

'It means they're perfect.'

At least they were the most perfect life forms that Argoneth and Gaia could create.

"What is your reason for setting foot in the forbidden realm?"

Having received permission from Argoneth for their species' survival, the dragons waited for their time in the Lifeless Zone.

"Don't be so cold. You were able to rest because we prevented the reset."

Karatorsa wanted to hear only the main point.

"So? What's your reason for coming?"

"I'm thinking of doing the reset myself this time."

Murderous intent rose in Karatorsa's eyes.

"Human, I dislike jokes. If you're serious, then you've come to fight us."

"Quite the opposite. I want to make a deal. But I want to ask - there's no forgetting for the Apostle of Time, right?"

"Hmph, don't compare us to humans' imperfect thinking. We are the coldest race. We don't distort any information."

All information is stored as combinations of 0s and 1s.

"Then you can view our history neutrally too. Help me, help humanity."

Karatorsa thrust his face forward.

"We're on neither the side of gods nor humans. We only prevent specific beings' intentions from interfering with the flow of time."

"That's what I want. A world that absolutely never changes, no matter what I do."

"Your comprehension is lacking." Karatorsa was frustrated.

"If you succeed in interfering with something, it means Anke Ra can do the same. Existing time will collapse, and from then on it becomes unmanageable."

"What if I could transmit the Akashic Records' logs to you?"

Light kindled in the Twelve Apostles' eyes, and Karatorsa, who had been wearing a blank expression, asked back.

"The Akashic Records' logs? You mean all events since the beginning, the movements of every atom?"

"Yes."

"How?"

Karatorsa's voice was provocative.

"I know you can manifest signals from outside. You call it Idea. But ultimately, Idea is also a signal created within this world. And the Akashic Records belong to the one who dreams this world, only to Anke Ra. You can't reach it."

"I can reach it."

Gerfin pointed to the sky.

"Because I'll shoot it directly from outside."

"...Outside?"

Karatorsa, raising his head vertically, imagined the universe at the end of the dark sky.

After a long silence, he muttered.

"Go outside the universe... and from there... transmit logs to me?"

"Yes. I don't know what kind of world it is, but I'll definitely succeed. I'll hack the logs and shoot them to you. In return, if I succeed, you'll protect the flow of time based on the Akashic Records' logs. So that no variables arise."

"Photon system departure. If you disappear..."

Karatorsa's brain began spinning rapidly.

"For Anke Ra, it would mean the only obstacle is removed. From then on, he'll attempt resets and try to correct all the errors he's made."

"Right. You have to stop him."

"But I'm puzzled."

Karatorsa looked down at Gerfin again.

"Even if we protect time, then who can stop Anke Ra? You won't exist anymore."

"Hexa."

Gerfin smiled.

"Icael's and my child will be in this world. It has no name. We won't give it one."

Because we're parents who don't even have that right.

"When that child becomes capable of bearing the truth of the world, I want you to convey everything then. The beginning and end of this world. The Alpha and Omega."

Karatorsa also became realistic now.

"Anke Ra won't leave it alone, will he? Hexa will be the first to be eliminated in a reset."

"That's why I'm going first. Hexa is a manifestation of signals from the outside world - if I initialize it there, I can remove the cause itself. Then Anke Ra can't touch it either. Preparations are almost complete. The dimensional walls, and even a successor to protect them..."

"Wait. Wait a moment."

Karatorsa interrupted.

"If you attempt a reset after departing from the logs, a person named you won't exist in the second era. A base event occurs. Users will have déjà vu, and angels might even feel discomfort."

"Right. Cracks will appear in the Akashic Records. I've left behind ruins with my name carved on them. It's not just because of this, but it should help you resolve historical contradictions."

"Hmm. Rather than confusing users, you'll make them accept the reset itself."

"That's the only solution. Even if you try to stop me, I'll do the reset. It's better to have the logs I transmit than to bang your head against a wall."

A long time passed.

"...Understood."

The Twelve Apostles descended to the ground in human form, and Karatorsa raised his body to its full height.

"The Apostle of Time has promised."

"Thank you."

As Gerfin turned and began to emit Hexa's light, Karatorsa asked.

"Are you confident you won't feel empty?"

"This world viewed from outside might be nothing more than a single signal. Even seeing that, will you be able to love this place? If everything that was precious to you until now was false?"

"I can."

As the last descendant of the Gaians who achieved an integrated mental system, with that brilliant mind.

"Even if it's false, even if there's something more empty than that, I can love it."

Gerfin placed his hand on his chest.

"Everything I felt while living here, loving here, is real. It will remain in me forever."

I'm not leaving just to leave.

"I'm ready. It's time to return with what I've learned in this world. And that is precisely..."

Gerfin's body began dissolving into particles of light.

"What it means to be a god with a heart."

As only his voice drifted through the atmosphere, Karatorsa fell into deep thought.

"A god with a heart..."

He had thought the world continued creating new worlds, converging toward endless kalpas.

"Going back in reverse."

Beyond infinity.

So that gods with hearts could dwell in all worlds.
