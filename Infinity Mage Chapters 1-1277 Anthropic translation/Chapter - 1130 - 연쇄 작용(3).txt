Chain Reaction (3)

The officials gathered in the Holy War attacked the Paras Kingdom with unprecedented unity.

"A pyramid has been erected in the Iron Kingdom as well. This is a clear violation of sovereignty against other nations!"

King Kitra's mouth remained closed.

'They're not going to tell them.'

Sirone knew that the most powerful language was silence.

'They just want grounds to make a judgment. If I don't answer, the initiative won't pass to them.'

Balkan was among the few people thinking the same thing.

'I don't see Havitz.'

If he had activated Vanishing, he would have been hit by the Pope's aura just now.

'Pope Constantine is the real deal. His divine power can shock even high-ranking demons.'

Of course, Satan was on a different level.

'There are two possibilities I can think of. Either there's something more interesting than the pyramid...'

Or Havitz has weakened.

In the end, both cases applied, but Balkan couldn't make a choice.

'Anyway, the momentum has completely shifted to Paras. Most nations have been broken. The only one still holding out is...'

Balkan's gaze turned toward the Kashan Empire.

'Uorin.'

Her head was buried so deep that her face wasn't visible, and her shoulders were trembling.

"Grrrgh."

At her groaning sound, Gando whispered.

"Your Majesty, are you alright?"

As the time waves continued to surge in, her head felt like it was about to explode.

'What is this? Why...'

Gritting her teeth and slowly raising her head, the golden melody of future sight vibrated like guitar strings.

'The future keeps changing?'

Her head was dizzy, and as nausea finally surged up, she abruptly stood up.

With officials from other nations watching, she immediately opened the door and left the conference room.

The chairman shouted.

"If you leave the conference room now, penalties will apply! You won't be able to attend until the next meeting!"

Uorin didn't even listen, and Gando followed her outside.

"Your Majesty!"

"Why did you come out? At least you should have stayed."

Looking at Uorin's pale face, it seemed like her life was in critical danger.

"I'll call the medical team."

"No need. Bring Kido."

"Your condition first..."

"Hurry!"

Seeing how even shouting seemed difficult for her, Gando bit his lip and ran outside.

Walking alone, Uorin couldn't move any further in front of the door and sat down.

"Hey! Uorin!"

When Kido arrived, she was trembling in a semi-conscious state.

"Kido, the timeline keeps changing."

"Don't talk."

As Kido lifted her in his arms, Gando took out a key and opened the door.

"Gando, guard the outside."

After giving that instruction, Uorin weakly pointed to the carpet laid on the floor.

"Over there."

When Kido set her down, she sat cross-legged and said.

"Set up Earth Binding."

It was to check Havitz.

"...Got it."

Taking out the spear from behind his back and spinning it, Kido stopped it horizontally and activated his avatar technique.

'Earth Binding.'

Powerful gravity that wouldn't allow even a single step pressed down on the room centered around them.

"Never release it."

As Uorin closed her eyes, History Search activated.

"Ugh!"

The time waves kept surging endlessly, but it seemed the biggest change had already occurred.

'Then I can find it.'

No matter how the world changed, human actions could be predicted within broad categories.

'I need to find the keyword.'

While the sum of causes creates the result, each cause carries different weight.

If someone ate an apple.

'I have no choice but to analyze all the causes.'

Because they were hungry, because they liked fruit, because there was only an apple to eat, because they were controlling their diet, etc.

Among those, the cause that had the greatest weight in the result would differ from person to person.

'The core keyword!'

In a state of selfless absorption, the work of weighing all causes continued.

How much time had passed?

"Gasp!"

Uorin's eyes snapped open as she collapsed forward.

"Hey, are you okay?"

Kido turned his head halfway and asked, but Uorin, overwhelmed by shock, couldn't answer.

"I'm asking if you're okay!"

She had succeeded in finding the core keyword.

But in the world covered by new time waves, the person who would become the most important event was...

'Why?'

It was completely beyond her expectations.

'Cayden?'

From Tormia, the fate of the Red Cross.

Certainly a unique background, but a person whose influence in this Holy War had been quite low.

'Not me, not Sirone, not Havitz...'

Cayden?

"Everything's completely twisted."

As Uorin turned off her future sight and stood up, Kido hurriedly supported her and asked.

"Are you feeling better now?"

'What on earth is going to happen...'

She looked at the pyramid outside the window with an uncomfortable expression.

'...in this world?'

Meanwhile, in the conference room, the offensive against Paras continued.

"Reveal the identity of the pyramid! Otherwise, we'll have no choice but to use force."

There was no answer from Kitra, and the viper wrapped around his neck flicked its tongue mockingly.

"This..."

Just as the official was about to shout, Kitra stood up and headed for the door without saying a word.

"Stop him!"

"We formally request the detention of King Kitra!"

Anyone from the Holy War participating nations could detain someone, but the procedure was terribly complex.

'It's useless. The Holy War is the center of diplomacy. They can't easily detain a nation's representative.'

As the frustration of learning nothing turned to anger, the officials changed their target.

It was Gis of the Zibe Kingdom.

"We'd like to ask Zibe. Do you know the reason the pyramid was erected?"

Gis answered bluntly.

"How would I know that?"

"Zibe suffered the biggest damage! We heard the angels' power was neutralized."

When they hit a sore spot, Gis bared his teeth.

"Don't stir up public opinion with uncertain events! When the time comes, I'll announce it myself."

Albino asked.

"That aside, there was a strange article in today's daily newspaper. Well, moral criticism isn't my job, but doesn't this kind of collusion break trust?"

'Old geezer. He knows everything.'

As he opened the floodgates, officials from other nations joined in with one voice.

"Exactly. We heard that citizens could elect a new king according to their national imperial law. Since it's a matter that affects Holy War principles, wouldn't it be better to clear this up?"

Gis's reaction was the same as Kitra's.

"Hmm."

"Please say something!"

'Are you crazy? Making me talk.'

Whether he confessed honestly or denied it, the moment he opened his mouth, he would become prey.

Pedra, the Prime Minister of Arachne who was watching the atmosphere, supported Gis.

"What's important right now is the pyramid. Wouldn't it be better to suspend the meeting and give each nation time to respond?"

His gaze shot toward the chairman of the Holy War assembly.

'Cut it. Cut it off.'

The assembly chairman struck his gavel.

"We'll recess for 3 hours. Let's continue after information gathering is complete."

The officials' expressions soured.

'It's already been taken over.'

There was no doubt that the assembly was also at the secret banquet provided by Arachne.

Lufist rested his chin on his hand.

'This is why nighttime politics is scary.'

Sharing each other's weaknesses creates a stronger alliance system than any document.

'But it's also an opportunity for us.'

As Gis was the first to leave his seat, Flu, who had been lost in thought, quietly stood up.

'Hm?'

Sirone watched her exit through the door.

'Does she have urgent business?'

It wasn't particularly hurried movement, but not reporting to Lufist was unusual.

After leaving, Flu kept Gis in sight.

"Ugh, so frustrating. Bring me some coffee. With lots of ice."

It was her first time using feminine wiles, but with each step she took, her heart grew colder.

'I'm a professional.'

Just perform the mission.

Albino's advice from the conference room a few hours ago passed through her mind.

"We can't approach as delicately as Arachne. Let's go with the standard method. First, a collision. A collision disguised as coincidence."

Albino had said.

"It's classic, but humans are rationalizing animals. They won't notice with this."

"Really? I mean, you would notice, wouldn't you, Albino?"

"No, I couldn't."

Albino smiled.

"I can say this because it's someone else's business. It's due to cognitive limitations. Humans think about causes when looking at themselves, but results when looking at others."

"Hmm."

"It's not that it's bad, but that's how it has to be. The reason we can't be generous with others' mistakes but are endlessly lenient with our own. That's why we need to be somewhat silent about others, but..."

Albino stroked his beard.

"Anyway, the reason you're worried is because you're looking at Gis with a predetermined result. But Gis doesn't know the result."

Flu understood.

"To me it's a specific event, but to Gis it's just one of countless coincidences."

"Exactly. If you tried to give meaning to every coincidence that happens every moment, you'd go crazy. People often say they made a stupid mistake. But to the person involved, it's not stupid at all. They're just swept along in the flow of cause and effect."

Human beings.

How far apart are we as beings?

"Geez, these people who don't know anything."

As people began coming out of the conference room, Flu walked toward the grumbling Gis.

'No need to worry.'

Flu began running hurriedly down the corridor and bumped into Gis's shoulder, spilling coffee.

"Ah, what? How annoying."

To Gis it would be one of many causes, but...

"Oh my, I'm sorry."

To Flu it was the only result.

"I was rushing because I have documents to deliver... Are you alright?"

Gis frowned.

"Geez, are you the only one busy here? Show some order in a place where important people are gathered."

As officials coming out of the conference room began to take interest, Flu bowed her head.

"I'm truly sorry. It's my mistake."

The officials murmured.

"What? What happened? That woman, isn't she the secretary general of Tormia's Magic Association?"

"She spilled coffee."

At their words, Gis's ears perked up.

'Magic Association secretary general?'

Moreover, if it was Tormia, it was a nation with considerable influence, led by Yahweh.

'Hmm.'

For someone in that position to bow their head in front of everyone wouldn't be easy.

'Well then. Zibe has name value.'

Gis's shoulders stiffened with strength.

'This will work.'

Still bowing her head, Flu looked at the floor and recalled Albino's words.

There's no woman who dislikes being called beautiful, and no man who dislikes being called strong. There may be degrees of difference, but ideology doesn't matter. This works at the genetic level.

'I need to gain his favor.'

To control a man, you have to praise his power. Money, authority, position, everything possible through his abilities. Make him feel like the strongest person in the world.

Gis's expression relaxed.

"Why bow your head over such a trivial matter? Stop that. Aren't you also a VIP of a nation?"

Once that situation is created, men usually become half out of their minds. To use a female analogy, it would be similar to the feeling of walking among women while being the only one called 'beautiful.'

Flu understood.

If you succeed that far, you can say you've buttoned the first button well. He'll listen to almost anything. Because he has to be a tremendously capable and strong person. That's when it begins.

The war of desires.
