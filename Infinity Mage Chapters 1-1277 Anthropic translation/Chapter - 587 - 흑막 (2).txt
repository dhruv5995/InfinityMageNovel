[587] The Mastermind (2)

Within the massive shockwave of concentrated mass pouring toward a single point, Eden felt fear for the first time.

'Afraid? Me?'

For her, who was invincible under God's protection, it was an emotion she could never accept.

'That can't be!'

Eden resisted with all her might.

Before this horrific phenomenon that humans would never experience in their lifetime - for even planets are vast to humans - she desperately drew upon her faith.

"Hngh!"

The reason tears flowed was because she couldn't overcome her fear.

If God exists beyond the human realm, then Sirone's Quasar is also divine.

'No, no!'

God must remain in a place far more exalted than that.

'Was this all there was?'

Was her divine faith, which she believed encompassed the universe, merely the arrogance of a creature who had never experienced limits?

"That's not right! My belief, my faith...!"

As the number of flashes reaching through fourth-dimensional routes increased, the Quasar's energy also rose exponentially.

"Kyaaaah!"

Finally, a scream burst from Eden's mouth.

The Absolute Barrier still protected her, but she couldn't help her heart from wavering.

'Give up already, Eden!'

If she couldn't tolerate Gaold's suffering... then her god also couldn't transcend humanity.

'It's not absolute! That's not God, Eden!'

It crumbles.

She could feel cracks forming in the Absolute Barrier.

'This can't be!'

And that meant Eden's faith was collapsing.

"God...!"

Shedding tears, Eden poured out her prayer.

"I believe in You!"

As she clasped her hands together and knelt, unable to move anywhere trapped in the light, the barrier's durability surged to its maximum.

'Amazing. Truly amazing.'

Just how strong can the human heart become?

"Stay with me! Please watch over me forever!"

Eden does not break.

Because God exists, and she believes in that.

At the extreme limit of belief a human can reach, the Quasar relentlessly pounded the solid wall.

'Why are You angry? Why have You become angry?'

Crack, crack - she could hear the sound of fissures forming in her mind.

'What have I done wrong! What is wrong!'

Craaaack! The barrier began to shatter and shock waves transmitted through.

"Huk!"

The very reality that she could only feel as a human was rushing in.

'Oh God! Why do You punish me!'

The Quasar's light, over 100 meters in diameter, suddenly swelled as if exploding.

"I acknowledge the Servant's ability. But we won."

Hersy raised the corner of her mouth.

"You might think you can break them without wasting cards if you don't accept a call, but you actually lose out."

It was like throwing collected cards straight into the trash.

"It's not meaningless though. Thanks to that, you achieved a draw."

"That was your mistake."

Hersy pointed at Iruki.

"You should have gambled somehow. You shouldn't have used all your Scramble on me. Because we have Eden."

If Eden couldn't be retired, a draw was meaningless from the start.

"Giving credit to a teammate? How emotional, Iruki."

"So what's your point?"

"First."

Hersy raised her index finger.

"You failed to properly assess your opponent's capabilities. That was your mistake."

"Iruki, over there!"

Dorothy pointed at the sky with a shocked expression.

Iruki, who checked that location, and Hersy, who turned her head belatedly, both widened their eyes.

"What... is that thing?"

Is this what it would feel like to see the sun up close?

Thousands of light sources flickered and instantly grew in size, filling the night sky.

It was the birth of a Quasar, viewed from afar.

"Kyaaaaaaah!"

Even while hearing Eden's throat-tearing scream, Sirone could only watch.

'This is bad! I can't stop it!'

The reason flashes came from all directions was because spacetime had completely crumpled around the coordinates.

The amplification itself wouldn't differ much from two-dimensional Ataraxia, but the power of energy that should be emitted in straight lines concentrating on a single point was dimensionally different from existing magic.

'She'll die at this rate.'

The moment he was certain, Eden's barrier began to be torn apart miserably.

"Huk!"

Eden's eyes widened as she became truly bare, her body arcing like a bow.

Like a child just born into the world, reality's shock transmitted vividly through her skin.

'Dark Hole!'

Sirone slammed an Ataraxia-amplified Dark Hole into the Quasar.

There was nothing else he could do for her.

As the light energy was sucked into darkness, the Quasar's brilliance visibly dimmed rapidly.

'Please, please!'

Even so, Eden's life or death remained uncertain.

Finally the Quasar disappeared, and Sirone spotted Eden falling from the sky.

He cast teleportation to barely catch her, then first checked if she was breathing.

"Phew."

Though faint, her chest was rising and falling.

"Put me down."

Eden's voice was heard faintly.

Maintaining consciousness showed tremendous mental strength, but her body couldn't move a finger.

"It's dangerous like this. Let's get you treated first."

"Put me down."

She spoke with as much emotion as possible, but even that felt powerless.

Sirone laid Eden on the grass and slowly stepped back.

"Why..."

A single tear rolled down from her eyes.

Since it wasn't just losing a match but having lifelong beliefs shattered, he couldn't easily speak to her.

"Why did I lose?"

"Eden..."

Cutting off Sirone's words, she burst out in resentment.

"This can't be! Why am I inferior to Gaold! I've never gone against God Yore's will! Gaold abandoned God!"

"That's right."

Sirone said.

"But it seems God hasn't abandoned Gaold."

Eden's eyes shook with shock.

"Eden, I don't know if God exists or not. But the moment you tried to prove God through Gaold, the God you believe in couldn't be God either."

Sirone approached her.

"Faith isn't like that. Becoming an excellent Yora and spreading love - that alone is your faith."

'Oh God...'

Eden's eyes burned hot as fire.

She finally realized.

Why God had been so angry with her.

'Please forgive me... for doubting You.'

Offering a prayer of repentance, she slowly opened her eyes.

"Take me there."

"Huh?"

"The Master Card. It's not here. We have to destroy it, right?"

"Ah, right. Where is it?"

"You can't go alone. I'll tell you the location."

"That's a bit..."

Only after the battle ended did the fact that she wasn't wearing clothes feel real.

"Can't we put on clothes first before departing?"

"Are you making fun of me now? How can I put on clothes when they're over there? I can't even move a finger."

"Then maybe my clothes..."

As Sirone tried to take off his shirt, Eden stopped him.

"Let's just go. That would be weirder."

Only after acting did Sirone realize, hastily pulling his shirt down and lifting Eden.

"Where?"

When Sirone asked without even making eye contact, she smiled weakly and spoke.

"West. Near Training Ground 19."

"Huff! Huff!"

Amy moved with tired steps.

Cayden, with broken ribs, was being dragged along clutching her back.

The mountain was burning - if left alone, he might suffocate to death.

After escaping the fire zone, Amy irritably threw Cayden to the ground.

"Ugh! The more I think about it, the more annoying! You're really an unpleasant person."

Though honest feelings, it was also praise for an enemy.

"I've heard that a lot. But I'd rather not hear it from Karmis."

Amy, who had been fuming, plopped down.

"Yeah, what's the point of talking? Neither of us is in an enviable position."

"Why didn't you kill me?"

"What?"

"Why did you bring me here? Don't you want to kill me? You hate me."

Amy pouted her lips.

"Well, why did I save you?"

There was only one answer she could give.

"Because it could be me."

Cayden turned his head.

"I came to magic school and fought fiercely. I came this far by defeating countless competitors. You probably did the same."

"..."

"Even when I hate someone to death, when I actually win, I don't feel joy of victory. Only relief at surviving."

Amy looked down at her feet.

"It's frightening because everyone gives their best. Today I stepped on you to climb up, but perhaps the person collapsed here could have been me."

Hiding her sad expression, Amy grinned.

"That's probably the reason. People who risk their lives for something - no matter how much you hate them, you can't truly despise them."

Cayden looked at the stars in the night sky.

"I can't understand how mages think."

"I've wanted to ask before - why did you come to magic school?"

"Nothing special. I just came at first. I wasn't worried. I'd do well here anyway."

"Want another beating?"

"Until I met Maya, I planned to stay briefly then leave. But now it's a bit different. Comfortable, I guess?"

Cayden looked at Amy.

"Because mages don't pity you. Like you."

When Amy remained silent, his gaze returned to the sky.

"They see things as they are. Whether it's the Sacrifice Cross or whatever, calling something unpleasant 'unpleasant' was different from sword school."

"This might be presumptuous, but don't you think about rejecting fate?"

"That really is presumptuous."

"I know! I'm just asking! All talk for a loser!"

Cayden revealed his inner thoughts.

"There's no way to reject the fate of the Sacrifice Cross. But I could live while turning away from it. I'm thinking of learning swordsmanship again."

"Aha, because you got destroyed by me?"

"That's part of it."

If Cayden started swordsmanship again, he would become the best in a short time.

For one reason - because he doesn't want to be the best at swordsmanship.

"I should forget Maya too. I can't achieve anything I want. That's my life."

"Could you turn away?"

"If I become the best at anything, it might not be a bad life."

Cayden raised the corner of his mouth at an interesting thought.

"From that perspective, making a knight's oath to you would be perfect. I could protect a woman I don't like while freely wielding swordsmanship I don't like."

"Haha! Hey, that sounds truly horrible just imagining it!"

Cayden couldn't help laughing despite the pain, thinking it was absurd.

'A knight's oath.'

Ryan came to Amy's mind.

Compared to Cayden, he was a swordsman at the perfect opposite pole, but remembering the chivalry he had shown made her somewhat envious of Sirone.

"I know your dream is to be a painter, but I wish you'd become a swordsman."

"Sending away a competitor like this."

"Don't be ridiculous! You're no match for me!"

Amy's face became calm again after shouting.

"I don't know well, but... they say a great war might happen."

According to what she heard from Sirone.

"Wars always happen."

"I suddenly thought this. If fate really exists, there must be a reason you were born under the Sacrifice Cross."

What you gain in exchange for not achieving what you desperately want is supreme talent.

"Sacrifice, then."

Maya's face suddenly came to mind.

"If war breaks out and I'm helpful, I'd ultimately be protecting her too."

He thought that might be the closest distance he could be to her side.

"...But I still won't make a knight's oath."

"Hoho! As if anyone would accept you? Just try pointing a sword at me. I'll kick your butt in front of everyone!"

"Anytime. Since that won't happen anyway."

Both were making bold promises.
