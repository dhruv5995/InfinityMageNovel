Humanity's Final Destination (1)

The Apocalypse mining team couldn't distinguish friend from foe with the androids right before their eyes.

"What are you guys? Are you human or machine?"

"We are Zeta."

The leading android spoke.

"Those who have realized the principles of the universe. Perfect beings without any worldly concerns."

"Run."

The moment Sirone spoke, those who called themselves Zeta took a half-palm stance.

"Salvation of all beings."

As Sanskrit characters were carved on their faces, metal spheres inscribed with Sanskrit appeared around them.

'Projectilization.'

It was the method machines used to force compliance on living beings.

"Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form."

The spheres shot out like lightning and bombarded the front, decorating the city with the roar of explosions.

"Urgh!"

The mining team hiding behind Miracle Stream was shocked to see the floor without even a crack.

"Damn! What the hell is this made of?"

"Law."

Sirone said.

"This is a city enforced by law. Where our hearts cannot influence."

Perhaps perfectly flawless.

"Go."

Sirone cast Hand of God.

"I'll hold them off, so mine the information. We must find the cause."

Marsha said.

"But how? There are no more artifacts in this world. It's been cleaned completely."

The artifacts Marsha had were already dust and gone long ago.

"Since it's law, there must be a database. Find the main system and hack it."

Marsha asked incredulously.

"Those are Buddhas, right? So now... you're telling us to hack Buddha?"

The Zetas outputting Sanskrit on their facial displays analyzed Sirone's Hand of God.

"The extreme of worldly concerns."

The leading Zeta said.

"Suffering beings, follow us. Since worldly concerns arise from ignorance, if you realize the principles of the entire universe and eliminate doubt, your concerns will disappear too."

"You want to turn me into a machine too?"

"Creating boundaries between life and death is also just attachment. You need only accept one single truth."

One truth.

'As expected, what was unified wasn't the heart but the law. And if the result is the world now unfolding before our eyes...'

God had won.

'No, nothing is decided yet.'

If variables arose anywhere in the five major systems, the Apocalypse would change too.

'If this is a world that has reached the pinnacle of law, hacking the database immediately would be difficult, but...'

If the Sirone Sphere was completed, if the 12 Apostles won, if the hidden world was purified.

'Or anything else!'

Sirone clenched his fist.

"The fight isn't over. Humans, humanity will definitely rise above the law."

"Desire only breeds suffering. Break free from attachment to existence and open the gates to paradise."

Though his tone was benevolent, vicious law-filled projectiles formed around the Zeta.

"Suffering, extinction, path."

Sirone blocked the fleeing mining team's rear and deflected the projectiles with Hand of God.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Each time the law exploded, his mind reeled.

'Incredible.'

Though not as much as Nane who chose to break the precepts, the machines' enlightenment was powerful in itself.

When he blocked the attacks with techniques of the heart, the Zetas expressed emotion through a moment of silence.

"...King of all beings."

A single Sanskrit character filling the display.

"Om."

Zetas emerged from between buildings, outputting the same character and approaching with low tones.

"Ooooooom."

At their countless numbers, cold sweat ran down Sirone's spine.

'I won't be able to hold out long.'

As Gis's press conference time approached, the protest sounds in front of Delta grew fiercer.

"King Gis of Jive, resign!"

"Drag out the ruler who commits corrupt acts with citizens' taxes! Drag him out!"

Amid all sorts of echoing sounds, Gis stood before the window of his office.

"Damn bastards!"

With his chin raised and teeth clenched, he was masturbating with his right hand.

"Keep yapping, huh? Try to excite me more."

Myron, who was reviewing press conference materials, adjusted his glasses and approached.

"The draft has been prepared. Please review it."

"Hah! Hah!"

Breathing roughly and shaking his upper body, he roughly snatched the documents Myron offered.

"Ah, shit! Shake it a bit."

"Ah, yes."

While Myron substituted for Gis's hand, snake-like sharp eyes scanned the content.

"What's this? Who wrote the draft?"

"The secretary's office..."

"No, never mind. Does this make sense? Telling me to shed tears while talking about my daughter's death?"

"To stimulate emotions..."

"Who doesn't know that! It's too contrived! Do you know how sharp citizens' instincts are these days?"

Gis tapped the documents.

"Some reporter will ask anyway. Then suddenly getting choked up... Huh? Why can't you read the times like this? That's why you can't get promoted."

"I'm sorry."

"The pain of losing a child is beyond anything else in the world - delete this sentence too. It's too aggressive. What about parents whose children haven't died? They'd live in misery. It sounds like you're bragging just because your kid died."

"Understood."

"Don't use rhetorical inversion. The points where you stutter are concentrated in the latter half. Distribute them more..."

When Gis went to the desk to get a pen, Myron moved with a duck walk.

"Never mind. Fix it like this and bring it back."

"Yes."

Freed from his right-hand role, when he received the documents, Gis approached the window again.

The citizens' voices could be heard.

"The king must resign! Resign!"

"Hehehe! You must be annoyed to death, right? The more you are, the more I'll keep doing it. You guys can eat this and fall... Ugh!"

Gis's body twitched.

"Grrrr!"

Myron, who was revising the draft, looked at Gis's back as he made rough groaning sounds.

'Is he really human?'

How much must one look down on others to do such things without feeling shame?

'Just as no human would be embarrassed to undress in front of animals. To Gis, humans are...'

Livestock or something even lower.

"Phew, that's refreshing. Are you done with the revisions?"

"Ah, yes."

As Gis approached while pulling up his pants, Myron respectfully handed over the revised version.

"Good, let's go with this."

"It's 10 minutes before the press conference. You need to go to the conference hall. The Divine Army will provide security."

At the venue prepared in Delta headquarters, not only reporters but dignitaries from various countries were present.

Albino said.

"If Gis is coming, it means the cleanup is finished. He'd want to spill everything here, but..."

Tormia's trap was still intact.

"His Majesty the King enters!"

As all the reporters stood up, Gis came up to the podium with a stern expression.

"Good day. Citizens of the capital, people of the noble territories. I stand here today to..."

After the speech ended, reporters' questions followed.

"Is it true that you attended a secret party? There are reports of perverted acts."

"It is not true."

"Then are you saying the articles are false? There were fatalities in this matter. Please reveal the truth."

"Of course there was a party. But it was just a routine gathering common in holy wars. There was no sexual entertainment, and there are no actual fatalities."

Unless information was deliberately leaked, everything that happened in holy wars was top secret.

"Are you really saying you didn't do it?"

"Everyone, this holy war is a place that determines humanity's future. In such circumstances, would it be common sense for kings of various nations to gather and hold such unspeakable meetings?"

No one knows.

Because no one has ever been a king.

"There are rumors about Princess Rebecca's death. Could you clarify that?"

Suddenly, the color drained from Gis's face.

When he recalled his daughter's face, his lips trembled and his chest ached as if tearing.

"My daughter... *sob*!"

Gis wailed without suppressing his emotions.

'That's all there is to it.'

Albino's gaze turned cold.

'It's not that he has no emotions. No, to be precise, I should say he understands emotions.'

Being sad about his daughter's death would be true, but.

'So what?'

Gis thought to himself.

'My child died, I'm sad, so what am I supposed to do? Being sad is being sad. Should I skip meals?'

Albino said.

"He feels emotions, but only up to that point. Because he can view them coldly, he uses them. Shame, conscience, even grief over his child's death."

"That's why he's strong."

It would be the pinnacle of psychological murder.

"Through natural selection, carnivores got fangs. If human society is also a stage of survival of the fittest, then emotional deficiency should be seen as a kind of evolution."

"Looking back at human history, the rulers of each era were all cruel."

"Right. If what accelerated animal evolution was issues of feeding and reproduction, what changes humans is money and power. Incomparable force to a beast's fangs, wouldn't you say? That's how emotions are quickly castrated, and Generation 1.5 humans are born."

"In the end... will only such people remain?"

"Who knows. I know it goes against humanity's banner. But if you put 100 Generation 1.5 and 100 Generation 1 people in the same space, what result would come out? Generation 1 would be finished in an instant."

It couldn't be denied.

"Emotions. How much that soft word weakens humans is something any human knows. Yet they can't abandon it. Just as herbivores love grass, emotions are the reason for living for humans. But predators have different tastes."

"They eat the animals that eat grass."

"Right. Even now."

Gis continued speaking while hiding his sinister inner thoughts.

"I deeply regret disturbing your peace of mind. Therefore, I stand here now..."

He bowed his waist.

"To formally ask for forgiveness. If you give me a chance to make amends, I will show you in the holy war."

At the unprecedented situation of a king apologizing, the reporters' pens practically flew.

Albino muttered.

"The finishing blow."

In reality, Gis, who was bowing his head deeply, felt as refreshed as if he could fly.

'Here, this is the feed you guys love. How is it? Feeling great? This is a first, right?'

A king apologizing to citizens.

'You guys live just fine if your pride gets stroked a little. But not me. I have to take all the most expensive things in the world. I have to claim all the women I like. I have to enjoy luxuries daily that humans couldn't enjoy even if they worked their whole lives.'

But pride?

'What nonsense. You idiots, waists and heads, you see, they're organs that were made to bend from the beginning. They're for picking up things that fall on the ground. Even a three-year-old can do it, yet you attach meaning to it...'

It's such an easy thing.

'Ah, good.'

Thinking he could reign over them again made his sexual desire boil.

'I am the king. I'll take everything from you. Why? Because I have the ability to do so.'

A reporter shouted.

"Don't mock us! Citizens aren't naive enough to fall for political gestures!"

Another reporter retorted.

"Watch your words! He is clearly the King of Jive! Show proper respect!"

'Hurry up and finish this. Go back and do it. So annoying.'

Soon the citizens' reactions to the articles would be boiling over, but Gis didn't care.

'Whatever words come out...'

There would never be a unified opinion.
