Free Electron (2)

The students felt their minds become crystal clear, as if they had taken some miraculous elixir.

'I've surpassed my limits.'

Their bodies trembled with an exhilaration they had never experienced with any buff magic before.

Lampa said, "You're certainly thoughtful, Five Great Stars."

Shirone's buff was dangerous. It was so exceptional that it could even change the minds of those who received it.

Amy said, "He's not using any power-enhancing buffs. It's an excellent educational judgment, I'd say."

When the demonstration ended and the buff's effects wore off, the teachers and students blinked their eyes. It felt like waking up from a dream.

"Huh...?"

The world viewed without that refreshing sensation felt somehow unnatural.

Shirone explained, "This is a buff that increases the density of the Spirit Zone. If you recall the feeling from just now, you should see good results."

How much training would it take to taste that state again?

Even so, being able to experience that particular level, even briefly, was an enormous privilege.

Unlike the excited students, Wizard was lost in serious thought with a grave expression.

"Can you do it?"

"Yes."

The answer came immediately.

"But why do I need to learn this?"

At what was perhaps the first doubt she had ever raised, the students and teachers turned to look at her.

"Brotherâ€”I mean, teacher."

The title "brother" was forbidden during educational hours.

"I know time is short. What you want is for me to grow strong enough to kill Harvitz."

It was meant to block emotional fluctuations, but this time it felt like she had crossed a line.

"Wizard."

"I'm sorry. I wanted to communicate properly. But... it's the truth anyway."

"I want to focus on mission success rather than survival. I know he's not weak enough to be killed while also looking after my own life."

Shirone remained unshaken.

"If that's really what you think, then solve my assignment as quickly as possible. That's the fastest way."

Their gazes clashed for a moment.

"Fine."

Wizard sighed and deployed arcane magic, drawing the same cross that Shirone had shown.

"Force."

Effects burst above the heads of those nearby.

Not only was the buff's effect amazing, but the speed at which thoughts collided surpassed even Shirone's.

"My goodness..."

You could see Wizard's desire to be fully recognized as a mage in her own right.

'She's applying it here.'

Countless diagonal lines emerged from the center of the cross as the form of thought began to construct a spherical shape.

The eyes of the Ten Circles of Magic shook with shock.

"That's... three-dimensional?"

"Certainly impressive."

Even Lampa had to acknowledge it.

"Three-dimensional thinking might be due to innate awakening, but applying it to Force is an entirely different matter."

That made Shirone's reaction all the more curious.

'A battle of nerves between master and disciple...'

Those who had the same thought remained silent even after the Force demonstration ended.

"Hah. Hah."

Wizard was breathing heavily but didn't take her eyes off Shirone.

"Is this enough now?"

"Excellent skill. Very well done."

"Then please teach me how to fight now. Not how to run from Satan, but how to fight."

"That was the plan from the beginning."

While Wizard looked confused, Shirone cast arcane magic.

"What...?"

Shirone, who had constructed the same three-dimensional thinking as Wizard, spoke in that state.

"The reason I taught utility magic was of course to increase survival probability. But..."

Wizard's face froze.

"What I really wanted to show you could be said to be this."

The teachers, who hadn't noticed because the Force was so fast, suddenly realized.

"Huh? Huh?"

The buffs that should have been collided in sequence were arbitrarily changing their order.

"Four-dimensional..."

Wizard muttered.

"Right. The fact that omniscience transcends space to change order means surpassing time."

It was the realm of Temporal Explosion.

"Siok is always by Harvitz's side. If you can destroy the barrier of time, the mission success rate will increase dramatically. The reason I chose utility-type magic is also because this method is best for training Temporal Explosion."

Though Wizard finally understood Shirone's deeper meaning, she honestly couldn't be certain.

"I don't know. Can I do it?"

Opening new senses belonged to the realm of species, not talent.

"You might fail. That's why it's a gamble, but I think it's worth investing time in."

For Wizard, who absorbed teachings like a sponge, even one hour was precious time.

'But I can't send her without addressing Siok. It's a problem that must be tackled.'

Wizard, who had been thinking seriously, raised her head.

"How long do I have?"

Shirone looked up at the sky and said, "I'll give you one day."

"What?"

Wizard's eyes widened as she made a crying face, but Shirone was an iron wall at times like this.

"Until tomorrow morning. Come to me when you find a method."

Wizard, who had been rolling her eyes left and right, suddenly asked, "I can use any method, right?"

When Shirone nodded, she rushed out of the training ground without looking back.

With Wizard's training temporarily concluded, Shirone walked over to Amy.

"Did you sleep well? Your hair has grown a lot."

"Oh."

Amy looked up and rubbed her invisible short hair with her fingers.

It wasn't a buzz cut, but compared to other female teachers, it still looked rather plain.

"I've been too busy to pay attention to it. Should we go out for lunch later?"

Amy shook her head.

"No. Wizard might have some changes, you know. I'd better stay at school today."

She was still considerate of Shirone, but her emotions were more restrained than usual.

"Then at least at the school cafeteria..."

"Fine."

Amy quickly turned around.

"See you then."

She hated the contradictory feeling of being disappointed after refusing herself, and she hated even more the thought of being caught with that feeling.

Lampa approached from behind Shirone.

"Amy seems to have a lot on her mind. There's no end to the advances toward the Five Great Stars."

"That's not it. I've never thought such things..."

"Ha ha! What's the point of explaining to me? Everyone wants to show their best side in front of their beloved. Perhaps she was bothered by her short hair?"

"No way. I think Amy's short hair is so admirable. It's the price for saving humanity."

"...Perhaps that's the problem. Anyway, even Buddha doesn't know a woman's heart."

Shirone felt somewhat guilty too.

"Actually, I haven't met Amy alone since coming here."

"Do you doubt your own feelings?"

"No. It's the opposite. My heart races every time I see Amy. But..."

If he threw his heart to her, the world and humanity's problems would seem trivial.

"Well, it would be strange if work went smoothly with someone you love waiting. You'll handle it well, but don't torture your own heart too much. Just because you can control your heart doesn't mean the pain disappears."

Watching Amy's retreating figure, Shirone pondered Lampa's words.

That night.

Shirone, Iruki, and Nade eliminated demon remnants in a remote rural village.

"Oh, Yahweh."

Since the pilgrimage began, Yahweh's name spread rapidly through people's mouths.

As rumors always do, events were exaggerated and embellished, but at least Shirone's sincerity was conveyed.

"A ray of light that descended into this turbulent world, please save us."

Without even bringing it up specifically, the fact that they already knew impressed Shirone's group deeply.

'The speed of spread is accelerating.'

One person speaks, but countless ears listen.

Nade raised his voice.

"The beginning is humble, but the end will be grand. At this rate, it'll be no joke in the cities."

Having a focal point for humanity was core to the Ultima Project, but Shirone remained wary of complacency.

"We can't be complacent. The Vatican's backlash won't be trivial either. It's late today, so let's stay here and move to the next location at dawn."

Still, he was genuinely pleased, so unlike other times, Shirone ordered alcohol.

Nade was getting tipsy.

"Ah, it feels good to drink after so long. Since I feel good, I miss our Liz. Don't you, Iruki?"

Though they were traveling by choice, from a lover's perspective, it was like being separated for life.

"Why would I miss your girlfriend?"

"Idiot, I mean Dorothy. This guy, he likes her too but pretends to be cold."

Iruki changed the subject.

"By the way, how's Amy? Are you still busy with Wizard's training?"

Nade suddenly realized.

"Hey, that's right! You're the only one not lonely? You'd better confess what you two are doing now. If you give me nonsense like 'events outside perception don't exist,' I'll beat you up."

Shirone chuckled.

"Yeah, she's fine. Training is progressing smoothly too."

At the unexpectedly bland answer, Nade put down his beer mug and spoke seriously.

"But don't you think we should clarify things at this point? You know, like those things. Want to enter a dungeon to find treasure? Or dig tunnels..."

Iruki looked at him pathetically.

"Why are you curious about that?"

"It's not curiosity! Obviously, there can't be secrets between us. What about you?"

"Me? Well."

When Iruki answered dismissively, Nade looked across at Shirone.

"Huh? What, what?"

Realizing from his reaction of avoiding eye contact, Nade opened his mouth in bewilderment.

"Don't tell me you..."

Have no attachment to the secular world.

"No, fine for you, but what sin did Amy commit? Did you two fight again?"

Even Iruki looked surprised.

"Ha ha, it's not like that. Actually, there were various circumstances. Plus, the schedule has been so busy..."

"Circumstances my ass."

Nade jumped up and approached Shirone, grabbing his ear.

"Ow ow! What are you doing?"

Nade's voice hit his eardrum.

"Hey, Shirone! Listen to me carefully from now on! Just do what your instincts tell you! If you just trust this naive main body, you'll die a lonely old bachelor!"

"Where's the main body?"

Shirone pushed Nade away and rubbed his ear.

"Do you think this is some communication device? We're all the same me. And it's not conveyed this way."

But.

"Sigh, acting like you don't know others' feelings."

Nade's voice was accurately transmitted to Shirone in the Kingdom of Stang, hundreds of kilometers away.

'Does he think I'm not human?'

Instincts, huh.

'Come to think of it, I might have been cold.'

Both Lampa and his friends were worried about Amy, who had been waiting, rather than about him.

"Alright! Let's just go for it."

Without even knowing what was good about it, Shirone left the lodging in a half-excited mood.

Amy's room had its light on.
