**Full Armament (4)**

Administrator Database.

Administrator Number Seven continued searching through Yahweh2's logs until finally reaching Moon Island.

The process of battling the mafia group decomposed into signals that flowed endlessly downward.

'He handles Donatello skillfully.' That much was good.

But Number Seven frowned at the Operator's appearance that followed.

'What the hell?'

Even when the Operator ruthlessly destroyed the Western Nation's user, Seven had only thought his temper was nasty.

Watching the logs that followed, Number Seven was gripped by an indescribable emotion.

This was the first time the Operator had told his story to someone.

No, weren't most of those in Under Coder refugees who had fled here because they hated reality?

'The real world.'

What did the Operator want to hear from someone who held the fate of reality in their hands?

When he confirmed the final log between them, Number Seven ground his teeth.

'Respect?'

This place was everything to him.

There was no reason to show respect to some human fighting desperately in reality.

Exiting the database, he saw the landscape of a factory located deep underground.

'Then what am I?'

Number Seven fell into silent contemplation.

---

Shirone, equipped with two legendary-grade parts, took the train back to the Eastern Nation.

Aegis met him, and they took another train to arrive at Nazca City, the Golden Wheel's intermediate base.

The city, with most buildings reduced to skeletal frames, was eerie, but surprisingly had many users.

"There are hunting grounds frequented by users in the 200-level range nearby. But what's even more famous is that it's a sanctuary for bounty hunters. There's a special unwritten rule - whatever happens here doesn't escalate into guild conflicts. That's why rankers who want to duel often visit."

Looking around, Shirone saw users who seemed too strong to be merely level 200.

Arriving at the Golden Wheel's hideout, Volga's son was emerging from his Mid Gear.

"Your aura's different. Good parts really make a difference."

Shirone shot back.

"You knew those people would betray us, didn't you?"

"There was no need to help all the way to the Western Nation. Items don't drop when you die anyway. The Operator's appearance surprised us too. What did you talk about?"

It seemed the mafia had uploaded a recording.

"Just... this and that."

When Shirone hesitated to answer, Fermi looked back with surprise but didn't probe deeper.

"Follow me. We don't have time, so let's start right away."

Entering the underground room, Fermi turned around holding one part in each hand.

"Take them. They're yours."

They were Power Gauntlets Raphael and Metal Wings Da Vinci, obtainable from Eastern Nation hunting grounds.

Raphael looked like rough mineral, while Da Vinci resembled feathers plucked from a goose.

"Should I equip them?"

When Fermi raised his hand encouragingly, Shirone first equipped Raphael.

Light spread, and seven metal spheres embedded like joints in various parts of Shirone's frame.

Both elbows, both sides, both knees, and finally the solar plexus where the High Gear was located.

"Power Gauntlets Raphael has the best durability among High Gear armor. It's probably nearly indestructible by user firearms. However, it's tricky to use."

This was already expected.

"The metal spheres embedded in your frame will protect you in any situation. But only one of the seven locations at a time. Information should have appeared in your augmented reality, so try it out."

"Hmm."

Activating the Raphael on his elbow, Shirone's entire right arm was covered in mirror-clear metal.

Fermi explained.

"Now your right arm is invincible. You can deliver physical attacks and block enemy bullets. But when one is activated, the other parts become vulnerable."

"But the part's durability remains, right?"

"Of course, but if you're barely reaching level 300 by the Solar War, ranker attacks will be fatal. You'll have no choice but to block with Raphael somehow."

"It's like a flag-raising game. Which part to activate in which situation."

"It looks simple, but the difficulty is maximum in a battlefield full of flying bullets. It would be easier for a Schema user, but since it's not a real body anyway, you'll adapt."

Shirone alternately activated each Raphael, gauging their defensive ranges.

"Upper body defense is the trickiest."

Fermi agreed.

"There are three options. Activating the left side covers half the upper body including the back. The right side is the opposite. Finally, the heart - the chest where the High Gear is located."

"The head is impossible."

Fermi nodded.

"Even with Raphael equipped, headshots are still possible. Of course, you can block with arms or legs, but depending on the situation, you need to consider evasion. What you need for that is..."

Shirone picked up the feather.

"Metal Wings Da Vinci."

Upon equipping it, the feather fluttered with effects as a new part was installed on Shirone's back.

There was no visible change in appearance.

"Da Vinci is called Metal Wings because it's not actual wings but a mechanical device. It's a propulsion system called Full Buster that uses explosive force. Open it."

When Shirone activated Da Vinci, the shoulder plates on his back opened and energy thrusters emerged.

"Power 100 percent."

As Shirone read the display, Fermi explained.

"Even at 100 percent, full operation will drain it completely in less than 10 seconds. Use it sparingly. It's self-charging, but takes quite a while to refill."

"How does it charge?"

"Solar power. According to High Gear's worldview, Da Vinci was made with Low Gear technology. Therefore, it can convert solar power to energy without going through Mid Gear."

"Hmm, should I think of it as an incredibly powerful booster? I heard legendary parts depend on user skill - does Da Vinci have difficult aspects too?"

"It does. Try using it once."

"Here?"

Fermi shrugged.

"All buildings in Nazca City are abandoned anyway. No one's going to demand compensation if something gets destroyed."

"Got it. Then..."

Shirone activated Da Vinci.

The moment blue light appeared in the thruster lens, the frame shot out at speeds exceeding Mach.

"Whaaaaat?!"

*CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH!*

Listening to the endless sound of walls being penetrated as it moved away, Fermi muttered.

"It's fast. Too fast."

10 minutes later.

The sound of Shirone trudging back could be heard from the cleanly drilled underground tunnel.

The entire frame was scratched up.

"You... want to die?"

If he had hit the wall at full propulsion speed, Shirone would have returned much faster.

'Because he would have died.'

But returning via the same path instead of the start point meant he had finished adapting.

Fermi saw that Shirone's right arm was covered in vivid silver metal.

'Incredible reaction speed.'

He had activated Raphael just before collision, protecting the frame while continuing to break through.

"Nothing beats real combat experience, right? Now you understand? Each function is excellent, but the four legendary weapons create synergy effects with each other. Depending on how the user utilizes them, they can offset level differences."

The reason Shirone disliked Fermi was because he was a liar who only spoke facts.

"Tch, you could have just explained this verbally."

Fermi pointed at Shirone.

"Plus, with Sibak and Baji in your time bomb, legendary-grade efficiency will increase too. But even so, your chances of defeating the Operator are less than 10 percent."

Shirone had clearly confirmed just how powerful the Operator's frame was on Moon Island.

Fermi looked around and asked.

"So, how far can you go? In reality, you went all the way, right?"

If High Gear's enlightenment was reality's Ip-do, then Gongjin, Mutae, and Ultima remained.

"If it's about understanding the world, Ip-do is the end. Beyond that is a matter of conviction. Gongjin is becoming one with the world. But to me, this world is..."

Not real.

"I could decide it's real, but I also can't - that's the heart. I'm here for reality. My goal is to defeat the Operator, excavate Apocalypse, and eliminate the demon realm from the world."

Fermi understood.

"Hmm, so you mean you have to settle things with what you have now. Anyway, fine. Golden Wheel just needs to transport you to the Operator."

The rest was Shirone's business.

"Let's go. You need to be at least level 300 to match the Operator's output. I'll assign you a teacher."

"Teacher?"

Following Fermi outside, Golden Wheel members were already waiting.

The first-string members flaunted their auras, with the Destruction Demon God group standing awkwardly behind them.

"Oh! Yahweh2."

Spotting Shirone, they ran over.

They had considerably leveled up while he was in the Western Nation, their parts much more luxurious than before.

"Wow! A Michelangelo Gun!"

But their appearance paled before Shirone equipped with all four legendary-grade parts.

Aegis approached.

"The reason for finding legendary grade first is not only difficulty but also faster leveling. You'll be touring hunting grounds with Wild West from now on."

Shirone looked back at the codename Wild West.

His entire body was skeletal, wearing a cowboy hat and equipped with a .44 caliber Magnum.

While staring at the High Gear glittering inside his ribcage, he approached.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Wild West."

A talking skeleton was bizarre, but nothing was impossible in High Gear.

"Ah, nice to meet you."

Death Princess said.

"We're going to level up too. Our goal is Magnan. We need to be good enough for the second string to participate in the Solar War."

West stood somewhat awkwardly and said.

"Leave it to me."

His posture like drawing a gun was amusing, but the codename was definitely familiar.

'Endurance West.'

Equipped with Skull Company armor, he was certainly specialized for hunting rather than dueling.

"Then let's depart. Minimum level 300 by the Solar War. After that, it's better to gain even one more level. Moving takes time too, so shall we start conquering from here?"

Shirone entered the hunting grounds near Nazca City following West.

The creature levels were 100 levels higher than Shirone's, but not impossible to hunt.

"Woooow!"

Like hunting with armor-piercing rounds at level 20, the experience gauge shot up rapidly.

As time passed, users gathered.

"Hey, look there. It's Yahweh2."

He was already famous on the forums and, most importantly, equipped with all four legendary parts.

"...Should we try?"

This was Nazca City anyway - fighting here wouldn't cause conflict with Golden Wheel.

"Hey, West."

Turning at the call, seven users from different guilds had gathered.

'Level 307, 311, 287...'

Small guilds, but prominent members within them had assembled.

"We don't want to interfere with Solar War preparations, but could we duel? With Yahweh2, I mean."

"Hmm."

After brief consideration, Wild West stepped aside.

"10 minutes."

"That's enough."

As the users approached, Shirone, who had already sensed their presence, turned around.

Wild West communicated.

*It's fine if you die, so try fighting once. Going to the start point is faster anyway. The level difference between you and them is roughly 2,000 levels. It's a meaningless cumulative method, but think of it as practice to reduce the gap with the Operator.*

The more duel experience, the better.

*Yes, I'll try.*

Crouching, Shirone activated Metal Wings Da Vinci and shot out at Mach speed.

*WHOOOOSH!*

The time it took to annihilate all enemies was 3 minutes.
