[515] A New Journey (1)

Miro's party returned to the integrated rebel headquarters.

This was possible because none of the rebels knew of the existence of God's Punishment.

The location Zulu had changed through the metagate as the landing point for God's Punishment was 300 meters underground in the deepest part of Zion beneath Jebul.

Even though the explosion was contained within a natural bunker, the seismic waves swept across all of Heaven—if it had struck the surface directly, the aftermath would have been unimaginable.

'Mr. Crude...'

Flu awkwardly received the rebels' joyful victory greetings while recalling his face.

If he had listened to Flu's words and confessed everything to his subordinates, Sirone's party would never have been transported to headquarters for treatment.

"For the night of victory! For humanity's future!"

Under the moonlight, drunken rebels roared at the top of their lungs.

Thinking of their fallen comrades, they couldn't bear it any other way.

Rebels who disliked the commotion gathered in quiet places to talk among themselves.

What puzzled them most was the massive earthquake that occurred at the last moment and the collapse of Arabot's spire.

Several people testified to seeing light falling from the sky, but no one thought it was magic.

In the headquarters' open ground, now free from worry of attacks, hundreds of torches blazed, and drinking continued throughout the night.

Meanwhile, Sirone's party was busy receiving treatment.

It was fortunate that Saint Moriak remained with Cage Team B.

"Aaahhh!"

Arius's screams filled the infirmary.

Though he had second-degree burns all over his body and cracked ribs, Moriak's hands casting healing magic moved with ruthless precision.

"I'm sorry. Please bear with it a little longer."

The process of skin rapidly regenerating and bones mending inevitably involved pain.

But the corners of Moriak's mouth, who was looking at Arius with pity, were actually twitching upward.

"Just bear with it a little... hehehe! Ah, sorry, hehehehehe!"

As Moriak's face transformed into a grotesquely laughing expression, Flu's face, who was waiting for his turn, turned pale.

According to Tarvan, her personality had become like this since her divorce from her husband.

In any case, her skills were excellent, and emergency treatment proceeded quickly.

Even Moriak, who had been laughing senselessly, gradually regained her seriousness as the patients' conditions became severe.

Sein's jaw was broken, Flu had bruises all over his body and fractures, and the martial artists Etela and Kang Nan had both hands shattered.

But the person with the most severe injury was Kuan.

The swordsman had lost one arm.

"Can't something be done?"

Shiina asked, looking at the arm placed on the makeshift bed.

Conversely, Moriak was examining Kuan's severed stump.

When physical loss occurred to this extent, recovery through magic was impossible.

"It was cut cleanly. The nerves don't seem too damaged either. If we could find a skilled surgeon as quickly as possible..."

"It's not necessary."

Though Shiina turned around, Kuan deliberately ignored her gaze and maintained his cold tone.

"It's an arm I severed myself. There's no point in reattaching it now."

It would be a lie to say he hadn't agonized over it.

A man with a limp and a one-armed man with a limp would be worlds apart from Shiina's perspective.

But ultimately, he decided to abandon the arm.

What had allowed him to protect Shiina from Mumeung was his realization as a one-armed man.

Even if he won her heart, what use would it be if he couldn't protect her?

'The war isn't over yet.'

I must become stronger.

No one could read Kuan's thoughts, but Armin seemed to sense something and smiled quietly.

"Emergency treatment is all finished. I haven't treated everyone, but..."

Moriak looked at two people lying on beds placed side by side.

There were some who couldn't be treated due to wounds carved not in their bodies but in their minds.

Those were Sirone and Gaold.

Even at this moment, they were trapped in their respective hells, paying the price for their resolve.

Miro concluded the situation.

"It can't be helped. At least they're not dead, so let's think about it slowly. For today, it would be best to rest."

Everyone knew they wouldn't be able to sleep, but no one complained as they headed to their respective rooms.

The shouting from the drinking that continued past midnight only sounded like surprise attacks, and most were whispering in gloomy voices under the night's silence.

It was natural to be exhausted as much as the tension had been released.

But only Miro was dragging Arius around like a dog on a leash, checking each of the party's rooms one by one.

After all, these were people who had come all this way to rescue her, so shouldn't she take some responsibility?

Arriving at Gaold's door, she hesitated with the hand she was about to knock with.

"..."

But soon she exhaled deeply and shook her wrist.

Knock knock.

Without waiting for an answer, she opened the door to find naked Gaold sitting unconscious on the bed while Kang Nan, having brought warm water, was wiping his body with a towel.

Miro looked at the bandages wrapped around Kang Nan's fists.

Her palm bones were almost completely crushed, and even Moriak's healing magic couldn't heal them perfectly, but she didn't even show signs of pain and was focused on wringing out the towel.

Probably because she was in front of Miro.

"Such devotion. Even when he wakes up, he probably won't appreciate it anyway."

Kang Nan's eyes filled with intensity.

"The Association President will return. Definitely."

Miro, who lightly brushed off Kang Nan's killing intent, smiled broadly.

"Right, he's not the type to collapse like this. But will you be okay? When he comes to his senses, he'll come running after me again saying he likes me."

"You...!"

As Kang Nan's anger reached its peak, Miro corrected her expression and raised her hand.

"Sorry. It was a joke. I didn't mean to hurt you."

Arius, sitting like a dog with his bottom on the ground in the corner, smacked his lips.

Besides her, Arius was the only one who knew there was substance to Miro's words.

Miro's mind, approached through Drimo, was the pinnacle of nobility without a trace of trauma.

But even she had a speck-like small tremor.

That was carved on the twentieth pillar of the temple built in Miro's mind.

'Mikea Gaold.'

A very small name that no one would have discovered if not for Arius the tomb robber.

That was the net that had pulled Miro out of her trance.

Since human minds are originally stained with countless wounds, it was a flaw like a speck of dust, but that made it all the more surprising.

'Adrias Miro, who reached the pinnacle of the unshakeable mind...'

Had been moved by Gaold exactly once.

Then... why don't you save him...

Miro smiled bitterly, recalling that night's events that had slipped out without her knowing.

The only regret left in her life.

'But you... you really did it.'

He had devoted a full twenty years to fulfill Miro's wish.

It wasn't something possible just by being strong—it was something only Gaold could do.

Miro looked pitifully at Gaold, whose gaunt face was covered with thick stubble.

'You fool, soft as cotton. How do you plan to live in this harsh world with such a tender heart?'

Well, wasn't that the man called Gaold?

Finishing her thoughts, Miro walked to the bed and stroked Gaold's head.

"It's probably a difficult place, but..."

Then she slowly bent her waist and kissed his forehead.

"Have a good journey."

After holding Gaold for a long time, Miro straightened up again and said:

"When you finish washing him, prepare to leave. We'll return at dawn."

The coordinates had already been extracted in Ingris, where she had gone with Sein to understand Ra's will.

"What about Sirone?"

At Kang Nan's question, Miro stopped walking and turned her head.

"I'll take him with me. He's too valuable a force to leave behind."

Not only the magic called God's Punishment, but he had also annihilated Uriel, one of the archangels.

If he was a nineteen-year-old boy who hadn't even graduated from magic school yet, she thought it would be fine to entrust humanity's future to him.

'But that doesn't seem like it'll be easy...'

Leaving Gaold's room, Miro entered Sirone's room.

Sirone was visible in deep sleep, and on the opposite bed, Flu was reading a book.

"Ah, what brings you here...?"

"Just patrol. How is he?"

Flu closed his book and looked at Sirone.

"Still no sign of waking up. The Armand won't release either."

Valhalla Action was an ability equipped to Armand.

Moreover, since even the avatar was integrated through Ilche Yusimjo, it wouldn't be released until Sirone paid all his debts.

Having heard the general situation from Flu upon arriving at headquarters, Miro could guess that much.

"Valhalla Action, you say. And for hundreds of years?"

"I don't know exactly. But an archangel named Ikael said that might be a hint."

"What do you mean?"

Flu summarized what Ikael had said.

Humans couldn't normally live for hundreds of years.

But Ikael said that if the result came out that way, the cause must have been established somehow.

"I see. Reversal of cause and effect..."

"Did something occur to you?"

Miro, who had been rolling her eyes while resting her chin on her hand, abandoned her thoughts and said:

"No, let's focus on returning for now. We're not in a leisurely position either."

"That's true. So when do we depart?"

"Starting now."

"What?"

"Since emergency treatment is finished, it would be better to send Cage Team B first. It's fortunate I brought several coordinates just in case."

"I see."

Once Cage Team B returned safely, there was no telling how things might change from then on.

Of course, with the strongest party plus Miro present, it was unthinkable that they could do anything, but just identifying the return point could narrow the scope of any encirclement, so moving separately was the right answer.

"Then get ready."

When Miro finished her patrol and left headquarters, Cage Team B was waiting at the main gate, having finished preparations to depart.

The war in Heaven was over, but the human world would become even busier from now on.

Tarvan approached.

"You're here. Let's depart."

When Miro took out Guffin's disc from her bosom and inserted it into the metagate, red light briefly flashed from the gaps in the iron plate.

"Done. Take it."

Tarvan caught the metagate Miro threw and asked:

"Where is it set to?"

"How should I know? The middle of a desert or inside a whale's belly? I set it roughly, so figure it out yourself."

Tarvan didn't get annoyed.

Honestly speaking, just being able to return was fortunate enough.

"What are you planning to do from now on?"

Miro, who had been heading toward headquarters, turned around.

"What do you mean?"

"Aren't you also a citizen of Tormia? How about returning together and cooperating with the kingdom instead?"

"A citizen of Tormia."

Of course, Miro's homeland was Tormia.

And that homeland had pushed her into a dimensional prison with no known end.

"I know you're disappointed. But not only you, but Gaold's team are also parties who encountered Heaven's incident. You'll be under surveillance from various countries from now on. Rather than that..."

"Huhu, I politely decline."

Miro turned around with a beautiful smile.

"I'm everyone's lover, after all."

Tarvan didn't make a second offer.

It was true that when history's strongest scale magician said no, no one could stop her.

'Gaold, you've awakened a monster.'

Miro had returned to the human world.

The political situation of countries worldwide would change rapidly from now on.

'Anyway, it's none of my concern.'

Once Cage Team B returned, the incident in Heaven would be reported to Tormia, and based on this information, they would be able to exercise influence in international society.

"We're returning."

When Tarvan activated the metagate and threw it on the ground, a black sphere was born as if tearing open space.

"It's not really inside a whale's belly, is it?"

As Cage Team B left Heaven and the metagate's black sphere disappeared, Miro's steps came to an abrupt halt.

"Phew, well then."

Another disc emerged from her bosom.

"Shall we also return home?"
