[574] The Omnipotent Monster (1)

"This is... impossible."

It was Eden's defensive magic that had never been destroyed by anyone in the graduation evaluation, or even in the graduation exam.

'He's come back as a monster!'

Before Hersy could make a judgment, Shirone rushed at Cayden.

"Stop him!"

The moment she shouted, she realized it was impossible.

Since they had lost to Shirone in Gang, no one on the allied team could harm him.

Heavenly Illusion Magic
Tantalizing密.

As Anchal's illusion magic unfolded, the scenery Shirone was looking at transformed obscenely.

"What the hell!"

Though not in clear form, what was conjured by the gestalt was imaginable lewdness.

Dense metaphors permeating the trees, rocks, and even the grass fields stabbed at his instincts, ignoring reason.

"Now! Run!"

Taking advantage of the momentary gap, Fisho moved his giant spider to grab Cayden and Eden and escape from the scene.

After the illusion of Tantalizing 密 disappeared, Shirone's face was completely flushed.

The rough pounding of his heart drummed against his eardrums.

'Anchal...'

He hadn't simply shown low-grade illusions to confuse the eyes.

He was a skilled practitioner who used gestalt, the specialty of illusion mages, to stimulate the fundamental psychology of humans.

'It's unfortunate, but destroying Eden's hand is a big gain. We can buy at least a day or more.'

Moreover, Cayden was also injured, so it would be difficult for him to participate in the match immediately.

'I need to reorganize the situation.'

A signal flare shot up above Shirone's head.

Midnight.

The allied team that had failed in the operation to kill Shirone gathered at their hideout with gloomy expressions.

Cayden sat powerlessly with bandages wrapped around his waist, while Eden knelt in a corner of the forest, continuously shedding tears in prayer.

"Troubling."

Fisho, riding his giant spider, descended from the treetops to the trunk through the lush leaves.

"We barely collected any Scrambles. At this rate, we'll likely fall behind on the 4th day too."

Hersy clicked her tongue.

Since they had all lost their hands after placing Gang on Shirone, an all-out battle was impossible for the time being.

'The other side will definitely place Gang on us.'

Since they had to prevent losing their Master Cards after attacking recklessly, collecting just a few Scrambles was the only achievement of the day.

"What are we going to do about the power loss?"

Anchal spoke up.

"Cayden is injured. Even if he receives recovery magic through the research members, it'll take a full day."

If it weren't for Anchal's illusion magic, not only Cayden but also Eden would have had their Master Cards stolen, so it was fortunate that it ended with just this much.

Hersy said to Anchal.

"Thanks to you, we survived. This strategy was my mistake. Stopping Shirone's movement with illusions was effective."

At that time, Anchal had also lost in Gang and couldn't harm Shirone.

"Honestly, it was a gamble. The definition of harm was ambiguous. But since they said secondary traps were allowed, I tried it prepared for disqualification."

'Hmph, he must have already finished experimenting.'

Still, the reason Anchal was complaining was because of the merit evaluation after Scramble Royale ended.

'If we win the match, the underground research societies will oppose each other again. The priority of investigation rights for Estas will be determined by how much each contributed to the victory.'

Though it was a powerful party of research society leaders, the limitations of an allied team still existed.

"I can fight."

Cayden said, grimacing.

"I don't need recovery magic. I'll catch Shirone again starting tomorrow."

His obsession was desperate to this extent.

"No, receive the recovery magic. There are still 4 days left, so there's plenty of room for recovery."

"I said I can fight. This little injury..."

"Cayden, this is an order."

Hersy was Fermi's proxy authority.

"Then I'll disobey the order. Even Fermi can't move me as he pleases."

Hersy's gaze turned cold.

"Be honest and admit it. If Shirone had hit you with the magic that destroyed Eden's barrier, you'd already be dead. Your torso would have been blown away, not just your ribs."

'Damn it!'

Since they had already lost, any words were useless. Cayden gritted his teeth as if his jaw would break.

"Oh God, forgive my pitiful indulgence. Grant me the teachings of infinite love..."

Eden's voice, offering prayers in a state of oblivion, pierced through the silence.

Hersy, who had been watching her, turned back to Cayden.

"Since you couldn't stop Shirone's solo run, we can't stick to the same strategy."

But it wasn't something anyone else could do either.

"I'll do it."

Eden, who had finished praying, approached.

"You?"

"From now on, I'll collect white cards again. If we make Infinite in the shortest time and protect it, we win, right?"

"But you were also broken. Another failure is dangerous."

"No, what was broken was my magic, not my faith."

"I understand how you feel, but..."

Eden's eyes glared fiercely.

"I can do it. From now on, I'll be different too. But there's a condition."

"Hmm."

Though still a team, they were ultimately senior class competitors.

Like Anchal's seal, Eden would have a secret card she didn't want to reveal.

'Proposing a condition means she wants to settle this here.'

Hersy, who judged this way, said.

"Alright, let's hear it first. What's the condition?"

"If I protect the Infinite hand until the 7th day, give me priority investigation rights for Estas."

Hersy's expression became troubled.

"Look, even for me, that's..."

"No, I'm proposing this to everyone here. The card gap has already started to widen. But I can definitely combine and protect the Infinite hand. It's a much better choice than paying the price for losing the match, isn't it?"

If Eden really had a hidden card, the probability of a successful comeback was certainly high.

'Eden will do her best. It's a matter of religious conviction.'

Hersy looked around at everyone and said.

"Let's vote. But it won't pass unless it's unanimous. Those in favor, raise your hands."

All the allied team members had their own calculations, but eventually they began raising their hands one by one.

'It doesn't matter if the priority is pushed back a bit. She'll never find it anyway. If successful, we get rewards, and if Eden fails, nothing changes from now. It's beneficial to entrust it to her for now.'

When Cayden finally raised his hand, Hersy said.

"Good, sold. We'll stick with Eden's strategy as before. Do it properly this time."

Anchal asked.

"Then who will mark Shirone? I don't know how he manipulates time, but he seems to always be able to make the strongest combination."

This was the biggest problem.

Even if Eden collected Infinite, if they couldn't stop Shirone, it would end in a tie, and then the match would be decided by the next ranking hand.

Hersy, who had been looking for a suitable person, spoke.

"Frings."

Since Cayden was injured, he was the team's only combat mage.

"No, I won't exclusively mark Shirone."

Frings said, stroking his mustache.

"I can't break him. He's too honest."

Fisho said.

"He certainly has soft spots. If we exploit that weakness..."

"He's not soft."

Hersy's face turned cold as she stared into the darkness.

"It's a bit... insulting."

This was also as Fermi had expected, but in such cases, she didn't feel good.

Cayden alone won't be enough.

Before Scramble Royale began, Fermi had said this.

"To stop Shirone, we need double, triple traps."

Hersy couldn't understand his words.

"In the first half's Gold Ring self-simulation, he was at most around 7th place. Anyway, 1st through 5th place are ours."

"That was until the first half."

"What could change? Besides, in this Scramble Royale, Cayden will use a sword. You know his swordsmanship skills, right?"

Fermi acknowledged that point too.

"Of course Cayden might subdue Shirone. Without Armand, mages are weak against physical force."

"Then what's the problem?"

"But he will... eventually find a solution."

"You, didn't you hate Shirone?"

Fermi smiled.

"I don't hate anyone. I just make them hate me. Anyway, Shirone won't stop. If his growth speed is accelerating, it's safe to think he's always ahead of expectations. In short, it's defensive investment."

The key to his judgment was that Miro had taken Shirone with her.

"Then what do we do if Cayden doesn't work?"

Fermi pointed at Hersy with his index finger.

"When that happens, do this."

Hersy, emerging from her thoughts, said.

"Alright, we'll give up on exclusively marking Shirone. Instead, Frings, there's something you need to do."

"If it's something I can do. What's the strategy?"

A chilling smile formed on Hersy's lips.

"If he's going to act like an old fogey... we have no choice but to attach a real old fogey to him."

The faces of Shirone's group gathered at the hideout were generally bright.

"Good, we've turned it around! Let's keep going like this!"

Amy, who had joined the team last, was currently the most excited.

While everyone smiled, guessing the reason, Nade looked at Shirone and said.

"Perfect timing. With one Explosive Blast, you destroyed over ten cards."

"Still, it's a bit disappointing. I wanted to drag it to the 4th day so there'd be no chance of a comeback, but they made the first move."

Iruki said.

"From now on, they'll be careful of Gang too. But we can use that as a tactic as well. Anyway, let's keep pressing our advantage. We destroyed Eden's barrier too."

"It's disappointing that I didn't see her naked... Ow!"

Sabina hit the back of Nade's head.

While everyone enjoyed the harmonious atmosphere, there was one person who was notably quiet - Dorothy.

Iruki, who had noticed her slow reactions since the 3rd Scramble was summoned today, asked.

"Dorothy, did something happen?"

"Huh? No."

"I have something to ask. Why did you retreat so quickly in the 3rd round?"

Dorothy answered in a sensitive voice.

"It was dangerous."

"I'm not criticizing you. I trust your judgment. But if there's a problem, we should solve it before..."

"I said it's nothing!"

When everyone looked at her in surprise, Dorothy immediately realized her mistake and bowed her head.

"Sorry, I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize."

Amy said.

"It's okay. You can get sensitive when battles heat up."

Nade added.

"Right. Let's rest well today and do well tomorrow too. We can win."

As Shirone's team disbanded after the day's battle, only Iruki remained at the site.

Day 4 of Scramble Royale, battle begins.

"The 2nd Scramble has been summoned."

Shirone, who had already collected six cards, focused on destroying the opponent's Scrambles.

The closest coordinates were in the forest near the integrated training ground.

"Let's go!"

Shirone, more excited because they were winning, instantly covered the distance and found the sparkling Scramble.

"Found it!"

At that moment, the ground shook and a beetle three times larger than a human emerged.

'It's Fisho!'

Only participants could collect Scrambles.

As the beetle that had swallowed the Scramble turned to flee, Shirone immediately launched Homing Photon Cannons.

However, the Scramble's position could be moved by factors other than participants.

This was a fact already confirmed by Dorothy's experiment, and coordinates of moved Scrambles were not recorded on Master Cards.

'I have to catch it before it escapes underground.'

Among the Homing Photon Cannons Shirone fired, four struck trees and the remaining three embedded in the beetle's carapace.

Kieeeeee!

As the beetle collapsed screaming, Shirone ran toward it, but a pale light began spreading from gaps in its exoskeleton.

Insect Magic
Explosive Bug.

A beetle evolved to have self-destruction capabilities.

Usually applied to small insects, but the current scale would blow away a 5-meter radius.

"Ugh!"

Beetle fragments struck Shirone's body.

'This isn't improvisation. This is an ambush.'

Because he knew the Insect series, he could be certain.

Insect mages use their 'mental ecosystem' to induce specific evolution from the egg stage.

To differentiate self-destruction capabilities in an insect of this size would take at least 2 hours or more.

'What are they targeting?'

Shirone's eyes widened as he expanded his Spirit Zone to find Fisho.

'There's one more person?'
