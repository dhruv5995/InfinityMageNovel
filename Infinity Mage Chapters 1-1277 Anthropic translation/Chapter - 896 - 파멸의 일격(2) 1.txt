Destructive Strike (2)

"An integrated mental system is..." Sirone trailed off.

If the world's forward progression principle was constructed as a system, there was one more fact that needed to be revealed.

"The heart."

The Chief Justice said.

"Right. While material information is based on light, the heart is formed through quantum signals. It ultimately comes down to this."

A hologram appeared in the air.

"When we perceive, quantum signals activate and combine with information coming through light to manifest the world."

Sirone gazed indifferently at the hologram of the planet.

"This hologram isn't real. If you zoom in, you can look around every part of the planet, but ultimately when viewed from outside, it's just a single stream of signals."

The Chief Justice turned to look at Sirone.

"The 10th sense perceives the minimum units of all signals that make up the world. That's why you're an administrator."

"Answer me. Why did I erase my memory?"

"Even the answer to that question could cause cognitive distortion in you. I can tell you if you want. But before that, I want to make it clear that you wanted it. Not anyone else, but your past self."

Then Sirone didn't particularly want to dig into it either.

However, since it was his past self's choice, he could well imagine what the reason might have been.

"To stop Nane, I suppose."

"Right. The moment you opened the 10th sense, there are now two administrators of this world. And the methods to reach Ultima will also differ."

"If Nane reaches Ultima..."

"He'll become a true Buddha. Perfectly righteous. That's the problem. In a world that has lost its vitality, users can no longer exist."

"Users? They can't exist?"

"If emptiness becomes perfect, the biological program Argones is expected to activate. It would annihilate all life in the universe. To express it in terms of the outside world's standards, it would forcibly disconnect users and make them leave."

Fisho's warning finally made sense.

"Do you believe there's an outside world?"

"I don't know. It's not a matter of belief. Terraforce is on the side of protecting the world. A kind of user protection program. Just as Argones activates when emptiness becomes perfect, if evil becomes perfect, we destroy it."

"Judgment?"

"I know you dislike it. But strictly speaking, it's not judgment. The essence of evil is chaos. Intelligence cannot survive in a world of chaos. We're not judging - it's a means to protect this world."

Sirone realized why the Chief Justice had come.

"The end is approaching."

"That's right. If emptiness wins, the universe closes, and if evil wins, humanity perishes. It's not bad. It's just that from Yahweh's standpoint, neither is welcome."

"I'll fight. I'll stop Nane and stop Havitz. To do that..."

He had to reach the Ultima system before anyone else.

"Terraforce hopes for that too. But it's not easy, integrating the hearts of all users."

The Chief Justice turned around.

"When the hearts of users, those countless signals, are integrated into one, Ultima becomes perfect. That's why the Gaians were able to break free from their administrator Ankera. And also, it will probably be the only way you can completely suppress Nane."

Sirone mulled over the Chief Justice's words.

"Prepare yourself, Sirone. The end is coming. On the day of judgment, everything will become clear."

When the Chief Justice activated the mechanism, the iron walls of the cavity slid apart to reveal a front glass window.

In the middle of the Arctic expanse covered entirely in ice, an ivory tower stood tall.

"Grraaah!"

In a cave in the central continent, Gaold was groaning.

"He's been stuck like this for three days already."

Kang Nan's words meant that Gaold had been feeling terrible pain for three days.

"Aaaaaaah!"

Following the scream, the cave shook violently.

"Gaold!"

Just as Kang Nan was about to rush in, Zulu grabbed her shoulder and shook his head.

"It's dangerous. There's nothing we can do to help."

He'd probably lost his reason, and if Air Press activated even once, it would mean instant death.

"But..."

"I'll go check."

As Miro took a big step forward, Kang Nan glared fiercely and snapped.

"Don't you know that you going will only make things worse? Why won't you leave and keep sticking around?"

Why indeed?

Having traveled together this far, Miro had been treated worse than a mongrel by Gaold.

'That bastard!'

The pain wouldn't be bearable.

In that hell of terrible agony, she could imagine just how hateful the woman named Miro would seem.

'Just endure to the end!'

A selfish thought.

But it was precisely because Gaold was like that that he had left a crack in his perfect, flawless mind.

'What am I doing because of you!'

She was enduring with selfish feelings, but if his inner demons grew worse, even the spirit of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara that observed all things would shatter.

"I'm going to give him a beating!"

At Miro's words, Kang Nan shouted.

"I told you to wait! You could die doing that! Don't you know Gaold's power?"

Miro looked back with cold eyes.

"Think I'm the same as you? That kind of guy, I could beat him to a pulp right now."

"Gah!"

In any case, since she was a woman who could match Gaold's breaking of precepts, Kang Nan had nothing to say back.

"Graaaah!"

At Gaold's scream, the cave echoed again.

"This is so annoying I could go crazy!"

Rolling up her sleeves and taking big steps, Miro saw Gaold crouched at the end of the cave.

"Hey! What are you going to do staying like this for days! When did you say you'd protect the world! You're so pathetic!"

"Get lost."

His hoarse voice echoed through the cave.

"Disappear from my sight! Get lost! Disappear from the world!"

Having shouted that, Gaold poured out all sorts of curses too foul to repeat.

Miro clenched both fists tight and bit her lips as she took in every word.

"Hah! Hah!"

Gaold let out rough breaths, and even that was like swallowing razor blades in pain.

"Are you done? Do you feel a bit better now? How did you hold back normally when you wanted to tear into me like that?"

"...Get lost."

Gaold's dying voice made Miro angry.

"Don't be mistaken. I didn't follow you because I wanted to. I wanted to finish this properly. And I've decided now. You really won't do. Let's end this here."

"Fine, so please just go..."

"Hey! You really!"

Miro glared with fierce eyes and moved quickly as if to swing her fist.

"Even if I'm leaving, I have to hit you once!"

She lit up the surroundings with flash magic and reached toward Gaold's collar.

Miro froze, unable to do anything.

"Huu..."

Gaold's appearance, curled up and trembling in his withered state as if even light was painful...

"...Hey."

He was in a state that could hardly be called human.

"You idiot."

Unable to control her emotions, Miro's face crumpled into tears and tears flowed down.

"What the hell is this state you're in?"

Gaold lowered his head as if ashamed and hid his face, but that made him look even more pitiful.

'I'd rather be dead...'

Even death seemed like it would be a blessing.

"Why are you such an idiot?"

Miro embraced Gaold's body that was nothing but bones and rested her cheek on his shoulder.

"Sob! Huuu!"

Feeling Miro's trembling transmitted through his skin, Gaold clenched his mouth shut.

"Waaaah! Aaaah!"

Probably for the first time in her life, having completely revealed her emotions, she couldn't hold back her tears.

Humanity's strongest seeker.

A crack was forming in the superhuman mind that had never tolerated even the slightest flaw.

That evening.

"Huff. Huff."

With Gaold wrapped in a blanket trembling by the campfire, Kang Nan held out a spoon.

"Here, eat."

Gaold's mouth slowly opened, and Kang Nan supported the bottom of the spoon as she slowly fed him.

Sitting across from them, watching through the gap between her knees, Miro's eyes grew coldly distant.

"Hmph. How nice to see. You two might fall in love at this rate."

"What's it to you?"

Kang Nan replied indifferently as she put the spoon in the bowl of porridge and stirred it.

'Jealousy?'

Honestly, it was satisfying, but it was ironic that the great Miro would feel jealous.

Gaold raised his gaze.

"Miro."

At the first time he called her since coming out of the cave, Miro brightened and stood up.

"What? Should I feed you? I'm better after all, right?"

"Just leave."

Miro furrowed her brow.

"That again? Whether I leave or not is my decision..."

"You're in a dangerous state."

Realizing Gaold had caught on, her lips that had been speaking clamped shut.

"You're different from me. If you can't maintain an optimal mental state, you can't fight. You want to save the world, don't you? Go back to your place."

"What's my place?"

"Ultimate good. Human emotions don't suit you. If you're obsessed with one thing, you can't see the whole."

One reason Miro's avatar Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara was powerful was because it had no blind spots.

She observed the world from all directions and could plan attacks in any situation.

Miro plopped down in her seat.

"I'll handle my own business."

The heart was like that - if it was something that could be easily reversed, she would have done it long ago.

"If you can't do it."

Gaold pointed his index finger.

"Should I help you?"

Terrifying killing intent emanated as massive air compressed at his fingertip.

At the power that made even the surrounding atmosphere tremble, Kang Nan gulped, and Miro stared at his fingertip.

'Gaold really will kill me.'

If the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara avatar manifested normally, she could dodge something like an Air Gun.

But being able to do that would mean she had already killed Gaold in her heart.

"You."

Just as Miro was about to speak, demonic shrieks came from the cliff they had their backs to.

"Kieee!"

Though still distant from the main battlefield, demons were everywhere in the central continent.

"Damn! Move!"

As Kang Nan got up, Gaold, Zulu, and Miro scattered in all directions.

Like a waterfall, demons poured down the cliff, and those with flight abilities covered the sky.

'Air Gun!'

Gaold turned the hand he had aimed at Miro toward the cliff and shot air bullets.

KWAAAAANG!

The cliff was destroyed with a single shot, but demons endlessly pushed through the smoke.

'Roughly over 100,000.'

They seemed to be moving somewhere.

"We fight!"

Zulu's summon Cougar leaped into the spot where Air Guns were endlessly firing.

"Graaaah!"

Kang Nan, protecting Gaold's side, destroyed the survivors who avoided the bombardment with her fists.

"The location's not good! Let's do this while retreating!"

The distance to allies was too close to finish it with Air Press that breaks precepts.

"Where's Miro?"

Zulu, who was retreating following Gaold, asked.

Only then realizing, Kang Nan looked around and pointed somewhere with surprised eyes.

"Th-there...!"

Above the demons' heads, the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara avatar was swaying precariously.

"Come at me!"

Miro's avatar attacked the demons, but the power couldn't be called ultimate good.

"Hahaha! That tickles!"

"That's...!"

The moment she turned her head, a giant club was falling before her eyes.

'I missed it!'

A blind spot had formed.

"Die!"

Just before Miro's head was crushed, an afterimage flew over and quickly wrapped around Miro's body.

KWAAAAANG!

Air Shield's shockwave burst, and Miro confirmed who had embraced her.

"G-Gaold?"

In Gaold's eyes as he checked on Miro, a moment of relief flickered past.
