[726] Face-Off (3)

Labyrinth Andre.

"Huff! Huff!"

Kido hid in the maze-like complex passages of Andre, breathing heavily.

'Is it still far off?'

It was already approaching the 6th day since Sirone had activated the Wheel of Fear.

"He's not dead, is he."

One Sirone needed to remain here to maintain the Spirit Zone, but he hadn't been seen since the battle began.

"Over there! Chase him!"

At the voices of the Maga Bandit Group, Kido limped deeper into the labyrinth.

Their numbers had been reduced from 40 to just 7, but blocking Andre's entrance was still impossible.

'Damn it! There were too many enemies!'

In a situation where the objective numbers and overall combat power were all disadvantageous, the one consolation was...

'At least there's plenty of food.'

The fact that Kido could eat human flesh.

"I'm getting tired of this too."

He grabbed the arm of the corpse in his hand and tore off a piece, the muscle ripping away with a squelch.

Of course, the Maga Bandit Group would supply food from outside Andre, but for Kido the Devourer, the corpses of masters were important.

'A Schema technique, External Gravity.'

New memories seeped into his mind.

'So that's how they could withstand the earthbound spirits. Definitely an annoying technique.'

But now Kido could also use Schema.

'I learned Schema through human flesh.'

Even with the same experience, one cannot open Schema through memory alone because the mental imagery differs according to qualia.

'Like a textbook, I suppose?'

But if you combine the memories of dozens of the Maga Bandit Group's top fighters, it's a different story.

No matter how different their perspectives on Schema, there must be common denominators.

"I should end this here."

The Maga Bandit Group would also know that this final clash would determine victory or defeat.

As he limped toward Andre's entrance, the Maga Bandit Group was having their last supper.

It was nothing but cracker crumbs gathered from outside, but it would be enough to squeeze out their final strength.

"...Have you made your decision?"

As the remaining 6 subordinates revealed their killing intent, the vice-captain stood up with his sword.

"The final battle will be here."

While their numbers decreased from 40 to 7, Kido's skills had evolved at an unbelievable pace.

'I don't know why, but that goblin devours others' experiences.'

Otherwise, there was no explaining why his abilities jumped dramatically each time a member died.

'If only we had realized it a little sooner...'

It was a miscalculation to think that trapping him in the labyrinth and wearing down his stamina would exhaust him naturally.

Anyway, it was in the past, and if the remaining 7 couldn't kill him with their full assault, the Maga Bandit Group would be annihilated.

As Kido accepted their do-or-die killing intent, he heard explosive sounds from outside Andre.

'Lian.'

He was still fighting the Cruel Woman.

'It must be difficult...'

Unlike Kido who could hide in the labyrinth, Lian wouldn't have been able to sleep or eat for 6 days.

'Wait a little longer. I'm coming.'

As Kido steeled his resolve and drew his spear, the vice-captain approached with his sword held diagonally.

"Where is the mage?"

The Maga Bandit Group hadn't been able to find Sirone either.

"I don't know either. Doesn't matter, right? Whether you die or I die, that's all that's left."

"That's true."

The vice-captain's sword pointed at Kido.

"Though you're a goblin, I pay my respects to your skill in driving the Maga Bandit Group this far."

"Keh!"

A sneer escaped naturally.

"That's exactly what I don't like."

Kido moved sideways following his spinning spear and instantly blocked Andre's entrance.

'He's gotten stronger.'

Simultaneously drawing out all the techniques of the 7 Maga Bandit Group members, they all rose up at once.

"Paying respects, doing this and that...!"

As Kido rolled on the ground swinging his spear, the earthbound spirits' Avatar Art activated around him.

"Stab simultaneously! Don't hope to survive!"

The 7 members fell like lightning on Kido who spun fiercely, and immediately one head was severed.

"Kill him! Keep attacking!"

Kido, crouched with his left hand on the ground, spun his right-hand spear and shot forward.

"Relativity theory! Quantum theory!"

The vice-captain's vertical slash cut through the center of the double-edged spear with a clang.

"What about the universe! What about God!"

Kido grabbed the split spear with both hands and twisted his upper body as blood spurted along his shoulder.

"Now! Drive it in no matter what!"

Facing the Maga Bandit Group charging in a line, Kido gripped the split spear and shouted.

"Arrogant humans!"

As the earthbound spirits' Avatar Art reached its peak, an illusion of the floor rising like waves swept over them.

"Dodge! If we dodge this, we win!"

Kido floated in the air as if lying down, rotating both shoulders and rolling rapidly across the floor.

"Living with both feet planted on the ground..."

Six blades flew toward Kido like lightning.

"Why do you only look up at the sky!"

Two spears rotating like a windmill drew circles and pierced through the lightning.

"..."

At the point where the positions of the Maga Bandit Group and Kido were exactly reversed, everyone's movements stopped.

"Paying respects?"

"Guh!"

Starting with the vice-captain's chest bursting open, all the members spewed blood and collapsed to the floor.

"Losing someone precious."

Kido, sitting collapsed toward Andre's entrance, dropped the split spear to the floor.

"Isn't mourning for death alone sufficient..."

That was the love Kido had realized.

'I must go.'

Kido forced strength into his fallen arms, grabbed the spear again, and left Andre's entrance.

The scene on the 6th day since the battle began, under the rising sun, was truly miserable and terrible.

'Is this really...'

A landscape created by two humans fighting with their bodies?

'Hand-to-hand combat. It's like being hit by bombing.'

No survivors remained among the scattered tourist corpses, and buildings and ground were completely devastated.

'Lian, wait a little longer.'

The moment Kido heard the distant roar and limped away from Andre's entrance.

"Huh?"

Blood flowing from his forehead obscured his vision, and he collapsed to the ground without even being able to bend his knees.

'Sirone.'

Though Kido had single-handedly annihilated the Maga Bandit Group, he had now reached his physical limits.

'Definitely, survive...'

Kido's consciousness was sucked into darkness.

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 1583.

At Sirone's suggestion to bring out all their cards, the 4 White participants looked dazed.

"Bring out all our cards?"

Marco knew that threatening a mage was useless, but he couldn't comply obediently.

"What kind of ridiculous threat is this? In the Law battles, weapon cards are like life itself."

"I'll accept the proposal."

Surprisingly, Ballard, who had shown the most hostility toward Sirone, obediently took out cards from his pocket.

His job as a guard gave him different instincts than others, and the effect was considerable.

"I-I'll also accept the proposal."

As Breeze and Atria successively brought out their cards, Marco ground his teeth.

"...If we do it this way, the aftermath won't be good. Can we live showing our faces in White together?"

"That can be decided by vote."

Marco, properly countered, hung his head in resignation and brought out all his cards.

"Nine cards total."

As Sirone examined each card Breeze handed over, disappointment showed in his expression.

"What's wrong? There's even an S-rank card. It's precious enough to trade for any card."

It was a card Ballard had been reluctant to show until the end, depicting a man's face with tears of blood.

Crimson Tears (Function).

Description: When you lose someone precious, you cannot see what's before your eyes.

Effect: All job ability stats increase 10-fold.

Even to Sirone, it was a tremendous effect.

'Cai...'

If Cai had Crimson Tears, he could have deceived enemies with the Conjurer's special ability.

"This is meaningless."

Sirone got to the point.

"The card I'm looking for is CPR. Have you ever used it, or heard of anyone having it?"

"CPR? That's..."

Breeze fell into thought.

"Is there someone you want to save? Probably from Black?"

"A child who helped me. I got him killed through my mistake. I need to get CPR somehow."

Ballard grumbled.

"You think everything works just because you want it? If it's not shuffled into the Harmony of Law, that's the end. If you're not using it, give me back Crimson Tears..."

Breeze interrupted Ballard.

"There's not no method at all."

"What method?"

"First is if CPR is shuffled in. If the Black side has it, you can trade it for Crimson Tears. Though 10 times basic stats is excellent, if it's a job with special abilities, it's a card you must obtain."

Even the Conjurer job alone could turn ten cards into Magic cards.

"Second is if it's not shuffled, the probability is low, but you can use Space Waste that I had."

"Space Waste?"

Sirone, who hadn't found any particularly important cards among those received, went through the nine cards one by one again.

Space Waste (Consumable).

Description: Sometimes it's good to leave some drawers empty.

Effect: By discarding a B-rank or higher card, you can obtain a Lucky Slot.

"Lucky Slot? What kind of card is this?"

"It's an effect that gives S-rank cards at low probability. Marco has Double Action, so you can use them together to increase the probability."

Double Action (Consumable).

Description: If your judgment is quick, there are plenty of opportunities to recover.

Effect: B-rank or lower card effects doubled.

"So using Double Action and Space Waste simultaneously means I can get two Lucky Slot cards."

"Right. If you have a First Aid card, you can get up to three, but we don't have one."

First Aid's effect was to revive consumable cards once when used.

"To activate Space Waste, you need to discard one B-rank or higher card. Influenza or Wild Horse would be appropriate."

"Then I'll use this."

Sirone pulled out a card.

Influenza (Function).

Description: Be careful. Sometimes it's fatal.

Effect: When activated, opponent's physical abilities decrease 10%. 3% chance of 90% decrease.

Special Note: Limited to one use per target.

"Activate."

Space Waste, Double Action, and Influenza cards simultaneously emitted light and transformed into new cards.

'This is Lucky Slot.'

Sirone looked at the two identically duplicated Lucky Slot cards.

Lucky Slot (Consumable).

Description: Let's postpone the match for a moment.

Effect: 100% probability of obtaining B-rank or higher cards.

1% probability of obtaining S-rank cards.

"Activate."

As Sirone immediately used one card, the 4 participants simultaneously stood up to check the card.

"What? What came out?"

It was a picture of armored skeletons walking through mud.

Necromantic Veteran (Summon).

Description: Remnants who survived hellish battles. Morale is low and they're wounded, but their combat power is formidable.

Effect: Summons 10 Necromantic Veterans.

Marco snorted.

"Tsk! Figures. It's the most useless B-rank. They're slow, so they're only suitable for defense."

With one card remaining, Breeze asked.

"What will you do? How about saving it and using it when you get First Aid or a duplication effect card?"

"No, it's fine. I'll keep rolling until it comes out."

Marco frowned and asked back.

"What nonsense? With just a 1% probability..."

"Activate."

As the last remaining Lucky Slot card flashed brightly, the participants' mouths fell shut.

'Come out! Come out!'

The moment the card, which had been glistening as if oiled, confirmed B-rank, Sirone's eyes widened.

'Damn it!'
