Rain (1)

"It's not so much difficult as it is close to impossible."

Nane continued speaking.

"What a great contradiction it is - to be able to destroy what you love most." The more you love, the further you drift from emptiness.

"That's why, although I've nearly reached it, I still need countless eons before I can become Buddha."

Shura asked.

"Then will Shirone reach it first?"

The ultimate.

"He's still far off. I can vaguely guess what he must be feeling in this world dominated by evil."

The greater the love for all things, the greater the sense of betrayal, and his rage would be racing toward emptiness.

"Then will Shirone end up destroying the world?"

Just like Nane had in the past.

"He might. But I know how difficult that truly is. If there's one difference between him and me..."

Nane looked up at the sky.

"It's that this world loves him."

Even if Yahweh's wrath heads toward the world's end.

World Climate Organization.

With help from the Holy See, the organization had relocated its headquarters, where over 300 mages were now stationed.

Their mission of manipulating weather was to increase agricultural production in regions free from demon invasion.

That surplus food would become the Valkyries' provisions, making this an indispensable department in the world war.

"Manager! Please look at this!"

Amira, in her first year on the job, gathered signals sent from observation stations worldwide and shouted.

"What is it? Did some disaster strike somewhere?"

The document was filled with numbers and diagrams, but the manager could visualize the picture in his mind.

"Wh-what is this?"

Typhoons.

In the sea between Gustav and Jincheon, massive typhoons unlike any in recorded history were moving.

"And there are seven of them! How is this possible?"

Amira pointed to the detailed data.

"Their movement speed is on a completely different level from existing typhoons. They'll make landfall in Gustav in a few hours. Their power will exceed at least Category Six." This wasn't a naturally occurring phenomenon.

"It's magic then. But who on earth could..."

Even for the World Climate Organization, generating typhoons of this scale in succession would be difficult.

"What should we do? If they make landfall like this, civilian casualties will be enormous. We have no choice but to dispel them."

"Can you dispel them?"

Amira stammered.

"W-well, before they grow any larger, we could plant seeds to slowly put them to sleep... But eliminating all seven would be impossible. It would be better to establish evacuation measures instead."

The fact that the typhoons were heading for the Gustav Empire, the source of evil, also played a part.

"Manager! Over here!"

Another employee shouted with a pale face, and the manager rushed over frantically.

"Damn it! What now?"

Amira stared intently at the documents the manager had thrown down and bit her lip.

'What's happening?'

It was one disaster after another.

Jincheon Sea.

Watching the typhoons moving beyond the horizon, 8th Corps Commander Mithura stood up from his giant clam.

"Here comes another one. How many shots are they going to fire?"

"What should we do? At this rate, Gustav will be completely destroyed. Then Satan will be furious..."

When Mithura glared, the demon jumped in fright.

"No, of course I trust you, Commander Mithura."

What the demons were suggesting was opening a demon realm before things got worse.

'This is annoying.'

It was a privilege only the ten corps commanders possessed, but it also symbolized eternal annihilation.

'I won't even be able to resurrect from hellfire.' The demon realm was opened with the resolve to die together if you were going to die anyway, and Mithura wasn't feeling up to it yet.

"Commander! Over there!"

Beyond the horizon, four of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars were approaching, creating rough foam.

Minerva, aboard Jet, spoke.

"Don't worry about the others. Our job is to eliminate the corps commander."

Freed, running across the water's surface, gripped his sword while keeping the demons in sight.

"They must have learned from Kashan, right? It's best to finish this before they open the demon realm."

Mithura's demon realm was a tsunami.

Once opened, all coastal cities around the world would be completely destroyed.

Mithura stood up, holding his massive harpoon.

"Fine! Boys, let's sortie! Let's have a proper fight!"

A muttering voice could be heard from afar.

"Just open the demon realm already."

When Mithura's harpoon swept horizontally, the necks of demons lined up dozens of meters away flew off.

"Hiik!"

No demons harbored complaints any longer.

"Consider it a greeting!"

Mithura lowered his stance and sliced the water's surface like cannon fire, creating a massive wave.

"It's coming!"

Freed's ice magic froze the dozens-of-meters-high wave solid with a crack.

KWAAAAAAAANG!

Minerva burst through the ice wall, stopping in mid-air and firing Jet.

Gustav Capital.

"AAAHHH! S-save me...!"

Voices disappeared before the screams could finish.

Ryan ran through the scene where people covered by insects and blackened like charcoal were collapsing.

"Incredible numbers."

The otherworldly insects, Palafinas, were endlessly multiplying and covering the entire city.

'How do I eliminate these?'

While he could cut down powerful foes, against countless insects, a sword was the worst possible tool.

"HIYAAAAH!"

A sword containing the realm of Mach bisected the landscape, but the fly-like insects endlessly clung to Ryan.

"Krugh!"

Eventually his entire body was writhing with bugs, and the sensation of blood being drained left his mind hazy.

'It's fine.'

This much wouldn't break his Idea, but ordinary humans would die within ten seconds.

Moreover, since Palafinas kept multiplying, if not suppressed early, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it meant the world's destruction.

"Damn demon realm."

Ryan accelerated through the wall and brought down his great straight sword with all his might. The atmosphere split with a roar, opening his field of vision enough to see blue sky for a moment.

"What..."

Without even thinking to raise his sword, Ryan stared blankly toward the distant sky.

"What is that?"

It was probably an avatar, but he didn't feel like wanting to know what it was.

Shirone's body was in a completely weightless state, like luminescent smoke.

Above him as he hung his head, what was endlessly rising was rage.

Melania muttered.

"Yahweh's wrath."

Black smoke rising at a terrifying speed pierced the sky and spread like a mushroom.

As if black paint had been spilled across the sky, the process of creeping expansion had no deceleration.

'It's emerged into the world.'

Yahweh's blackened, rotting resentment had burst through his physical body.

'What will happen?'

Melania, suddenly coming to her senses, shouted.

"Kill him! Kill Yahweh!"

"Krugh!"

Gai immediately rushed forward and brought down his sword, but Shirone couldn't be cut.

'It doesn't seem to be matter.'

Along the trajectory the sword passed, though Gai couldn't confirm it, hexagonal particles of light were floating.

'Information?'

Meirei suddenly stood up, covering one ear.

"Chief Justice."

The voice of Chief Justice Teraforce was still deep and resonant, but carried an urgent feeling.

The Hexa Program has been activated.

"Hexa... Program? What's that?"

There was no time to explain.

We'll send the Ark.

With that, communication was cut off.

The World Climate Organization manager roared at the top of his lungs.

"How is this even possible!"

The thrown file folder slid across the floor, and nearby employees hurriedly picked it up.

"Manager! What's wrong?"

Amira approached, but the manager just paced around frantically, snorting with agitation.

"Amira, look at this."

When she received the documents sent from Gustav Empire's observation station, Amira quickly examined the figures.

The papers fell from her hands once again.

"Impossible."

The other employees felt the same way.

"But it's reality. This isn't a natural phenomenon or magic. It's something unknown."

Even if you gathered all the water on the planet, you couldn't generate clouds of this mass.

"It's like..."

An employee imagined the sky beyond the ceiling.

"Steel heavier than the planet is floating up there."

Gai's blade passed through Shirone's body at speeds that created afterimages.

'Why can't I kill him?'

Perhaps because he was already dead.

When that thought occurred to Gai, he finally stopped attacking and looked up at the sky.

"It's gotten bigger."

Judging by the size of the cloud, it was easily large enough to cover an entire kingdom and more.

"What kind of avatar is that supposed to be?"

"Yahweh."

Melania approached.

"That's Yahweh? Didn't you say he reached the realm of loving all things? This is rather..."

It was a killing intent more turbid and dark than any demon's.

"That's right. How truly detestable."

This was the magnitude of evil that one human had to suppress to reach the realm of universal love.

"Why wouldn't he want to be angry? He'd want to be jealous, to desire, to do whatever he pleased."

Yahweh is not good.

"Universal love is created through sacrifice. That sacrifice, which no one acknowledges, accumulates deep within until it becomes an unbearable monster..."

Black clouds covered the entire empire.

"An existence that must live forever imprisoning itself to prevent that monster from bursting out."

Melania caressed Shirone's particles.

"To demons, that pretense is so terrifyingly..."

Her hand grasped the light.

"Disgusting."

When she slowly opened her hand, hexagonal light fluttered upward.

Melania's eyes following it looked ecstatic, contrary to her words.

"He did it. With this, Yahweh's wrath has disappeared."

Rumbllllllle.

An ominous preliminary sound of thunder came from the black clouds that blocked the sun.

"Shouldn't we evacuate for now?"

"To where?"

Melania, who had raised her head with disheveled eyes, turned her palm toward where the sky was.

"It looks like it's going to rain."

The moment her words ended, particles of light began falling from the sky.

The light containing divine particles was a gloomy gray color and thousands of times heavier than water droplets.

Swoooooosh.

The light drops were falling almost simultaneously.

But at the extremes of observation, simultaneity cannot exist, and the leading light drop headed for the imperial palace Marsak.

The moment the first light drop collided with the highest spire of the capital's imperial palace.

Thok!

With a powerful bursting sound, a fist-sized hole was carved out.

Thok! Tha-thok! Tha-tha-thok!

And such things...

"Damn it!"

Infinity.

KWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWAKWA KWAKWA!

An infinite number struck the entire empire.

"KRAAAHHH!"

Tens of millions of demons screamed simultaneously, but even that was buried in the roar.

The imperial palace was being shaved down at four meters per second in height under the continuing bombardment of falling mass.

"What is this! What..."

That power was striking the entire empire equally, scraping away everything on the ground.

"HIYAAAAH!"

Gai swung his sword to deflect the light particles.

After three seconds, nothing remained of the sword except the handle.

"This..."

A dull sound resonated through his skull.

"Keh!"

As thousands of light drops pummeled his entire body, Gai's form crumpled to the ground.

"How unfortunate."

Melania, holding a black umbrella, looked down at Gai, who had lost his shape.

"It seems no ark came for you."

When she turned to survey the capital's scene, hundreds of thousands of bluish domes had been created.
