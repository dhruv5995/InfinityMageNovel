Living On (2)

Number Seven, driving the massive excavator, spotted Jet's barrier blocking the path ahead and pushed the speed to maximum.

Marsha, gripping the pole, shouted.

"Are you crazy?"

"Then should we fight? We have no choice but to break through."

The next moment, the excavator's drill bore into Jet's barrier.

The cockpit shook every time an android was crushed like a tin can under the continuous tracks.

'The machine is holding up this well. The durability is no joke.'

Finally, their view opened up, but a similar number of Jets were gathered in the block across from them.

"Eliminate the source of anguish."

As bullets flew toward them, Number Seven shouted.

"Emergency evacuation!"

The moment the mining team was ejected into the sky, the excavator exploded and the group was sent flying ten meters.

"Are you okay?"

At Number Seven's words, Marsha gritted her teeth.

"Great job."

"I had no choice. But we're almost there."

Looking at the tallest building in the city twenty meters ahead, the Operator asked.

"Are you sure? There's no guarantee this is the main system."

The thought that the biggest building was the core was also human thinking.

"We have no other choice. We can't go anywhere else now."

All around them sparkled with the silver light of androids.

"By the way, where's the entrance?" No door was visible.

"I'll give it a try."

Lollipop Mark examined the wall, and Freeman pointed behind them.

"Hey, over there."

Jets were already gathering.

"We'll hold them off."

While the executives of the Parrot Mercenary Corps charged forward, Lollipop Mark checked the system.

"What kind of code is this? It's on a completely different level from Mucus's era."

It had changed from a future ruled by Fairies to a future where the God of Law directly intervened.

The Operator said.

"We don't need to decode it perfectly. We just need to scramble the signal and open the entrance, right?"

"No, the thing is..."

Before he could finish speaking, the heat of an explosion rushed toward them.

The executives of the Parrot Mercenary Corps were being pushed back by Jet's bombardment.

Though they were renowned masters in reality, they were useless against future technology.

Lollipop gritted his teeth.

"I'm sorry. I can't make it in time."

"There's one way." Number Seven pulled out an Under Coder card, and the Operator asked.

"Did you bring other equipment too?"

If it was an engineer who had implemented even the excavator 'Extra's' data in Apocalypse, there was a possibility.

'Please, something big and strong...'

She had hoped for something like a High Gear boss creature, but Number Seven looked uncertain.

"Data capacity isn't unlimited. So I had to be selective."

"I get it, so hurry up. What is it?"

Number Seven looked back at the Operator and said.

"Don't get mad."

The moment he pressed the button, a whooshing sound came from high in the sky.

"Huh?"

The Operator's eyes widened as she looked up, and at the same time, a mechanical device engulfed her body with a thud.

Lollipop looked dazed.

"Mid Gear?"

It was a device for charging and preserving High Gear machines.

"Actually, I was planning to use it when the mood was right."

The Mid Gear's lock released, and the Operator's machine, emanating a black aura, emerged with a seductive gait.

It felt like she had transformed from a girl to a woman.

"The mood was just right."

Though it probably wasn't the romantic atmosphere Number Seven had wanted.

Number Seven scratched his head.

"Tch, anyway, you need to control the output well. Even if we can pull up the data, charging is impossible here."

One chance.

"That's enough."

She looked at the Parrot Mercenary Corps executives who had been pushed back right in front of them, then kicked off the ground and leaped out.

Moving at wind-like speed, she mixed into the group of Jets and drew her greatsword Blackjang.

"Collapse."

A magnetic field spread in the form of a black sphere, and all androids within the radius began to be drawn toward it.

The mining team instinctively covered their ears, but the metallic impact sounds were intense enough to penetrate through their palms and reach their eardrums.

Number Seven slowly opened his tightly shut eyes and discovered a massive lump of scrap metal crushed into a spherical shape.

"Operator!"

His worry was misplaced as the Operator, who had spun beautifully in the air, landed gracefully beside him.

"Why are you making such a fuss? Did you forget who I am?"

Until Yahweh reclaimed it, she had been the undefeated legend of High Gear.

The Operator looked at the building and said.

"Move aside. I'll break it down."

Lollipop stepped back.

"Yes, it seems we have no choice but to destroy it. Honestly, at this rate..."

Whether they could hack the main system was uncertain, but he didn't bother saying it out loud.

"I'm going to destroy it with maximum output."

As the Operator aimed Blackjang and took a stance to leap forward, Number Seven's face turned pale.

If she failed to destroy it, the machine would be destroyed.

"How about reconsidering?"

"No, half-hearted power would just waste output. I need to end it in one shot."

As the group watched with solemn expressions, the Operator increased her lower body's output.

At that moment, rectangular lines appeared on the building's wall, and doors opened to the left and right.

The engine sound of the Operator, who had brought her feet together, quickly diminished.

Marsha asked.

"What? Why did it open by itself?"

"Could it be a trap?"

The Operator shook her head.

"No. If it's a system that even Lollipop can't open the door to, there's no reason to bother setting a trap."

Strapping Blackjang to her back, she walked into the darkness inside the door and continued.

"Let's trust and go. We're not the only ones in this city."

"Ah..."

Marsha looked beyond the city.

'It's already past the time they should have arrived, isn't it?' Come to think of it, Sirone hadn't come.

An emergency council was held at the Holy Temple.

Havitz's influence had become strong enough to break the Holy Temple's cause.

"This cannot continue."

Among the gathered kings of various nations—or rather, 'those who could attend'—arguments continued.

"How long will we just keep taking hits? Though they may be weaker than before, the demons still threaten humanity. We must select a world leadership nation as soon as possible and unite our strength."

Even those who hadn't batted an eye when people were dying now realized the gravity of the situation.

'The situation has changed.'

Albino stroked his chin, lost in thought.

'Twenty minutes ago, Havitz tried to assassinate the King of Corona. Now that he's seriously begun hunting the heads of each nation, the cause of human peace is meaningless.'

Expecting kings to have responsibilities and duties befitting their titles was close to collective delusion.

'It's like believing that a non-existent god would be benevolent.'

The chairman said.

"There are no objections, I assume. Then when would be a good time to hold the vote?"

When they got to specific scheduling, the heads of each nation fell silent.

They wanted to hold the vote right now, but becoming a leadership nation that way wouldn't be recognized by anyone.

'But we can't be too late either. If we're not careful...'

The thought was widespread that the casualty an hour from now could be oneself, killed by Havitz.

Thus, the decided time was 7 AM the next morning—the minimum authority the heads of nations could concede.

The chairman summarized.

"Then, by unanimous agreement of the nations attending the Holy Temple, we will hold the vote at 7 AM tomorrow morning, earlier than the original schedule. We ask that working-level staff from each department announce the adjusted schedule to all nations within two hours."

There wasn't much of a special schedule.

At most, the finale where artists from around the world would perform together would be held tonight.

"So it has come to this. Now no one can know."

At Albino's words, Lufist nodded.

"Whoever stirs up the muddy water and grabs the treasure first wins. Tormia has a fighting chance too."

"Those gathered here are actually professional gamblers. They don't bet unless they're certain. Being the leader of a nation isn't a probability you can reach through luck alone."

"Bluffing won't work anymore. Rather than high odds, they'll lean toward whoever has the sure hand."

"Hmm, even in the early days of the Holy Temple, there were quite a few sure hands. Uorin's Kashan, the Moon Kingdom's divination, Kytra's astrology... Hah."

But Uorin couldn't attend the Holy Temple, the Moon Kingdom was annihilated, and Kytra had also withdrawn from the front lines.

"Kesia."

Albino said.

"In this situation, the side with the most reliable information would be Kesia."

Where he turned his gaze, King Fermi of Kesia was holding his position.

'I wish I could open up his skull and look inside.' Albino's eyes narrowed.

'Son of Yolga, what do you know?'

Fermi checked his watch.

'7 AM tomorrow morning. Then... Ymir is faster.'

Even now, Fermi's future remained unchanged.

Ymir, Deep Layer 1.

Gaold's party had arrived at the maternal psychology where the unconscious of the moment of birth slumbered.

Below the realm of numbness was an endless land made from the bodies of ten billion Gaians.

"Even with ten billion humans, they couldn't constitute this much land. Therefore, the symbolism contained here is..." Arius said.

"Everything of oneself."

It was Ymir's body, born from the integration of ten billion Gaians.

The party examined the land.

It was earth distorted like fingerprints, as if melted in lava.

Arms stuck up here and there, and faces like reliefs looked up at the sky.

Arius said.

"It's different indeed. There are no characteristics that appear in ordinary people's minds. Gender, cradles, climate—none of these things were captured in Ymir's cognition. He was the strongest from birth."

Miro asked.

"The air is stale, isn't it?"

"Yes. It's the atmosphere of desire. The fact that the Gaians became earth means Ymir completely controlled the physical body. Desire gas rises from there and fills this world completely."

"So the volcano that erupted in Deep Layer 2 was this atmosphere exploding."

"Yes. The situation where gas from the 1st floor erupts to the 2nd floor. Judging by Gaold's power, even that must have been an extremely rare event."

Arius turned around.

"Anyway, the world's composition is simple. If the land is the body and the atmosphere is emotion, then the mind is..."

The Ultima of ten billion Gaians.

"It would be over there."

Everyone raised their heads following Arius.

"Good heavens."

Kang Nan opened her mouth in a daze.

In the center of the sky filled entirely with light, there was a hole of tremendous size.

"A black hole."

At Miro's words, Arius nodded.

"Yes. If the light spread across the sky is the Gaians' minds, then that black hole is holding onto all the light. Therefore, that is..."

A voice came from straight ahead.

"Right. That's the Ultima System you're looking for."

Everyone looked down with surprised expressions to find Ymir sitting there, chin propped on his hand.

"The power to change the laws."

In other words, gravity.

It was a measure of how fiercely one existed within the backdrop of the universe.
