The Terrible Truth (1)

The Church of Satan.

Seina charged toward Shirone across the garden where blood poured down like rain.

"Demon Sword Astacia."

Her sword, which should rightfully be a holy sword, was wrapped in dark red demonic energy.

"Miss Seina! Snap out of it!"

This wasn't simply brainwashing or hypnosis, but proof that her heart had tilted toward evil.

"I'm sorry, Shirone."

Demonic energy blazed like flames from her body.

'She's gotten stronger.'

Shirone gritted his teeth at the power that was incomparable to her previous divine force.

'Gyorgi. You bastard.'

"I stabbed Lord Maximus while he was repenting. I have nowhere left to return to."

"That was a mistake."

It was merely the result of Gultan's mental craft taking effect.

"No."

Seina shook her head.

"It's the opposite. I wanted to kill Maximus. It's just that appearances, fear, the shell of being a holy knight—these things were blocking my heart."

"That is the truth. The human heart wants to be good, yet also wants to destroy everything. There's no such thing as a heart that leans eternally toward one side."

Gyorgi spoke.

"It's useless. Just as your conviction won't break, Seina's conviction is equally strong. Of course, you could force it through if you wanted. Go ahead and do it. But you'll die too."

The spear of the demon dragon would come flying.

"This is all the power I've granted to Seina. Asuka Contract Article 7, Section 2. The effect is... I stake my life to raise the target's abilities to the limit of what can be imagined."

This was a characteristic of the darkness attribute.

"Don't worry. The universe won't be destroyed. No one can imagine such a thing. Asuka used Satan's temptation to experiment with human hearts. When given money that would never run dry, how far could humans go?"

It would be a hidden code similar to the level of Sheol.

"That's all there is to it—human imagination. Delusions like buying the universe, when they become reality, they don't even know how to conduct business. Most of those who fell victim to Asuka's experiments produced boringly consistent results. Do you know what they were?"

"...They would have bought everything."

"Right. In other words, they could only buy what someone was 'selling.' Only a few humans took interesting actions to break free from the concept of 'buying what's being sold.' But they too failed due to lack of imagination."

Of course, like all of Satan's temptations, after waking from the dream, they were dragged to hell.

"Such contents are recorded in the Book of Asuka. Of course, you and I could imagine far grander things, but this ability cannot be used on oneself. The subject of imagination is Seina, through and through."

Shirone turned his gaze again.

'If it's the limit of what an ordinary human can imagine, would it be something like 'defeat everyone who can be defeated'?'

That alone would make one the strongest under heaven, but several individuals existed in realms of transcendence that surpassed common sense.

"...What are you thinking?"

Since Shirone was also transcendent, he couldn't readily understand Gyorgi's choice.

'The reason for choosing Asuka Article 7, Section 2 among countless abilities.'

Could this really be the most powerful card that Catacomb, specialized for the great battle against Yahweh, could present?

"What are you doubting? You can't attack Seina. If you show even a moment's opening, the spear of the demon dragon will come flying. Then it's our victory."

"That's a lie. Miss Seina can't catch me. You know that better than anyone, right? What's your real intention? Why did you specifically take Miss Seina? If you wanted to kill me, there would be more powerful methods."

"No, there aren't."

Gyorgi shook his head.

"All the countless enemies you've faced so far devised the best methods to kill you. But none succeeded. In efficiency versus efficiency combat, your record is invincible. But I know you. I am your demon. You cannot attack Seina. That's why this is the most powerful method, but..."

On the other hand.

"At this point... does it even matter?"

With the world's end right before their eyes, there was something he clearly wanted to know.

'Yahweh's heart, and the heart Yahweh abandoned.'

Perhaps for Gyorgi, this was a more important matter than victory or defeat.

"Shirone!"

At Nade's voice, he threw his body aside, and the spear of the demon dragon struck where Shirone had been.

"I'll block it."

Eden moved to intercept and blocked Shirone's path.

'A strategy targeting Shirone's openings. Even staking my life, I must block at least one attack.'

On the pride ofYor.

As Shirone's group and Catacomb moved simultaneously, Seina swung her sword.

It was certainly the strongest strike a human could imagine, but Shirone found an opening in that instant.

'There!'

Gyorgi smiled bitterly.

'Invincible.'

If Catacomb had made a mistake, it was underestimating Shirone's growth rate.

'Now he handles this level through intuition. Yes, you are the strongest in this world.'

He too had once been Shirone.

Why did you abandon me?

When first born from Yahweh's demon, the first notion that arose was this:

If Yahweh is right, why do I exist? If we're wrong, we shouldn't exist in the first place, right?

Can existence itself be wrong?

'I win.'

Like Yahweh, he could see agape beyond good and evil, but unfortunately his disposition was the complete opposite.

'Yahweh, this is my final card.'

Feeling Shirone's agape seeping into Seina, Gyorgi prepared for annihilation.

Simultaneously, the spear of the demon dragon struck Eden.

"Hngh!"

As the demon dragon's energy traveled along her barrier and injected fear, she gritted her teeth.

"God Yor."

Since submitting to Havitz's evil, she had vowed never to yield to evil again.

"Grant me courage!"

The moment she gave her all, the spear of the demon dragon exploded and Eden's body was flung away.

"Eden!"

Her friends shouted at the sight of her rolling across the ground at terrifying speed, but Shirone didn't look back.

'I'll purify her.'

The moment he pushed the demon out of Seina's body, Gyorgi would also be annihilated.

As the light gathered in Shirone's palm blazed with tremendous radiance, Gyorgi closed his eyes.

'Yes, kill me. Erase evil from the world.'

If there was no value in existing, it was proper to disappear, but.

'I won, Yahweh.'

Even Ultima wouldn't be able to reach this.

"Huh?"

Suddenly the light of agape disappeared, and everyone stopped fighting and turned their heads.

Shirone was kneeling with his hand on Seina's forehead, lost in deep thought.

Nade shouted.

"What are you doing? Quickly heal Miss Seina..."

At that moment, clear tears flowed down Shirone's cheek.

"Sh-Shirone?"

The dream of all victories had ended.

Ymir's Deep Layer, Stage 1.

Having experienced the entire lives of Yorahan and Armang together, Shirone's eyelids slowly rose.

'I see.'

It had been a dream named Yor.

And even now, Yorahan's dream was being transmitted to the believers of Yor through Drimo.

'Great forgiveness.'

It was the only path for the good-evil-agape separated from Lilith to be integrated again.

'I was the one who had to forgive.'

Even if everyone threw away trash, even if they all passed it off to each other...

'Yorahan succeeded.'

Even in pain more terrifying than death, he had bloomed the most beautiful flower in the world.

'Right, Armang?'

The woman who became a single sword to protect Yorahan's heart gave no answer.

There would be one opportunity.

He had a vague understanding of what her words at their final meeting meant.

'Thank you.'

It was an honor that she had chosen him.

"I won't back down anymore."

Rising with eyes different from before, Shirone surveyed Ymir's Deep Layer.

Hearing the rumbling sounds beyond the horizon, Shirone looked up at the black hole.

'There...'

The only remaining Ultima in this world was there.

Somewhere in the Truth Pyramid, Canis clutched his head and screamed.

"Ahhhhh! No!"

In the waves of acknowledgment, Canis could deny any possibility of being siblings with Arin, but.

'I can't do that. If I do, I'll...'

Lose his heart.

But even if he endured like this, all that remained was a life of despair.

"Graaah!"

"Canis! You have to endure! I can't lose you."

"A-Arin..."

The one who had been with him since his earliest memories was his sister?

Canis turned his head and shed tears.

"...I love you."

Through her transcendence, Arin realized.

Unable to choose any life, Canis was thinking of taking his own life.

"Yes."

Arin embraced him.

"Let's go together. We'll fight to the very end. We won't submit to something like fate."

Habist, tasked with the role of ending their lives, embraced them both with his long arms.

Was this really okay?

Canis nodded, and just as Habist's body began vibrating for the explosion.

"It's not over yet."

Someone's voice came from the darkness.

"Mr. Ares?"

Zulu, who had been traveling with them, approached Canis and handed him the bodily fluid of the iron beetle Amoros.

"Drink this. You should be able to hold out for a while."

The liquid was nauseating just to look at, but having resolved to die, he didn't even care.

"Huh?"

It was just a hopeful attempt, but Amoros's bodily fluid had an unbelievable effect.

"The waves of acknowledgment are receding. How...?"

Ares said.

"They say it's a creature that lived in the ancient pyramid. I'm glad it's effective. Let's find Shirone for now."

"There's no need."

When Zulu pointed to the darkness on the opposite side, Shirone appeared shortly after, carrying Glen on his back.

Color returned to Ares's face.

"You came. You found us well."

"I can't really say I found you. Miss Rukia guided us here."

"What do you mean?"

Rukia, who had followed behind Shirone, examined the pyramid's internal structure and said.

"As expected, my guess was right. There isn't much time left now. We need to depart right now."

Canis, supported by Arin, asked.

"Depart? Where to?"

This was the Truth Pyramid, which made one lose not only space-time but even life's direction.

Rukia turned around and said.

"To meet God."

She led everyone from the front, advancing without hesitation through the maze-like complex paths.

Arin asked.

"Don't tell me you know the way?"

"No."

Rukia said as she turned a corner.

"I don't know the way at all. I'm just... going where my heart moves me."

Shirone added.

"It's not a coincidence that we gathered in the pyramid. God wanted to bring Rukia here from the beginning. Conversely, it means we don't need to know where God is."

Ares muttered.

"You mean God is wherever Rukia thinks he is. But why? Why does he want her?"

"Me?..."

It was a fact she realized like destiny.

"I should be able to summon God. Probably."

Amid the continuing silence, the group turned corner after corner at a rapid pace.

And finally, the place they arrived at was...

"Here."

It was the final chamber at the very top of the pyramid, which seemed impossible to find.

"God is there."

On the altar Rukia pointed to sat a device with electricity flowing through it like a vacuum tube.
