[567] Opening Moves (3)

Sirone asked.

"What exactly do you mean by 'unable to cause harm'?"

"It covers all primary physical and mental attacks. However, tactical applications - that is, secondary aspects - are not restricted."

Hersy said.

"Secondary, huh. So setting traps and waiting for participants would be allowed?"

"That's correct. Since the source of attack would be objects, strategies, or terrain rather than Kang's loser."

"I understand. What if Pao is chosen?"

"Refusal to compete. Even if Pao is chosen, you cannot harm the participant who initiated Kang until the next Scramble summons. However, in this case, it doesn't count as a loss."

"But you can keep your cards."

"Exactly."

Iruki rested his chin in his hand, lost in thought.

Whether losing at Kang or choosing Pao, being unable to harm your opponent was a fatal risk.

'You'd have to be chased by your opponent for nearly two hours. If your Master Card gets stolen during that time...'

The tide of the match would turn instantly.

'This isn't simply about competing with card hands. Rather, the game rules encourage destroying opponents' Master Cards. Combat ability will be important in addition to tactics.'

Amy asked.

"What if priorities are equal? I mean, if the card combinations are the same?"

"If the same hand appears, there's no winner or loser determination. Also, no loss occurs."

Though not stated outright, it implied that from then on, they should fight each other to the death.

'Hmm, I thought there'd be priority based on acquisition time, but you just need to match the hand.'

Then there was no need to open Random Cards immediately.

"These are the game rules. Does everyone understand?"

There was no response.

While they understood the rules, they'd need to actually play the game to grasp the intentions behind them.

'The rules themselves are simple. But the utilization of Random Cards and the variable of being invincible for two hours could complicate things considerably.'

Lulu wrapped up.

"The basic game period is seven days. The one with the highest hand by midnight on the last day wins, and all rewards and penalties are distributed through the Judge."

In summary, to win Black and White, one of two conditions had to be met:

Fight opponents and destroy all their Master Cards, or maintain possession of the strongest hand until time runs out.

'Neither can be considered easy. To destroy Master Cards, you'd have to subdue the entire opposing team. On the other hand, only one person needs to hold the strongest hand to win, but defending it for seven days would be difficult. Sacrifice strategies would be necessary.'

"Scramble locations are displayed in XYZ coordinates, and disappear from Master Cards when collected by participants. These conclude the rules for 'Black and White.' Please find various methods by applying the rules and enjoy a fun game with your friends."

As Lulu disappeared, the Judge's light went out.

"Fun game, my ass."

Someone muttered.

All twelve people who heard Black and White's rules were silent, gauging the variables arising from the rules and their own abilities.

'I've won. I've definitely won this game.'

Though he didn't show it, Nade was inwardly thrilled.

One second by photon system standards.

If time was fluid, there was plenty of room for Sirone's Immortal Function to work.

Iruki went into more specific detail.

'Slow can extend one second. But Immortal Function is on a completely different level.'

The key was utilizing Random Cards.

He didn't know the exact time for Random Cards to be determined as black or white, but it wouldn't exceed one second.

Therefore, Sirone could repeatedly open Random Cards until he got the color he wanted.

It ignored the randomness that was Hidden Cards' weakness.

Sirone couldn't possibly not be thinking about this, but he maintained his poker face while looking at the opposing team.

'Only my friends know my ability.'

But even if they didn't know, this clearly wasn't an easy game, yet the Allied team all wore confident expressions.

'Baseless confidence? Or have they devised a killer strategy?'

Once everyone's thoughts were somewhat organized, Hersy stepped forward again to proceed with negotiations.

"Well then, let's move on to rewards and penalties."

Nade brought up what he'd been thinking.

"First, let's confirm what's already decided. If we win, all six Allied team members must rank lower than us until graduation exams."

Hersy temporarily jotted notes while speaking.

"Good. Then if our team wins, the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society leaves Estas."

This part was easy, but the problem came next.

"Now that the overall terms are set, shall we move to individual ones? Raise your hand if you have rewards or penalties you'd like to stake on this Scramble Royal."

No one immediately raised their hand, simply because this wasn't about stating what you wanted.

This was negotiation, after all.

To push through a reward, you had to accept an equivalent penalty demanded by the other side.

"I'll make one proposal."

When Cayden raised his hand, Sirone's team tensed up, and Sirone especially bit his lip anxiously.

Since this was someone consumed by jealousy, any demand wouldn't be surprising.

'If it's just about separating me and Amy, that's fine. But if he's planning something with Amy...'

Amid all sorts of anxious imaginings, Sirone took a deep breath.

'Stay calm. Even if it's an unreasonable condition, we can adjust it through negotiation.'

The only worrying thing was that once Scramble Royal was accepted, the match had to be played.

If refused, it would be considered forfeiture by unwritten rule, and refusing even that meant war.

"My demand, if our side wins, is..."

Sirone swallowed hard.

"Sirone, you must sincerely confess your love to Maya."

"...What?"

His eyes widened at the unexpected statement, but thinking about it, he was relieved that Amy wasn't involved.

Amy's reaction, however, was completely different.

"You bastard! What do you think people's hearts are? Do you think you can manipulate emotions through this kind of match?"

"I'm not forcing anything. If you can't do it, pay with death. We'll discuss contract violations later."

"This is...!"

"Amy, wait."

As Amy raised her fist, Sirone spoke.

"Nothing's decided yet. If it's impossible, we can adjust through negotiation."

Though Sirone said this, he actually sensed they'd ultimately have no choice but to accept Cayden's proposal.

"Right. The subject of negotiation is Sirone. You know this is the most realistic condition I can propose."

Amy said.

"Sirone, ignore him. We have about eleven hours left? Let's see how far we can go with this agenda."

Cayden's eyes bulged.

"Do you really want to go to the end? If this negotiation is everything, I'll have to raise the difficulty. How about Amy becoming my doll if we win? Or should I sell her to Golden Ring?"

Amy slammed both hands on the table.

"Says who? I'd rather die!"

"Then die!"

Cayden shouted back.

"Do you think this is school? No one cares if you die. I've made maximum concessions for smooth negotiation. Underground research societies have their own rules, and everyone agreed to gather here. If you don't like it, just leave."

Sirone asked.

"What meaning does that have for you? Me confessing love to Maya, I mean. You like Maya, don't you?"

"She is my muse."

Cayden's eyes flashed with madness.

"If she can be happy, I can sacrifice anything. I can also kill anyone."

"Everyone calm down."

Iruki controlled the atmosphere.

"It's just the opponent's proposal. And Cayden has made clear he won't back down here. In that case..."

Lightning sparked in Iruki's eyes as he glared at Cayden.

"You must be prepared to pay an equivalent price, right?"

Perhaps the most enraged person here was Iruki, who had brought Amy into this.

"That's also something to decide after hearing the conditions."

Hersy stepped forward, receiving Iruki's killing intent.

"But before that, may we propose one penalty from our side first?"

Nade asked with an expression ready to strike immediately.

"Why are you proposing our side's reward?"

"Don't be like that, just listen. It won't be a bad condition."

Sabina, who had calmed Nade, asked.

"Fine, let's hear it."

Hersy smiled and raised his index finger.

"If you accept Cayden's proposal, we'll help one of your members pass the graduation exam."

"What... did you say?"

"It's not about stamping approval seals, but mobilizing all of Golden Ring's connections and abilities to ensure passage."

'Fermi, huh.'

That Golden Ring operated as brokers for graduation exams was certain, just lacking physical evidence.

'This isn't something Hersy can propose alone. They came with negotiation limits already set.'

Hersy held up two fingers.

"If that doesn't appeal to you, how about this? All Golden Ring members will rank lower than your team until graduation exams."

Since graduation was the supreme goal at magic school, this was undoubtedly a groundbreaking proposal.

'Why are they so obsessed with Scramble Royal? What exactly is Estas's secret?'

"Let's accept it."

All of Sirone's team turned to look at Dorothy.

"What?"

"I said let's accept it. Research society members aside, Sabina and I are unrelated outsiders. We need that level of reward to give our all."

Dorothy looked at Iruki.

"That's the same reason you brought me in, isn't it?"

Iruki nodded readily.

"That's true."

Nade said.

"But Dorothy, even if you graduate that way..."

"I know. I don't want to pass by receiving anyone's help. I don't necessarily need special treatment. But if I'm precariously balanced on the edge of passing, I can't guarantee anything. Does anyone want to spend another year here?"

Dorothy held out her palm.

"Sorry, I misspoke. My point is, regardless of using the pass card, it's much more efficient to accept it for now. It's not like they're demanding Amy's body, or telling Sirone to date Maya. It's just a confession, right? And what we gain is one pass card. You understand what this means?"

Apart from passing or failing, it meant gaining leverage to control Fermi's entire group during graduation exams.

'Golden Ring will definitely do their best. Having made an agreement through the Judge, they'll have no choice but to pay the penalty for contract violation. Hersy's words are true.'

While Iruki was lost in thought, Dorothy added.

"Don't misunderstand. If there were another way, I would have rejected this kind of proposal too. But regarding the issues between Sirone and Cayden, Amy and Maya, there's no better compromise than this. Honestly speaking, wouldn't it be stupid not to accept?"

Having finished thinking, Iruki asked Cayden.

"Just confessing is enough? Regardless of Maya's choice?"

"Of course. Whether Maya accepts or not doesn't matter. But the confession must be sincere. If you can't do it, you'll pay the penalty."

"Phew."

This was extremely ambiguous.

Rationally speaking, the scales had already tipped, but emotional issues made it feel balanced again.

Nade clutched his head.

'Hersy won't back down. That must be his condition for participating.'

Knowing this, Hersy had proposed the most powerful negotiation card while accepting losses.

"Let us step outside and coordinate our opinions."

More precisely, he wanted to hear Sirone's thoughts first.

"By all means. Today's that kind of day."

As Hersy gestured, Nade came around the table and called his friends.

"Everyone come out."

Glaring menacingly at the Allied team, all five filed around the table and left the research society.
