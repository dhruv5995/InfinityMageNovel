[683]献花 (3)

'The rain is getting heavier.'

Shirone spread his photon wings and rushed toward Saenghwa at maximum speed.

Since all the devices in the concealment facility had stopped operating, their powerful anti-aircraft defense network had also been neutralized.

But that fact only made him feel more uneasy.

'Something's strange.'

The state of Saenghwa as sensed through the Ultima System was like the calm before a storm.

Though it seemed quietly still, through the eyes of Jikji, countless energies were chaotically circulating like nerves inside the massive iron tower, forming Saenghwa's structure.

'Full power operation. It's plotting something.'

Following Saenghwa's input and output mechanisms, it was clear that a powerful energy beam was standing by.

'Could it be targeting the capital?'

It was entirely possible, and this was precisely why Rufist had been willing to make sacrifices to get as close to Saenghwa as possible.

"Shirone oppa."

Mayray, who had caught up behind Shirone through teleportation, flew alongside him with her soaked body.

"You're safe. Thank goodness."

When Shirone spoke casually, thinking they had become somewhat acquainted, Mayray smiled shyly too.

Though she was a mage, her skills weren't exceptional enough to be classified as a combat operative.

Shirone had thought she might already be dead if she hadn't met up with her comrades.

"I was lucky. I landed in an area with no enemies."

"How about the signal?"

Mayray covered one ear as she spoke.

"I can't hear anything. I keep checking, but there isn't even common noise. This is definitely strange."

It meant La Enemy was no longer giving instructions.

'Has the design already been completed? Or...'

As Shirone fell into thought, two people approached, leaping over buildings.

"Lian. Huh?"

His gaze went to the goblin following behind.

'A goblin wearing glasses is a first.'

When Shirone and Mayray stopped, Kido performed an agile aerial somersault and landed on the rooftop.

"Phew, we finally meet."

Striking various poses, Kido bent his legs in front of Shirone and smiled while adjusting his glasses.

"Um, but who are you?"

Just the fact that he came with Lian was enough to trust he wasn't an enemy.

"The general commander of Speed Kill."

When Shirone showed no particular reaction to Kido's playful words, he continued awkwardly.

"...Former goblin, Kido."

"What happened?"

When Shirone turned his head, Lian approached and explained.

Having already guessed La Enemy's intentions through his conversation with Etela, understanding came quickly.

"I see. Corresponding to taste..."

"Something like that. This one is hearing?"

When Kido pointed with his sharp claws, Mayray nodded.

"Hmm, so now we have touch, hearing, and taste gathered. But to track La, we absolutely need smell."

"Sagar probably already entered Saenghwa. We don't have time either."

As Shirone turned to leave, Kido extended his hand.

"Wait. I'd like to make one proposal before that."

Everyone looked at Kido.

"What proposal?"

"If it's okay, could I eat you guys?"

If he could obtain information by eating, it would be good to know Shirone and Mayray's memories too.

"I don't mind."

Shirone looked at Mayray.

If it was just eating flesh, Armand would heal Shirone, but she had no means of recovery.

Mayray touched her right ear and said.

"Wouldn't cutting off an ear be better? Other body parts would cause a loss in combat ability. Without ears, the divine frequency function would be enhanced too."

Kido gaped in bewilderment, but Shirone strongly opposed.

This was a matter already discussed during the test at Silvering Guild.

"That's a last resort. If we can't catch La Enemy with one sense, communication function is important too."

Kido smiled and said.

"No need to worry. Body fluids are sufficient even without body parts. Also, unless it's memories imprinted on specific organs, there are limits to the information transferred regardless of what I eat."

Lian said with a slightly aggrieved expression.

"So you don't need to eat much."

"Hehe, that's the advantage of my ability."

Though goblins were a gluttonous race, the objective amount they could eat was less than humans.

"Alright, then I'll give you my blood."

Shirone made a long cut on his left palm and let the blood drip.

Due to their height difference, Kido could drink just by lifting his head.

"Hmm. Hmm-mm."

As Kido savored the blood taste by rolling his tongue, his eyes deepened.

"I see. You're a very interesting human, aren't you?"

"You seem pretty formidable yourself."

"Keke! It would be troublesome if you were surprised by just this much."

Kido's chest heaved as he spoke to Mayray.

"Goblins lack manners, but I still don't like hurting women. If you don't want to be cut, saliva would be fine too."

Mayray, who had been staring at Kido expressionlessly, extended her wrist.

"I'll do blood."

Though disappointment briefly crossed his face, Kido approached with a playful expression.

"Then I won't refuse."

When Kido bit her wrist with his sharp fangs and sucked with his lips, her blood flowed over.

His eyelids trembled as a specific memory was transmitted.

'Huh? What's this?'

Though few people had lived as tumultuous a life as Shirone, Mayray's memory was on a different dimension.

'What is this? What kind of memory is this?'

"How long are you going to keep sucking? It hurts."

"Huh? Ah, sorry."

Kido hastily pulled away and blinked while staring at Mayray.

"What's wrong?"

He couldn't get any information from her innocent expression.

'Could it be she doesn't know herself?'

Having thought that far, Kido suddenly realized.

'I see. Kuku, this is getting completely interesting. Maybe...'

It could be a counter to La Enemy.

"Good, received. Let's get going."

Using the urgency of time, Kido hurried them along, and the group took flight without complaint.

Rain poured down as if a hole had been punched in the sky.

Time remaining until Saenghwa strikes the royal castle: 7 minutes 32 seconds.

Jane's steps, roughly calculating the time, gradually quickened.

To increase speed, more blood was needed, and the more she did so, the fiercer the resistance of the hand gripping her heart became.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

Though sensation had already disappeared from the hand clutching her heart, mental transcendence magic kept moving her body endlessly beyond the limits of human muscle strength.

Treating the human body as a machine, it was work replacing heart muscle with arm muscle, but the durability couldn't be the same, and eventually muscles and tendons began snapping with tearing sounds.

Since it was genuine magic rather than law, the arm that had physically reached its limit could no longer move.

"Gasp!"

When her heart stopped again, Jane's eyes widened.

'With the other hand...'

Never had she been more grateful that humans had arms on both sides.

Switching hands to contract her heart again, bodily functions returned and death was postponed.

Aria's sobbing voice spread like hallucinations in her ears, but she had no leisure to respond.

Carrying her own death on her back, Jane entered the control room with the main system.

Since she couldn't remove her hand from her heart, she swung her already destroyed hand like a stick to operate the devices.

Aria, the code...

The crying stopped abruptly as an enormous amount of code flooded in.

Aria was also doing her utmost.

Time remaining: 6 minutes 22 seconds.

Regaining control was one thing, but to cancel the strike itself she'd need to go to the pilot room, but Jane didn't have much time left.

'The Director will handle it.'

Jane! Are you okay?

Though only a voice, it was good to have someone's farewell at the final moment.

Aria, this isn't your fault.

After a brief silence, a calm voice seeped through.

The nation will never forget your sacrifice.

With those words, contact ceased.

She could no longer maintain the Spirit Zone.

'Still...'

Leaning her back against the cold machinery, she looked up at the ceiling.

'I kept my promise.'

If asked about the happiest day of her life, it would undoubtedly be the day Rufist became Director of the Magic Association.

"Jane, you're a genius."

At Rufist's words as he gazed out the window from the director's office, Jane shrugged.

"That's right."

"Have you ever felt superior in life? From the point that you're far superior to others?"

"Hmm, briefly when I was very young? But why do you ask?"

"I've never felt superiority. People ask why I don't pursue petty interests. Despite having powerful magical abilities and position. But humans aren't such great beings. Superiority is an emotion possible only because there are objects of comparison. Genius or dunce, in the end they're just components of the system."

Though he had become director succeeding Gaold, civil society was saying he was too extreme an appointment.

"I didn't know you cared about others' evaluations."

"I don't. No, maybe I should care. What's important is facing facts."

"What do you think is fact?"

"Humans are not equal."

Rufist was resolute.

"What 90 percent of humans handle is production and reproduction. The remaining 10 percent of humans consume their resources while leading the whole forward."

"That's a rather disgusting way of thinking."

"Disgusting. But what if it's fact?"

Rufist looked at Jane.

"Most people don't know how the world works. They take the things around them for granted like air. They don't think about reasons why bread can be placed before them every morning."

"It's not something to blame them for."

"Right. Where would there be a more valuable life? What I want to say is that someone faces that disgusting fact, which is why they can live."

Rufist looked at the nameplate that hadn't been replaced yet, engraved with "Magic Association Director Mikea Gaold."

"I'll change it now."

Rufist shook his head and placed his hand on the nameplate.

"Gaold was popular. He even had a guard unit. Humane, with the power to draw people's hearts. But Jane, you can't maintain a system with emotion alone. If Gaold empathizes with human suffering from the extreme of the individual, I protect humans from the extreme of the system at that opposite point. Even if it's disgusting, I think that's the mission I must fulfill as a core component of the kingdom called Magic Association Director."

"...I see."

It was a very personal director inauguration speech dedicated only to Jane.

"I'm grateful to you. Without you, I couldn't have reached this position."

At praise he'd never given in his lifetime, Jane awkwardly scratched her head.

"Well, it was naturally something I should do. Besides, I became Chief Secretary too."

"So..."

Rufist, stiffly clasping his hands behind his back and turning around, said briefly.

"Please continue to work well with me."

Jane's eyes curved into thin crescents.

'It was the greatest honor of my life.'

Jane recalled that day in this way.

Having come this far, she had no great attachment to life, but because she wanted to look back just once more at her happiest memory, she endlessly gripped her heart.

But when her wrist muscles inevitably ruptured making even that impossible, she pulled her hand out of her abdomen.

As oxygen to her brain was cut off, her consciousness too was sucked into deep abyss.

Life's end.

Had she lived without regrets?

'Respected Director.'

A beautiful smile formed on the lips of her powerlessly drooping head.

'Was I a core component?'

Jane's heart stopped.
