[688] The Incident Occurs (3)

After confirming Shagal's direction, Rufist cast a Fly spell and found Sirone's group.

He hadn't even worried when he broke the flesh flower, but he knew it wouldn't be easy to kill that guy anyway.

"You managed to survive."

As Rufist landed on the ground and spoke, Sirone pouted with a sullen expression.

However, understanding Rufist's feelings about losing Jane, she didn't say anything particular about the flesh flower.

"Mayray is strange."

There was no humanity felt from her face.

"Terraforce?"

Being in a position to receive reports on the world's secrets, he wasn't greatly surprised to see intelligent life forms from outer space.

However, he needed to know their intentions in appearing through Mayray.

"What are they after?"

Mayray looked around, collecting sounds with little sniffs, then answered in human language.

"Order."

"Order? What kind of order?"

No answer came, and since the mission was priority for now, Rufist set aside his thoughts and spoke.

"Alright, we're departing now. Shagal has started moving. La Enemy is nearby."

Kido extended his hand.

"Give me one too, Nemesis."

When Rufist turned around, Sirone briefly explained.

"It's taste."

Now guessing La Enemy's intentions, Rufist obediently handed over a spare Nemesis.

"Hmm, if I wear this..."

As Kido put the ring on his index finger, imagination became reality and the scene of a goblin tribe unfolded.

'Sister.'

Kido's sister, wearing a tattered skirt, had one leg up on a rock while gnawing on a pig's leg.

Her bold and fierce appearance was unpleasant for humans to see, but Kido looked at her with his mouth agape in pure joy.

"Hehe."

Rufist spoke coldly.

"Block your thoughts. If interference occurs, it'll be fatal in combat."

The scene disappeared instantly.

The fact that he could immediately control his mind showed Kido's level of mastery.

"Let's go. We're chasing Shagal."

The mages flew through the sky while Kido quickly followed behind them at a distance.

After running for 3 minutes, they saw Shagal stabbing with his quick-draw sword in a state of lost reason.

"Uaaaah!"

Though he looked insane, his genius movements made the presence of the imaginary La Enemy clearly felt.

"Enter within Nemesis's range."

As they entered within 20 meters of Shagal's range, Sirone's eyes widened at a sensation she'd never felt before.

'This is the incident's perfume.'

Like recalling the past from a specific scent, La Enemy's perfume that Shagal was smelling wafted over strongly.

'But I can't tell where it is.'

Unlike vision, the detection ability of smell isn't constrained by concealment and cover, but couldn't pinpoint the exact location.

I am here, Sirone.

As the divine frequency resonated and La Enemy's voice was heard, everyone turned their heads to the left.

"La Enemy!"

Sirone shouted toward the empty space, but the answer came from a completely different place.

What is the universe?

"Come out! Show yourself before me!"

Why can I not become a god?

"Kieee!"

Kido slid past the point where the voice was heard and swung his spear, but nothing was caught.

Sirone immediately shifted her gaze.

'It's useless. He only exists in the past.'

If it was a voice pushing forward from the past, there was no guarantee he would still be in that spot.

'But it's not that distant a past.'

Because Shagal was still here, and if it was within 1 second of the past, she could strike La Enemy with Time Differential.

'Rampage!'

Using time differential to cast magic, a curtain of light seized the entire 20-meter radius.

Simultaneously, Shagal sniffed and left the location.

'He dodged. The magic definitely works on him.'

The fact that Shagal's movement was immediate meant La Enemy was staying in a time period very close to the present.

"Where are you! Come out!"

Then someone touched Sirone's shoulder.

Answer the question that was left, Sirone.

At the cold voice heard from close by, Sirone felt her heart sink.

'He's behind me.'

Everyone felt it through Nemesis and Kido launched his body, but Shagal arrived first.

"Die!"

"Kugh!"

Sirone hurriedly twisted her body to avoid the dagger.

"Get a grip! If we don't join forces..."

"I'll kill you! I'll definitely kill you!"

As the irrational Shagal kicked off the ground and quickly ran down the road, Rufist, who had risen into the sky, shouted.

"Follow him! That's the place!"

As another chase began, Kido stuck close to Sirone's side.

"Wait until vision is added. He's manipulating cosmic-level incidents. He can probably calculate even the movement of air molecules. We have to assume he's the strongest enemy."

"Even if he materializes, subduing him is a different matter?"

Kido nodded.

"Finding isn't everything. If I can't subdue him, I can't eat him, and then I can't grasp La Enemy's intentions."

Rufist lowered his flight altitude and spoke.

"I don't know how many chances we'll have, but it's perfect to think of it as just once. When the opportunity comes, absolutely don't miss it."

Sirone gritted her teeth and nodded.

"Yes."

She absolutely wouldn't miss it.

Rian, Kuan, and Bethia joined up with Ethella and ran through Radum's concealment facility area.

'This is really a strange feeling.'

There was no destination.

Since La Enemy would be wherever they were going anyway, it was fine to empty their minds.

'That's why it's ominous.'

Kuan looked back at Bethia.

'Why did La Enemy kill her brain?'

Probably because Bethia's free will interfered with La Enemy's design.

'If that's the case, we reach the conclusion that we shouldn't meet La Enemy...'

"There's no need to think."

Kuan looked at Ethella.

"Whatever judgment we make, we can't distinguish whether it's La Enemy's intention or our will. We should consider that we've already been consumed by the incident."

It was the loss of free will.

"So the only way is a frontal assault."

The only method they could use was to meet La Enemy and erase his very existence.

Having made his decision, Kuan stopped walking and put a Nemesis ring on Bethia.

Feeling Ethella's gaze, he explained.

"This was what Ms. Aria was wearing. Now if La Enemy approaches, we can confirm it with our eyes."

Then Sirone's voice was heard.

"Rian!"

Shagal was seen charging with eyes raised in madness, and Sirone's group was following behind.

"Ah, ahhh..."

As Bethia trembled and made groaning sounds, Rian, Kuan, and Ethella simultaneously turned their heads.

A handsome man with dark skin and tall stature, wearing Middle Eastern clothing with long hair flowing like a woman's, was standing there.

"Finally."

The five senses had integrated.

"La...!"

Shagal drooled between his teeth and threw the bag containing his quick-draw swords with all his strength.

"Enemy!"

La Enemy turned around and smiled beautifully, but that smile was directed at Sirone, not Shagal.

"It's been a long time, Sirone."

For Sirone it was merely 20 years, but for La it had been billions of years of waiting.

"Why! Why! Why!"

The vanguard was Shagal, as expected.

Dozens of quick-draw swords flew toward all of La's vital points.

A technique that had taken the lives of countless strong fighters.

But La Enemy rotated once with beautiful movements like dancing and evaded all attacks.

"What...!"

It was such a bewildering incident that Shagal, who had fallen into terrible despair, lost even the will to continue attacking.

'This is impossible!'

The genius's intuition was telling him so.

"Sirone! Now!"

The moment Rufist shouted, Sirone stopped walking.

'I won't miss it!'

Quantum Superposition

300 Overlaps

Avatar Technique

Angel's Punishment.

The archangel's avatar rose gigantically and began a tremendous bombardment toward La Enemy.

It was powerful enough to kill everyone present, but even so, sacrifice was unavoidable in this situation.

'If we can just eliminate La!'

Since everyone was thinking the same thing, no one resented Sirone for unconsciously casting the magic.

A roar that shook heaven and earth penetrated their eardrums.

Debris fell first and a dust cloud spread out like a giant monster, devouring the city.

"Phew! That was tremendous."

Rian emerged, pushing up a brick larger than a person.

The spears of light that Sirone had mercilessly driven in were much more powerful than what he'd seen in the graduation exam not long ago.

'If I survived, everyone else probably did too.'

Those gathered here were the top elites.

The first thing that caught his eye was a pitch-black hole spanning dozens of meters in radius, so deep its bottom couldn't be seen.

And above that hole, La Enemy was floating.

"...He's perfectly fine?"

Others who gradually appeared through the smoke also couldn't understand the current situation.

Only Sirone could clearly replay the instantaneous moment when 300 spears struck down sequentially.

"This is... impossible."

The emotion Sirone felt exactly matched what Shagal had felt moments ago.

'There was no way to dodge that!'

It wasn't because Sirone was overconfident in her abilities or underestimating La Enemy's capabilities.

Movement Zero.

Clearly 300 spears had perfectly blocked La Enemy's movement routes, yet he had evaded them.

'There was a route he could dodge?'

Sirone shook her head roughly.

'No, absolutely not. Even if I had been in that position, there would have been no way to escape.'

Finding a move that could break through a perfectly checkmated situation was impossible.

Not because it was difficult, but because it actually didn't exist.

Mayray approached Sirone.

"Hexa. La is perfect randomness."

"Perfect... randomness?"

"Humans can't create true randomness. Even when trying to set something randomly, the very intention of 'setting it randomly' creates a new pattern."

Can we imagine perfect randomness?

"But La is different. That's perfect chaos. Because he moves outside patterns, you end up believing it doesn't exist."

Waving hands, blinking eyes, shouting.

When imagining all the nearly infinite actions humans can take, La can perform some action that transcends that category.

"Just because you can't imagine it doesn't mean it doesn't exist."

"Right. If Hexa is a product of 100% inevitability, then La is a product of 100% chance."

If everything was triggered by chance, transcending patterns, it was natural that humans couldn't imagine it.

"In other words, he's annoyingly strong. Now what are you going to do? Pure firepower seems ineffective?"

Mayray said.

"There is a way to eliminate La Enemy. But that's only possible after stealing his blueprint."

Kido pushed up his glasses while glaring at La Enemy.

"If I eat him, I can eat his imagination too. Perfect chaos probably doesn't mean invincibility anyway. I mean... that's what chaos is, right? Sometimes weak, sometimes strong..."

"Yeah, I understand."

Sirone spoke as she stepped forward.

"I'll create an opportunity. That's when you eat La Enemy."

"How?"

"...I don't know either."

As Sirone ran forward with a smile and leaped over the pit with teleportation, La Enemy spread both arms to welcome her.

"Can you do it, Sirone?"

I don't know.

But the answer was there.

Quantum Superposition

Wheel of Emptiness.

At first it was 2 overlaps.

And when she activated Quantum Superposition again from there, the number of overlapping incidents began shooting up to infinity.

The only way to control the fractal of emptiness was the Ultima System, but Sirone gave up even that and kept multiplying the numbers.

"My goodness..."

Sirone's numbers swelled like bubbles, then became a giant sphere of bodies, completely trapping La Enemy.

"How are you going to endure this?"

If the numbers kept increasing like this, control would eventually become impossible, but Sirone wasn't worried.

'It doesn't matter, no matter how much they multiply.'

Neutralizing inevitability and chance.

The reason it was okay for Sirone's incidents to increase endlessly was that La Enemy's incidents would equally cancel them out.

"The bubbles... are disappearing."

Finally, the moment one Sirone grabbed La Enemy, all the Sirones began converging toward that single incident.
