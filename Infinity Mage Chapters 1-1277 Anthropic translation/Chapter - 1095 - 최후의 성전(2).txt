The Final Holy War (2)

As if a lens had been placed over the continent, the desert heat was rising higher each day.

"This is terrible."

Canis shielded the sun with his palm.

Due to the demon realm "Scorching" unleashed by the 5th Corps Commander Marbas, even the oases had completely dried up.

Sirone said, "Frigi and Argan are restoring the oases in each city. Though they won't last more than 3 days..."

Zulu pointed toward the horizon.

"Over there."

It was a massive oasis shimmering like a mirage.

"Nagnak. It means 'God's Grail.' It's royal territory directly managed by the Paras Kingdom."

Arin stuck out her tongue.

"Water."

Of course, water could be created with magic, but an oasis that could be seen and drunk was pure refreshment itself.

Canis said, "Within a 6-kilometer radius of the Pyramid of Truth is a restricted access zone. So pilgrims, travelers, and explorers all gather at Nagnak. In other words, it's the closest point accessible to ordinary people."

Sirone pulled out an entry permit.

"They said if I submit this to the National Treasury Management Department in Nagnak, soldiers will guide us."

While they were talking, they arrived at Nagnak.

It was a settlement of about 200 households, with many outsiders wandering around.

"Wow..."

As a cool breeze blew like cold water being poured over them, Arin took off her cloak and dried her sweat.

"Canis, look over there. The oasis hasn't dried up. It didn't rain during our stay at the royal castle."

"That's because—"

Just as Sirone was about to explain, two familiar apostles walked out from inside the village.

They were Frigi the Ice Dragon and Argan the Earth Dragon.

"It's dragons."

As Arin spoke about what she saw with her supernatural sight, Canis's shadow grew sharply longer.

Frigi approached.

"We have been waiting, Messiah." With silver hair and a cold appearance, he showed no emotion even in front of Sirone.

"The oasis is lasting quite long?"

Earth Dragon Argan said, "I worked on it with my breath 3 days ago. I was going to make rounds to other villages, but I received word from Kira and have been waiting in polymorph state."

Kira was a 1-star resident of the Integrated Space Management Department and a master of undead magic.

"Speaking of which, where is Kira?"

"He was supposed to wait with us, but he received an urgent telegram from the Ivory Tower and departed."

"A telegram?"

Sirone raised one eyebrow.

Stang Kingdom.

When Sirone called out, a streak of light flew across the sky and arrived before him.

"You summoned me?"

It was Lampa, a 3-star resident of the Ivory Tower and an authority on information magic.

"I heard that Kira from the Paras Kingdom received an urgent telegram and left. What happened?"

Unless it was a special case, all business was supposed to be reported to the Five Great Stars.

"Well..."

After hearing the explanation, Sirone's expression became serious.

"So they've finally shown themselves."

"Yes. The army of hell led by 1st Corps Commander Baal is currently engaged in battle with the Corona Kingdom. The war situation is neck and neck. All stars except for you, Sirone, have been summoned to the Ivory Tower."

"The Corona Kingdom isn't weak. What the Ivory Star is concerned about is... the demon realm?"

Lampa nodded.

"Deadly Cross. Baal, or more precisely Havitz, intends to break the Ivory Tower."

"But they still haven't opened the demon realm. There must be deeper intentions."

"They must have the holy war in mind. Corona is participating too. They're trying to hold the Ivory Tower hostage and gain an advantageous position in negotiations."

His head was already throbbing.

"But why didn't they call me? It would be sufficient if I went with Simultaneous Events."

Lampa spoke with difficulty.

"It was an order from the Ivory Star. I cannot fathom the reason, but the atmosphere at the Ivory Tower is also somewhat different from before."

"Lord Freed and Lord Amanta. The System Inspection Department and the Balance Department have lost their Five Great Stars. Losing 10 stars from the entire Ivory Tower is an enormous loss. For now, we have no choice but to absorb and integrate, and Lord Singh is at the center of that."

"Singh."

The Five Great Star of the Law Department.

"Lord Singh's perspective on the world differs from yours, Sirone. Though it hasn't surfaced yet, the stars and residents of the Ivory Tower are probably making decisions in their hearts. While Lord Minerva upholds Yahweh's banner, it's estimated that a considerable number follow Lord Singh's perspective."

"That's unexpected."

He wasn't being arrogant.

'We've shared much understanding. Even if not complete agreement, I believed we understood each other.'

What could be the reason for suddenly changing their minds?

"The atmosphere is not good. We should hold a great assembly, but with the holy war and the fierce battle situation in Corona... For now, the Ivory Star seems to have only blocked your summons, Sirone."

"Is it that serious? Of course, Singh is strong, but it's not like I haven't done anything at the Ivory Tower."

"That's the thing..."

Wrinkles deepened on Lampa's forehead.

"Lord Singh has approved the Law of Taiji. This fact seems to have shocked the stars and residents."

"Taiji."

Two people came to mind in Sirone's head.

"Eumji and Yangji."

Ivory Tower.

Twin sisters with identical appearances entered Singh's room.

"You summoned us?"

Eumji and Yangji.

4-star residents of the Ivory Tower, their atmospheres were completely different, making them easy to distinguish.

"Yes. What's the situation in Corona?"

Yangji answered, "Nothing much. Though Baal's army is the most powerful elite force in hell, I can sweep them away. Please send us right now."

Eumji said, "We must be cautious until all the stars gather. First, we should strengthen internal unity within the Ivory Tower..."

Yangji interrupted, "If we use our Taiji, Lord Singh's law will reach the realm of absolute realization. Let's just go. We'll sweep away the demon army and tear off Baal's thing."

"Ridiculous."

Eumji spat out.

"If Baal dies, Havitz will come. If one dies in Taiji, it will lead to the total annihilation of the Ivory Tower. The demons will control the world. They'll torture humans, and we'll also fall into their hands..."

She trembled all over.

"All sorts of things will happen to us. They won't kill us easily either. We'll scream, struggle, and meet our end. In the end, only pain. It's over. This world is doomed!"

Yangji shouted, "It's not doomed! We have 8 stars with the Law of Taiji. No Five Great Star is higher than us! Ah, Lord Singh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."

"Then what! We're human after all! No different from worms in the ground. Living beings are insignificant! We can never, ever defeat Satan!"

"I've had enough of listening to this..."

Singh cut them off.

"Stop."

Eumji and Yangji's expressions simultaneously reset, and they stood side by side like twins again.

"I understand your thoughts well. But I won't make any choice. First, making the residents of the Ivory Tower my allies is the proper order. Start from there."

Eumji asked, "If I may be so bold, why the split? I thought Lord Singh liked Lord Sirone."

Singh's eyes darkened.

"I trust no one. The reason I accepted you two was also to carry out my will. Convey my intentions to the stars of the System Inspection Department. It should be fine if you two go."

After Eumji and Yangji left the room, Singh turned toward the window overlooking the atmosphere.

"Sirone."

If he had to choose between like and dislike, it was definitely like.

"Understand me."

Nagnak Oasis.

Regardless of the political situation at the Ivory Tower, Sirone focused on what he had to do in Paras.

Simultaneous Events was his unique sense, so sharing it would only disturb everyone.

"Then, let's go."

The group headed toward the government office in the center of the village.

It was the only stone building, and across a table, a low-level official and pilgrims were arguing.

"We're not saying we want to go inside! We can't even see the pyramid from here!"

"It's a royal command. The number of people visiting this place has increased tenfold in the past two months. Go back."

"Then please let just my family go! If we can just cure the emotional illness, we'll return right away..."

"This person, really! Do you know how many people like you I deal with in a day? This isn't a hospital! Go back before I call security!"

Sirone looked at the carving engraved on the building wall.

'Pyramid of Truth.'

The shape of a large eye floating above a pyramid was carved in relief.

'All-seeing Eye.'

Did the ancients know about the eyes of the outer world?

'Super-ancient civilizations aren't recorded in Omega. All data could be lost if we're not careful. But...'

The fact that ancient people frequented the Pyramid of Truth could be known from the symbols.

After waiting his turn, Sirone went to the table with the pass given directly by the king.

"Hello. For the Pyramid of Truth—"

"Sigh."

The official sighed first.

"Look, if you have ears, you would have heard, right? How many times do you make me say this! Are you looking down on people just because they work in the middle of the desert!"

"No, that's not it..."

As Sirone was about to present the pass first, someone at the end of the table suddenly shouted.

"What are you talking about? I got permission 4 months ago! From the Minister of Land Management!"

"That was 4 months ago. Don't you know the world situation? The king's name has changed, so what use is this document?"

"4 months is incredibly tight! Archaeological exploration isn't child's play, with personnel and equipment..."

"Ah, forget it. If it's not allowed, it's not allowed, so go back."

The official dealing with Sirone turned his head again and said with a sneer, "See? Even the Land Management Minister's influence doesn't work in this situation. So..."

The official who was about to hand back the pass with both hands suddenly widened his eyes.

"Huh? This is..."

King Kitra of Paras's seal was stamped prominently in the center of the pass.

"I apologize!"

The official's face turned pale as he stood up abruptly and shouted, causing everyone to look in that direction.

The explorer at the end also looked at Sirone's group but soon turned his head back to the official.

"Anyway, if I can't get approval for this, I'll officially sue the Paras Kingdom..."

The voice of the official handling Sirone could be heard.

"Please, come this way."

Seeing him guide the group even away from the table, the explorer suddenly realized.

"Hey! Those people! They're going to the Pyramid of Truth right now, aren't they? How is this happening? Wasn't it access forbidden?"

"Wh-what are you saying? His Majesty the King..."

As if he didn't need to listen, the explorer turned and chased after Sirone.

"Hey, you guys there! Wait a minute!"

When Sirone turned around, an explorer with a beard grown down to his chest grabbed his shoulder and shook him.

"You guys got approval, right?"

"Well, that's..."

"Tell me! No, take me with you! Our team has been preparing for a long time! We'll definitely be helpful."

Since it was a dangerous mission, Sirone didn't want to involve civilians if possible.

"I'm sorry. We have separate..."

"I'll pay money! Is it because of emotional illness? Or ancient artifacts? Don't be like that..."

"Hmm?"

The explorer, who had been half out of his mind, changed his expression and stared intently at Sirone.

"Si-rone?"

Hearing his name, Sirone also looked at the face hidden behind the beard with a blank expression.

"Huh?"

At that moment, the explorer's eyes glowed red.

"Uhahaha! Yes, Sirone! You really are Sirone!"

"Mr. Ares?"

It was Amy's second older brother.
