EXO Universe (4)

Constantine, heading toward the annex, preached to every human he encountered along the way.

"Believe in the god Crea."

"...Yes."

Without exception, everyone he contacted became expressionless and turned into "People," changing direction.

'I am...'

Constantine was not an OOPArt.

'A divine agent.'

Perhaps it was destiny that he, who wasn't exposed to the pyramid's waves, gained such abilities.

'Forgive me, god Crea. Delusion remained within me. I harbored doubts I wasn't even aware of.'

Tears flowed.

Though he had believed in god's existence despite all the world's skepticism, he too was human after all.

But now it was different.

'I saw with my own two eyes. I heard with my own two ears. God's workings, that brilliant evidence.'

If it exists, one can believe, and that belief was absolute enough to befit being called a pope.

Therefore, from god's perspective, his belief also becomes an absolute, immutable law.

"Hehe, an age of god..."

Not a world created by humans, but kneeling before a transcendent absolute being.

Just imagining it made his heart race.

'I will dye the entire world in god's name.'

And right beneath that name, Constantine - he himself - would stand tall.

'World Leadership Council?' Though everyone in the holy war was striving to gain legitimacy through Constantine's approval.

"What nonsense."

He had no interest in human nations.

"1 hour 49 minutes 12 seconds. 11 seconds. 10 seconds."

At the suddenly heard voice, he turned to see a vagrant emerging from around the corner.

His clothes were dirty, and his unwashed hair reaching his shoulders made him look like a corpse.

"Kitra?"

Constantine intuited this upon seeing a withered snake coiled around the man's neck.

'Why is the king of Paras Kingdom here?'

What did it matter.

"1 hour 48 minutes 42 seconds. 41 seconds. 40 seconds..."

"Kitra."

To create another believer, Constantine extended his hand toward Kitra.

"Praise god Crea."

"36 seconds. 35..."

The time counting stopped.

"Crea?"

The moment Kitra turned his head, Constantine received a soul-freezing shock.

"Ah, aah..."

Unlike him who was overcome with emotion, Kitra was indifferent.

"God has no name."

Constantine dropped to both knees with a thud and prostrated himself in the most miserable posture possible.

This wasn't Rami religion's etiquette, but instinct.

"Please save me."

...This was god.

The moment one encounters it, the forms, dispositions, and doctrines humans had imagined become meaningless.

Kitra asked.

"You haven't lost your mind."

"My heart belongs only to you. Use it as you will."

"Kill Maya."

'Maya?'

For a moment he wondered, but he couldn't muster the courage to look up at Kitra and ask.

"I will obey your will."

As Constantine got up and left the corridor, Kitra turned in the opposite direction.

Until the universe closes...

"1 hour 46 minutes 55 seconds. 54 seconds. 53 seconds."

"Aaaaah!" Satiel's mental body screamed.

'No.'

Amid the cosmic changes in universal law, the angels managed to protect their minds, but nothing would change.

God circumvents countless causes to force through the desired result.

'What god, the whole, the universe wants is...'

Void.

By photon realm standards, in about 1 hour and 30 minutes, the universe would scatter into particles smaller than atoms.

After that, eternal nothingness, and then into a realm of infinite void where even that concept couldn't exist.

'It can't end like this.'

Though he had always fought prepared for annihilation, the pressure he felt now was of a different dimension.

Not because he couldn't be resurrected.

'Even if I'm annihilated...'

As long as this universe exists, it would continue eternally in someone's heart.

'But everything becomes nothing.' The hatred toward Ikael, the resentment toward Guffin - it all becomes momentary delusion.

Ooooooooh!

As tremendous law rushed in, the mental bodies of the seven archangels began scattering into particles.

Ikael resisted with all his might.

'If we're pushed back here, it's over.'

If the seven archangels, the initial concepts, were dismantled, the universe's scattering process would be instantaneous.

'Without Uriel, it's huge. With seven concepts, slowing time is the most we can do.'

Even that wouldn't last much longer.

"Ikael."

At that moment, he heard a familiar voice.

"Amy?"

"I'm here."

When Amy, who had permeated the sun as a fire incarnation, connected with the mental body, Ikael was surprised.

'Whoa.'

She was incomparably more powerful than before.

"I'll help you."

With Amy's joining, the archangels avoided dismantlement, but they had only bought about an hour.

Ikael spoke honestly.

"I'm sorry. We can't prevent annihilation. If Miss Amy stays here, you'll face the same fate."

He hoped she would spend the remaining time with Sirone.

"No. We'll survive."

"What?"

As the archangel's attention focused on Amy, she smiled and said.

"Because Sirone is creating something incredible."

"Mica."

"Construction progress is 87.9546 percent."

It was spectacular.

Whatever it was, it was on a scale that no one born human could ever see.

The Sirone Sphere had completely surrounded the sun, with only detailed assembly remaining.

'Less than 1 hour and 30 minutes left now.' At the current speed, completion would take 3 hours, but by then the universe would already be gone.

'I need to increase the speed by more than double.'

Simultaneous events are like ten fingers coordinating to play an instrument.

In other words, just because one finger disappears doesn't make the other fingers faster, but...

'Material is different.'

It would be like suddenly changing sheet music and requiring the concentration to play it in real time.

Indeed, after the Apocalypse ended, the sphere's work speed had improved dramatically.

'That's how we got the remaining 3 hours, but this time is different in dimension. One wrong move and the simultaneous event could break.'

Sirone was cautious.

'If I could just get the result for sure, there'd be no reason to hesitate. But the problem is...'

Could he really meet the deadline?

If he focused on Material and even broke the simultaneous event, it would be neither here nor there.

Wasn't this something that had to be done?

"Faster."

As Sirone, having made his decision, increased the work speed, the space where matter emerged glowed red-hot.

"Graaaah!"

In the realm of unity between mind and matter, his consciousness became hazy, and the foundation of simultaneous events began to waver.

"Ugh!"

Sirone, who had been blocking the procession of People at the entrance to Delta headquarters, suddenly clutched his head.

"Yahweh!"

The southern warriors called out in concern, but Sirone soon raised his head.

'I won't give up.'

The moment the procession of People entered Delta, Maya would inevitably die.

'Maya.'

Imagining her song, Sirone's eyes blazed.

"Hand of God."

The hand of light filled with protective intent pushed back the procession, instantly creating a 20-meter distance.

"Yahweh, you are an error."

Even while colliding and tumbling with each other, the People repeated the same words without any change in expression.

Feeling eerie, Sirone concentrated his wavering mind on a single point.

Integrating two points of focus into one was...

"I'm not an error."

Similar in difficulty to having to play unfamiliar sheet music at ultra-high speed, but...

"It's the heart."

According to Reyna from his childhood, Sirone was quite good at sight-reading.

Ooooooooh!

As law and heart collided once again, the procession of People began being pushed back endlessly.

"Sirone will..."

Fermi said from in front of the window.

"Manage it somehow. In any situation, he finds the best method and executes it."

Seriel smiled and replied.

"He's been like that since school days."

"It's not just about having skills. Cold judgment, courage to gamble, situational awareness to set the standards for those bets, calculation speed, diversity that doesn't limit the number of methods, flexibility to break through one side when the other is blocked, and so on."

Fermi turned around.

"What we simply call 'being good at something' actually contains many things. Solving problems is the totality of human ability. And as far as I know, that guy is probably the most excellent problem-solving magician there is."

"How unusual for you to praise Sirone so much? You're acting strange today. Is something really wrong?"

Fermi turned around again.

"Maya dies in 10 minutes."

"What!"

Seriel shot up.

"How can you tell me that now, you crazy bastard! You knew this and you're just sitting here?"

"It's not something that can be stopped. God's will means forcing through results. I've done everything I could."

Fermi pointed to the main gate.

"Sirone will block the procession of People. That's why I can deceive."

"Deceive? Who?"

"God."

Sometimes when conversing with someone whose perspective is too broad, you think they've gone mad.

"If Sirone succeeds, god will find a workaround. It's a strategy that's possible because that guy will succeed. Probably countless causes we don't know about are intertwining right now. And the moment god reaches the desired result through that..."

Fermi struck his palm with his fist.

"I'll throw a counter."

"I can't understand it. No, I don't want to understand it. Is Maya really going to die?"

"I don't know."

Fermi said quietly, imagining Maya's song that would be reaching its climax.

"Even god wouldn't know that."

It was up to Cayden.

Even after Maya's voice had disappeared, her phantom echo lingered in the air of the annex.

The only sounds breaking the silence were quiet gasps of admiration from here and there in the audience.

Panier lowered his baton.

'Well done, Maya.'

And he took in the sight of her, still breathing heavily with excitement not yet faded from her expression.

'Now you're the world's best.'

"Bravo!"

The moment someone stood up and shouted, applause and cheers erupted from all directions.

Only then did Maya's expression relax.

'It's over.'

In truth, she couldn't hear the applause, the whistles, or the voices praising her.

'I can go home.'

Just the relief of having fulfilled her responsibility made her feel like she owned the world.

"Amazing! Maya!"

At the voice from backstage, she turned to see Cayden applauding.

'Right. He was always by my side.'

Only after the performance ended did everything that had happened to her hit as reality.

"Sob..."

Maya, finally bursting into tears, bowed her head to the audience.

"Thank you."

As the applause grew louder, her colleagues took her hands and led her to center stage.

"Go forward, Maya. You're the star."

Watching the performers respond with flushed faces, Panier smiled.

'She won't want to do this again.'

Wasn't it a bit harsh to have to fight fear for countless hours just for this brief moment of joy?

'Hehe, absolutely not.'

She could never leave.

'She'll have to come back. The emotion she's feeling now will be more thrilling than a lifetime of happiness.'

Meanwhile, Cayden backstage was also applauding as enthusiastically as the audience.

'Well done. Well done, Maya.'

His chest swelled seeing her standing alongside the world's greatest performers, when...

"Huh?"

His applauding hands unconsciously dropped to grip his sword hilt.

No one noticed.

'What?'

The fact that on the opposite side of the unlit stage, a man was aiming a crossbow...
