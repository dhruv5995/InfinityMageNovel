[755] The Doctrine of Evil (2)

The Holy War was heading toward the worst possible situation.

Even after Gustav Havitz XVII declared war on the world and left the conference hall, the representatives of each nation remained silent.

'A real war?'

Despite being at the pinnacle of power, their hearts were racing because their opponent was the worst tyrant in human history.

President Basari of the Cotria Republic, the host nation of the Holy War, spoke with a pale face.

"Are we supposed to believe this? That a world war has just broken out at this very moment?"

If Havitz deployed his forces, the first target would be the Cotria Republic, closest to Gustav.

"It's impossible to analyze Havitz's thinking. But if it's him, someone faithful to his desires, it's probably true."

Even among the Holy War representatives, Uorin's words carried special weight, and President Basari's face turned grim.

"But why? Isn't this a war he can't win? The Holy War will take damage, but Gustav will be destroyed."

King Casartac of the Paras Kingdom spoke up.

"Our nation calculated Gustav Empire's chances of victory at below 10 percent, assuming they abandon Valkyrie. If he's simply a madman, even if he starts a war, we just need to crush him."

"He's not mad."

Everyone in the Holy War turned to look at Uorin.

"Of course, Gustav's chances of winning the war are extremely slim. But assuming a certain situation, it's over 90 percent."

Emperor Jingang of the Jincheon Empire asked.

"What situation?"

"The probability that the world becomes a complete mess."

The pupils of each nation's representatives wavered.

"What Havitz is thinking isn't just something like war. If Gustav Empire raises armies and extends toward the continent, the east, and the south, it becomes difficult to protect the spiritual realm. Eventually, the demons will break through the barricades and burst into the world..."

From that point on, it would be chaos.

"He's driving us into an unpredictable situation."

Uorin nodded.

"Havitz moves on instinct, but Gustav's Four Horsemen are probably already drawing up plans in their heads. If it's a situation where probability becomes meaningless, it's worth trying. And in such a situation, Havitz's abnormal thinking would become a powerful weapon."

If war meant consuming everything available, Gustav's strategy of utilizing the hidden world was excellent.

'Havitz XVII. A frightening man. What's more disturbing is that he didn't think and judge. He's just feeling it.'

If you truly believe it, the fact that the world will inevitably revolve around you.

"Are we done with human affairs?"

First Dragon Blitz rose from his seat.

"I've listened this far as a member of the Holy War, so I suppose I've observed proper protocol. Now I'll convey our dragon race's agenda."

Though his tone was quite arrogant, no one took offense because Blitz had the qualifications for such an attitude.

'One of the Twelve Apostles Who Keep Time. Among them, the Thunder Wing Dragon said to be strongest in combat power.'

Since this was the first time he attended the Holy War representing the dragon race, the representatives perked up their ears.

"As of today, the dragon race withdraws from the Holy War."

"......"

Though anyone could withdraw like Gustav if they paid the price, gasps escaped throughout the hall.

"May we ask the reason?"

It wasn't yet time to inform humans.

"The dragon race joined the Holy War to protect time from Ankera's reset. And now Ra's will has been passed to Nane, and we've reached the point of closing time. For us, there's something we must stop before evilâ€”emptiness."

With the new directionality of love and emptiness, it was no longer possible to define the world through the simple dichotomy of good and evil.

'So it comes to this after all.'

Nane, who said they must go where the real exists, versus Sirone, who said only where we put our hearts now is real.

'This is just the beginning. Many more will newly define themselves according to the compass of law.'

Countries would emerge following Gustav Empire, and this wouldn't exclude even Holy War nations.

Enox, representative of the fairy race, asked.

"You're withdrawing from the Holy War? Then what about us?"

"Why ask me? You're the fairy representative. If you want to stick with humans, do that."

Though his tone suggested they handle it themselves, he couldn't hide the nuance that he found involvement in human affairs distasteful.

"Hmm."

While the Seven Star representatives watched with stern faces, only Uorin was certain.

'They'll remain in the Holy War.'

Heaven's fairies and the human world's fairies are distinguished by the names Fairy and Elf.

Elves have mental strength comparable to Fairies and, most importantly, bodies close to humans.

'Their magical mastery is incomparable to humans.'

They were presumably the result of unions between heaven's fairies and Norse, meaning there had been terrible experiments in the distant past.

"I'll stay in the Holy War. If war breaks out, countless lives will die, so naturally the fairy race should help."

Uorin found it chilling.

'What kind of race could sacrifice their lives for a weaker race?'

If this too was good, it was far too 'artificial' good.

"Fairy representative, your choice seems to warm the hearts of all gathered here."

Enox blushed and stuck out her tongue.

"Hehe, I got praised. Don't worry. Fairies have helped humans since long ago. Unlike the noble dragon race."

"Hmph."

Blitz turned away coldly and transformed his body before even leaving through the door, flying up to the sky.

After he disappeared through the ceiling, large chunks of stone debris came crashing down where the round table had been.

"...The worst Holy War."

Sirone tucked the dagger into his chest.

'I can't reconstruct this.'

The reason Material could theoretically create any object was because it generated matter.

But the significance of <Law Kill> lay not in the matter but in the spirit contained within it, making imitation impossible.

'It would just create a dagger of the same shape.'

It was the same principle as how even if Sirone combined organic matter to create a human body, he couldn't breathe life into it.

As Verdi calmed down, his mother stood up.

"I need to clean the house."

Seeing corpses was horrible for her too, but if they weren't careful, the whole family could be massacred.

"I'll go wring out some rags. First the blood..."

"It's no use, Mom."

Verdi shook his head.

"Everyone will notice anyway. The houses for collection are predetermined. If we don't run away now, we'll be caught."

Even if he explained <Law Kill>, they wouldn't believe it.

That's why what was more frightening than execution was the torture that would be persistently inflicted to uncover the truth.

"You don't need to worry."

Sirone approached Verdi and his mother.

"I don't have <Law Kill>, but I'll protect you. So let's think of a solution together. What would you like to do?"

Though Verdi briefly showed a hopeful expression, despair soon filled his eyes.

"Don't lie. Why would someone as strong as you help us? Mom and I are useless anyway."

He knew well enough that the reason Sirone came here was <Law Kill>, not himself.

"You'll leave eventually anyway. Because there's no time, because you think you've done enough, because it becomes bothersome..."

A child raised in harsh circumstances seemed to know more than adults from peaceful worlds.

"I won't leave."

Sirone stroked Verdi with a pitying expression.

"I absolutely won't leave until the means threatening you and your family completely disappear. I promise."

If universal love meant being unable to kill someone to save someone else, then Sirone had to handle the affairs of this place.

"Will you really... protect us?"

Though the fate of having to protect everyone was painful, right now he was happy about the fact that she didn't have to leave immediately.

"Of course. It's absolutely not bothersome. You're the most valuable person in the world. I'll do my best to protect you."

Faced with words and emotions they'd never heard or felt in their entire lives, Verdi and his mother burst into tears.

"Thank you. Thank you."

Since time was short, Sirone regained his composure and turned to the mother.

"Is this your entire family? Perhaps your husband..."

"No. My husband is currently doing forced labor. He works at a military facility for about a month before coming back."

Shadows crossed the mother's face.

"Whatever work they make him do, no matter how much I ask, he won't say. He says if it's known, the whole family will be massacred. But..."

"But?"

"It doesn't seem like normal work. When he comes home, he just sleeps for three days without eating... He talks strangely in his sleep. Like he's having nightmares."

"What does he say?"

Though she seemed embarrassed to speak of it, the mother eventually confessed.

"'I won't bear a monster's child.'"

"Excuse me, but your husband..."

"Yes, of course he's a man. Verdi's biological father. So it's strange that he has such dreams. When I asked in the morning, he threw things and got angry. He's not the type to get angry at family."

Though Sirone had some suspicions, it wasn't something to discuss in front of Verdi and his mother.

"Alright. Let's go find your husband first."

Leaving the soldiers' corpses behind, Sirone led Verdi and his mother outside.

Even with a hood, they'd quickly arouse suspicion, so they took a large detour through the mountains to enter the military facility.

'It really is heavily guarded.'

Though Sirone had experienced several nations while sealing altars, this was the first place with such strict military discipline.

"Are you sure it's okay to follow?"

Verdi and his mother, staying close behind Sirone, were so tense they could barely breathe.

"I don't know your husband's face. Even if it's not your husband, please tell me if you see any familiar faces."

After passing about seven buildings while avoiding the tight security, Verdi's mother pointed ahead.

"There, that's Albas."

A man whose eyes were so dead he might as well have been a corpse was dragging a cart reeking of rotten food.

"He's my husband's friend. My goodness, how did a person become like that..."

The Albas she remembered had been a big man weighing over 100 kilograms just a month ago.

"Can you call him?"

Desperate to find her husband, Verdi's mother gathered courage and stepped out of the shadows.

"Albas. Albas."

Albas, who hadn't even turned his head, suddenly came to his senses and turned around with a shocked expression.

"Mardel? How are you here..."

He set down the cart handle and quickly ran over while looking left and right, grabbing her shoulders.

"Are you crazy? Do you know where this is? Go home quickly!"

"What about my husband? Haven't you seen my husband?"

Only then did Albas notice Verdi, who was on the verge of tears, and the stranger holding her hand.

"This is insane. Don't tell me you came to rescue him?"

"Yes. This person will protect us. Come escape with us, Albas."

Albas hung his head glumly.

"Give up. I don't know what kind of person this guy is, but Baseto won't be able to return now. Just raise Verdi well. Tell my family the same thing."

"Can't return! Don't tell me my husband...!"

Sirone interrupted.

"What kind of work are you doing here?"

He'd probably cut off his thinking to survive in this place.

As Albas pondered what to answer, he finally realized what he was doing and his face turned pale.

"I don't know. I don't know either."

Albas covered his face and sobbed.

"This place... has demons living in it."
