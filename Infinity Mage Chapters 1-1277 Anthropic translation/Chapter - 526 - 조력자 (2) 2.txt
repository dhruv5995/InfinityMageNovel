[526] Helper (2)

Fermi didn't seem particularly surprised.

Thinking he was better than Enrique, Miro entered the room with Arius.

"How disappointing. Here you are in the prime of your youth, cooped up during vacation doing dishes. I was hoping to catch you doing something strange so I could tease you about it."

"Doing such things during vacation isn't particularly constructive either. Why did you come?"

Miro, seated on the sofa, changed the subject.

"Do you really remember? You were only three when we last met. When I called 'Geumdong, Geumdong,' you'd giggle and come running."

"I retain all memories from when my brain began functioning."

"You definitely take after your mother. Your father can't even remember what happened yesterday. Oh, then perhaps the baldness is..."

"Hah."

Fermi was getting annoyed.

"Just get to the point. Why are you here?"

"Did you hear that I went to heaven and came back?"

"I don't know."

Thinking it was probably true, Miro removed Sirone's robe.

"Ta-da, how's this? Does this spark some interest?"

Fermi briefly looked at Sirone's sleeping face before turning back to Miro.

"We're acquainted."

During the height of graduation class competition, Sirone had given up on evaluation, and there had been no news of him since.

"Sirone was in heaven too. He fought with the fate of the world at stake. Don't you want to hear what happened?"

Fermi leaned back against the sofa as if bored.

"I'm not interested."

"Don't be like that, just listen. In heaven, there's this strange creature called Ankera..."

"Anyway."

Fermi interrupted.

"Isn't that something Ardrias should handle?"

Miro bit her lip and smiled apologetically.

"Whether the world ends or not, whatever monsters live in other worlds - I don't care. Same goes for Sirone. If he returns to school, I'll crush him, and if he can't return, that's fine too."

"Really? Then why did you enroll in Alpheas Magic School?"

"What are you trying to say?"

Abnormal madness filled Fermi's eyes.

"It has nothing to do with you. The Ardrias family is just a ruined legacy of the past."

Before Fermi could even speak properly, the Ardino family had suffered countless hardships, and 19 years later, he had become an unregistered mage.

"I'm sorry for the damage caused. I mean that sincerely. But it was an unavoidable choice."

"Don't misunderstand. I enrolled in Alpheas for personal purposes. There's a lot of money to be made there."

Miro regained her smile.

"Then how about using your power to achieve that purpose this time too?"

Like a cat hiding its claws, Fermi's madness instantly disappeared inward.

While switching tactics in the face of money might be a unique trait of the Ardinos, Miro couldn't shake the feeling that he was trying hard.

"I'm not one to refuse deals. But if the other party is my aunt, there might be conditions."

"Tell me."

Fermi pointed to the floor.

"If you kneel before me and beg for forgiveness, I'll consider it. After all, I'm also an Ardino, so I can't just make deals carelessly."

"That's easy."

Miro was sincere.

"Kneeling is no difficult matter. If you're of Ardrias blood, you can change your heart as easily as flipping your palm. So I want to ask you one thing."

"What?"

"Do you think there's a difference to me between kneeling before you and killing you right here and now?"

"..."

There would be no difference.

The Ardrias Miro he knew was someone unconstrained by anything.

"Haha!"

Fermi laughed brightly as if nothing had happened.

"I'm joking. As if I'd make my aunt do such a thing. But I will definitely receive payment for the deal."

"That's fine by me. I've got an incredibly solid sponsor backing me."

"That's welcome news. Then let's begin. What do you need me to help with?"

Miro relayed exactly what she had told Uorin, even revealing the conclusion Uorin had reached.

"Hmm, extraction of collateral."

Being a brilliant talent, Fermi understood immediately.

He also intuited that this would be as massive a deal as the reputations of Miro and Theraze warranted.

"Well, this does generate some motivation."

Fermi becoming motivated was fortunate.

What Miro wanted was not only Fermi's abilities, but also the vast magical knowledge possessed by the Ardino family.

"Can you extract Sirone's magic?"

Instead of answering, Fermi raised the hand resting on the armrest.

Unregistered Magic

Depreciation Deal.

Various colored and patterned chips fell with a cheerful clatter from beneath Fermi's palm.

As the chips stacked up like a tower, he flicked the topmost chip into the air.

"Nice. What kind of magic is that?"

Catching the falling chip, Fermi said:

"Summoning magic Epoxy Tosca."

"Oho."

Miro caught the chip Fermi threw.

It had a mottled two-tone pattern, with an insect resembling a spider drawn on the central decal portion.

"It's a large bug that inhabits Lake Tosca. It attaches to human spines, secretes hallucinogenic inducers, and sucks blood. In the hallucinogenic state, one can only tell the truth, and if forcibly removed, it self-destructs by spewing strong acid, dissolving everything down to the bones within 48 hours."

"Perfect for criminal use."

"Exactly. Of course, I purchased it from royal contacts. Magic needed by superiors comes with a premium, so I bought it expensively."

"Can you extract any magic?"

When Miro threw the chip, Fermi caught it again.

"Basically, yes. Unregistered magic that steals or copies others' magic involves complex conditions or dangerous prices in the process of equivalent exchange. On the other hand, conditions and prices don't matter to me."

"Because you use equivalent exchange itself as a tool."

Fermi smiled broadly like an idiot.

"Exactly. I'm merely an intermediary who completes unregistered magic. When trading magic, the intentions of both seller and buyer must be reflected."

Since the giving and receiving parties had already reached agreement, no special conditions or prices applied to Fermi.

"The medium for balancing both sides would be money. I understand roughly. Then how do you measure prices?"

Fermi extended his left hand.

Unregistered Magic

Depreciation Deal Contract.

A sheet of paper materialized and was grasped.

"Prices are based on the broker's reasonable judgment according to circumstances. Of course, false testimony is impossible. If I set prices that lose reasonability..."

"The unregistered magic itself won't activate."

"Correct. The advantage of this magic is that the broker has no separate conditions to fulfill. Ultimately, the decision is made by the parties involved. However, there are problems here too."

"You mean problems with the traders?"

"Yes. For example, factors like 'regret' or 'change of heart.' Permanently transferring another's magic requires risks beyond magical value."

"So you applied depreciation."

"The conclusion I reached after much consideration was that I needed to create the possibility of 'contract cancellation.' If we could return to before the contract, customers' anxiety would weaken and the unregistered magic would become more solid."

Fermi placed the deal contract on the table.

"If magic A is worth 100 gold for a month's rental, depreciation costs are applied according to contract period. For example, if it's three months, the second month would be 60 gold, the third month 30 gold. Cancellation is possible, as well as transfer and extension."

A smile formed on Miro's lips as she examined the contract.

Using depreciation, any deal could be made within reasonable limits.

"Good. Once value is assessed like that, what's left?"

"We need to set fees. I set fees for all funds exchanged between customers. Between 1 percent and 99 percent."

"Kuk kuk kuk."

Miro lowered her head and burst into laughter.

While magical value couldn't be falsified, fees could be set entirely at Fermi's discretion.

Of course, this was natural.

No one would create such unregistered magic for others' benefit.

Also, by arbitrarily setting fees, he could manipulate situations to control both sellers and buyers.

"I expected as much. Honestly, if it weren't at least this much, I would have thought the Ardino family was finished. Now then, shall we hear it? What do you judge the value of Valhalla Action to be?"

Fermi rested his chin on his hand and fell into thought.

False testimony was impossible; he had to present only numbers he truly believed as value.

Judging there were no further calculations needed, Fermi slowly opened his mouth.

"100 billion gold."

Arius gulped.

He recalled when he had previously tried to sell the looted Ataraxia to Zion for 4 billion gold plus the condition of joining Theraze's line.

Of course, joining Theraze's line was worth far more than 4 billion gold, and Fermi's valuation criteria included "according to circumstances," but even so, 100 billion gold was an amount he had never even considered.

'Well, if that's what an expert thinks, then I suppose that's how it is.'

Arius thought he should absolutely never go into business, even later, but Fermi's scale was much larger than his.

"Based on a three-year contract. 100 billion gold in the first year, 60 billion gold in the second year, 30 billion gold in the third year. With a deal of roughly 200 billion gold scale, we should be able to extract Valhalla Action."

Miro wasn't particularly surprised.

It was quite predictable that Theraze, as the buyer, would present a blank check, and it wasn't money coming from her own wallet anyway.

"Good. The fee would probably be 99 percent, right?"

As if there was no need to ask, Fermi shrugged.

"Then let's draft the contract. After that, once the seller and buyer's signatures are in, the deal is complete."

"I can go get Theraze's signature, but Sirone is currently in a moratorium state and can't sign. It's not like just holding his hand and scribbling would work, right?"

"Of course not."

"Then how do we get the signature?"

Fermi blinked.

"Why are you asking me that? You should figure it out yourself, Aunt."

"Geumdong."

Miro said with a smile in her eyes.

"You don't think I came here because I couldn't find an unregistered mage who extracts magic, do you? This is worth how much? You need to take responsibility to the end. If you're someone called a genius in the broker world, you should be able to find some method even in this situation."

Though Miro seemed determined to push, Fermi remained indifferent.

"How would I know something you don't know?"

"No, you do know."

"Why do you think that?"

"Because even after hearing that Sirone is in a moratorium, you explained the depreciation deal. That means there's a method, doesn't it?"

"Don't jump to conclusions. That kind of rhetoric doesn't pressure merchants at all."

"Really? Then shall I speak in a merchant's way?"

Miro, leaning back in her chair, crossed her arms and legs.

"At first I wondered why you created such magic. If it was to make money, the Ardino family's financial power would be sufficient, wouldn't it?"

"More assumptions."

"Keep listening. Ultimately, what you want is the highest grade magic. That is, magic with astronomical value. Then it becomes clear why you created this magic."

Fermi finally looked back at Miro.

"There's exactly one thing missing from what you explained. The condition you must accept to arbitrarily set fees."

Miro smiled the victor's smile.

"When a broker purchases chips for use, that funding must be paid with fees generated up to that point."

'Damn it...!'

Profanity rose in Fermi's mind.
