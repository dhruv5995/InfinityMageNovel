The Counterattack of Evil (4)

Wizard's parents were dumbfounded.

"What is this child saying right now? You shouldn't use the word 'die' so carelessly."

Her father apologized.

"I'm sorry. She's still just a child who doesn't know how the world works. She probably doesn't even know what dying means."

"I know too. It's really scary."

If she was truly a wizard of super-logic, she would have already sensed all the possible outcomes that could happen to her.

"Yes, it's very frightening," Sirone said.

"It might not end with just dying. Your arm could break, terrible things could happen to you. A blade could cut your body..."

"Stop! Please stop!"

Her mother's eyes welled up with tears.

"Why are you saying such horrible things! She's only seven years old! Go save the world yourself!"

"I will."

Sirone answered coldly.

"I don't want to send Wizard. That's why I'm trying to scare her even more. So, are you still not afraid?"

"Yeah, I'm okay."

Wizard didn't hesitate.

"I might get hurt and it might be painful. But I'll still do it. I want to keep going."

'This child really understands.'

She had never experienced it before, but she understood it intellectually through insight...

"You're a wizard."

Wizard grinned as if she'd been praised, then turned to her parents to drive the point home.

"I'm sorry, Mom. I want to follow my big brother. Please let me go, okay?"

Her mother was shocked by her daughter's sudden change.

"Wi-Wizard."

Just this morning, she had been acting childishly and giving the teachers headaches.

Lampa's eyes narrowed.

'She was waiting for this. No, maybe she didn't think of it consciously, but in her deepest heart...'

Perhaps she had been afraid?

'No one could provide her with the right answer. Loneliness, anxiety, fear. Those negative emotions probably manifested as displays of superiority.'

But the current Wizard was different.

'All her senses are frantically absorbing Sirone. What this is, what she needs to do to become like this.'

It was one of the correct answers.

As Wizard's parents realized her determination and were left speechless, the administrator interjected.

"Ahem, shall we go inside first? Now that we've heard Wizard's resolve, we can discuss the detailed procedures..."

"That won't be necessary."

Sirone said without even turning his gaze.

"We'll pay whatever amount Stang wants. If there are other conditions, tell Mr. Lampa."

Her father shouted.

"My daughter is not merchandise! Even if Wizard wants this, we still oppose it!"

"Yes. I also think it's unreasonable. I was just confirming her resolve, but my thoughts haven't changed."

Sirone knelt on one knee in front of Wizard.

"Listen carefully, Wizard. The enemy you'll face is one of the strongest humans in the world. No, maybe they can't even be called human."

Wizard's eyes sparkled.

"That's why your big brother can't send you right now. I'll stay here for a while and test you. In very harsh and painful ways. If you pass, you'll follow me and become a wizard, but if you don't pass..."

Sirone met her parents' eyes and continued.

"You're not ready to face the world yet. You'll wait until your big brother calls for you again. Can you promise me that?"

He knew Wizard's determination, but the opponent was Habitz, called the ultimate evil of the era.

'As long as Satan remains, humanity has no future. If everything's going to be ruined anyway, I'd rather do it with my own hands...'

This was the only consideration he could offer Wizard.

"Okay. I'll do that."

Though it took longer than usual, when she finally answered, Sirone nodded and looked back at the administrator.

"Nothing has been decided. For the time being, we'll stay at the magic school and teach Wizard. Of course, if you want, other students can join the classes too."

It was a decision to gain Stang Kingdom's consent, and as expected, the administrator gulped.

'Stars of the Ivory Tower at the school...'

Though he couldn't secure a contract immediately, this much would satisfy the king.

"I'll report to His Majesty first. Whether he'll approve will be communicated later..."

Sirone didn't even pay attention and bowed his head to Wizard's parents.

"Please entrust Wizard to me. You're welcome to observe the classes anytime. If you still refuse after that, I won't be greedy anymore."

The couple looked at each other.

They still couldn't understand Sirone's intentions, but they only had one choice.

Kido wandered through the downtown area where reconstruction was in full swing.

"What am I even doing?"

He had entered human society on a whim, but there was no place for him here either.

'She's really a bad woman.'

Remembering the humiliation he suffered from Uorin made his teeth chatter, but when he actually tried to leave, he felt regretful.

'There were fun times too. Should I just pretend I can't win and go back? I think I'll regret it.'

It's disgusting.

The moment those words Uorin had spat out stabbed him like a dagger, a fiery impulse arose.

"Ah, I don't know! So annoying!"

He plopped down on the edge of the stone path and looked ahead at the construction site while fuming.

Habitz was beheading a worker.

"Hmm..."

Kido rested his chin on his hand.

'Maybe my dreams were too big.'

Every time Habitz performed his sword dance, headless corpses convulsed and spurted fountains of blood.

"It's not because I'm a goblin, but Uorin is an Empress. She's someone that even normal humans can't dare to approach."

Thinking this way made his heart feel much lighter.

"No need to have an inferiority complex. From Uorin's perspective, humans and I are equally insignificant anyway. At least I'm on the stronger side..."

Habitz emerged from the construction site and indiscriminately massacred citizens walking through the streets.

"Of course, that doesn't change anything. That woman thinks of me as an animal anyway."

As Kido sighed deeply, a severed citizen's arm dropped in front of his eyes.

"Right, let me get some fresh air before going back. Smart me should endure this. Why isn't Sirone coming?"

With his mind cleared, Kido stared blankly at the severed arm oozing blood.

That's when it happened.

"...Something's strange."

Those words came out without him realizing it.

'Huh? Strange? No, now that I think about it, it really is strange. But what's strange about it?'

When he looked up, Habitz was approaching.

"It's been a while, goblin."

His voice was vividly transmitted to his ears, but it didn't reach his brain.

"Let's have some fun. Fun."

The moment Habitz raised his sword, Kido bit into the flesh of his right hand.

Clang! The blade struck the ground.

"Huff! Huff!"

Kido, who had hastily thrown his body away, breathed heavily as he searched through his memories.

'What is... this?'

Habitz still couldn't be perceived.

But in the memory contained within the taste of the incident, there was definitely a scene different from reality.

"Oho?"

Habitz, who had struck the ground hard enough to create a crater, slowly raised his upper body.

"You really are an interesting guy."

The ability to obtain objective information by re-eating his own memories.

"Slurp! Slurp!"

Kido sucked in blood repeatedly.

'It's getting a bit clearer.'

And the moment he finally discovered a blurry silhouette, he immediately pushed off the ground and backed away.

'It's Habitz.'

Though not in perfect form, there was definitely a monster-like silhouette holding a sword.

'What should I do? Should I run? But I don't know where I am right now. If he's right next to me...'

He acted simultaneously with his thought.

'...then!'

Kido drew his spear from his back, wildly slashed around him, then rolled on the ground.

It might be a delusion.

But unlike humans, goblins with strong survival instincts chose life over shame.

'Didn't he approach? Or did I avoid him?'

Kido stuck out his tongue and savored the taste of the air.

'...No good. The probability of Habitz's cells floating around is low, and it's too faint to even be called a taste.'

He would have no choice but to run.

'Wait.'

Kido did a backward somersault and landed, then sucked blood from the wound on his right hand again.

'He's there. Still there. A blurry shadow watching me from within some terrible scene.'

If he could kill Habitz here.

'Uorin would also... If only I could bring back the head of the one who gave the Empress of Kashan the greatest humiliation of her life.'

"Phew!"

Kido gripped his spear with both hands.

'If I rely on the taste of memory to attack, it'll already be too late. Calculating sensually, roughly twelve steps. The time it takes for him to reach me is between 3 to 4 seconds.'

An imaginary second hand moved.

'2 seconds. 1 second.'

The strategy of devastating the area when the opponent was off guard was certainly excellent, but...

"I can hear everything, you know."

Habitz had the 'Frequency of God.'

Kido activated the Law of Earth 'Earthbound Spirit' and spun with his back, moving in all directions.

'Now!'

Gravity twisted locally, and Habitz's feet became sticky as if trapped in a swamp.

"Hehe, interesting technique."

For the first time in a while, a dry orgasm rose in his heart, which had only repeated boring murders.

'Get caught! Get caught, get caught!'

Kido endlessly swung his spear toward an unknown enemy that might or might not exist.

'As long as Earthbound Spirit is active, he can't escape far. I'll realize it the moment I kill him!'

In Habitz's eyes, he could see a top made of blade afterimages approaching at a terrifying speed.

Raising his long sword as if to stab, he calculated the timing and muttered quietly.

"Shi-ok."

A time not in the law, 0.666 seconds.

"Huh?"

Black shadows rising from the ground surrounded Habitz, but time didn't stop.

"What!"

The moment Kido shouted while spinning and watching, a powerful impact struck his side.

"Ugh!"

Kido, who blocked with his spear raised, slid across the ground and examined the impact point to see a black robe standing there.

"...That was good judgment."

Wanderer's 6 o'clock.

He obtains the results assuming all necessary actions to achieve something have been taken.

"What are you guys?"

Without answering Kido's question, Wanderer's 6 o'clock returned to Shi-ok's position.

Habitz looked around at those standing in their respective times and made a full circle.

"What?"

The 4 o'clock position was empty.

"Where did one go?"

Shi-ok was human, and without needing to hear an answer, the Frequency of God conveyed it.

"Hmm, Sirone."

When the Vanishing phenomenon disappeared, Kido could finally see the corpses scattered everywhere.

It was a gruesome and bizarre scene, but Kido had a more pressing task to solve first.

'I'll protect Uorin.'

Though the wound in his heart hadn't disappeared, he still couldn't give up on her.

"Habitz! Listen carefully. One step from here..."

"Good, guide me."

"...Huh?"

Habitz tapped his head.

"You're saying you'll come to meet me? Through the voice of your heart. Yes, she was definitely decent for a courtesan."

Kido, who had lowered his spear with a blank expression, suddenly bared his teeth savagely.

"This woman really...!"
