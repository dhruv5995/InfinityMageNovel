God's Shadow (1)

Amy, having arrived at the mountain, discovered a special place where traces of battle remained.

'She's not here.'

Maya was nowhere to be seen, and from a distance spanning an entire mountain, a thunderous explosion erupted.

"Quite fast."

A glint of tension flashed through Amy's eyes as she was about to cast spatial movement.

As she twisted her body, a hooded man had approached right up to her and was throwing a punch.

"Urgh!"

The moment she defended with both arms, her solar plexus felt like it was on fire, then something pierced through and emerged from her back.

"Huff!"

"Gyeolgi really is something..."

The figure who had penetrated through Amy flipped his hood back and muttered.

"He may be obsessed with Yahweh, but he shouldn't send comrades."

Meanwhile, Amy tore at her collar left and right, examining where the pain was lodged.

'What is this?'

There was a charred black mark between her breasts, which gradually faded as time passed.

Amy turned around.

"What are you?"

With red skin, pointed ears, and antennae on his forehead, his form resembled a fire ant.

"Gultan. I'm an assassin specialized in anti-Yahweh combat. Actually, I don't want to fight anyone other than Yahweh, but..."

The Catacomb's selection criteria were those who could achieve efficiency of 6.8 times their basic abilities or more when fighting Yahweh.

"Still, you are a corps commander."

As Gultan approached by making a wide detour around the perimeter, Amy tracked him with her gaze. Seeing him pass through the thick trees, she realized why her previous defense had failed.

'He can pass through matter.'

Amy hastily leaned her upper body back as Gultan's fist swiftly passed before her eyes.

"Oho?"

A glint of interest appeared in Gultan's eyes.

"Your physical abilities are excellent too."

Through her war with the demons, Amy's schema had reached a high level.

"Flame Avatar."

A giant of fire rising from her body roared flames toward Gultan.

A radius of dozens of meters was consumed by fire, but laughter could be heard from behind Amy.

"Hehe!"

Simultaneously, a hot energy struck her back.

"Huff!"

Since she was hit from behind, all she could see was black smoke emerging through her chest.

'There was no time to dodge. How did this happen?'

Matter penetration ability.

"The ground, huh."

"Yes. Physical barriers don't matter much. By the way, this makes it twice."

An ominous feeling arose.

"What do you mean?"

"I've touched your heart twice now. Ah, don't worry. You won't die."

Gultan's ability was heart crafting.

He changes his body to quantum form to penetrate targets and sculpts their hearts.

"My heart... what's wrong with it?"

"Crafting is delicate work. To make the desired form, you have to touch it again and again."

Amy just listened.

"But if you're a skilled craftsman, you can roughly shape it with just a few touches. In other words, with two touches, the rough framework is set."

"Framework?"

Gultan spread both arms and laughed.

"I guarantee it. When this battle ends, you'll be madly in love with me."

And that was indeed the core tactic of the Catacomb to weaken Yahweh's abilities.

'Damn!'

The reason for her ominous feeling was that her hostility toward Gultan had decreased after allowing his second strike.

'These guys are no joke.'

They were ones who had meticulously analyzed Yahweh.

"I also know you have an ability called Red Eyes. Investigating the people around a target is basic for assassination. But it's useless. The heart I caress is in a place much deeper than the mind."

Amy desperately denied it.

'No, that can't be. Me loving that fire ant-looking demon?'

"That's quite a disgusting reaction. I don't particularly like you either. Human women are fun to torment, but they're not my type."

"...Is it possible to return to normal?"

"Hearts don't have a fixed form to begin with. It will change over time, but will you really be able to escape? The third touch will be quite detailed."

"No."

Amy's eyes blazed red.

"Go ahead and try. You'll never lay a hand on my body again."

"I'll have to fix that attitude first."

Gultan, who had seeped into the ground, appeared behind Amy and raised his fist.

'She absolutely can't dodge.'

The reason Amy had allowed the strike earlier wasn't because her reflexes were sluggish.

'Quantization.'

While Gultan was passing through matter, time and distance were ignored.

There were conditions and restrictions, but they weren't important issues given Amy's current state.

'I'll touch it, your heart.'

Just before his fist touched Amy's back.

"What?"

Her body scattered into flames as Gultan stumbled forward.

A voice came from behind.

"Spontaneous Combustion."

Gultan's expression became serious at the sight of Amy standing with flames wrapped around one hand.

'Fire teleportation? This is a first for me.'

Gultan attacked again for confirmation, but all he grasped were remnants of heat.

'I see.'

Where he turned his head, fire bloomed and Amy flickered like a mirage.

'Her movement speed isn't fast. Rather, the problem is her reaction speed.'

The wind Gultan pushed forward had extinguished Amy's fire like a candle.

'Then igniting a new spark to combust again. The movement speed would be similar to convection, but...'

During movement, she was nearly invincible.

"What are you doing? Not going to attack?"

As Amy wiggled her fingers, Gultan gritted his teeth.

'There must be a specific section that responds to air movement. In the end, either move very slowly...'

Or fast enough to penetrate the wind.

'Throwing a punch at supersonic speed is beyond me. At least it's comforting that she can't ignite before I make my move?'

That's what he thought.

"If you won't attack, I can attack, right?"

Until he remembered that Amy was a mage.

"Crimson Flame."

The flames that climbed up her body condensed into the form of a massive sphere high in the sky.

Gultan, who had gaped at its size that made distance perception disappear, hastily came to his senses.

"Wait! Negotiation, let's negotiate!"

Without time to hear an answer, a fireball reaching 6,000 degrees Celsius crashed into the peak.

The mountain instantly burst into flames.

"Aaaaah!"

It was powerful enough to burn even the person who cast the magic, but Amy was smiling.

"To extinguish the fire..."

The flames rotated down the mountain ridge like a river, becoming a massive whirlpool that pierced the sky.

"What's that?"

Sirone, who was in a taijitu formation with Gyeolgi, examined the pillar of fire shooting up from the mountain.

'Amy's Perfect Combustion.'

If she was using the pinnacle of fire magic to this degree, it meant her opponent was also a practitioner of comparable skill.

'Don't think. Just believe.'

Because that's what comrades do.

'More than that...'

Among the countless sounds heard from the taijitu domain, there was one that particularly bothered her mind.

Ultima rearranged the syllables, and the information Sirone analyzed in reverse was this:

'They are watching you. Trust nothing. Save yourself from the terrible truth.'

It wasn't the citizens' voices.

'It's not Gyeolgi either.'

Then who could have said such things?

Sirone's conclusion was 'no one in this city could possibly say such words.'

'Not a being of this world?'

Like cutting out newspaper letters to make sentences, if specific signals were extracted and combined.

'A message sent to me.'

The fact that it was transmitted when the law collapsed lent strength to the hypothesis.

'Alright, let's think. First, they are watching me. Who are they? Why won't they tell me their identity?'

Some kind of censorship?

'And trust nothing. If this means this world is fake, this is just like Ting's philosophy.'

She thought only she was human.

'No, I'm right. Whatever the world is, where you throw your heart is real. This absolutely cannot be denied...'

Suddenly, she got goose bumps.

'Save yourself from the terrible truth.'

What could the truth possibly be that the message sender used the expression "terrible"?

She didn't know.

The only thing she felt was that the current message was penetrating the deepest part of this world.

'Such insight.'

The space of taijitu was encroaching beyond the city onto the vast earth.

Caden, seriously wounded, collapsed in the grass and let out a scream.

"Aaaaah! Stop it!"

Even watching with his eyes as Mio relentlessly tormented Maya was hell.

"Hohoho! Why are you being so stubborn?"

"Caden."

Maya's eyes were unfocused, but she maintained her reason to the end, protecting her dignity.

"Run away. I'm... okay."

"Aaaaaaaah!"

Caden, made even more miserable by those words, buried his face in the ground and screamed.

'Move! Move, damn it!'

As long as he couldn't cut Maya from his heart, he would be unable to use any power.

'I don't care if I die! No, I'll give up on Maya! Give up! Give up! Just give up!'

He wouldn't mind never meeting her for the rest of his life.

"Give up, give up..."

But hearts don't move according to thoughts, so it was just struggling.

"Damn it! Why won't it work? Why..."

No one could be blamed.

"Hehehe! You're really funny, aren't you? What can someone as weak as you do..."

Then, as the mountain beyond caught fire entirely, Mio's laughter instantly disappeared.

'What's that?'

At the unexpected situation, Mio finally thought to execute the Catacomb's strategy.

"Alright, I'll finally free you from pain."

Mio opened Maya's mouth wide and began forcing her hand inside.

"Ugh! Urgh!"

Watching Maya suffer, she said:

"But I'll have to take your voice."

Because that would drive Yahweh mad.

"No, no!"

Caden, who had been out of his mind, came to his senses and shouted, but there was no way to stop it.

"I'll tear out your uvula and give it to Yahweh as a gift."

"Urgh! Urgh!"

At the sight of Maya crying tears, Caden pounded the ground with both fists.

"Move! Move, damn it!"

Now there was nowhere to retreat, but he couldn't even sense how to turn his heart around.

Caden's eyes became webbed with red blood vessels as he pushed against the ground with all his might.

'Give up! Give up, damn it!'

Can't give up, like this Maya will, rather die, have to save Maya, impossible, what I can do, damn fate, I love her, Maya, Maya, Maya will die...

Mio, who had shoved her fist into Maya's mouth, looked at Caden and smiled brightly.

"Now, the grand opening!"

"Huuuuuu!"

In maddening fear, his vision blurred and Mio's voice became distantly ethereal.

"Hoho! This beautiful voice will be mine..."

Crack.

A tearing sound echoed in Caden's mind.

"Huh?"

The next moment, Mio examined her condition with an incomprehensible expression.

"Why?"

Her arm had been cleanly severed.

"Hah. Hah."

Breathing roughly, Caden recalled the situation from moments before.

'How did this happen?'

As he turned his tense face to the side, he saw the sword that had cut Mio's arm.

'I... cut it?'

It was definitely his arm and the sensation was alive, but it was completely free from his brain's control.
