The Last Holy War (5)

Glen frowned.

"What are you doing?"

"Ms. Rukia should be fine for now."

"That's not what I'm asking! Do you know why she was enduring it? Do you think she was doing this because of pain?"

"It's better than Angel."

"You're wrong! She'd rather take drugs than receive help from a heretic. In the Lamie Church, we absolutely must never..."

"G-Glen."

At Rukia's changed voice, Glen's shoulders flinched as he turned his head.

"Now... I'm okay."

Before her eyes that had regained their peace, Glen couldn't say anything.

"Why?"

He clenched his fists.

"I know too. Yahweh's criterion for treating emotional sickness is those who fight for the world."

Without even such criteria, all the people in the world would drag Yahweh down.

"But we're priests of the Lamie Church. Helping you is like denying our faith."

"You don't need to deny it. I merely suppressed Ms. Rukia's emotional sickness."

"You destroyed your own standards! If you save Rukia, you'll have to save other people too! But you can't do that. The whole world will condemn you!"

"Then I'll accept the condemnation."

Glen's expression went blank.

"What's important is creating better results, not following my rules. I'm not doing this to be loved or acknowledged by someone. I just..."

There was only one thing he wanted.

"I want everyone to be happy."

A brief silence fell.

The apostle watched Sirone with a reverent expression, and Glen hung his head.

"Damn it..."

A hand came to rest on his shoulder.

When he turned his head, Rukia, supported by Ares, was smiling.

That expression said it all.

"I'm sorry."

Glen looked back at Sirone and said,

"I seem to have lost my reason to impatience. Give me a chance to explain. Rukia and I are..."

"I know. Your story was in the Vatican's official newspaper. I heard you were excommunicated."

Rukia said,

"Glen and I are lovers. But to become high priests, we must observe the doctrine of celibacy. High Priest Maximus counseled me. He told me to break up with Glen. I was angry, and then I accidentally..."

She raised her left hand.

"A new ability manifested."

"Ability?"

Glen explained.

"Rukia has such powerful abilities that no one in the Vatican can match her. That's why the High Priest dislikes me. Rukia's future seemed to be ruined because of me."

"Glen."

"I'm not resentful. I would have done the same. Anyway, Rukia has tremendous abilities. They call it God's Right Hand."

Rukia approached Sirone.

"I'll show you."

Friji and Argan tried to approach, but Sirone stopped them.

"It's okay. I want to know too."

"My right hand is..."

When Rukia gently grasped Sirone's wrist, all the strength drained from his body.

"Huh?"

Rukia supported Sirone's back and laid him on the ground.

"It relaxes all living beings to their limits."

It wasn't restraint.

'It feels like pleasant exhaustion. I can't even move my fingers, but there's no anxiety.'

"No one has ever escaped this state. Among them were Yakshas and Banyas too."

It was certainly powerful.

"But you should be able to break free."

After thinking for a moment, when Sirone raised his hand, Glen's eyes widened.

"H-how?"

Rukia helped Sirone up and said,

"Scholars call it Unregulated Expression, but in the Lamie Church, we call such phenomena miracles."

Both were in the realm of faith.

"I can touch a person's heart. It feels like water. That's where it's determined. Unlike the mind, the heart has no barriers, so to overcome God's Right Hand, the heart itself must be strong."

Rukia felt bitter.

"The moment I grasped your wrist, I was honestly dizzy. It didn't feel like touching water, but like being submerged in an ocean."

She felt Yahweh's heart.

"I've reformed countless evildoers with this ability. But perhaps because evil thoughts had taken root, while being scolded by High Priest Maximus, I awakened a new ability."

Rukia raised her other hand.

"The Devil's Left Hand."

The reason a Lamie Church priest deliberately used the name 'devil' was because it was the truth.

"Living beings that touch my left hand twist and crumple their own bodies. Though I quickly let go, High Priest Maximus's elbow was broken."

"...That's incredible."

At his honest answer, Rukia nodded.

"Yes. The ability's intensity matches God's Right Hand. I won't deny the name devil. I'm ashamed of myself and feel nauseous, but..."

"Because it's that kind of ability."

"Yes. Like Unregulated Expression, miracles are also workings of the heart. Though I was excommunicated as the price, I'm convinced. If I can subdue this left hand's devil, it will prove my faith."

That was their story.

"Yahweh, no, Mr. Sirone. Though we believe in different things, I saw that your heart is no different from mine. So please..."

She bowed her head modestly.

"Please take me to the Pyramid of Truth."

Ares's beard curved up along his lips, and Glen averted his gaze while muttering,

"...They'll be helpful enough."

After exchanging glances with Canis, Arin, and Zulu, Sirone nodded and said,

"Alright."

The Jive Kingdom.

With two days left before the holy war, rulers from around the world were arriving one after another.

"Tomorrow is the eve festival."

The one seated on the throne was a giant in his mid-thirties with a stylishly groomed beard.

The Iron King, Gis.

He was the man who had purged King Meyer and become Jive's king through election.

"It's also the day I become king of the world."

Jive's annual GDP was 3,224 trillion gold, of which defense spending was 44 trillion gold.

The number of certified first-class magicians was nine, and it was also the country that produced Buddha Nane of this era.

"Hey! King!"

The door burst open and an archangel taller than humans entered.

It was Satiel, the Archangel of Decomposition.

"How long do you expect me to wait? I want to decompose Ikael quickly."

Ripples appeared in Gis's eyes.

"You'll be able to go outside tomorrow. Think of it as enduring for revenge."

"Hmph, I shouldn't have negotiated with humans in the first place. The angels I command are sufficient."

"Even if you destroy the target, you can't destroy what's contained within. Trust me. Ikael will probably shed tears of blood."

If there was one thing Ikael couldn't bear, it was Sirone falling into the abyss.

It was something only humans could do, and the reason Satiel had joined hands with Jive.

'Things are going well.'

The holy war being held in Jive was also readily approved by the existing Three Empires.

'They must have their own intelligence. But would anything change even if they knew? Angels don't break contracts.'

They were already Jive's military force.

"Your Majesty, the participating nations are arriving. Currently, Tormia, Kashan, and Corona have crossed the border."

"Hmm."

The feeling of being the center of the world wasn't bad, and Gis sprang to his feet.

"Good. Shall I go greet them?"

"Entry! The Kingdom of Tormia!"

Tormia's delegation on horseback entered through Jive's massive outer gate.

Sirone was beside King Pony, and beyond them, the royal guard 'Descent of God' formed a defensive perimeter.

Guard Captain Ozent Rai gave instructions.

"Watch for snipers. Respond immediately if you see anything suspicious. I'll take responsibility for the consequences."

"Yes."

While his subordinates fiercely surveyed the surroundings, an old man's voice was heard from the side.

"The new captain is quite spirited."

Mercodain Albino, the head of Tormia's think tank Thunder Dragon, was smiling with his eyes.

"Don't waste your energy from the start. All the holy war participants are at war. You don't push the person in front while walking a tightrope."

Rai remained unshaken.

"Tormia is a relatively small nation. Nothing would be strange if something happened. Don't worry. I'll never let my guard down."

"How reliable."

The Kingdom of Tormia's annual GDP was 1,700 trillion, with defense spending of 24 trillion gold.

There were three certified first-class magicians.

But they had Yahweh, the Compassion of the Era, Miro, the Ultimate Good of the Era, and monopolized elemental bomb technology.

'A leading nation.'

Looking beyond the royal guard, Albino's smiling face twisted grotesquely.

'Kekeke, isn't this a gamble worth trying?'

Meanwhile, Sirone watched the procession of the Corona Kingdom pass through the open front.

Ivory Tower residents were positioned in large numbers, and he could see the faces of Stars among them.

'I don't see Ms. Minerva. Is she too busy blocking Baal? Or is she...'

Perhaps keeping Sythe in check.

"Sirone."

Lufist approached with Flu and Dante.

"Where's Gaold?"

If Miro and Gaold joined Tormia, that alone would change the entire situation.

"We can't reach him. Let's wait a bit more. If he were dead, I wouldn't be here either."

"...I see."

Sirone turned around.

Behind the officials' procession was the army, and beyond that, artists followed.

He could see Reyna, the court musician, leading as a representative, and Cayden next to Maya.

'Where did Mr. Quan go? Is he with the teacher procession?'

Shiina was among the teachers attending the Human Future Forum.

'Given his personality, he wouldn't have gone to meet her. Though for all I know, he might be right next to me.'

The Asymmetric Stealth was that excellent.

Contrary to Sirone's thoughts, Quan had left Tormia's procession and was high in the sky.

What his eyes captured was Kashan Empire's procession, the Wind General protecting Uorin.

'I'm going to clip your wings.'

Guard Captain Kido's eyebrows twitched.

"It's been annoying me. Someone seems to be watching from above. Should I drag them down?"

While the Wind General remained silent, Uorin said,

"Leave it. You can't catch them anyway."

"You're openly ignoring me now. If this is how it's going to be, why did you make me guard captain?"

"Hohoho! Because I'm bored. I think there'll be a lot of stressful things at this holy war."

Just as Kido's eyes bulged, Gando said,

"Your Majesty, over there."

In the huge plaza leading to the inner castle, Tormia, Corona, and Kashan collided.

'Who would enter first.'

King Woodlai of Corona said,

"Haha, how embarrassing. How about we set aside petty pride battles and enter in order of arrival?"

Corona was about five seconds earlier.

Uorin smiled ambiguously and turned her head.

"Still, since it's a holy war, shouldn't there be courtesy for veterans? Kashan will go first."

"Veteran courtesy."

Woodlai's lips curved up.

"Of course, this is Corona's first holy war. But it's not because our national power is weak, which I'm sure the Empress of Kashan knows better than anyone?"

"Is that so? I'm not sure. Has there ever been a country with stronger national power than Kashan?"

"Kekeke! Excellent! If the princess of a fallen empire has hurt pride, I'll humor you just this once."

At that moment, smoke rose from behind Uorin, and everyone's hearts sank.

"Wh-what?"

How had they not noticed?

A man sitting behind Uorin was taking a long drag from the drug Asker.

"Hoooo."

Sirone's eyes intensified.

"Satan."

It was Gustav Habitz.
