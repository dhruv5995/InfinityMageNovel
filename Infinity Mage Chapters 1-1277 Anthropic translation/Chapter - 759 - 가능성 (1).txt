[759] Possibility (1)

Minerva and JC, who had infiltrated the 48th Military Facility, mercilessly cut down the stationed troops as they carved their path forward.

Though JC had initially offered to serve as a guide, there was no need for one since no one could even approach Minerva.

"Save me, please save me...!"

The soldiers collapsed on the spot from the mere aura of death that Minerva emanated, dying in agony with pained groans.

'One of the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower.'

Though JC himself was an unofficial 3rd-class Grand Mage who took pride in his own level of mastery, this was on a completely different dimension.

'I haven't even seen her use magic yet.'

Minerva, who had crushed an entire army with her aura alone, moved toward the laboratory in the central building.

"Wait!"

JC shouted urgently.

"This is where the Garas prototypes are kept! The moment you open it, all hell will break loose."

"Garas has no prototype. More precisely, no one knows the prototype. They destroy biological systems."

"That's exactly what makes them more dangerous. They're on a completely different level from the mutant poison hounds that were elevated to species level. They'll grab onto anything they see and breed with it."

"Doesn't matter. Open it."

JC couldn't disobey her words and eventually unlocked the iron door.

Another iron door appeared, and when that too was opened, the prison containing the Garas was revealed.

"Grrrrr! Grrrrr!"

As Minerva stepped forward, the hideous voices of the Garas echoed from all directions.

'This is the first time I've seen them this excited.'

As JC trembled and followed behind, Minerva stopped in the center of the warehouse.

"They've caught the scent of a witch. For them, it's a more powerful aphrodisiac than any drug."

"Should I open them one by one to eliminate them?"

"No."

Minerva narrowed her eyes and swung Jet, transforming her body into that of a young girl.

"Come to me, my lovely children."

The moment she finished speaking, dozens of iron doors burst open with loud crashes.

"Kyaaaah!"

The color drained from JC's face as he watched, having observed through experiments what kind of species the Garas were.

'She's still holding her ground.'

Unlike the mutant poison hounds, the Garas's desires transcended even Minerva's killing intent.

But Minerva simply stared ahead with half-closed eyes, unmoved.

'The fate of becoming a witch.'

By the time she realized she couldn't escape, her body and mind were already in ruins.

"If this is my destiny, I have no choice but to accept it willingly."

Dozens of Garas swarmed over her.

"Minerva!"

JC, judging it was already too late, turned to flee when something amazing happened.

"Kraaak! Kraaaaa!"

The tangled mass of Garas began bubbling like oil, and their numbers gradually started decreasing.

"The witch's breath."

Before anyone knew it, she emerged from between the Garas with a pipe in her mouth, exhaling smoke with a "whooo."

"How did you do that?"

"I let them enjoy themselves to their heart's content. With each other."

As far as JC knew, the Garas's reproductive urge was at the pinnacle among living beings, but they absolutely never mated with their own species.

"Their sexual desire is 100,000 times that of humans? Then right now it would be about 100 million times. At that level, they can't see straight."

"100 million times..."

The mass that had clumped together looked like a black oil blob, with countless mutations repeating cycles of birth and death.

Minerva watched indifferently and said:

"Biological systems consist of reproduction and feeding. Garas have the property of maximizing reproductive system compatibility to expand throughout entire ecosystems. But what happens when the same species mate with each other?"

As JC looked back, Minerva raised her finger.

"Evolution becomes impossible. After repeating countless mutations among themselves, what they choose is stability. And that means..."

"Returning to the prototype."

Minerva watched without answering, and what finally appeared before their eyes was a black sphere about one meter in diameter.

The sphere, trapped in a membrane like a tadpole egg, vibrated and split down the middle, dividing into two.

"Celia..."

As the division progressed, the size of the black spheres decreased while their numbers increased exponentially.

When the number of cells in the cycle surpassed 40 trillion, a human form finally emerged.

"I've wanted to meet you at least once. Argoneth."

The father of all life forms existing in the universe.

The Great Star, who was also considered the mother figure, had long called Argoneth the biological program.

As Argoneth's mouth opened, the mucus blocking his throat cleared and a voice was heard.

"You wanted to meet me."

Like someone who didn't know language speaking only through sounds, there was absolutely no variation in vocal tone.

Minerva didn't care.

"Angke Ra has disappeared. That's impossible without your involvement. What are you scheming?"

If he truly was a biological program, Argoneth must have been the one who provided Angke Ra's body.

"I scheme nothing. I spread life forms widely. I fill space with more individuals, even to places without suns."

"What a diligent civil servant. Even though this world might completely close soon."

"It doesn't matter, my daughter."

Minerva's eyebrows twitched.

"You are both the lowest probability and the core probability among everything created through me. Kill as you wish, give birth as you wish. That's the meaning of your probability."

"I wasn't created for the needs of something like you."

"It doesn't matter what you think. I didn't create you either. You simply received the choice of probability."

"You bastard."

Killing intent filled Minerva's eyes.

"Do you think that becomes a reason for the suffering I endured?"

"Mutations are eliminated."

Argoneth's body became thin like porridge and seeped into the floor with a slurp.

"It's dangerous!"

Argoneth, transformed into mucus, burst from the walls on all sides to attack Minerva and JC.

"Mucus."

Where the wave of mucus crashed, there were no longer any people, and Minerva, who had thrown herself into a corner, planted Jet into the ground.

"Breath of Destruction."

With Minerva at the center, black smoke rose at a terrifying speed as if time had been accelerated.

JC, who was standing behind her, sensed the power and cast defensive magic just as an explosion-like burst of smoke spread forward.

Kurrrrrrrrring!

The sound of buildings collapsing came from within the black smoke, growing uncontrollably larger.

'Just how far does it reach...'

When the magical smoke cleared and vision was finally restored, JC trembled violently.

The first magic he witnessed from Miracle Minerva had reduced all visible scenery to ash.

'This isn't magic. It's a catastrophe.'

Nothing remained standing within 200 meters in a fan-shaped area ahead, only piles of black ash mountains.

"Tch, how annoying."

Minerva, returned to her adult form, spun Jet and looked back at JC.

"Let's go. There's still one more thing left to confirm."

Unable to voice any words, she could only nod repeatedly.

'If it's this person...'

She could deliver the ultimate revenge against the North Aimon Republic that killed her husband.

"Let go! Release me! I'm telling you to send me home!"

Baseto realized what situation he was in upon seeing the only structure visible before his eyes.

A shabby cabin.

Known to the workers as the Cabin of Eternity, it was a place where once you entered, you could never come out.

"I did everything you told me to! Why on earth... Ugh!"

A soldier struck Baseto hard on the back of the head with the handle of his military sword.

"When told to submit, you submit. Don't make so much noise. Stop struggling uselessly and get inside."

Being too competent was also a problem.

This was the conclusion the soldiers reached after assessing Baseto's capabilities, having observed his cool judgment in crisis situations.

"From today, you're permanent."

"You bastards! What did I do wrong!"

Another dull impact was delivered, and the soldiers grabbed Baseto by the scruff of his neck and threw him into the cabin.

"Consider yourself lucky. You get a private house that other workers can't even dream of, plus regular meals."

It meant to live like a dog begging for food in solitary confinement where there were no means of suicide.

'Damn bastards...!'

If he were with the other workers, he could at least ask them to tie up his limbs and strangle him.

"Send me home. Please send me home..."

Baseto, who had been crouching in a corner of the cabin sobbing, looked up sensing a presence.

"What...!"

As if there were stairs installed underground, Shirone was rising up through the cabin floor.

"Phew, finally found you."

Zion's Law, which had to cover the entire world, had holes scattered throughout to maximize efficiency.

"Eek! A gh-ghost!"

Baseto pressed his back against the wall with nowhere left to retreat, kicking his legs frantically.

Having experienced so many terrible things, it seemed the grim reaper had finally come for him.

"Shh."

Shirone put his hand to his lips to calm Baseto, checked the situation outside, then asked:

"Are you Verdi's father?"

Baseto's eyes, which had been filled with terror, immediately changed, and he lunged forward.

"How do you know Verdi? My family, where is my family? Answer me! What on earth did you do to my daughter...!"

He seemed to think they had taken his family hostage.

"Everyone is safe. I came after hearing from Albas. Come with me and escape from this place."

"Al-Albas? Was he alive?"

Relief filled Baseto's eyes.

"I'll take you to your family. Hide in a safe place until I finish dealing with this place."

"Finish dealing with it? With what exactly? This is a totalitarian state ruled by President Igor."

The Five Stars of the Ivory Tower were supranational beings.

"I have a way. Let's get out first. If soldiers happen to burst in..."

Shirone stopped speaking and perked up his ears.

"What is it?"

An explosive sound erupted outside the cabin, followed by people's screams echoing from all directions.

"Wait... no, follow me!"

Judging by the scale of the explosion, it seemed more dangerous to hide inside the building.

When they opened the door and went outside, demons that had completely invaded the space were massacring soldiers and workers.

"Honey! Verdi!"

As Baseto stamped his feet, Shirone embraced him and cast teleportation.

"It's dangerous!"

A fireball exploded.

Where Shirone turned his head, he saw a woman in North Aimon military uniform casting magic.

'Why is she attacking her own side?'

It was JC, the Northern spy.

"Hmph! Not bad...!"

Having caught sight of Shirone evading the fireball, she cast fly magic and charged forward.

A spy couldn't have any sincere comrades, and everyone here was her enemy.

'I'll kill them all! You disgusting bastards!'

After six years of infiltration life sacrificing her youth, what returned to her was the death of her husband, her only family.

"You feel the same thing too!"

With Minerva backing her, she had nothing to fear as she cast invisibility magic right next to Shirone.

For any being relying on sight, this would be a situation where death was all but certain, but...

'This way!'

Shirone's senses were three levels higher than humans, and his Photon Cannon accurately locked onto the target.

'How did he find me...?'

JC felt dizzy.

'Press!'

The moment a 3rd-class Grand Mage's experience compressed air to form a high-strength barrier.

Bang!

The impact of the Photon Cannon vibrated the Press, harder than steel reinforcement, and struck JC's abdomen.

"Urgh!"

As her invisibility magic was dispelled, she realized while not even knowing where the shockwave was pushing her:

'He's not just any mage.'

It was an impact she had never experienced in her entire life.
