Satan's Proposal (2)

Jincheon Empire Sector.

Having been struck by the Moon Kingdom's curse, Jingang sat cross-legged, battling the vengeful spirit within his mind.

Though his body had already weakened beyond recovery, the emperor's stubborn will remained firm.

'Woonryong.'

Jingang's brow furrowed.

'How dare you try to kill me?'

The retainers who had been prostrating themselves flat before Jingang raised their heads at the chilling aura.

"Oh, ooh!"

Anchal's eyes lit up.

'Azure Dragon's energy.'

A bluish aura began rippling from Jingang's body, followed by a woman's screams.

"Your Majesty! The spirit fears you! Please summon just a little more strength!"

The ghost's phantom became visible within the blue energy, and finally Jingang's eyes snapped open.

Kyaaaaaah!

The spirit's phantom shot away like an arrow, causing several retainers to tumble backward.

"Hii-eek!"

The ghost, driven mad with resentment, ignored them all and burst outside.

"Cough!"

As Jingang spat blood, Anchal supported him.

"Your Majesty, are you alright?"

"Yes."

Successfully performing the reverse curse didn't mean his already ruined body would recover.

"Your Majesty."

"Don't worry. I won't die just yet. I can't miss such a fine spectacle because of a mere whelp like Moonryong."

Strength returned to Jingang's eyes.

"My daughter's enemy. I will watch with my own eyes as his kingdom is reduced to ashes."

Moon Kingdom Sector.

"Ahhh!"

Woonryong collapsed with a shrill scream unbefitting of royal dignity.

"Your Majesty!"

His limbs convulsing, his face turned blue and dark red veins became visible.

"Wh-what is this?"

"A reverse curse!"

"Impossible! His Majesty's quarters are a perfect mystical defense zone! How could this possibly... Gack!"

The mystic collapsed, coughing up blood.

'Damn it!'

The head of the Cheongan Order realized the truth.

'It was a curse that couldn't be blocked from the start. That's why they formed an alliance with Kashan. If a reverse curse occurred, it's only natural we couldn't stop it.'

But it was contradictory.

'It's an unstoppable curse. We even amplified extreme resentment using Satan's power. So how is the reverse curse activating? Was there an even stronger grudge than this—'

The head's expression grew calm.

"Jingang."

Was he that formidable?

The Cheongan Order's mystics shouted.

"We must find a solution! At this rate, the curse will spread and kill us all!"

'How immature. After studying the world's principles so extensively, do they lose their reason when faced with death?'

It was already too late.

"Your Majesty."

The head of the Cheongan Order bowed to Moonryong.

"Rest in peace."

With those final words, as he slowly closed his eyes, blood began flowing backward from his stomach.

"Gack!"

The curse, further amplified.

The head of the Cheongan Order collapsed, and the curse struck everyone remaining in the room.

'How frustrating.'

Even facing death, the head tried to understand the situation.

'Why did it come to this?'

The detestable face of a woman came to mind.

'Uorin.'

Everything according to her plan.

'I shouldn't have trusted Theraze.'

Mass death.

Like a crime scene with no evidence to be found, only corpses remained in Woonryong's quarters.

Kashan Sector.

While Habitz had left the room, Uorin was staying up all night with Kido.

Kido asked.

"Earth-bound spirits... don't you need to set them up? Habitz might still be around."

Uorin, holding strong liquor and swirling ice, smiled.

"It's fine. He won't come for a while. He seems to have found something much more interesting than me."

Part of her felt bitter.

'Will it really just be for a while?'

She worried that Habitz's new amusement might completely overturn everything.

"Sigh. Only a few hours left until morning."

Uorin, looking at her reflection in the window, raised her glass as if toasting.

"It should be finished by now."

The Moon Kingdom's sector would be in ruins.

"You planned to frame the Moon Kingdom from the beginning, didn't you?"

Feeling Kido's drowsy gaze, Uorin turned her head with a broad grin.

"Frame them? The Moon Kingdom really is the culprit. This is called justice prevailing over evil."

At the Code Zero meeting, Woonryong had given them 10 minutes to devise a strategy.

"Actually, there wasn't much to think about. The Moon Kingdom was going to be the culprit anyway. Since they actually did it, there's no room for manipulation. Is there any simpler method than this?"

Kido twisted his lips.

"Jingang was absolutely necessary for the reverse curse, and I wanted to see Paras's reaction. It'll all be revealed come morning. The rest, well, I added those because I needed them."

"Sirone won't like it."

King Phonido of Tormia had also been struck by the curse.

"It's fine."

Uorin said.

"Living beings feel tremendous sexual desire when their lives are in danger. It's the instinct for species reproduction. When death rises to their throat, they'll find energy they never had."

"So you're driving Sirone to death? Do you really think that's love?"

"Habitz told me that if I don't define things, I'll achieve what I want. It's actually true. All failures in this world stem from defining things."

Kido thought.

If she doesn't define herself, couldn't she even make love with a goblin?

Uorin looked out the window.

"That won't happen."

"Tch! Who said anything?"

"A goblin's thoughts are obvious. To be honest, I'm closer to despising you? A goblin wearing glasses and reading books. Just thinking about it makes me... ugh."

"You're really cruel."

"Hehe, but keep trying hard. Starting tomorrow, my life will be in danger too. Who knows? When death approaches my throat, maybe I'll find energy I never had."

All the kings of the holy war would have to watch their necks.

"Why make it so complicated? Just ask for help. I'm the captain of the guard."

"I don't want to."

Kido wasn't bothered by anything Uorin said, but times like this made his heart ache.

'She won't ask for anything.'

As if a being like him could leave her side anytime and it wouldn't matter.

Uorin looked coldly at Kido's dejected reflection in the window.

By human aesthetic standards, it was a face that could never be called beautiful, but...

'Intelligence.'

Feeding on human memories, Kido had acquired intelligence superior to any scholar.

It wasn't an illusion that his translucent silhouette seemed to overlap with Uorin's face.

'Why do I despise him?'

Perhaps because Kido's appearance reminded her of her past living in the age of barbarism.

'The age of barbarism when feeding and reproduction were everything.'

Then again.

'What's different now?'

The next morning.

Even before dawn broke, morning newspapers spread throughout the capital of the Jive Kingdom.

"These damn animals!"

According to testimony from Langee, representing Arachne, there had been a secret entertainment event.

The problem was that it was a horrific SM party where one of the female entertainers had died.

Langee stated:

"Most high-ranking officials in the holy war probably believe in Satanism. But watching what they do, they're so cruel that even Satan would shake his head."

The testimony was specific, and the authority of being a world beauty pageant winner couldn't be ignored.

And she...

"My partner that night was Gis, the king of Jive, which is hosting the holy war."

She delivered the decisive blow.

Jive Sector.

"What kind of damn nonsense is this! What is Arachne doing not handling someone like this!"

Advisor Myron, hit in the face by the newspaper Gis threw, hurriedly responded.

"They seem to have made their move. Sirone's public stance. This was unexpected."

The content stated that Sirone, one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower, was directly addressing this issue.

It was silent pressure sent to the kings of each nation.

"Ugh! My blood pressure's rising from the morning!"

Gis wasn't stupid either, so he acknowledged that it couldn't be helped.

Myron adopted an appropriate attitude.

"I apologize. But this will be the last time. I'll handle it before sunset."

"Too late. The press conference is at 3 PM. Finish it before then."

"Understood."

"Make sure of it. I have a lunch appointment, so I'll go right after that's finished."

"By any chance, is it with Ms. Flu?"

"So what?"

"Will it be alright? With today's article and all, in this situation you should be careful with your movements—"

"You're talking nonsense. I have lunch appointments with so many people—are you saying all of that is suspicious behavior too? Being cautious at times like this makes you look more suspicious."

"But..."

"It's a different league from someone like Langee. She's the secretary general of the Magic Association. If we get caught, do you think only I'll be ruined? Tormia would be finished too. Nothing will happen. Don't worry."

Tormia Sector.

Flu, who had slept for about two hours, used hot water to reduce the swelling and sat before her vanity.

The Jive morning newspaper was spread out.

'So this is what Sirone was aiming for. Gis is cornered. I need to stay alert too.'

While applying skincare, she looked at her reflection in the vanity mirror.

Born as a woman, she had trained for over ten years.

'I'm a professional before I'm a woman.'

She was the secretary general of Tormia's Magic Association, dedicating her life to the nation and its people.

'Don't overthink it. I'm the only one who can carry out this mission.'

She would definitely ensnare Gis.

As she finished her makeup, an agent from Dante's department delivered a note written in code.

Gis, press conference. 3 PM.

Crumpling the note and putting it in her mouth, she looked in the mirror with a cold smile.

'And yet he still wants to meet me?'

He thought meeting with Tormia Magic Association's secretary general was safe.

'A political judgment. But Gis, you're mistaken. Of course, you must have fought with everything you had to reach that position. Killing your pride like a worm, even abandoning your family.'

The only reason great people fall is because arrogance creeps into their minds.

'Sorry, but what we're about to do is war.'

Flu tied her hair back tightly.

'An endless war.'

Delta Headquarters.

Seriel, busy with morning paperwork, spotted Fermi walking down the corridor.

"Hey! Hey! Fermi!"

His steps seemed to halt for a moment, but Fermi moved again as if he hadn't heard.

"This bastard, really!"

Seriel glared and approached.

"You promised to send me the Angel manufacturing method and chemical formulas! Why haven't I heard anything?"

"Sorry. Next time."

Fermi answered briefly and continued his thoughts.

'There were assassination attempts in six countries overnight. They'll be hiding it with the highest level of security a nation can deploy. But once working-level staff start handling things, information inevitably leaks. About two hours, I'd say.'

Meaning by the time the holy war opens, all nations would understand the situation.

'According to the mined intelligence, the Moon Kingdom will face a reverse curse. How annoying. I should be the one killing them.'

Seriel spun Fermi around by the shoulder.

"Hey! Are you ignoring me? I keep asking! Right now, so many patients are...!"

Suddenly she was struck with fear.

"What's wrong with you?"

It wasn't that Fermi was particularly frowning or sending hostile looks.

'He had this expression back then too.'

Nothing particularly different, yet she felt like she might burst into tears at any moment.

And that expression was...

'That's why I...'

It was also Seriel's only weakness when dealing with Fermi.
