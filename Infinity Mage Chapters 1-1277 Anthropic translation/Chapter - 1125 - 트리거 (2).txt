Trigger (2)

Pride's 1 o'clock furrowed her brow.

"Grk!"

She had restored Harvits by changing past choices before the shockwave could tear him apart.

'This is dangerous.'

Since there's no cause for what emerges from nothingness, the time to make judgments was only an instant.

'If only Sloth's 4 o'clock were here...'

What could be done?

A comrade had pushed him to his death from behind.

Whoooo.

From the wizard's body that had successfully landed the first strike, the Formless God's heat haze rose again.

The branches twisted into even more grotesque shapes, and the long tongue writhed like an eel.

"Now! Attack...!"

The moment Shiok shouted, the Formless God's form melted back into the air.

"Denial Tube. Core World."

As the wizard's hand signs became more complex, secondary and tertiary shockwaves exploded around Shiok.

"Graaaah!"

Though Pride's 1 o'clock was holding on with hidden code, the speed of the consecutive attacks grew even faster.

"Attack! She can't hold out much longer!"

Prejudice's 5 o'clock shouted.

"You're a bug! A bug that can do nothing!"

They thought it was over.

Even if she denied it, Obstinacy's 3 o'clock would refute her claims.

Revenge's 10 o'clock cast a curse, and Delusion's 9 o'clock drove the wizard into illusions.

The wizard's response to all this was:

"Formless God."

Simply making the grotesque tree avatar permeate the world again.

"White Rotation."

Dozens of whirlpools formed behind her, from which branch-like hands emerged.

As those hands grasped the air and twisted like pretzels, Shiok's face contorted.

"Grk!"

All the hidden codes were destroyed.

'Reversing the laws.'

The system the wizard comprehensively perceived included the hidden world as well.

Hidden codes weren't human logic, but her logic wasn't human either.

'Then what is it?'

To Shiok's question, Harvits answered.

"Nobody knows."

A world only the wizard could feel, creativity born from that world as its foundation.

"...Well made."

He didn't know who had raised the wizard as a weapon of war, but the efficiency sent chills through him.

'Still young. Little experience. The physical impact isn't that strong either. But...'

Potential.

'That possibility whose limits can't be measured.'

Something that would probably bloom in the distant future, dragged into this moment.

"Do you want to kill me that badly?"

Harvits felt kinship with the wizard - a being that couldn't be stopped even when known.

"Hehehe."

Wasn't this perfect for life's finale?

"Let's play!"

Harvits' facial muscles were pushed back, revealing Satan's true face.

Faster than Shiok, with claws sharper than swords, he grazed the wizard's cheek.

"Super Void Rotation."

As the wizard brought both hands together at her core, a massive air mass struck vertically downward.

Kuuuuuung!

The impact was enough to shake the ground, but Satan only bent slightly at the waist.

"Hehe, yes. Your creativity is certainly unavoidable and unstoppable, but..."

As murky amber eyes stared forward, tremendous malicious energy surged forth.

"This weakness won't do."

As the wizard's facial muscles twitched for the first time, Wandering's 6 o'clock kicked off the ground.

'Now!'

Against a martial artist's kick assuming 200 years of training, the wizard cast magic.

'Air Shield.'

The air barrier burst with a pop, and the man's shin struck the child's ribs hard.

All her ribs broke.

Without even groaning, the wizard flew sideways and braked with one foot.

Her legs gave out from the pain of her organs spilling, and one knee touched the ground.

'Should I heal?'

If it wasn't fatal, attack would take priority.

'But it seems fatal.'

Judging by her body's reaction, it was shock severe enough to stop her heart in about 3 seconds.

'I don't know. Should I gamble?'

Though she'd made countless trial and error attempts with Sirone, the limits of experience still existed.

'Can't help it.'

The Formless God was absorbed into the world and her wounds began healing rapidly.

Harvits wouldn't miss this only opportunity where counterattack was impossible.

"Still young."

Death still lingered in Satan's mind, but assumptions were meaningless before chaos.

Harvits, transformed into a red body as if skinned, swung both arms simultaneously.

Just before the wizard's face was smashed.

'Huh?'

Harvits - no, Satan - was engulfed in a feeling he'd never experienced before.

'What?'

The wizard was already far away, and two clear lines marked the ground.

'I was pushed back.'

What exactly had hit him?

Looking down, Harvits confirmed that only his solar plexus had returned to human skin color.

The wizard, having flown into the sky, bent one leg and spread both arms.

"Infinite Creation."

Following her body's centerline, chakras at her brow, throat, chest, navel, genitals, and perineum sparkled.

Then tens of thousands of chakras opened and light burst from the wizard's body.

Harvits doesn't define things.

Therefore he neither lets his guard down nor falls into thought traps, but the one thing he overlooked was:

'Genius.'

The transcendent imagination of one human who could conceive even what doesn't exist in the universe.

As sprouts of light grew along the wizard's arms, all 11 Shioks charged forward.

"Kill her!"

The sprouts quickly became branches, extending in fractal structures to fill the sky.

'Keep imagining.'

Destruction, change, creation.

That mechanism of destruction-change-creation raced in infinite cycles as the Formless God's avatar bloomed.

That form was...

"...Huh?"

Since it didn't exist in the universe, the shock of merely seeing it felt heart-stopping.

"Super Form."

Harvits thought:

'Form is everything. All phenomena in the universe begin with the form of particles smaller than atoms, waves even smaller than that.'

'Then what phenomenon does that form create?'

As if answering Harvits' question, the wizard slowly brought her hands together in a seal.

"Infinite Realm."

The 11 Shioks saw red petals blooming as fast as light before their eyes.

"Super Void Wave."

The fruit of imagination sublimated into flowers began blooming from all the Shioks' heads.

'Can't block it.'

It was something only the wizard had imagined - not physics that existed in the universe.

Void's 12 o'clock gritted his teeth.

"Damn it..."

Everything was reset.

Pop!

The moment his head exploded, the remaining Shioks opened their eyes wide on the ground.

'She targeted 12 o'clock from the start.'

Even with the surreal situation of 10 Shioks still alive, the wizard remained calm.

Because to her, it wasn't surreal.

"May I finish this now?"

As the wizard landed and formed a seal, the Formless God wavered and disappeared.

"Flame Flower."

Death.

"Kraaaah!"

Sensing annihilation, Satan enlarged his body massively, and red flowers bloomed all over him.

The maddened Shioks charged.

"Satan! Watch over us!"

The wizard drew a circle with her finger, aimed at Satan, then pierced the circle with her opposite thumb.

"Dogwood Lotus."

Thousands of flowers bloomed in full, and Satan's body shrank from an unidentifiable impact.

"Kraaaah! Kraaaah!"

Shock, restraint, suppression, transformation - all kinds of physical forces returned Satan to Harvits.

"No!"

As Shiok panicked, the wizard charged at Harvits, who was staggering half-naked.

'I'll kill him here.'

Until Satan's destruction, probably 1 second, 1.5 seconds?

'I did it.'

An extremely short time.

'I'm killing Satan.'

But also enough time for one human to dream before success.

'If I kill Satan...'

She had no material desires.

Even if offered the whole world, she could remain indifferent - at such a level, the only sweet thing was:

'Sirone oppa.'

What she, whose mind had been forcibly elevated to adult realms, wanted was a trivial desire.

'Will he say I did well, will I be praised?'

But still, desire.

'Huh?'

The moment Harvits vanished from her perception, her eyes shook with shock.

'What am I doing here?'

Realizing through the voice of his heart that Vanishing had activated, Harvits emanated killing intent.

"Graaaah!"

Even while kicking off the ground to charge, the wizard couldn't escape her confusion.

'Why? Why?'

She didn't know.

But her genius-level resilience grasped the state of ignorance and returned it to its original place.

'Harvits!'

The moment the wizard recognized him, Harvits' fist struck her abdomen.

"Guh!"

As an adult's fist drove into a child's body that could make no response, her breath was completely cut off.

"Gak! Gak!"

Shiok rushed forward like demons.

But Harvits was first, and his longsword rested on the wizard's nape.

"Satan! You must kill her!"

Though the wizard still couldn't move, even not immediately cutting her neck felt anxious.

'Please kill her. There won't be a second chance.'

Harvits thought differently.

"Whew."

Having narrowly escaped death, he exhaled deeply toward the sky, then spoke to the wizard.

"You okay? I hit pretty hard."

"...Kill me."

She had lost herself.

Fighting again, or waiting for the opponent's carelessness to strike unexpectedly.

The moment such thoughts arose, Harvits would disappear.

"The match is over. So kill me."

"Hmm."

Harvits removed the sword from the wizard's neck and sat down heavily as if his legs had given out.

"That was close. Impressive. Deriving one thing from pure chaos - even I can't do that."

Because it's contradictory.

"Kill her! I said kill her!"

"But contradiction isn't a natural state. Not being able to maintain it longer was your downfall. In 5 years, no, 1 year, you could kill me perfectly."

The wizard slowly straightened her back.

"...One day would be enough."

"Maybe so. Honestly, I don't know what kind of thinking you have either. Sirone sent you, I suppose."

The wizard gritted her teeth.

'Let's die.'

Rather than see her teacher's disappointed face, it would be better to end her life here.

"What do you want? If you're thinking of sparing me, leave."

"Planning to commit suicide?"

Harvits gazed quietly at the child who was silently biting her lips.

'What is this woman to me?'

He had no desire to know, but he was certain he didn't want the wizard to die.

'How strange.'

Meeting Gustav's 4th Squadron was also enjoyable, but not with this strong a resonance.

'Ah, right.'

He wanted to play more.

'This woman sees me.'

Some kind of comfort.

'Should I suggest tormenting people? No, I should suggest fighting on Sirone's side. Whatever we do would be fun...'

He heard the wizard's voice of heart.

'She hates me.'

Sadness briefly passed through Harvits' eyes, and he slowly stood up and spoke.

"Come find me whenever you want to kill me."

"Satan! Huk!"

As Shiok sank into the ground, the wizard raised her head as if she couldn't understand.

"Come find you?"

"Right. Of course, you can't kill me with just the desire to kill. But you have to try as far as you can, don't you? Better than dying."

Though the wizard silently fell into thought, Harvits already felt he'd heard her answer.

"Today was fun."

Even after Harvits entered the forest, she didn't move from her spot for a long time.

"Huk..."

The hypnosis was lifted.

"Waaaah! Waaaah!"

The wizard, returned to a seven-year-old child, began crying miserably.
