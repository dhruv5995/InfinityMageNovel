What Guffin Left Behind (1)

Katathorsa nodded.

Sirone's Miracle Stream was comparable to Guffin's abilities that he knew.

"It was properly passed down."

"Yeah. Thanks."

Having experienced Omega, there were no more mysteries left for Sirone, and naturally his speech became more casual.

"Without you all, the Gaian spirit wouldn't have been passed down to this era."

That didn't mean his respect had disappeared.

"I'll convey my gratitude on Guffin's behalf."

They were the ones who had preserved time through the massive flow from Guffin's erasure to the Great Purification.

"We merely fulfilled our duty."

Though he said that, perhaps deeply moved, Katathorsa gazed at the ceiling with distant eyes.

"...Knowing Omega doesn't mean it's over. As I said before, I cannot tell you the history of the era you exist in. You must continue to fight the world with your own judgment."

"I'm prepared for that."

"However..."

Katathorsa's head slowly lowered, and his two eyes stared directly at Sirone.

"There's one more thing remaining. The only history from your time period that Guffin permitted."

"That Guffin permitted..."

Sirone gulped.

"Yes. An event that occurred just before Guffin departed the photon system, and right when you were born. Since very few know about Hexa's birth, it shouldn't greatly affect your present. But Guffin said to ask for your understanding. I don't know the content of the event either. If you don't permit it, I will delete the log I possess."

In a situation where he was leaving Hexa behind, he didn't want to convey something like his own emotions.

'I suppose that's a parent's perspective.'

Still, he wanted to know.

'He claims to be my real father, but I don't have a single memory with him.'

Since Sirone didn't appear in Omega, there were virtually no points of contact between him and Guffin.

"What Guffin left behind."

Sirone, who had muttered quietly, took a deep breath.

"Yeah. I want to know."

Golden light rekindled in Katathorsa's eyes, and some record from Omega came flooding in.

After Guffin's door was installed in Estas and with the Judgment of Twenty imminent, Miro visited Heaven.

"That child?"

The Plateau of Corruption.

In a landscape where everything had been swept away by the aftermath of war, Guffin was holding a child.

"Ugh... ?"

As Guffin lowered his head to meet the child's eyes, indescribable emotion filled the corners of his mouth.

"Let me see."

When Miro lowered the child's wrapping, a baby bright as a full moon was smiling.

"Hmm."

Guffin chuckled.

"If he's cute, just say so honestly. It's natural for Ikael's and my child to be handsome."

"Your smile is reaching your ears. If you treasure him so much, how can you give him to someone else and leave?"

Guffin smiled bitterly.

'Even if you see through all things in the universe, children are still heartbreaking.'

Feeling sorry, Miro examined the child again and changed the mood.

"Well, he's 90 percent like Ikael. Baby, you should know how lucky you are. If you'd taken after your father... ugh."

Guffin shouted incredulously.

"What are you saying? Anyone can see he's my son! Look carefully. How is this only 10 percent?"

"No, his face is 100 percent Ikael. The remaining 10 percent is, hmm, probably here?"

Miro's index finger slowly opened the wrapping and headed toward the child's lower body.

Sirone's shoulders, receiving the log, trembled violently.

'Miss Miro, please...'

Since this wasn't just video but felt through all senses, even her thoughts were clearly visible.

'She's really trying to look.'

Then Guffin hastily twisted his body away.

"Why are you doing this? You can't have our son."

Miro snorted.

"What? Didn't you say he was the one and only successor and the last defender who would protect the world? Was that all bluff?"

"I don't know. Anyway, absolutely not our son! He's going to have normal romance with a normal woman."

Miro's eyes grew hollow.

"Mister, you won't even remember this anyway."

If Guffin erased the log after departing the photon system, he wouldn't remember what happened here.

"There, there, good boy."

Not even pretending to listen, Guffin was cooing at Sirone when he suddenly showed gentle eyes.

"He resembles Ikael..."

As Guffin's emotions came through empathy, Sirone's eyes grew hot.

'How much must he miss her.'

Discovering Guffin's gaze, Miro softened her expression and patted his back.

"Let's go. We need to start."

"Ugh... huh?"

After advancing 100 meters from there, there was a massive bell-shaped structure rising from the ground.

"This is... the Tower of Babel?"

Guffin burst into laughter.

"I understand your disappointment. But it was once high enough to pierce the sky. And it was huge."

It had approached God.

"The Battle of Babel. In the Second War, the Gaians officially lost their confrontation with God. You could call it a historic place."

"You want to pass this on to that child?"

"Thinking about it, Gaians don't really have a homeland. Ever since realizing Ultima, they rejected fear and challenged God. Now that even our roots are disappearing, perhaps this place could become a homeland of the heart."

Guffin looked down at the child.

"My son, remember the Gaian heart dwelling in this tower. Though we were defeated, we challenged endlessly. We never surrendered to the world. We never despaired, and we protected our free will to the very end."

Guffin and Miro entered Babel's interior and descended endlessly underground.

Sirone realized.

'I really had been here before.'

This was why he had felt something like déjà vu when he entered Babel during the Heaven Project.

Miro asked.

"Why is the security so thorough? Didn't Gaians used to live here?"

While constantly activating Miracle Stream to neutralize security devices, Guffin answered.

"It's Heaven's doing. Looking at the code, it's Kariel's work. Originally Heaven's technology belonged to the Gaians. Now the Mecha divine people are carrying on its maintenance."

"...It's safe, right?"

As Miro looked around warily, Guffin raised the corner of his mouth.

"It's just technology after all. They can never imitate the unique Gaian spirit."

Each time Miracle Stream's smoke spread, the red warning lights in the corridor went out.

"We should be able to do something here."

Entering the control room, the first thing visible were cone-shaped pillars installed on the ground and ceiling.

Beyond them were various mechanical devices that Kariel had made, looking crude to Guffin.

"The Tower of Babel operates on the Ultima System. It's beyond the angels' reach."

Placing his hands between the cones and activating the Ultima System, powerful electrical energy condensed.

Simultaneously, all devices lit up as Babel activated, and screens came to life.

"Main system access. Code name Babel Project."

While Miro watched, the operating program's logic circuits appeared on screen.

"What are you going to do by activating it now?"

"Well, that's true."

Guffin felt a bit embarrassed too.

"But since we came all this way, I feel like I should leave something. After all, I am the last Gaian."

We existed in this world.

"Of course, if Hexa can't defeat God, this record will also return to nothing..."

That's why it's Omega.

"This time too, I'm just throwing it out there. My heart."

As thoughts converted to text, characters that had never existed before began to be written on the screen.

Even Miro couldn't read them.

'Number of Laws 1.'

Therefore, it was solely Guffin's language.

"Gaians all used different characters according to their individuality. But communication wasn't a problem. In the end, there's only one signal that penetrates this world."

That was empathy, the Ultima System.

Therefore, if Sirone came here in the future, he would be able to read Guffin's record.

'When Ankera attempted the Second Reset... that would be roughly Omega year 412.'

Guffin, who had recorded specific eras of the Gaians in Omega units, filled in the final 999 years.

'Last Gaian, Mclain Guffin. Photon system departure.'

Though the name would be erased anyway, this concluded Gaian history.

'The future is...'

Guffin, who had been lost in thought for a moment, muttered.

"Beyond infinity."

A sentence meant for someone was recorded again, and with that, the screen went dark.

"Is it finished?"

Miro asked.

Behind her, a dimensional door connecting to Estas had already opened.

"Then give me Hexa now. If you initialize while he's switched with Kazra's prince, Hexa's cause will be permanently removed. Then even Ankera can't touch him."

"That's right."

Since humanity's future was at stake, Guffin didn't hesitate to hold out the child.

However, his hands seemed to tremble slightly.

"...The child will be safe. I can't convince Sister Yolga, but I won't go easy on him either."

"Yes. I'm counting on you."

Miro, who was about to receive Hexa, stared intently at the child's face before raising her gaze.

"As a father, don't you have any last words?"

A parting while still alive.

She knew that leaving room would only make it more painful, but Miro couldn't leave like this either.

"Last words."

If there was advice he could give to his son who would have to fight the world alone from now on...

"If you."

Guffin said while stroking the child.

"If you must fight evil so strong that you cannot protect yourself, you may follow evil's methodology."

The Behemoth seal engraved in Sirone's inner self briefly glowed red.

"If you become strong enough to protect your family, stand in the neutrality between good and evil."

There's nothing greater than protecting family.

"Dad couldn't do that."

As Guffin burst into hollow laughter and his eyes reddened, tears flowed from Sirone's eyes too.

"If you become strong enough to protect your family and protect even more people, uphold good."

That is righteousness.

"And if... you become strong enough to protect the entire world..."

Guffin lifted Hexa high.

"Listen to everyone's stories."

Among beings born from one, there is nothing insignificant.

"Ah-oo. Ah-ah."

Perhaps enjoying seeing Guffin's face from up high, the child smiled brightly.

As if swallowing tears, Guffin raised his head to the limit and slowly lowered his arms.

Miro, who had become reverent, carefully received the child and entered the dimensional door, turning around.

"How much time do I have?"

"Estas's time must be linked with space. When events branch, time's relativity reaches its extreme. One second here could become decades inside Estas."

It was time's closed curve.

"Don't worry, I'll definitely succeed. If I can't return in time, just close the time. I won't resent you."

"No. You'll end up resenting me anyway. When my existence disappears, you'll just be humanity's scapegoat."

Guffin, who had been lost in thought briefly, continued.

"I'm sorry to you, and I'm prepared to be hated. Just please protect Hexa."

Miro nodded and walked into Estas's interior, muttering.

"Yolga."

The next moment, Miro could be seen walking down the corridor with blood smeared on her face.

In time's closed curve, space was time itself, so from Guffin's perspective, Warehouse 72 was the same time period.

'Creating independent time within the world's time, and when I depart the photon system...'

In Estas's other warehouses, Miro might have already been affected by Guffin's erasure.

It was Estas's mystery - future within the closed curve but actually past in overall time.

'Kazra's prince is... gone.'

Though this was the first time seeing Miro so murderous, she simply nodded silently.

'Thank you.'

There had probably been a tragic event, but Guffin also didn't ask and closed the dimensional door.

With this, Miro would leave the event of escaping Estas in time's closed curve.

'All preparations are complete.'

Guffin looked up at the ceiling and muttered.

"This time you won't be able to stop it, Ankera."

Because I'm not alone.

As Ikael's tears flowed out through Hexa, a massive Ataraxia unfolded.

"Kuuuuu!"

Amplification.

Guffin's body itself became Miracle Stream and began compressing toward infinity.

'Though there's no more Ultima in this world...'

I leave behind.

'One hope.'

As his body gradually spread into light, a faint smile formed on Guffin's face.

"It was fun."

His body disappeared like a flicker.

'Breakthrough.'

When passing through the photon system's boundary, the unknown layer where even the concept of spacetime didn't exist.

'That is?'

He could see a blonde boy who looked exactly like Ikael rushing toward him.

"...Little rascal."

Guffin understood everything.

"You became a wonderful guy."

See, I told you he resembled me.
