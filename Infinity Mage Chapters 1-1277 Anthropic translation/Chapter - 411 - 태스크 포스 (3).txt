[411] Task Force (3)

The monstrous bird Kydra, flying toward Galliant Island, spotted a cargo ship crossing the vast ocean and lowered its altitude.

When Zulu released Kydra, the four people including Shiina and Quan began falling rapidly toward the sea.

Zulu and Shiina controlled their descent speed with Fly magic, while Shirone spread his light wings.

Though high altitude wouldn't be a familiar environment for the swordsman Quan, he didn't even blink as he confirmed the ship's position.

His ability to generate external gravity through micro-vibrations to offset gravitational acceleration was in no way inferior to the mages' techniques.

Shiina was impressed by the skills of the Death Magician she had only heard about in rumors.

Just ten years ago, he had been evaluated as having unparalleled talent in swordsmanship movement.

Such a person had lost his Achilles' heel. Just like that person who had lost his eyes for her sake.

'Come to think of it, they're similar.'

The four people flew toward the ship and landed on the deserted stern deck.

Simultaneously, Zulu summoned Auto Prism, making everyone invisible.

'As expected, when skilled people gather, things get resolved easily.'

How many people could infiltrate a ship floating on the sea and reach Galliant without being detected by anyone?

If Sein had been there, he could have even blocked sound with Equilibrium.

No matter how dangerous Heaven might be, with a team of this caliber, they wouldn't be easily defeated.

The warehouse was packed with products from the mainland.

The four people went to a corner where rice sacks were stacked and sat back-to-back, facing each other in pairs.

"Once we reach the port, I can't summon Auto Prism. There's a risk of being detected by Zoner. Flu will be waiting at the intermediate contact point, so we need to slip out without being noticed if possible."

Shiina handed a robe to Quan.

Zulu could sufficiently hide his face with his current clothes, and Shirone could solve it cleanly by using Diamond Armed.

An hour later, the ship docked at the port. The area outside the warehouse became noisy, then the door opened urgently.

The four people hiding against the wall slipped out as soon as the sailors entered.

The deck was busy with workers from the island loading cargo, so no one paid attention to the four people.

Going down to the wharf, it was bustling with ship mechanics, cargo handlers, warehouse managers, traders, and such.

Jis, who had deep ties with Shirone, was also running busily between the docks, soliciting travelers.

"Come, come! I'll carry your luggage! I'll also guide you to Galliant's famous Kergo ruins! Translation services available too!"

Shirone pulled his Diamond Armed robe deep over his head and quietly turned to look at Jis.

'Still the same, Jis. Is Yuna doing well too?'

Just because the Parrot Bandits had left didn't mean their place would remain empty, but he seemed to be living quite honestly.

"Huh? Who's that?"

When Jis turned around, Shirone quietly lowered his head and followed his companions out of the dock.

Though he wanted to exchange greetings, having bid farewell to the world and heading toward a place of death, there was nothing to say.

'Be happy, Jis.'

Friends approached Jis, who was staring blankly at Shirone, with gloomy expressions.

"Ugh, why aren't we getting any customers today? Huh? Jis, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. Did someone come?"

"No, I just feel strange somehow. Those people."

The friend looked at the hooded figures and frowned. It seemed Jis's bad habit was showing again.

"Hey, don't mind people like that. They look dangerous just by looking at them. If you get involved with them wrongly, you won't even be able to collect your bones."

Another friend agreed.

"My instincts as a tout for 10 years say so too. Those people give off a smell of being extremely dangerous."

Despite his friends' dissuasion, Jis couldn't turn his gaze away until they disappeared.

For some unknown reason, a feeling of longing seeped in.

'Come to think of it... I wonder if he's living well?'

"Hey! Luggage here! Any porters available?"

A large man who had gotten off the passenger ship approached, staggering with luggage bags in both hands.

Jis hurriedly came to his senses. Then he raised his hand faster than anyone and ran over.

"Yes, yes! Coming!"

Kergo Ruins.

Gaold, Kang Nan, Sein, Zulu, Flu, Etela, Shiina, Quan, Shirone.

The nine people participating in this project gathered in one place for the first time.

Since rumors had been circulating back and forth, there was no particular need for a separate briefing.

There were several agents within the ruins as well, but they had all been dealt with by Sein, who had been waiting for a day.

Of course, since complacency was forbidden, it was better to cover their faces.

However, Gaold, the core target, pulled back his hood and even took off his robe, throwing it on the ground.

Kang Nan gritted her teeth and said,

"Please put it on while I'm asking nicely."

"It's stuffy. Anyway, once we go in, it's over. From now on, we're going to the Kergo Autonomous District."

Sein added,

"If there's someone waiting at Guffin's Gate, they'll select based on skill. About one person might be added to this group."

The party headed to the stepped altar on the east side of the central temple.

It was the place where Shirone had previously opened the Immortal Function and passed the maze trial.

A Kergo native was guarding the entrance, but it was different from the person Shirone had seen before.

Since Chief Kadum had lost his lifespan, the political situation of the Kergo tribe must have changed considerably.

When they had visited with friends a year ago, the native had displayed terrifying prayers, but seeing Gaold's party, he seemed nervous and swallowed hard.

As a Kergo warrior, the gatekeeper couldn't fail to sense the blade-like refined energy emanating from nine people simultaneously.

Gaold strode forward and spoke.

"Kertia, ro hoima. Akrasia, widmia benzen."

Knock on my door. Then it shall be opened.

It was a memorable password that remained in Shirone's memory as well.

However, the native's reaction was different from before. With a serious face, he shook his head and spoke in Kergo.

"Not now. There are too many waiting to go to Heaven. Come back in three days."

Gaold slightly furrowed his brow and swung the back of his hand, making a thud sound as the native flew away.

Shirone, who was staring in bewilderment at the native lying motionless on the ground, asked Sein.

"What did the native say that made him angry?"

"Gaold doesn't know Kergo."

"......"

When Gaold operated the device, the altar wall collapsed inward, creating a door.

Kang Nan added a comment.

"But he hates Kergo."

Entering the altar, square spiral stairs descended endlessly downward.

After descending for about 20 minutes, a corridor continued. As before, two natives were guarding in front of an iron door.

From here was Kergo's world with no contact points with outside civilization.

The natives had no hesitation in revealing the tattoos carved on their bodies, and they were much more aggressive than the one guarding above.

"Wait. How did you get in? From today, entry to Heaven is..."

When Gaold struck his jaw with the back of his hand, the native collapsed with a thud.

His companion tried to shout angrily, but then the back of the opposite hand turned his jaw.

Shirone stared blankly at the two natives who had fainted while bleeding from their noses, thinking this wasn't right.

If they opened the Immortal Function in the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice, they could receive everyone's welcome and go to Guffin's Gate. There was no need to cause trouble with Kergo.

"Um, couldn't we just do it the standard way? I know some of the natives here, and if we light all eight eyes of the angel..."

"Angel?"

Gaold stopped abruptly and turned his head.

"Shirone, this is just a toy made by my schoolmate."

Shirone closed his mouth.

He could feel terrible anger from Gaold, but it wasn't just because of that. He seemed to understand why Gaold hated Kergo.

Inside the iron door, an octagonal room appeared.

Three men were guarding the iron door across, with a man with white tattoos symbolizing a Kergo priest standing in the center.

Even to Shirone's eyes, his level of force was different from those who had blocked their way so far.

However, Gaold didn't even look at him and entered the altar where eight spheres created by Miro were floating.

The Kergo priest moved with a menacing expression.

"Who are you? How dare mere foreigners enter the sacred angel's room without permission..."

Before he could finish speaking, Gaold grabbed a sphere at random and cast magic.

When a simple Air Press, hardly worthy of being called magic, entered, the altar rang with a thud.

The priest looked around the shaking room with a surprised expression, then hurriedly turned his gaze to the sphere.

The white radiance that Shirone couldn't see despite using all means a year ago was brightly lit.

Shirone stared intently at the sphere.

It was amazing that white fire actually came on, but more than anything, it was the first time he had seen such a small number.

1,008,000.

"One million eight thousand points..."

Gaold approached the stunned priest, looked directly into his eyes, and answered briefly.

"Move aside."

Though he didn't know what it meant, the priest's legs had already moved to open a path for Gaold.

It was a score that far exceeded what was needed to pass in the language of God.

Upon arriving at the Kergo Autonomous District, warriors who had already heard the news were guarding the entrance.

Their eyes, holding weapons aloft, flashed with wariness toward the foreigners.

"This is the sacred land of Kergo! If you trespass, we will kill you regardless of reason!"

Gaold walked toward the barrier of spears standing like a hedgehog while compressing an air sphere above his palm.

Compared to Heaven's citizens, the Kergo here were rather cute.

Warriors who would give their lives for Ankera. Moreover, their individual force was on a different level from these people.

But to Gaold, they were all just the same Kergo.

"Everyone lower your weapons!"

Just as Gaold's Press magic was about to explode, a sturdy man walked through the warriors.

Though his black tattoos had changed to gold, Shirone could recognize his face at a glance.

It was Mahatu, a member of the anti-angel faction who had opposed Chief Kadum.

Having gold tattoos meant he had become chief.

As expected, the warriors lowered their weapons and knelt.

"Chief! These are heretics who assaulted a Kergo priest! Why do you extinguish our fighting spirit!"

Mahatu, who had briefly made eye contact with Gaold, moved toward the eight companions standing behind.

"It's been a long time, Lord Shirone."

Mahatu had learned continental language.

Since his doctrine was to separate religion and society to improve tribal life, it was an essential skill for negotiating with the Galliant government.

"Mr. Mahatu, you've become chief."

"I don't know if I'm qualified, but that's what happened."

The warriors couldn't contain their anger.

To them, assaulting a priest was the worst crime that nothing could replace.

"Chief! Please explain! Who exactly are these people!"

Mahatu asked Shirone with a troubled expression.

"Why didn't you prove your angelic abilities?"

"Ah, well... there were some circumstances."

Mahatu seemed to understand.

Recently, countless people had been flocking to the Kergo ruins.

What on earth was happening in Heaven?

The seriousness of the situation could be understood just by looking at the level of people Shirone had brought.

'What the hell are those monsters?'

Mahatu, Kergo's greatest warrior, could feel it.

Each of them was a master who had trained different systems to their limits. Especially Gaold didn't seem human.

If someone like himself, who thought he wouldn't lose to anyone in fighting spirit, could have his spirit broken just by briefly making eye contact, then even Shirone would have had no choice.

Since negotiations were in progress, extreme conflict didn't break out, but the nerve war between the warriors and Gaold was still fierce.

"Execute the heretics who assaulted the priest! We are ready to fight! We're not afraid of someone like you at all!"

"Yeah, come on! Come and try!"

Kang Nan looked pathetically at Gaold, who was arguing with warriors he couldn't even communicate with, and rubbed her temples.

'As expected, we shouldn't have made that human the commander.'

Still, the reason she left him alone was that sometimes Gaold's methods were necessary.

Above all, wasn't this the beginning of the day he had waited for 20 years?

No matter how much of an ugly duckling he was, Kang Nan couldn't scold him today.

"Everyone be quiet! How dare you disobey my command!"

"Chief! We are prepared to die for your command. But isn't compromising with heretics denying Kergo's very existence!"

"How foolish. Do you know who has come here now?"

The warriors' gazes turned to Shirone.

However, those who had been imprisoned under Kadum's iron rule just a year ago couldn't possibly know the boy's face.

Mahatu raised his hand to introduce Shirone.

"This is the divine messenger who punished Kadum's faction and saved us anti-angel faction members, Lord Shirone."
