[588] The Mastermind (3)

News of Eden's retirement reached the Scramble Royale participants.

It was shortly after Quasar had exploded.

"Retirement?"

Hercy wore a dazed expression.

'They really broke through the barrier?'

In the Gold Ring's own simulations, Eden's defensive abilities were unmatched among the graduating class—a solid first place with no competition.

"Now Infinite is gone."

Iruki said with a sneer.

"Only Amy and Cayden are left."

Hercy, having regained his composure, quickly calculated the hands.

Shirone's team strongest hand was Sabina's ●●●● (Demon).

'Cayden's hand is...'

○●○ (Democracy).

'Perfect!'

Hercy trembled with excitement.

In the complex battle of hand combinations, only Iruki would be able to calculate what Shirone's team's strongest hand was, but he had one more strategy left for the worst of the worst scenarios.

"Puhahaha!"

As Hercy burst into loud laughter, Dorothy raised an eyebrow.

"What's wrong with him? Has he lost it?"

"You fought well."

Hercy said, stopping his laughter.

"Really magnificent. Honestly, I thought this would be an easy win. I'll give you credit for hanging on this far."

"Do you think Cayden can beat Amy?"

Hercy shrugged.

Unlike Eden's case, even in the Gold Ring's own simulations, the two were evenly matched in combat ability.

"It doesn't matter who wins."

Hercy was certain the Scramble Royale was over.

"I'll say it again—the winner is Cayden."

"Hand over the Master Card."

Amy extended her hand toward Cayden.

"Master Card? Oh."

Cayden blinked as if just realizing something.

"Hurry up. You're not planning to be stubborn even now, are you? That's not like you."

"The thing is... I don't have it."

"What?"

Amy furrowed her brow, not understanding.

"This morning, Hercy took my Master Card without telling the team members. I can't call 'Kong,' but your hand was lower than mine anyway. That was the condition Hercy proposed in exchange for letting me pursue you."

"Wait. He took your Master Card? Your Master Card?"

Amy, suddenly confused, extended her hand while muttering something, then checked the participants' card status.

Cayden's Democracy was the strongest.

'If the Scramble Royale ends like this, the Coalition Team wins.'

Amy's heart sank as she turned to Cayden and shouted.

"You idiot! What good does it do to tell me that now? We're going to lose!"

Cayden was equally bewildered.

"Why would I tell you that? We're on different sides!"

"Shut up! You airhead!"

Amy kicked Cayden in the ribs, sending shock through his broken ribcage.

"Ugh! What are you doing?"

"Ugh! I really can't stand this!"

As Amy turned and ran off, Cayden reached out his hand.

"W-wait...!"

"Shut up! Just wait until after the match!"

His trembling hand moved toward his broken ribs, and saliva leaked between his teeth.

"Grrr!"

As expected, mages showed no mercy.

"Cayden doesn't have a Master Card."

Hercy declared triumphantly.

"I took it this morning. Even if Amy beats Cayden, she won't be able to break the card. And if Cayden wins, well, the result goes without saying."

A moment of silence followed.

"Do you understand now? The Scramble Royale is the Coalition Team's victory."

"Iruki."

As Dorothy turned around, Iruki spoke.

"Where's the Master Card?"

"Well, where could it be?"

Hercy's body flashed with light.

Sonic was already analyzed and unusable, but they wouldn't be able to cast Cancellation on spatial movement.

"Then we'll see after the match."

Simultaneously, Sabina approached from behind and grabbed his throat.

"Don't move."

Sharp Air Cut energy swirled around her fingertips.

"Hmph, a final struggle? How unsightly."

Dorothy approached with Hickory in tow.

"Hand over the Master Card. Otherwise, we'll have to use force."

Just then, the ground beneath Sabina's feet writhed, and a snake-like long centipede burst up and wrapped around her ankle.

"Damn!"

From a tree 10 meters away, Fisho descended upside down, riding a spider.

"Let Hercy go. It's a venomous centipede."

"Don't talk nonsense. Think you'll die alone?"

Sabina tightened her grip on Hercy's throat even more, and Hickory's fist aimed at Fisho hanging from the tree.

In a situation where each held the other's lifeline, Sabina said.

"Search Hercy's body. We don't have much time. We need to find the Master Card."

Hercy spread both arms as if enjoying himself.

"Hahaha! You never disappoint me! But what to do? I don't have Cayden's Master Card."

"Shut up and stay still. We'll verify that ourselves."

Murderous intent could be felt in Sabina's voice.

"Be my guest. Just because I received it doesn't mean I'm necessarily carrying it. Search all you want. If you can find it in time, it's your victory."

"Iruki, hurry!"

Only after Dorothy, who had loaded her Rocket Punch, shouted did Iruki slowly start walking.

"Oh my, I don't have a hobby of entrusting my body to men. You won't be able to find what you're looking for anyway..."

"Hercy."

Iruki interrupted and looked up.

"Are you perhaps an idiot?"

"What?"

Hercy's face crumpled.

"Yes! I'm an idiot! I'm a fool!"

Amy changed direction and retraced her path.

Emerging from the forest, Cayden was still clutching his side and groaning.

"Hey! I can just retire you, can't I?"

"That's why I told you to wait..."

"Shut up! There's less than 2 minutes left!"

Amy grabbed Cayden by the collar, pulled him up, activated her Schema, and hoisted him on her back.

"Ow! You're too strong."

"Like I care!"

Amy, who had cast spatial movement repeatedly, landed near the magic school's main gate.

10 seconds remaining until Scramble Royale ends.

"This is crazy!"

Amy, calculating the strain of teleportation and Schema, ran while carrying Cayden on her back.

5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3 seconds...

Hearing Lulu's electrical signal, she threw Cayden with all her might.

"Go, Cayden!"

2 seconds, 1 second.

As Cayden's body crossed over the main gate, another signal came between the counts.

Cayden, eliminated by going out of bounds. Scramble Royale match time has ended.

The strongest hand is Demon (●●●●). The winning team is Shirone, Iruki, Nade, Amy, Dorothy, Sabina.

Rewards and penalties will be applied through the judge.

"Hah! Hah!"

Only after recognizing all of Lulu's signals did Amy collapse, supporting herself with her hands on the ground.

"Such a brute force method..."

Cayden, who had fallen outside the main gate, writhed while enduring the pain.

"We won!"

Sabina and Dorothy dropped their combat stances and jumped up and down.

Fisho still showed no emotion, and only Hercy was in a dazed state.

"Ah..."

The fact that he only realized much later how stupid his thinking had been meant it hadn't been in his head at all.

'Why did I do that?'

"When you're cornered, you start accepting even impossible hopes positively."

Hercy's eyes turned to Iruki approaching him.

"It's like insurance in card games. Setting up insurance for specific situations is a good strategy, but if you're not careful, you end up forcing all assumptions into that specific situation."

"Hmph, stop showing off...!"

"Because you're thinking of using tricks..."

Hercy's face crumpled, but Iruki ignored him and looked at Dorothy, recalling her advice as he continued.

"You lose sight of what's really important."

"..."

Hercy, realizing his complete defeat, ground his teeth.

"Let's meet at the graduation exam. I'll definitely crush you at least."

"Just focus on helping us."

The condition was that 2 people from Shirone's team would be supported in the graduation exam.

As Hercy disappeared through spatial movement, Sabina and Dorothy approached.

"Good work, Iruki."

"Yeah. It's thanks to you all moving according to strategy."

Dorothy said.

"I'll say this again when the team gathers, but it's definitely an ambiguous condition. Choosing 2 people, I mean."

In the negotiations before the Scramble Royale began, Cayden had responded emotionally, so Shirone's team had also proposed the strongest conditions, but now that they had won, dividing the rewards was ambiguous.

Iruki suggested.

"How about this? The two people with the lowest rankings among us until the graduation exam get the rewards."

Sabina agreed.

"That's a good method. Honestly, this might sound emotional, but I'd like all 6 of us to pass."

No one would use the trick of deliberately lowering their ranking to get help from the Gold Ring.

'Because we know what's really important.'

Dorothy smiled toward the sky, thinking she was glad to have entered the magic school.

"Are you really leaving now? Your injuries seem serious."

Though Amy was the one who had caused them, Cayden now understood her personality.

"I can do simple healing magic. I'll get treatment from a professional on the way."

Since the Scramble Royale itself was illegal, he had no intention of visiting the infirmary.

"Okay. You'll come back, right?"

"I just want to get some fresh air. Visit home after a long time. Most importantly, my ranking is quite high."

Now that he thought about it, it was absurd.

"To drop my ranking below Nade's, I'd have to stay away for at least a month."

Nade's graduating class ranking was dead last, and currently, even his return was uncertain.

"Haha! Right? Be careful. In the meantime, I'll boost my ranking way up."

Cayden turned around with a bitter smile.

"Give my regards to Maya."

"No way. Come back and tell her yourself. Honestly, I feel uncomfortable when I'm with her."

"Hahahaha!"

Cayden suddenly had a thought and threw his head back, bursting into laughter.

"Now I see you're a match made in heaven. Shirone and you, I mean."

Amy's face turned red.

"What nonsense? We're still nothing to each other...!"

"My ribs that you broke—Shirone broke them a few days ago too."

"..."

"You don't give the bones time to heal before beating them up. I'm really sick of you two."

Amy asked with an anxious expression.

"Don't tell me you..."

"Don't worry. I won't interfere anymore. So enjoy your life to the fullest."

Cayden, moving away from the school, looked back at Amy and raised one corner of his mouth.

"Karmis."

Amy also saw him off with a smile.

"Have a pleasant trip, Cross."

The participants, still feeling the afterglow of the match, gradually gathered where Iruki was.

Shirone arrived with Eden, and finally Amy joined them.

"Phew, that was close, wasn't it? Everyone worked hard."

As Shirone said, they all looked tired.

"It feels weird to just go back like this—should we grab something simple to eat?"

As Amy rubbed her growling stomach, Sabina agreed.

"I'm hungry too. But there won't be any shops open at this hour, right? Even the school store is closed."

Eden said.

"Let's go to the school cafeteria. I'll cook with the ingredients there. I can make simple food. The believers said it was delicious too."

"Eden, you will?"

Though Eden had lost the confrontation, his expression was actually more peaceful than before.

"Making food for the hungry is also practicing love."

Iruki nodded.

"Good, then let's go. Fisho, want to come eat with us?"

Even after the Coalition Team disbanded, Fisho still remained in place.

"...I'm not lonely."

Fisho was the oldest in the graduating class.

"Who said anything? Let's just review this match. There might have been winning percentages we never thought of. You were in charge of Scramble too."

"If you put it that way."

The pain of defeat was great, but he knew how important it was to analyze the causes of failure.

As Fisho joined and everyone was about to head to the school cafeteria, Shirone called out.

"Wait. But there's a bit of a problem."

"A problem?"

"Going into the cafeteria at this hour violates school rules."

"..."

Everyone opened their mouths with blank expressions, and in the awkward atmosphere, Iruki asked.

"Are you serious right now?"

"Yeah. What if we get caught and scolded by a teacher?"

Having heard that much, everyone turned away and started walking off.

"Wait! I'm really worried...!"

Hearing Shirone's footsteps hurrying to follow, Fisho said.

"That's Shirone alright."

"Of course. This is a magic school."

Amy said, suppressing her laughter.

"He's not normal either."

Scramble Royale concluded.
