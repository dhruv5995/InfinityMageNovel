[611] The Five Prestigious Schools (4)

"Tormia!"

The herald shouted.

"Royal! Magic School!"

The reason their chant was longer than the other prestigious schools wasn't simply because it had more syllables.

People's gazes focused on the road by the north gate where the royal castle stood, as eight horses pulled a massive carriage that completely occupied the width of the road.

"Wooooooah!"

The cheers were much more thunderous than before.

The king-sized carriage was only operated in the capital, and was a means of transportation that couldn't be used without traffic control backing from the royal castle's transportation management department.

"Tch, is this what being 'Royal' means?"

It was a school established under the king's command to nurture magicians who would lead the nation, and the majority of the association's key positions were filled by Royal Magic School graduates.

The four doors installed on both sides opened simultaneously, and 30 Royal Magic School students filed out onto the ground.

Their eyes held the pride of being the kingdom's top elite, and they remained unshaken even by the people's applause and cheers.

The gazes of students from other prestigious schools turned cold.

'There's definitely something unfair about this.'

Twenty graduates, they said.

No matter how fierce the competition at Royal was, having two-thirds of applicants pass was an incredible advantage.

"Dante, don't you regret it?"

Sabina asked.

Dante's group had also been ranked in the top 30s at Royal Magic School before transferring.

If they had stayed and been promoted, making it into the final 30 for the graduation exam cutline would have been much easier.

"No need to be swayed by reputation."

Dante examined the faces of the Royal Magic School students.

Unlike students from other prestigious schools who were having psychological battles with key figures like Shirone, Dante, and Fermi, they wore completely confident expressions.

"Wherever I fight becomes the top school. Have confidence."

Sabina and Closer's lips curved upward.

'That's right. Dante, you're the best.'

"Students, enter!"

Following the herald's instructions, the barricades opened and 150 students in formal wear began entering the central plaza in formation.

Though they were students, they were graduating seniors, and the aura emanating from 150 aspiring mages was enough to form an army by itself.

"All the talented ones in the kingdom have gathered."

Two kilometers away from the central plaza, current Magic Association Chairman Lufist was casting Fly magic in the sky, watching the rippling black wave below.

He had a pale face with sharp features, a torn scar on the right side of his mouth, and his eyebrows were missing patches of hair in comb-like patterns as if clawed by a beast.

Jane, the chief secretary assisting Lufist, spoke.

"In terms of brains alone, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say they're ranked 1st to 150th in the kingdom. However, they're ultimately just components of the state."

With her red hair pulled back tightly and wearing a silk robe, her face was as vicious as a wildcat's, and her artificially removed wrinkles made it difficult to guess her age.

"That's true enough."

Lufist didn't recognize individual value.

"But they're core components."

That's why his current statement was the highest praise he could give the students.

"It's time. Let's depart. I'll go to the association and prepare."

As Jane finished speaking, the two flew off in different directions.

Flight magic was prohibited within the capital, but no one could stop Lufist from flying to the central plaza.

"Look there...!"

People pointed at Lufist as they looked up at the sky.

Under the gaze of nearly a thousand people, Lufist landed on the platform with his black coat fluttering.

'Flight magic in the capital.'

Collie realized that all his actions were political rhetoric.

"Greetings, students. I am Lufist, Chairman of the Tormia Magic Association."

As his voice echoed through the plaza via sound amplification, the graduating students' eyes clearly changed.

'That person is...'

First-Class Archmage Raphael Lufist.

He was one of the core military assets of the Tormia Kingdom, known by the alias "The Steel Archmage."

'He's definitely different.'

Though Shirone had lived alongside Vice Principal Olivia, a Second-Class Archmage, the aura of a First-Class Archmage—of which there were only four in the kingdom—was on another level.

'Another Gaold.'

That was Shirone's first impression.

"Before we begin the inspection ceremony, I think I need to clarify something. Mages are creatures who won't act unless they're convinced."

His rough manner of speaking was unbefitting of an association chairman, but it was permitted precisely because he was the chairman.

"Actually, there's no particular reason I called you here. I just wanted to see my future family members with my own eyes after taking office as chairman."

As Lufist's eyes swept across the plaza, the students' hearts pounded.

'He's looking at me. He definitely saw me.'

While everyone was thinking the same thing, Lufist's gaze finally returned to Shirone.

"You are the kingdom's top 150. And 60 of you will pass. Of those 60, about 10 will obtain official mage certification. And of those 10, only 5 will be able to get jobs at the Magic Association."

The atmosphere became solemn.

"Of course, some will leave the Red Line, and some will dig dungeons and never emerge into the world again. You don't know this yet, but mage is a difficult profession to manage. To work at the association, you need patriotism too."

Lufist spread his five fingers.

"I want to form a group of 5 with the best elites. I don't know which of you will pass, but if you think you're the best, aim for the Magic Association."

It was a kind of recruitment pitch.

"So why the Magic Association, you might wonder? First, all those pretty women and handsome men you love so much will follow you in droves."

Unlike the citizens who burst into laughter, the students' expressions remained seriously unchanged.

"And you'll receive considerable lobbying. Illegal funds, that is."

Even before countless spectators, Lufist was unrestrained.

"Of course, it's not recommended, but how would you know? You can think of thousands of ways to do it without getting caught, right? Because you're smart."

That was also true.

"I don't control mages. Because they can't be controlled. The standard I require of you is only one thing."

Lufist's index finger rose prominently before their eyes.

"Can you solve problems?"

The students' eyes blazed.

"Whether you're conscientious or trash, I don't care. Need to beat someone up? Then beat them up. His Majesty will remain silent. Want to kill someone? Then kill them! His Majesty will turn a blind eye!"

Lufist's voice rose.

"You can do whatever you want! The only rule you need to follow is making the kingdom strong!"

Both fists struck the platform.

"This won't do, that won't do—everyone complains, but you can't be like that! Because you're smart! Mages aren't those who raise problems, but those who solve problems! That's why you're given public authority, and that's why you're given a license to kill!"

The plaza's air trembled with boiling excitement.

"Who is the most outstanding mage here!"

Me.

'It's me.'

Everyone was thinking the same thing.

"Eliminate all factors that hinder the kingdom's development! If it's a god, kill even the god! That's the kind of mage the association wants! Do you understand!"

"Yes!"

It was a sound loud enough to startle the citizens.

"Repeat after me! Absolute power!"

"Ab! So! Lute! Pow! Er!"

The students' voices echoed through the quiet plaza.

"That is the greatest gift the Magic Association can give you. If you want it, come to the association."

As Lufist cast spatial movement magic and flew to the Magic Association, a thousand gazes followed him.

Though it was a common sight for the graduating class, it was a miracle-like phenomenon for ordinary citizens.

"Now, we will proceed with the inspection ceremony. Please form ranks with 5-meter intervals between schools in columns of four."

The students moved in perfect unison, and Shirone also lined up waiting with Iruki and Nade.

"Whew, this is no joke. I was so nervous."

"Right. I've met Mr. Gaold too, but his charisma doesn't seem to fall short."

Iruki said.

"Raphael Lufist. In political circles, he's evaluated as a representative figure of the far right. Showing the nation's strength rallies people, but his public authority remarks were at a dangerous level. If he didn't have that level of charisma, the citizens would have risen up."

The inspection ceremony began, and starting with Royal Magic School, 150 students advanced along the route as citizens applauded and welcomed them.

'Still, receiving this kind of treatment is nice. Maybe being a mage isn't such a bad profession...'

Lufist's force was so impressive that even Nade considered it worth thinking about.

"Huh?"

Shirone spotted her first, and Nade's gaze followed.

'Liz-senpai.'

Among the crowd, he could see Liz standing with a gentle smile.

Though he'd said he'd forgotten, that was just a matter of the mind—seeing her face made his heart start pounding again.

'But why...?'

Even as Nade's eyes questioned her, Liz couldn't provide a clear answer.

'Right, what am I doing here?'

When she had coldly pushed him away, what face did she have now to harbor lingering feelings for him?

It's much better to try and regret than to not try and regret.

Remembering her master's words, she steeled her heart and clapped vigorously while saying:

"You look great, Nade."

Though her voice was buried in the cheers, Nade definitely felt like he had heard it.

'Liz-senpai is looking at me.'

Only at me.

It felt as thrilling as falling into a bathtub filled with drugs, but it wasn't enough to heal his heartache.

'I'm sorry, senpai.'

Because it had been so painful, he was afraid to step foot in that place again.

"Nade..."

Liz watched the departing Nade with a sad expression, but soon smiled.

'Right. I'll be the one to hurt now.'

She finally understood her master's words.

Following the military band's lead, the Magic Association's imposing presence immediately captured the students' attention.

The 18-story building that seemed to pierce the sky blazed in the sunlight, and the top mages that Lufist had so emphasized were standing guard at attention from the entrance.

"This concludes the inspection ceremony. Since you need to submit your exam application forms, please enter in single file."

Passing through the revolving door, Shirone saw the familiar lobby scene.

Due to the large number of students, movement was via stairs, allowing the students to tour a bit more of the Magic Association they had dreamed of so much.

"It's much more impressive than I heard."

It was on a different level from buildings that wealthy nobles made pointlessly large just for show.

"It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it's a concentration of humanity's most advanced technology. This is definitely motivating."

Though Shirone had not only toured but even lived here, his aspirations were no different from the other students.

'It's not a dream anymore.'

There had been times when he worried about surviving and returning from heaven, let alone graduating, but once he submitted his application today, all that remained was the graduation exam.

'It's Flew-senpai.'

Arriving at the Foreign Affairs Management Department, Flew in uniform was standing at attention.

Her professional demeanor showed as she gazed straight ahead without looking at anyone.

Royal Magic School's valedictorian graduate.

Now he could feel firsthand how much blood, sweat, and effort she must have put in to earn that single title.

'Should I greet her?'

As he got closer, his dilemma deepened, when Flew's left hand, which had been behind her back, quietly slipped out.

'Senpai.'

Shirone smiled and gave her a high-five with a slap as he passed by her side.
