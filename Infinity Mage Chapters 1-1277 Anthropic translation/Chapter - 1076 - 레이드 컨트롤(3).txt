Raid Control (3)

The light faded from Ergos's eyes, and its legs embedded in the cave began pulling out one by one.

As it crashed down, shaking the ground, the creatures lost control and began rampaging in all directions.

Screech! Screech!

Unable to receive attack commands, they scattered chaotically before disappearing from sight in an instant.

"Phew."

Letting out a long breath, Shirone looked at the translucent box rotating in front of Ergos's hull.

The reason it hadn't materialized was because priority for item acquisition hadn't been determined yet.

'Michelan.'

Though he didn't know much about high gear, he could instinctively tell this was the item he wanted.

Just as he was about to reach for the antique-looking box, the Mafia group came running over.

"Wait! Wait a minute!"

Dexgamseong approached Shirone's side and stared at the box with an expression of disbelief.

"It's real. It's really legendary grade."

While probability works that way, he couldn't believe it had appeared on their first attempt.

'The only legendary item Ergos gives is Michelan. If we sell this, the money would be...'

Zeros raced through his mind.

'The Western Nation free pass is good, but Michelan is worth much more than that. If we take this...'

Receiving Shirone's gaze, he cleared his throat awkwardly.

"Ahem, money earned from party hunting follows the principle of equal distribution. However, since items can't be divided, they don't materialize until priority is established."

"Priority?"

"There are two methods. Users designate directly, or leave it to chance. Usually the former is used, but when trust is lacking, we draw cards. Higher numbers get priority, and if ownership is forfeited, it passes to the next in line."

"Then designate me as number one. If you help me get Donatello too, I'll give you the Western Nation free pass."

Though that was the original agreement, the Mafia group's expressions couldn't help but sour.

'Did they really think a legendary grade would actually drop?'

They had seen Yahweh2's abilities with their own eyes, but couldn't imagine he could control probability too.

"What? Suddenly don't want to give it up?"

Speaking so bluntly like this, no matter how greedy one might be, their face would naturally burn with shame.

Sona made a gesture of protest.

"No, but honestly! This is the jackpot of all jackpots, and you want to take it all yourself? Isn't that a bit shameless? There should be some reasonable level before making concessions."

Mafia chimed in.

"Ergos was also C-type, pursuit pattern - that's why you could catch it. You can dodge bullets and jump through space, right? With B-type cases, they're defense-oriented, so your attacks wouldn't have made a dent."

"So what do you want to do? I need Michelan, and what do you guys want? Money?"

Fermi would buy it at any price.

"Western Nation free pass plus money. If Donatello drops too, pay us in cash for that as well."

As if it would ever drop.

"Fine. Then let me acquire Michelan first. I'll contact Geumhwaryun when we get out."

Sona spoke up.

"That won't work. We'll hold onto it and return it when you pay up. Geumhwaryun might refuse payment, and there's also the possibility you'll take it and flee to the Eastern Nation."

"That risk applies to anyone."

Mafia sat down with an attitude of 'do your worst.'

"We won't compromise. Choose wisely. If you don't set priority, you can't leave here until you log out."

Having broken their promise and now being persistent, Shirone also abandoned playing nice.

"Fine, then let's do this. Let's decide by probability who gets to take this."

"Huh?"

The Mafia group turned their heads with surprised expressions.

"What's wrong? It's fair, isn't it? The person who draws the highest card gets priority, right?"

"Well, that's true, but..."

It was a 7-to-1 situation.

'Is he serious? We just need one out of seven to place first. No, we just need anyone with a higher card than Yahweh2.'

Mafia stood up.

"Let's accept it. I think that's reasonable too. No objections from anyone else, right?"

Everyone nodded.

"Then Yahweh2, you touch the box. When the priority selection method appears, choose random."

It was like telling him to touch an item he couldn't have, but Shirone pretended not to notice and complied.

When he selected random, card hands appeared in augmented reality and were distributed one to each party member.

"Alright, let's reveal them."

Everyone opened their cards, and Sona clenched her fist and cheered.

"Yes! It's a King!"

"Oh, that's a high card. Congratulations."

The reason her teammates couldn't laugh heartily was probably because they didn't completely trust even Sona.

'This is really cutthroat.'

Clicking his tongue, Shirone stared intently at the card blinking before his eyes.

"What are you doing? Hurry up and open it. We don't have time."

In his concentrated state, Shirone's senses sharpened and the true nature of this world flowed into him.

'Right here.'

Opening the card at the point chosen by quantum signals - his mind - the atmosphere turned ice cold.

"Th-that's an Ace?"

The Mafia group leaned forward as if they couldn't believe their own eyes.

"H-how is it an Ace? Huh? This is an Ace..."

Still thinking he needed them, Shirone acted out an innocent smile.

"Haha! I'm really lucky today, aren't I? At this rate, won't I get Donatello in just one day?"

A system message appeared.

Item acquisition priority has been determined. 1st priority Yahweh2, 2nd priority Sona, 3rd priority...

"Acquire."

The box materialized and wooden glove-shaped parts were placed in Shirone's hands.

'Wood?'

It was an unusual material in High Gear.

"You! That..."

Just as Sona was about to speak, the cave lit up and was covered in pale radiance.

The event has ended.

When vision returned, they were suddenly in front of Ergos's sanctuary.

Sona hurriedly continued speaking.

"You! Don't equip that right now! Once equipped, it becomes untradeable!"

That was a characteristic of legendary items.

"Equip."

"Ah..."

As Shirone defiantly chose to equip it, cracks appeared in Michelan and light burst forth.

With a pop sound, the form was destroyed and particles of light covered Yahweh2's right arm.

"What's this?"

The light disappeared, and a bronze-colored metallic gauntlet had replaced his right hand.

Sona held her head.

'Ah, this is driving me crazy. Bound items don't even drop as loot. Is he really going to run off?'

When good items appeared, it wasn't uncommon to kill the user and obtain their loot.

"But how do you use this?"

Now even such innocent questions seemed like he might be mocking them.

"Sigh, a legendary item at level 100. You should become a ranker before equipping it. What if you get PKed? Won't you regret losing it?"

"Can't help it if that happens. But this..."

As Shirone held out Michelan, the Mafia group showed interest and approached.

It was their first time seeing one in person.

"Legendary items have common traits. First, they're not in metallic form when acquired. Second, they become untradeable once equipped. And third, they perform regardless of output level."

Shirone nodded.

'Performance regardless of output level. So that's why Fermi was obsessed with legendary items.'

"And about Michelan..."

Sona grabbed Michelan with both hands and examined its functions while turning it around.

There was an intaglio lens in the palm.

"Ah, this must be it. From what I heard, Michelan is a photon particle controller. Light has destructive power, they say."

Shirone's eyes narrowed.

'It's a photon cannon.'

After hearing the explanation, Shirone held his palm upward and activated the part, causing the lens to light up.

"Huh? Whoa?"

The Mafia group hastily stepped back and watched the smoke of light gathering above his palm.

"Wow."

The moving light was fascinating, but it didn't seem particularly threatening yet.

Sona pointed at the light and said.

"This is difficult. All legendary items are like this - they don't generate power themselves but manipulate something. Skill matters more than level."

That's why they ignore output levels.

"Hmm, I see."

As Shirone swirled the light smoke to get familiar with the sensation, Mafia clicked his tongue and said.

"That's why I told you not to equip it. Now you can't hand it over to a guild, so what will you do? Still, you absolutely must pay..."

At that moment, everyone's eyes widened.

'Something like this, I suppose.'

As he recalled the sensation of the photon cannon, the light smoke began compressing into a sphere instantly.

"Wh-what is that?"

The thoroughly agitated light looked ready to explode at any moment.

"I compressed the light. I don't know the principle in High Gear, but anyway like this..."

As Shirone thrust Michelan forward with a firing motion, a flash struck a distant rock directly.

BOOOOOOM!

A thunderous roar erupted, and the wind's shockwave rushed in, revealing the deeply cratered ground.

"My god."

Everyone's mouths gaped open.

"Light exploded? That's a missile!"

While power would vary depending on compression precision, having no ammunition constraints was an enormous advantage.

Shirone clenched his fist.

'Perfect. I got one.'

It was a blade that could stab an Operator.

The Mafia group, still staring at the destroyed area, hastily fixed their expressions.

"Anyway, congratulations. Your skills seem solid. So now only settlement remains, right? Will you contact Geumhwaryun now?"

"No. Settlement is after we find Donatello too. Let's hurry to the next hunting ground."

Dexgamseong shouted.

"Hey! How can that be? You want us to stay together until Donatello drops, whenever that might be?"

"That was the original agreement. You've broken everything so far, so at least keep this one. Otherwise, I'm nullifying the settlement too."

"Ugh!"

Now the Mafia group was at a disadvantage.

'Damn! We're really trapped. If this guy flees to the Eastern Nation, we get nothing.'

Sona made a tearful face and asked.

"You'll really settle when we find Donatello, right? We're making this promise here and now, okay?"

'They break promises like eating meals.'

Though he grumbled internally, the initiative had already passed to Shirone.

'I don't want to clash with other Western Nation users either.'

Having made his decision, Shirone equipped a booster from selective options and said.

"Fine. Let's return to Democracy for now. I'll wait where the mid gear is."

Activating the booster, rocket engines ignited and Yahweh2's craft shot into the sky.

"...He left."

The moment he departed without looking back, their hearts sank as they faced reality.

"Damn! I thought he was naive, but he's vicious. Wait, he didn't run away, did he?"

Dexgamseong gritted his teeth and said.

"He said he'd wait at the mid gear, so we have to trust him. Just settling Michelan alone would let us upgrade our parts several levels. We can't give up here."

"Really? Even Donatello too?"

As sighs leaked out from various places, Sona activated her booster and said.

"Let's depart first. Our output is higher, so if we chase now, we won't lose him."

Hearing this, everyone flew up at full speed.

RRRRRRRRRR!

At the roar, Shirone looked back and confirmed the Mafia group following far behind.

'That's what you get for not being sincere.'

His tongue stuck out slightly.
