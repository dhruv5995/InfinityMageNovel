Biological Program (1)

The Kingdom of Tormia.

A nameless village in the Sanperos region.

"Faster! Please go faster!"

A single carriage was racing down a treacherous mountain path at a terrifying speed.

Its sleek exterior was designed purely for mobility, with a medical equipment wagon hitched behind.

The carriage wheels hit a rock and bounced up, causing the medical staff inside to brace themselves against the walls.

"The road is too rough! At this speed we'll...!"

Before the coachman could finish his sentence, Seriel emerged from the cabin, pulling back the curtain.

"It's fine! Please go at maximum speed!"

The coachman gritted his teeth and whipped the reins, and finally a shabby village came into view beyond the mountain pass.

Though it wasn't completely nameless since it belonged to the Kingdom of Tormia's territory, the village was currently in a state of complete lockdown.

Three days ago, reports came in of an unknown disease causing mutations among the residents, and this was exactly what Seriel had been looking for.

"We've arrived!"

The door burst open with a bang, and a white-haired man and Seriel jumped out as if diving into water.

Behind them, medical staff from the World Health Organization hurriedly began gathering their medical equipment.

Tenos, the department head of molecular biology, was a cantankerous-looking man with silver-white hair.

"Where are the mutants?"

Soldiers in protective suits were guarding the entrance.

"They're all dead except for one remaining. But his condition is very poor."

"Move aside!"

As they pushed past the soldiers and entered, the medical officers shouted.

"You can't! Without proper epidemiological investigation, forced entry is..."

"Seriel! Follow me in!"

"Yes!"

Seriel, receiving an equipment bag from the medical staff, followed Tenos into the village.

"What should we do? If there's contamination..."

The commander gave his orders.

"Damn it! Seal the entrance for now. Any villagers attempting to escape are to be shot on sight!"

As the army loaded their crossbows, the World Health Organization medical staff filed in one after another.

In the village of 300 households, corpses were scattered here and there, and the survivors' eyes were filled with terror.

"Save us! Please let us go!"

As if emerging from a hellish swamp, people reached out their hands toward Seriel.

But she didn't even blink as she headed deeper into the village.

There too, corpses were piled up.

'The mutation range is larger than expected.'

Could those things really still be called human?

There were those whose arms and legs had transformed into insect parts, as well as corpses whose entire bodies had mimicked animals.

"Chief! Seriel!"

She snapped to attention and looked toward the hut where she heard the department head's voice.

"Yes!"

Going inside, she saw a man whose skin had become pale to the point of transparency, tied to a bed.

"Kraa! Kraaaaah!"

Though he had already lost his reason and his eyes couldn't focus, his sense of fear remained intact.

"He hasn't mutated yet! Extract it!"

The medical staff tore off all the man's clothes, and Seriel climbed on top of him.

"Kraaaaah! Kraaaaah!"

She pressed down on his solar plexus with both hands to stop his struggling and quickly examined the man's entire body.

'Where is it? Where?'

The point where the parasite mutates the host's body never exceeds a 20-centimeter radius from the initial injection site.

'Found it!'

Seriel's eyes widened as she discovered the injection wound on the man's chest.

'Damn it! It's the heart!'

There was a high probability of full-body mutation.

"Scalpel!"

The moment the medical staff handed her the scalpel, the man's upper body shook even more violently.

"Kraak! S-save... me...!"

Human language that sent chills down the spine.

Seriel bit her lips and mercilessly cut across the man's chest with the scalpel.

"Aaaaaaah!"

Blood spurted up with a splash, creating red spots on Seriel's face like brush strokes.

She didn't close her eyes, but fortunately the blood didn't get in her eyes.

However, it was still unknown how the parasite infected other organisms.

"Aaaah!"

Seriel, who had thrust her hand into the man's heart, felt something with a different texture and pulled it out.

Like a cancerous mass, the squishy cellular matter writhed roughly as if alive.

"Extracted!"

When the medical staff threw the parasite into a metal box they had prepared, cellular tendrils spread out like whiskers.

'It's almost pure instinct.'

The moment she confirmed this, the medical staff closed the box, and Seriel hurriedly performed emergency treatment.

"I'll cast healing magic."

Tenos nodded and locked the box.

"Please! Please!"

Seriel's healing magic was well-regarded at the World Health Organization, but it could only heal wounds.

The man, whose vitality had already been completely drained by the parasite, looked up at Seriel and moved his lips.

"Doc... Doctor..."

"Don't speak. Recovery is the priority right now."

"...I had a dream."

The man had the expression of someone who had accepted death, and as far as Seriel knew, such cases were unique.

"My body was burning with pain, but suddenly the agony disappeared. Was that you, Doctor?"

"It's probably thanks to extracting the parasite. You can live. Just stay conscious a little longer."

"A light was pulling me, and then my eyes opened."

The man recalled his dream.

"A wonderful fragrance and comfortable sensations. Things that someone as poor as me could never experience."

Seriel no longer tried to stop him.

'This man too...'

The mutant reports being collected from around the world had something in common.

"Then this thought came into my head. Ah, I'm rich. Everything up until now was just a dream."

Tears flowed down the man's cheeks.

"But actually, that was the dream. Yes, I'm a poor person."

"What did you see in that dream?"

Though she was still casting healing magic, the man's life force wasn't returning.

"A hazy sky. It might have been a glass window. Beyond that sky, something was looking down at me."

"What was it?"

"I don't know. I couldn't see it well. Something small and grayish... Then suddenly the sky opened..."

The next moment he came to his senses, he was here.

"That was a dream. I was rich. No, this must be the dream. Doctor, I want to go back."

As the tearful man cried out in anguish, Seriel grabbed his face.

"Stay conscious! Your wounds are already healed! You can live!"

"No! It's all fake! Everything...! Huk!"

The man's lungs suddenly inflated, his pupils rolled upward, and he stopped breathing.

Though Seriel performed resuscitation, the man's body temperature was rapidly cooling.

"That's enough, Chief. Stop. Write the report."

Seriel's head dropped.

"Mutant case B-38. Life functions fully recovered after extraction of parasite Argones, but deceased. Cause of death is..."

Seriel slowly raised her face, her eyes flashing.

"Presumed... suicide."

As the medical staff quickly recorded this, Seriel climbed down from the bed and gave instructions.

"According to international agreement, the World Health Organization will handle the mutant's remains. Proceed discretely. This matter must not become public yet."

The temple would announce this fact only after Fisho's funeral was over.

As Seriel exited, Tenos was outside the hut lighting a cigarette.

"Good work."

When he handed her the lit cigarette, Seriel took it and inhaled deeply.

"...Why do they die?"

Tenos remained silent.

"The recovery was definitely perfect. No wounds, and their biological functions, metabolism—nothing was wrong. So how can a person just die?"

"Well. From emptiness?"

"Can a person just die from feeling empty?"

"You shouldn't say 'just die.'"

Tenos lit his own cigarette.

"You know how it is sometimes? When you feel like there's nothing left even if you live your life. Good memories, bad memories—once they pass, they're just brain signals."

His finger with the cigarette pointed forward.

"We say we live in the present for the future, but in the end, only the past remains. Living intensely just to keep that one memory in your head is inefficient."

"I didn't know you had such thoughts."

Tenos shrugged.

"I'm speaking theoretically. Living reality means living sensations. But sensations are a kind of impulse. Can we call that life? And the moment we perceive something, it's already the past."

Cigarette smoke streamed out in a long trail.

"Past, present, future—humans exist in none of these places. The only thing that truly exists in this world is emptiness."

"That's Buddhist philosophy."

Tenos smiled slightly.

"I tried imitating Buddha, but I don't really know. If humans are nothing more than external signals, it's no different from dreaming. Is it really suicide? Maybe they realized there's no substance here."

"Do you want to call it enlightenment? Near-death experiences are personal experiences. They can't be scientifically proven."

"...That's why you need to find out."

Tenos dropped his cigarette.

"Fisho's choice was right. It was fortunate that among his classmates was one of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars. Even the temple won't be able to access classified information by betraying the Ivory Tower. Go. Find out exactly what Fisho discovered."

Of course, that was her intention.

"Understood."

"A carriage will be too slow. Use spatial movement. You can depart right after quarantine at the branch office."

"All personnel participating in the Argones Project must move according to the route designated by headquarters."

"I'll take responsibility. The restrictions will be lifted tomorrow anyway. Don't worry about this place and focus entirely on Creas."

Since this was what Seriel wanted as well, she bowed her head and cast spatial movement magic.

"I'll be back."

A roar split the sky.

The day of Fisho's funeral.

Creas City Cemetery was bustling with famous figures from all walks of life since morning.

"There really are a lot of people."

Having spent a long time at the magic school, a considerable crowd had gathered around the Alpheus Magic School banner.

But elsewhere, she could see figures who seemed to have no connection to Fisho at all.

Dorothy said, "This definitely isn't just an ordinary funeral. Let's not let our guard down and keep an eye on the situation."

Arin asked, "Are you saying a fight might break out?"

"Not necessarily, but..."

Sabina poked her in the ribs.

"Come on, just tell us. You must know everything since you heard it from your boyfriend. Why are we being like this among ourselves?"

At the word "boyfriend," Dorothy's face turned red.

"I-I don't know either. Iruki didn't tell me anything. He just said it might be dangerous."

Closer pointed with his finger.

"Over there."

Alpheus, the headmaster of the magic school, and Olivia, the vice-principal, were talking with students.

"Headmaster!"

When the excavation team including Dorothy greeted him, Alpheus smiled kindly.

"You came. Thank you."

"Of course we had to come. But the atmosphere seems a bit strange. Is something wrong?"

"It's because of Fisho's will. There seems to be some problem we don't know about. There was even a protest a little while ago."

"What? A protest?"

When Dorothy turned her head, she saw officials from foreign countries arguing with temple representatives.

"This is unreasonable. Do you know how much investment the Miel Kingdom has made in the temple?"

"Please understand. As I've said repeatedly, neither the Ultra-Creature Research Institute nor the temple has the authority to disclose the will."

"But that doesn't make any sense...!"

Just as the official was about to cause another scene in his inability to contain his anger, a knight pointed to the entrance.

"Ambassador, over there."

As if those words were a signal, hundreds of people fell silent simultaneously.

"One of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars."

The person to whom Fisho had granted sole access rights—Shirone was entering with Amy.
