Dark Organization (5)

"Let's wash up first. If we go like this, there won't be a single restaurant that'll accept us."

Nade, who had barely escaped from Pena's cloak, spoke, but there was no proper place to wash.

"I have a good idea."

Entering a deserted area, Sirone used Material's ability to create a makeshift bathhouse.

Pena's eyes widened.

"How did you do that?"

"It's an ability I have. Corcoras doesn't use points, so things like this are possible."

The explanation was brief, but Pena didn't mind.

"I'll be right back!"

From inside the bathhouse she entered came the sound of her gulping down water.

When Sirone's face turned pale, Iruki asked.

"What's wrong? With your ability, a bathhouse like this should be nothing."

"Yeah. That's true, but..."

The aftereffects of constructing the Sirone Sphere on the sun side were being transmitted.

Since simultaneous events weren't divisions, any Sirone could exist at 100 percent.

'But Armand isn't me. I cover it with mental strength, but there are limits to what's available.'

As the silence lengthened, Iruki realized.

'Something serious is happening.'

The reason he couldn't dig deeper was because knowing wouldn't necessarily mean he could help.

'We experience Melkidu, but to Sirone, it's just one event.' Even now, he would be controlling everything.

'Hang in there, Sirone.'

At Iruki's silent pat on his back, Sirone felt his heart swell with emotion.

'Thank you.'

They probably wouldn't know.

Among countless simultaneous events, this was the only place where he could smile.

It wasn't because his friends were strong, nor because Melkidu was more comfortable than other places.

'It's okay to fail.'

To his friends, he wasn't the infinite mage, one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower, or Yahweh who bears responsibility for humanity's fate...

'Just Sirone.'

He was simply Sirone, a fellow graduate of Alpheas Magic School.

'Sometimes sensitive, sometimes stubbornly silent, but my friends don't see me differently.'

It was probably because they even understood the reasons.

With his heart at ease for the first time in a while, Pena came out of the bathhouse, shaking her hair.

"Now I feel alive. Let's go quickly. I'm hungry."

Sirone smiled.

"Yes."

Sirone's group entered a nearby restaurant.

"What happened to Curtis?" Pena, who had been wolfing down food, started coughing and gulped down water.

"Oh, that. It worked out well. That guy must have been quite the big shot. His crimes were so serious that instead of going elsewhere, he was locked up in the capital Parme's prison. It's the highest-grade prison."

It didn't sound like things worked out well.

"Thanks to that, I avoided some trouble too. But... thinking about meeting you guys made my stomach turn. I could have just stayed in the capital, but there was no way to contact you. I reluctantly used Despondency to come here."

Sirone consoled her.

"You didn't lose out. We had to come here anyway. There seems to be a purchase hint here."

"Really? Hmm, well. If a dark organization really exists, there's no place more fitting than here. I watched from a pile of trash, and it was really no joke."

"What did you see?"

"Corpse dismantling. I thought they were cutting pork. They butchered bodies without batting an eye. But thanks to that, I got some information. About the three major gangs."

Pena's explanation was similar to what they had heard, but the information was updated to the latest.

"The side that seized the supply materials coming into Corcoras this time was the Johan Cartel. So the Desperado organization seems to be plotting something big. A major war is going to break out."

Sirone stood up.

"Good, then let's go to the Johan Cartel. The side that seized the supplies must have made contact with the dark organization."

"Ugh, Johan Cartel..."

Pena, who was about to say something, shook her head.

"Right! Let's go! None of the three major gangs seem normal anyway. The problem is how to find their hideout. The resistance won't be easy."

Nade, who had finished paying, returned.

"Damn. Just eating this cost a bonanza. Let's go out and take them down one by one."

Leaving the shop, Sirone's group saw the three major gangs blocking the entrance.

A man pointed a machine gun at them.

"Time to choose, isn't it? We're not very patient."

Nade, who had been examining their faces, turned to his friends with a smile.

"This just got much easier."

While his other friends also smiled, only Pena was trembling with fear.

Johan Cartel.

A monastery with a solemn atmosphere, unsuitable for gunfire, was their headquarters.

"New recruit?"

In a dimly lit area, a woman in nun's clothing was tilting a wine glass.

The Johan Cartel's boss, Aria.

"Yes, sister. He hasn't been through any other organizations."

Among the gathered gang executives, a man in his mid-twenties bowed his head.

"Hello! I'm called Boto! I'll serve you with all my heart and soul from now on!"

"How will you serve me?"

"Pardon?"

"How will you serve me? Don't make me ask twice."

"Ah, well..."

Unable to handle Aria's intense gaze, Boto averted his eyes to a shelf.

He saw underwear with male genitalia attached, whips, and dog collars connected with chains.

When Aria snapped her fingers, Boto's gaze returned to its place.

"Listen well. Johan Cartel is the most prestigious organization in Melkidu. It's the only place that directly follows the will of Cain, Melkidu's founder. Since ancient times, we've controlled Melkidu, allowing our brothers in reality to remain strong."

"Yes."

"But at some point, Red Union, Desperado, and other nobodies started coming in and causing trouble. I don't like it. You understand what I mean?"

"Don't worry. I was quite notorious outside too. My hands are itching for action."

Then came a knock.

"Boss, we've brought those guys."

"Come in."

After checking Sirone's group's faces, Aria muttered with a rotten expression.

"Fucking annoying."

Guys qualitatively different from gangs.

"So, you've been causing quite a stir, huh? Are you cops? Or looking for someone?"

Sirone said.

"Tell us about the dark organization. We want to enter the Core through the back door."

"Ah..."

Aria's eyes became hazy.

"Back door. Nice."

"Kekeke!"

When Boto couldn't contain his laughter at realizing the meaning, the executives turned their heads.

"Hmm, sorry."

Aria, who had been watching him expressionlessly, put down her wine glass and stood up from her chair.

"Come here."

As Boto awkwardly approached, Aria pressed against him and grabbed his wrist.

"Big, big sister."

"Why? You like this kind of thing."

She lifted her nun's habit skirt and guided Boto's hand to the inside of her thigh.

"Touch this. That's right. Hold it tight."

Looking down, Boto discovered a dagger gripped in reverse in his hand.

"Um, why is this...?"

Before he could finish speaking, Aria moved Boto's hand to stab the dagger into his abdomen.

"Huk!"

Though he reflexively pushed away, the blade was already two-thirds inserted.

"Aaaah! Knife! This is a knife!"

As he staggered backward, Aria grabbed a bottle and swung her arm in a full swing.

The bottle exploded with a bang, and Boto collapsed.

"Uaaaah! Uaaaah!"

Blood spurted from his head, and the blade that tore through his stomach burned like fire.

"My stomach, my stomach! There's a knife in my stomach...!"

"Keke. Then pull it out, you bastard."

As the executives kicked his abdomen like they were playing, Boto flailed his limbs.

"No! Agh! I'm dying! Ah! Ah! Please save me!"

Aria waved her hand.

"Shut up. Take him out quickly."

As Boto was dragged out by his legs, the wooden door closed with a bang.

"Phew, right."

Sitting back down, Aria asked.

"Back doors are my specialty. Among the three major gangs, no one can penetrate them better than me."

The creator of Melkidu's system was presumed to be Cain, humanity's first murderer.

Of course, the truth would be in the Core, but Johan Cartel had followed his will for ages.

In reality, and in Melkidu.

"In short, you came to the right place. But what can you do for me?"

"Nothing."

"Huh?"

Sirone said.

"We won't do anything. I think this is sufficient as a deal condition."

Emotion disappeared from Aria's face again.

"Do you know what a gang is?"

"I don't want to know."

No matter how evil someone was, he was disgusted by the sight of cruelly tormenting a colleague.

"No one here is afraid of guns. Why? The moment you cower in fear, you're buried. You just pull the trigger. The one who shoots first survives."

He understood the feelings of the Beach Ronin.

"It's like a holdem game. Even if you get AA in your hand, if your opponent goes all-in, you get scared. Those without guts die, and only those with guts call."

"What's your point?"

When Sirone's tone became fierce upon sensing killing intent, madness flashed in Aria's eyes.

"All-in, you bastard."

A machine gun was suddenly in Aria's hands, and all the gang members fired at Sirone.

Gunshots deafened the ears, and flames flickered in the dark lighting.

Pena covered her ears and crouched.

"Ugh, uaaaah!"

She thought she was doomed, but no matter how much time passed, she felt no pain.

Slowly opening one eye, she saw an unbelievable sight and sat up.

"What, what is this!"

As the gang members who realized the same thing stopped shooting one by one, only the ringing in their ears remained.

"Who are you?"

Smoke of light spreading from Sirone's center was holding all 700 bullets.

"Call."

The next moment, the bullets returned to all gang members with the same direction and speed they were fired.

"Hueok!"

As the bullets stopped in front of their foreheads and spun at tremendous speed, the gangsters trembled.

Sirone said.

"No one's afraid of guns? No, they just can't see what's visible. How about now? A little scared?"

It was true.

"This is your last chance. The last chance for me to do nothing. Decide."

Aria bit her lip.

"Fuck."

At the same time, the bullets that stopped spinning all fell to the floor with heavy sounds.

"Haa. Haa."

As his subordinates collapsed one by one, Aria was grateful she was sitting in a chair.

'Oh Cain.'

Was it really the truth?

Lord Cain, who realized the efficiency of evil through the first murder, created Melkidu's system. He gave hope to humanity. The hope that any mistake could be forgiven.

As pure blood of Johan Cartel, she had heard much from the previous nun.

We kill people and plunder wealth. The world calls it crime, but we call it sacred acts. Evil is much more powerful than good, much purer, and the truth that dwells in humanity's deepest places.

The nuns of Johan Cartel must enter Melkidu and manage Corcoras.

But Aria, evil is strong, but its limits are also clear. It must always hide in darkness and must not yearn for light.

Why?

She didn't understand at the time.

Why can't we shine? Didn't Lord Cain give hope to all sinners?

The final message.

Instead of persuading, the previous nun continued.

It's a secret Johan Cartel must protect until the end, so you must never forget.

When leaving Melkidu, Cain reportedly left these words:

There is no sanctuary for demons.
