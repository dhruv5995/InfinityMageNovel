The Tomb of Information (2)

It was a nightmare from the very beginning.

'Is this the influence of Dream Star?'

It wasn't easy for anxiety to settle into Yahweh's mind. It was probably a chemical reaction in the brain.

"Even so, this is a bit..."

As he raised his body, countless corpses were forming walls and approaching from the horizon's edge.

"Hoooooo!"

The corpses dragging their dried-up entrails cried out in unison as they approached.

"Yahweh, do you know those who died because of you? Do you know those you failed to save?"

Sirone's guilt.

Behind the ideal of saving humanity, there were people dying right now.

All life ends in death.

The words he had heard from Fermi before taking Dream Star seemed to have remained in his subconscious.

"You suffer too. Our pain, our resentment!"

Even as the corpses approached with hostility, Sirone didn't move.

'This kind of dream.'

He wanted to lessen his guilt even a little by being torn apart by them.

"What are you doing?"

Fermi appeared among the rotting corpses and looked around Sirone's dream with interest.

"Hmm, I thought you just went around with stern eyes like an old man, but you have unexpectedly tender spots?"

"Don't talk nonsense. This is your doing, isn't it? What kind of drug did you give me?"

"Even if you say that, it's the next-generation Dream Star improved by the best drug designer. Fear and eros have clear purposes, so address matching is easy."

The moment Sirone recognized Fermi's words, the forms of the corpses became even more distinct.

Of course, he hadn't felt they were blurry before either, but everything had been a work of the mind.

"Uuuuu... Uuuuuu!"

Through their tattered clothes, glimpses of breasts and genitals could be seen.

When Sirone made a disgusted expression, Fermi shrugged his shoulders as if he understood.

"When two things mix, this happens."

Sirone turned his gaze away.

"So... what do I need to do now? Under Coder is outside Drimo's boundary."

"Nothing. Just wait until Dream Star is completely absorbed in your stomach. When your brain is half-awakened, the dream will collapse, and then we'll go to Under Coder."

It was a simple method, but the problem was that the waiting place was a nightmare.

The corpses that had approached close by were baring their teeth and watching for opportunities.

The reason they couldn't attack immediately was because Sirone's mind was blocking the development of events.

Stopping the progression of dreams was impossible even for professional divers.

Fermi smiled with his eyes.

"You've changed a lot, that freshman kid."

Magic school days.

"We fought a lot back then. You were so countrified then, but now you're the Messiah who will save humanity."

"I don't want to talk about that with you."

"There's nothing else to do anyway, right? Time concepts get all mixed up in dreams. If you immerse yourself, it's faster than reality, but like this, we don't know how long we'll have to wait."

Fermi said, looking to the side.

"It reminds me of the senior class survival test. Trapped in ice water, cut by blades... Did we go up to the 7th stage then? Ah, I withdrew at the 6th stage."

"Grrrrrr!"

The corpses moved one step closer.

"Actually, I thought you would die at the 7th stage. If I had known you would pass, I would have followed to the end."

"What are you trying to say?"

"Just... I guess I feel somewhat wronged? Anyway, I'm a loser, but this is inside a dream."

Fermi extended his hand.

"I thought maybe it could be undone."

At the same time as feeling an eerie killing intent, the corpses rushed at Sirone.

"Kraaaaa!"

The escape route was in the air, but he would be intercepted by Fermi's attack if he flew up.

'Explosion.'

The corpses caught in the explosion of light were torn apart, and flesh flew dozens of meters.

In the opened field of vision, Fermi caught a chip made through a depreciation deal and put it in his mouth.

"Let's have some fun."

Unorthodox Formula - Unmanned Sniper.

The next moment, hundreds of bullets fired from 374 places in the air shot toward Sirone.

'So it's a railgun.'

The speed of bullets accelerated through electromagnetic fields would be impossible for even an archmage to react to.

"Ugh!"

Hand of God swept up Sirone at the same time the bullets crashed into the ground.

The shockwave shook the earth's axis.

"Kraaaaa!"

Sirone stood intact where the corpses' flesh was falling like hail.

"Hmm, haven't seen that before? Some kind of... technique of the mind?"

Looking up at the giant hand of light floating in the air, Fermi smiled.

His eyes were friendly.

"So you deceive my mind like a law. Good ability. But it won't work twice."

"Really?"

Sirone, feeling genuine killing intent, also responded sincerely.

"Shall we try it once?"

When Hand of God spread its palm toward the air, a giant photon cannon was created.

Ultra-high-speed bullets and a powerful cannon.

Even in the critical situation, Fermi was calmly observing Hand of God.

'He used scale to transcend the limits of power. It's typical of Sirone, but...'

He faced forward again.

"If it were me, I would have developed that earlier deception technique more. No matter how strong the power, there's always an escape route. On the other hand, that technique can subdue enemies 100 percent if the situation aligns. It has the weakness of becoming weaker on the second use, but that's also the charm of tricks, isn't it?"

Sirone frowned.

"What does it matter to you what magic I research? Mind your own magic."

"Hehe, well, you're right."

Fermi turned around, and shortly after, the earth vibrated and cracks began to appear in the scenery.

The dream was collapsing.

"Time flows quickly when you're immersed. Now the drug seems to be taking effect. Let's get going."

Sirone released Hand of God but couldn't erase his unpleasant feelings.

"So you deliberately picked a fight?"

"Well, killing two birds with one stone."

He was a person whose inner thoughts were impossible to read.

The two people dissolved into light in Under Coder and arrived at the middle layer following the blue line.

In a room with countless mirrors, Sirone asked.

"Where are we going?"

"The Abyss. The tomb of information and the terminus of the world. That's why it's also called Apocalypse. Should be familiar to you?"

He had heard that discarded information was restored to forge Sirone's signature.

After leaving the middle layer, they placed their hands on the mirror leading to The Abyss.

As the boundary reversed, the world of Apocalypse rushed rapidly into Sirone's eyes.

"This is...?"

When Sirone looked down from the high ground with a blank expression, Fermi asked.

"Why? Surprised because it's different from your expectations?"

It certainly was.

'Miro said Apocalypse was a place that implemented a destroyed future world. But this...'

The entire landscape visible to the eye was covered with a mucus-like substance of unknown origin.

"Is that thing called Mucus?"

"Yes. Since we left the photon system, Apocalypse has been completely covered with Mucus. Investigation results show that over 98 percent of the ground is mucus."

Fermi pointed around.

"As you know, The Abyss is the terminus of information. It's the scene of the end implemented based on the real world. I think this predicts Cell Buster in reality."

Sirone was quite surprised.

"How do you know all that information? Even in Omega's logs, those are very old records."

"As time passes, even a king's secret diary ends up in bookstores. You're also revealing it to me right now, aren't you? So in the future, won't many more people know?"

"The future?"

At that moment, he realized.

"Don't tell me... you?"

What an audacious thought.

"Yes. In The Abyss, the future is endlessly deposited. Therefore, the longer an object has existed here, the nearer future it becomes in our reality. Then couldn't we predict events that haven't happened yet? I call this time mining."

Sirone blinked.

"From then on, I investigated Apocalypse thoroughly. I even picked up things like scraps of paper abandoned deep in the mountains. But those are information from a future that hasn't happened in reality yet."

The irony that trash here becomes gold in reality.

"I collected all such information to predict and prepare for events that would happen in the future. Emotional illness was one of them. Of course, the reason you decided to make a deal with me was also after hearing this explanation from me."

"I understand."

Sirone gained confidence in his judgment at that time.

"I won't ask about the deal. But how did you collect all that information? Even if it's trash, information containing the near future would be hard to find."

Fermi blew his bangs with a puff.

"I really struggled. Trying to do it alone didn't work. So I hired them, the entire Parrot Mercenary Group."

"You mean Sister Marsha is here?"

Fermi smiled and pointed with his thumb at the lowlands covered with Mucus.

"Want to go see?"

The place they arrived at by flying through the sky was the center of a city where a giant excavator was installed.

While the mercenary group's executives sat on iron boxes drinking, Marsha was next to the excavator.

Fermi walked over with his hands behind his back.

"How's it going?"

"Huh? Fermi, what brings you here..."

Marsha stopped speaking when she spotted Sirone, then immediately showed delight and shouted.

"Hey, Sirone! Everyone! Come here. A celebrity has arrived!"

Although they were now a mercenary group dealing with the world, Sirone's appearance still caused quite a stir.

"If it's Sirone, that's Yahweh, right? Vice-captain, didn't you say you once fought with that guy?"

Freeman, still without eyebrows, leaned his arm on a box and said while holding a bottle to his mouth.

"...I didn't exactly fight him."

Marsha expressed her joy by ruffling Sirone's hair.

"This guy! How did you become even more handsome than before? Men really need to have power, right?"

Marsha had the talent of making any words feel comfortable.

"You're still the same. Are you doing well?"

"Ha! Me? Well, I'm dying doing work that's not in my destiny. Detective work, grave robbing, and now even construction. Who would have known I'd actually be mining after singing mining songs?"

Marsha's face looked more haggard than before, but her eyes sparkled like a child's.

"Are you using this machine to pierce through the Mucus?"

"Yeah. We're taking a break right now though. It's probably useless anyway. Even when we pierce through, it regenerates."

Fermi asked.

"If it's thick enough to make even the tallest buildings disappear, that's considerable depth. Have you tried going all the way down?"

"There's a record of hitting a solid stratum this morning at dawn. It seems to be around the 480-meter point."

Sirone's eyes widened greatly.

"480 meters?"

Marsha knocked on the excavator.

"It's accumulated tremendously. In this state, even if we pierce through and go down, exploration would be impossible. Most importantly..."

The Mucus at their feet wriggled and stretched like tentacles, wrapping around Marsha's legs and climbing up.

Just as the tip of the tentacle hardened like a needle and shot up, Marsha roughly grabbed it.

"This sticky thing is annoying me to death. Anyway, it knows what's pretty. This guy is definitely male."

Freeman approached.

"It's because you're near the excavator. It seems to instinctively detect targets that attack it."

"Freeman."

Before Sirone could exchange greetings, Marsha threw the tentacle to the ground and snapped.

"Shut up. Then you should be nearby. All you do all day is drink. Profanity."

"Profanity?"

Freeman explained.

"Her mouth got so foul that the subordinates voted. For now, Marsha is banned from swearing."

"Hmph! Do you think that can stop me? Profanity, you bastard! I'll just profanity the profanity and tear it apart."

"...Haha."

Sirone made a bewildered expression.

'They really live interestingly.'
