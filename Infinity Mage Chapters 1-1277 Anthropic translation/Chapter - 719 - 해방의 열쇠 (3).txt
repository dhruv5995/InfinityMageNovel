[719] Key to Liberation (3)

Labyrinth Jessica.

In the giant city divided into 10 final levels, Jin Seong-eum had arrived at the boundary of the 6th level.

It was an achievement that even renowned organizations couldn't accomplish after 10 years of preparation, and the 200 members of the Volcano Expedition who had already secured this area felt their pride wounded.

"Form an encirclement! Don't give them any chance to counterattack!"

Their skills were undoubtedly the best in the industry, holding humanity's highest exploration record in Jessica, one of the world's three great labyrinths.

"Princess! It's dangerous... Urgh!"

The members of Sambo scattered in all directions as thermal flash cannons rained down from the sky.

'Damn! Ancient weapons!'

The shoulder armor equipped by Volcano was an ancient weapon called Kit, which fired thermal flash cannons from its central lens.

'What's even more annoying is the gravity collapse.'

The area was devastated as nearly 100 Volcano members flew through the sky, bombarding everything.

'I need to find the Princess! I have to protect her!'

The ancient weapons buried here weren't primitive technology like the Signa or Exd used by the citizens of heaven.

As phenomena impossible to implement with modern technology threatened Seong-eum, Mun-gyeong's heart raced.

Though evaluated as having the greatest combat ability among the Ivory Tower candidates, her actual combat experience was severely lacking.

Having spent most of her life in the imperial palace, it was uncertain whether she could hold her own against these seasoned combat professionals.

"Princess!"

Breaking through the smoke, Mun-gyeong discovered Seong-eum standing alone in the heart of Volcano's enemy formation.

'When did she get all the way there...?'

She had clearly jumped in herself, and it was a mistake.

"Now's our chance! Finish her!"

As all 200 members rose into the sky simultaneously and unleashed their thermal flash cannons at Seong-eum, Mun-gyeong felt dizzyingly terrified.

'No! That's...!'

Having followed Seong-eum her entire life, even from a distance, Mun-gyeong knew she had never faced attacks faster than her senses could perceive.

"It's over!"

Just as a Volcano executive shouted, a quiet light rippled in Seong-eum's eyes.

Ether Wave

Great Melody.

"Wh-what is that?"

The flashes curved naturally like objects moving along rails, then rotated while sweeping around Seong-eum in a large circle.

Seong-eum lifted one corner of her mouth slightly.

"...I'll give you up to 2 steps."

As she extended both hands, all the grandly swirling flashes gathered between her palms.

The world's landscape became tangled like a mess of threads, distorting chaotically before finally rippling with natural colors.

"Ahhh."

In the spatial entanglement that human minds couldn't analyze, Mun-gyeong felt as if she had lost even her sense of life's direction.

'That is... the Princess's, Jin Seong-eum's 2nd step.'

She could never enter it.

'No, it would be the same for anyone else. It's not a realm where humans can set foot.'

"Fluctuation of the Great Melody."

As Seong-eum spread her arms, the particles of the thermal flash cannons began seeping into the landscape like osmosis.

"D-dodge!"

Though Volcano's leader shouted, he and his members already intuited it.

'We can't dodge.'

Because directionality doesn't exist in Seong-eum's space.

"Urgh!"

As intense heat struck the sky, all 200 members evaporated instantly without leaving a drop of blood.

"I should leave one alive."

Seong-eum extended her hand toward the leader who had lost control of his Kit and was flying about erratically.

Leaping across space to grab his ankle and drag him down, the leader's body crashed into the ground at tremendous speed.

"Ahhhhh!"

Approaching him as he writhed with broken legs, Seong-eum hid her expression and asked.

"Tell me everything you know."

The leader glared at her while shedding tears of blood.

Labyrinth Pytharos.

In the labyrinth where the laws of seven different sins formed layers of varying density, Nane had arrived at the final layer.

"Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!"

Listening to the demons' cries would drive any human insane, but...

'Why do we suffer?'

They too had once been human.

'If pain and happiness cannot be exchanged equivalently, shouldn't there be no reason to exist in the first place?'

Nane never walked quickly, yet he arrived at the labyrinth's destination before any other candidate.

Pytharos's only exit: the Gate of Annihilation.

The moment one passed through that door, time would stop and only the eternal continuation of nothingness would remain.

"Please take us too! Please end the suffering of these pitiful beings! We beg you!"

Nevertheless, countless demons crawled across the floor, bowing their heads at Nane's feet and pleading.

They too had experienced all seven layers of hell on their way down, so they knew what kind of being Nane was.

"Poor sentient beings..."

Nane looked at the demons with pitying eyes.

"A human?"

The masters of the other world guarding the Gate of Annihilation approached, striking iron plates with their massive feet.

Horns grew wildly like tree vines, and their muscular flesh bulged reddish as if to incite the demons' lust.

"Remarkable. To have passed through all seven hells yet still not lose yourself."

Nane extended his hand and gave a command.

"Demons, open the door and save the sentient beings."

Passing through the Gate of Annihilation into the world of nothingness was the last refuge remaining for the demons.

"This door was not made by you."

The demons approached, breathing fiery breath.

"But this hell was not made by you either."

The demons fled in terror as dozens of demons surrounded Nane.

"There is no exit for you. You too shall perish here for eons and become a demon."

Nane raised his hand, curling his index finger and thumb into a circle.

"Destroy demons to save sentient beings."

The sword tattoo carved on Nane's tongue blazed golden, floating numerous swords of light around him.

Sermon

Tongue of Truth.

Nane is almost correct.

Therefore, the sounds created by his tongue moving with a Kar value of 99.999 percent become truth itself.

"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form."

The sword of light manifested through sword transformation pierces the opponent's essence with the same intensity as enlightenment gained through Zen dialogue.

"Grahhhhh!"

As swords of light radiated in all directions and penetrated the demons, their red skin instantly turned to ash and burned away.

"Close your eyes and it ends—such is the boundary between existence and non-existence."

Nane is almost correct.

"Follow me, pitiful ones."

As Nane opened the Gate of Annihilation, a space filled only with soundless, feelingless pitch-black darkness was revealed.

"Um... Seeker."

The demons who had been following behind with tears of overwhelming emotion simultaneously knelt and called to Nane.

"If we enter there, everything will disappear, won't it?"

"Yes. You will be liberated from the suffering of existence."

The demons clasped their hands together and pleaded.

"If this is the end anyway, couldn't you let us taste meat just one more time? Since it's the last time..."

Sadness filled Nane's eyes.

'Attachment. Attachment to life.'

The gap between fleeting memories remaining after pleasure and the sensory emptiness as if such things never happened—this was the karma of living beings.

'Can it not be severed?'

Realizing that the demons would not be able to cross the door, Nane sat down and extended his hand.

"Eat."

A demon already drooling trembled violently, then bit down hard on Nane's finger.

"Since it's the end anyway. Since this is the last time..."

All the demons rushed forward and began brutally tearing at Nane's body.

"Delicious! Delicious! This is the best after all!"

The demons, their eyes rolled back, quickly digested Nane's body, and when there was nothing left to eat, they scratched at their necks with their claws.

"Hun-hungry! Want to eat more! Hungry!"

No one leaped into the Gate of Annihilation.

'With this, I give everything and depart.'

Having lost his physical body in the other world, Nane crossed the Gate of Annihilation in a mental state.

In a realm without time or space, what awaited him was the only existence that could be born from nothingness.

It was Ra Enemy, who dreamed of this world.

"..."

Though reincarnated in human form, no muscle was attached, his eyes were blind, and his nose was crushed.

He could neither speak nor hear.

From such a withered body, Ra Enemy existing as a past event entered Nane's memories.

"Do you resent me?"

Ra Enemy wore a beautiful smile.

"Anyone can dream."

Even if it weren't Ra Enemy, someone would dream, and if that was all there was to the world we live in, nothing would change.

"So... what did you realize?"

Nane hesitated for a moment.

For him, whose thoughts were fast enough to stop time, it was contemplation lasting near-eternity.

"Only one thing."

Nane raised his index finger and said.

"Emptiness."

Labyrinth Andre

World Number 9999.

The buildings soaring as if to pierce the sky were made of neither stone nor iron.

Not a speck of dust floated in the air, and despite having no power lines, it was a world with a perfect electrical grid that somehow provided light.

"As expected... no one's awake."

According to information obtained through the Ultima System, this place was immeasurably far in the future from where Shirone had lived.

Based on several days of exploration, all the humans in this world were inside person-sized glass tubes.

'They're all either dead or sleeping.'

While lost in thought, a small sphere silently flew down from the sky, its center opening to reveal a protruding lens.

A laser scanned Shirone's retina, and a voice came from a speaker on the side.

Non-dormant individual detected. Code cannot be retrieved. Danger level zero. Would you like to reincarnate?

Shirone asked happily.

"Are you human by any chance? Where is this? Where can I meet people who are awake?"

The sphere tilted at an angle.

Presumed temporary amnesia due to post-death stress. Would you like a detailed examination at the Center?

"Detailed examination? But I don't have amnesia or anything..."

Shirone stopped speaking and nodded.

"Yes, I'll get examined. Anywhere is fine, so please take me somewhere I can talk to people."

Transferring unregistered code to Center.

Hundreds of identical spheres flew from beyond the buildings and wrapped around Shirone's arms, legs, and waist.

"Huh?"

Shirone's body floated up and was quickly flown through the sky by the sphere drones.

Arrived at Center.

Turning gracefully, the drones brought Shirone to the first floor of the city's tallest tower.

Detailed examination will be conducted. Wait time: 3 minutes 2 seconds.

Arriving in the room, Shirone looked around but saw only mechanical devices where people could lie down, arranged in rows.

"Wait! Isn't there really anyone awake?"

Though Shirone shouted in frustration, the sphere drone didn't respond and left the room.

"What am I supposed to do in a place like this?"

Please lie down on Table 1.

A voice came from the ceiling, but he now knew it wasn't human.

'I'll have to investigate myself.'

As Shirone tried to leave the room, another drone flew over and blocked his path.

"Sorry, but just let me go. I don't have amnesia..."

Light shot from the lower lens of the drone watching Shirone, and a hologram appeared.

"Amy?"

It was Amy, with perfect features lacking nothing.

Hello. I am Administrator Argo.
