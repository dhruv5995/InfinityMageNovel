[706] God of the Desert (5)

According to the true meaning of esoteric Buddhism, it is a phase (bardo) of experiencing the source of existence, and medically, some believe it to be similar to near-death experiences.

Patients in comatose states encountering landscapes different from reality has been frequently reported, and exceptional high monks sometimes glimpse into the world of souls through extreme cultivation.

However, Shirone's current bardo was not a momentary enlightenment, but a vivid sensation simultaneously accepting two landscapes - reality and the hidden side.

"Let me confirm again."

As Baknyeo approached, destroying everything visible in her path, the color drained from Shirone's face.

'Choeni Bardo!'

Just as Shibutsangpokubai merged past and future, Choeni Bardo merged two spaces, unfolding countless new routes like the electrical circuits of a precise magic circle.

As Shirone evaded the attack and cast Homing Photon Cannon, flashes of light rushed forward as if spinning.

Baknyeo's monstrous senses activated, and her upper body vibrated like a plucked string.

Just the movement of her upper body caused the air to explode, and the Photon Cannons swirling around Baknyeo collided with each other and vanished.

'Is that even human?'

Baknyeo was equally surprised.

'She's definitely opened her bardo.'

The seventh sense corresponded to the sensory layer of ordinary angels by heaven's standards.

It was the result of countless magical methods of ordinary angels, who had explored this world with no less than seven senses, including divine observation.

Baknyeo lowered her stance and spoke.

"From now on, I will evaluate you my way."

Extremely intuitive, but precisely because of that, never missing the mark.

'What is that now?'

Behind Baknyeo, a massive mechanical device resembling a heart made of steel flickered like a hallucination.

Axing
Nirvana E
Engine (V
12-cylinder).

Then the hallucination disappeared, and a vivid V-shaped avatar soared like wings, causing Shirone's face to contort.

"Urgh!"

The feeling of the world bending around her was like encountering Lian's Maha.

'Since that day...'

She had tasted the ultimate acceleration while facing Lian in Apocalypse, but couldn't be satisfied with just that.

For the same avatar, a straight line was wasteful - bent into a V-shape to accommodate more cylinders of natural law.

'Now I can run even faster.'

Very few knew that Baknyeo, before gaining immortality, had been a genius engineer of the Mecha tribe and a terrible speed addict.

'Amita would oppose this.'

The Council of Ten disapproved of immortals retaining habits from their pre-immortal days.

"Shirone."

Baknyeo's mouth corners stretched into a long tear.

"Will you... go all the way with me?"

The eerie feeling was brief - the V avatar blazed like fire and Baknyeo's form vanished.

'Damn!'

Even mobilizing both temporal explosion and bardo to evade attacks, honestly she didn't think she could hold out.

'How is she so fast? Can she even control it?'

Momodo, watching Vanguard become a battlefield, clutched her head with both hands.

"No! How can I protect the Vanguard I've worked so hard to maintain!"

Suddenly a hole burst through a perfectly intact wall with a bang, followed by crashing sounds from inside.

Shortly after, pushing through clouds of dust, shops began collapsing in sequence.

'I'm being caught up to!'

At this speed, a hundred spells were useless.

Finally, Baknyeo, who had taken a detour seven times longer than Shirone's path, came rushing at her.

"Shirone!"

Lian blocked her path and swung his great sword, causing the curved blade to ring sharply as it was deflected.

"I'll handle this! Go get Latusha!"

Shirone bit her lip.

"Will you be okay? That woman is..."

Though Shirone always trusted Lian, this time she couldn't leave him alone.

"I know what you mean. I've already fought her."

Recalling the battle in Apocalypse still gave him chills.

"Don't worry. I won't die. But honestly... I'm not confident I can win here."

Lian's words brought clarity to her judgment, and Shirone used Choeni Bardo to leave the area.

"Second time seeing you."

Baknyeo approached with her sword hanging loose.

"Shall we run?"

Lian could only smile bitterly.

KWAAAAANG!

The sound of Lian and Baknyeo's axing devastating Vanguard reached Kido's ears.

"Tch! Are we just goblins?"

When the Maga Bandit Group arrived, Kido was standing on a spear shaft gripped by his ten toes.

"What are you people? Why are you attacking us?"

"You don't need to worry about how you die."

As the vice-captain drew his sword and approached, killing intent that seemed to burn his nerves enveloped Kido's entire body.

'These guys are incredible.'

There were probably very few organizations that could turn the mighty Vanguard of the central desert into chaos.

Each of them was a Drakkeur, and especially the woman fighting Lian had far transcended human limits.

"Keke, kekekeke."

The vice-captain's eyes grew fierce at the sight of Kido shaking his shoulders with laughter.

"Have you gone insane? What's so funny?"

"My mind is finally clearing up."

When faced with imminent death, you realize something.

'Fate that might never come...'

It's completely worthless.

"Right, Shirone?"

As Kido flicked the spear he was gripping with both feet and came down, the spear shaft that shot skyward made a whirring whistle sound.

And the moment it fell back down, Kido's body spun at the same rotational speed as the spear and rolled sideways.

"Running away is the best strategy!"

As Kido rolled the spear like a wheel and went vertically down the apartment building, the Maga Bandit Group leaped down.

"Chase him! We must catch him in Vanguard!"

Meanwhile, Baknyeo, who had been overwhelming Lian, spotted Shirone climbing over a wall in the distance.

'She chose to meet La?'

Unable to let Shirone go, Baknyeo ran to a nearby drainage device and grabbed a tank.

"Wait! You can't touch that!"

Momoda's cry was swept away by the wind, and the V-12 cylinder transmitted power to Baknyeo's body.

"Grrrrrr!"

The RPM shot up madly and the tank began shaking violently.

"Oh, my..."

At the end of increasingly violent vibrations, metal snapped with a grinding sound.

"KIYAAAAAA!"

Baknyeo let out a beast-like roar and twisted her waist, causing the tank to swing wide with centrifugal force before flying toward Shirone.

"100 tons..."

Momoda, who had been staring blankly, suddenly came to her senses and shouted.

"This is bad! If the outer wall collapses...!"

"Shirone! Get away!"

At Lian's voice, Shirone turned and her eyes widened at the sight of the massive tank.

"What!"

The 100-ton tank crashed through the wall with a thunderous roar.

"Oof! What the."

Shirone, who had tumbled outside Vanguard, gripped desert sand in a prone position.

The first thing she realized was the sound of burning wind.

'It's coming.'

Something massive was surging from the deep darkness of the desert.

"Activate the second tank and repair the windbreak! If we don't stop it early, everything will be destroyed!"

Though Momoda gave swift instructions, powerful wind rushed into Vanguard like water through a hole in a dam.

Sand swirled as double windows rattled, and casualties struck by building debris began appearing.

A subordinate who jumped down from the watchtower shouted.

"Manager! Noscarta...! No..."

Judging that he couldn't fully express his emotions with just the name of the trade wind, he changed his words.

"The God of the Desert is coming!"

As Shirone regained her senses and cast Shining magic, Caidra flew in from where the moon hung, making strange bird sounds.

'Thank goodness. You were nearby.'

Kido and Lian ran toward the exit, and at perfect timing, Photon Cannon blew away the iron gate.

"Lian! Kido! Quickly!"

Shirone waved her hand urgently, and the vice-captain watching from afar shouted to his subordinate guarding the exit.

"Block them! Don't let them board the strange bird!"

As members riding Omechs raised their swords and charged from both sides, Kido stopped walking.

"Tch! Go ahead first!"

"Catch the goblin first!"

Omechs that leaped into the air extended sharp claws and stomped down on where Kido had been.

"Kido!"

Lian, who had reached Shirone, looked back and shouted.

KRAAAANG!

As the dust settled, the sight of Omechs with severed legs rolling on the ground in agony was revealed.

Kido, who had rolled out like a ball, ran toward the exit while gnawing on one of the beast's legs.

"Puhehehe! How was that? Did I do well?"

"Stop eating already!"

At Shirone's scolding, Kido threw away the leg, climbed onto Caidra, and grabbed the reins.

"I'll drive! We've seen enough here too!"

The Maga Bandit Group, all mounted on Omechs, charged toward Caidra while cracking whips.

"Leader! Shall we pursue?"

UOOOOOOO!

The rough wind was so loud that voices could barely be heard.

"To the very end."

As Baknyeo turned the reins to change direction and took the lead, the vice-captain looked back and gave instructions.

"Beat the drums! We'll track their position by sound!"

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!

Caidra took flight to the sound of drums.

"Damn! This wind really is incredible!"

But due to the severe wind resistance, they couldn't easily gain altitude.

The wind sound grew endlessly louder, and even the fearless bandit group swallowed nervously.

'They really want to break through this?'

Kido, who intuited from the wind's strength, shouted.

"It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!"

Just as Shirone turned her head at the deafening roar, Lian pointed ahead.

"Shirone! Over there!"

Noscarta.

A desert tsunami reaching an incredible height of 2 kilometers was approaching, engulfing the horizon.

Shirone burst into laughter with an expression ready to cry.

"Puhahahaha!"

The members running on the ground also discovered the massive sand barrier and became mentally confused.

"Brace yourselves! If we get swallowed, it's over!"

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!

Baknyeo took a deep breath while facing the strong wind that seemed to tear her skin.

'This is nature's wind.'

She pulled down the only burial shroud she wore, spread her upper body wide, and lifted her head.

"Haaaaaa."

White showed beneath her trembling eyelids, and her waist swayed like waves in rhythm with the Omech.

'Literally an animal.'

Watching Baknyeo's softly risen back muscles, the vice-captain pressed his lips tightly together.

'It doesn't matter if she becomes a beast. If it's that person...'

Even if she fell into the realm of animals, he would gladly serve Baknyeo as king and sacrifice his life.

Kido gripped the reins and shouted.

"Hold on tight so you don't fall! We're going to collide!"

Shirone stared at the mind-bogglingly massive sandstorm and realized the principle of natural law that ruled the desert.

'It's not wind.'

The true nature of Noscarta transmitted through her bardo was the futility of countless lives that had perished over eons.

GRAAAAAAANG!

Was it coincidence created by air currents?

Sand particles flowing down the desert wall formed the shape of a massive skull and let out a terrible cry.

'I won't be swallowed by futility!'

Even if only a miserable ending awaited in her fate, she would fight the world to the very end.

"Lian! Kido!"

A skull protruding from the sand barrier extended its skeletal hands and struck at Caidra.

"Let's go!"

Simultaneously, Lian swung his great sword vertically.

"UAAAAA!"

Divine Transcendence
Maha.

PEOOOOOONG!

As Lian's will bisected the world, the skull's face carved in the sand wall exploded and split in two.

Finally, the desert storm swallowed Caidra.

"YAHOOOOOO!"

Kido's voice spread on the wind.

"Don't lose them! We are the Maga Bandit Group!"

Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.

The God of the Desert comes, devouring futility.
