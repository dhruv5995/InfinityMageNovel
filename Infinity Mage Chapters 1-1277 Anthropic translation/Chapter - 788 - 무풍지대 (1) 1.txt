[788] The Doldrums (1)

Upon arriving at Aganos's airfield, the Caydra handlers had already prepared Ratusa and were waiting.

Iruki, who had come to see Sirone off, handed his friend his bag and said:

"How long do you think it'll take?"

"The time will depend on how much the Arachne government cooperates. But it shouldn't take too long."

If it was the Ivory Tower, they would have no choice but to cooperate, which was also why Woorin had specifically chosen Sirone.

"The problem is Betafish—real name Amery Jastin's thoughts. She might... not hate Harbitz."

That part bothered Iruki too.

"She's the sole survivor while her entire bloodline was being wiped out. There's plenty of room for fear to play a bigger role than hatred."

The fact that she had abandoned even her name and was hiding in a foreign country added weight to this suspicion.

"I'll try my best to persuade her, but if she refuses, there's nothing I can do. Like with Abella, <Beop-sal> isn't a weapon that works through coercion."

"Right. We'll try to come up with backup plans too."

If Sirone's sincerity didn't get through to her, it would be impossible to bring her back no matter who tried to persuade her.

"It's not a dangerous mission, so try to relax a bit while you're there. Arachne is a world-class resort destination. You've been having a hard time lately."

Sirone's face had grown noticeably gaunt recently.

'It's not just the battles...'

Clashing with demons who despised Yahweh so intensely must have been mentally exhausting.

"I'll be back."

Though he had no intention of treating it as a vacation, Sirone didn't show it and boarded the Caydra.

"It's been a while, Ratusa."

As a comrade who had crossed Noscartha together, Ratusa affectionately rubbed her beak against him.

"If the Caydra gets tired, rest plenty. There's no need to feel pressured because of us."

Sirone said as he gripped the reins.

"It's fine. If she gets tired, I'll carry you and fly."

As Ratusa stood up, a massive shadow fell, and Iruki's gaze rose to a height of 4 meters.

"Let's go!"

The Caydra's massive body launched out of the airfield and dropped straight down vertically.

Kiyaaaaaaah!

A clear bird cry immediately burst forth as Ratusa revealed herself again and disappeared into the clouds.

"...He's going to carry and fly?"

Iruki shook his head as he imagined Sirone riding on the back of the monster bird.

The Kingdom of Arachne.

The 5-star Rubistro Hotel.

"Maya, the preparations are going well, right? Did you see the sheet music for this song? Isn't it amazing?"

Maya had arrived in the Kingdom of Arachne three days ago.

"Yes, it really is great. It's exciting and upbeat."

The entertainment company 'Elbor' from the Kingdom of Tormia was paying special attention to the debut of their major new talent, Maya.

And so they had secured the opening stage for Arachne's biggest festival—the World Beauty Contest.

"That's right, that's right. It's the result of collaboration between the best composer and the best lyricist."

Every year, an average of over 20,000 tourists from around the world flock to see the World Beauty Contest.

Palmers, Elbor's handsome bachelor CEO in his mid-thirties, clenched both fists and trembled.

"The timing is perfect too. The damn demons made this year's scale a bit smaller, but news coverage from media companies from each country will be spread worldwide. Don't worry, just sing well."

"Mr. CEO."

Maya said with a tearful expression.

"I know you're really good to me. I'm so grateful."

"Hahaha, what have I done? I just caught Maya's natural singing talent faster than anyone else..."

"It really is good, the song is good and everything is good..."

Knowing Palmers' goodwill, she had agonized over it, but no matter how she thought about it, she couldn't feel confident.

"The lyrics are strange. I don't think I can sing like this."

"Huh? The lyrics?"

Maya spread both arms and shouted:

"They're too decadent!"

"Hmm."

Palmers blinked and recalled the lyrics, then obediently nodded.

"They are a bit provocative. But that's what makes them good, right? If it's not too obvious, sexy stuff always works."

"Still, the meaning is too intense. I'm sorry for saying this as a newcomer, but this is just..."

Palmers smacked his lips.

'This is the problem.'

Flawless appearance, naturally exceptional singing, she could dance, had a mage certification, and even had sense.

'But why on earth!'

Why was she so shy?

"Maya, can't you just close your eyes tight and sing it? I know your personality. That's why I deleted the undressing sequence too."

The undressing was just showing shoulder lines and cleavage, but Maya was disgusted.

"I-I'd rather undress. It's entirely my problem, but I really have no confidence."

Faced with her resolve to show skin rather than utter decadent words, even Palmers couldn't be stubborn.

'Is it really that difficult?'

Having personal feelings for a singer was a shortcut to ruin, but honestly, he didn't want to see Maya undress.

"Fine. Let's do this then. Since we don't have time, I'll bring the lyricist now. Let's think of revisions together."

"I'm sorry, Mr. CEO."

Palmers smiled bitterly.

"This is my job after all. If anything else bothers you in the future, tell me anything. You need to be comfortable for good results."

Twenty minutes later, Palmers brought a man with a stubborn face wearing square glasses.

"It's not that I don't like it, it just doesn't seem to match the style I'm pursuing."

Unlike during the audition, faced with her firm attitude of self-assertion, lyricist Moster also obediently sat at the table.

"Right, which parts don't you like?"

The words came right out.

"First, the word choices. 'I'm going to lick.' 'While hearing slurping sounds.' What keeps getting licked? And the double meanings. 'A man hard as a stick.' 'Come into my open heart'..."

Moster hastily held out his hand.

"Ah, that last one isn't it."

Maya bit her lower lip.

"...Anyway, that's what I mean."

While Palmers leaned against the wall watching, Moster sighed.

"Writers in general, that is, people who create stories with words..."

Maya blinked at the sudden words.

"Most are crazy. Actually, there are only two types of writers in this world. Regular people pretending to be writers, and crazy people pretending to be regular people."

Moster tapped his temple with his index and middle fingers.

"Two thoughts flow simultaneously in a writer's head. Very logical and damn boring thoughts, and thrilling, terrible thoughts that destroy that logic."

He clicked his index and middle fingers like scissors.

"When those two thoughts interact like electricity, they become logical yet interesting storytelling. Split personality. That's how you go crazy."

"So?"

"Even while having the most beautiful thoughts, the desire to cruelly trample them coexists. The important thing is maintaining balance. If you lean to one side, you're ruined."

"...So?"

Moster pushed his chair back with a clatter, knelt down, and bowed his head to Maya.

"I lost to that desire!"

"What are you doing right now?"

Maya was startled and tried to lift him up, but he lowered his center of gravity and wouldn't straighten his knees.

"I felt thrills during the audition. What amazing material! I wondered what would happen if that heavenly voice expressed such things? The destructive impulse was so strong I had to write it!"

"Are you a pervert? Why would you think such things...!"

"Trust me! It'll definitely work! Please sing my lyrics with your beautiful voice!"

When Maya turned her head, Palmers was already opening the door and calling security.

"Take him out."

Even while being dragged away, Moster didn't give up.

"Please, Maya! I even dream of you singing those lyrics!"

The door closed.

"Sigh."

As the drained Maya slumped into her chair, Palmers approached, smacking his lips.

"Sorry. This is entirely our mistake. I'll somehow procure a new lyricist."

He should have known about the individual's burning passion.

"But it also means Maya is material so compelling that even veteran Moster would abandon money and choose desire."

If even her shy appearance could be used as a weapon, it might be good to go with Maya's wishes.

"Alright, let's go pure."

Maya asked worriedly:

"There are only three days left. Can we complete the lyrics in time?"

"We'll have to mobilize all company personnel. Though people who can extract things as sensibly as Moster are rare..."

He had no regrets about that.

"Then, could I perhaps try writing them?"

"Huh? Maya, you?"

"Yes. Actually, I don't know what those two thoughts Moster mentioned are, but I'd like to try."

"Hmm. That's not bad."

Since the lyricist fell through anyway, relying on Maya's original nature was one strategy.

"Good, try working on it first. I'll put it up for final review. But you have to keep practicing, okay?"

Maya smiled satisfiedly.

'Sirone.'

There were lyrics she really wanted to write.

Kiiiiiii!

The Caydra's cry woke Sirone from his morning sleep.

"Huaaaam!"

The air that had been cold before he fell asleep had already changed to the warm tropical heat of the equator.

"Wow!"

As if the sun had shattered, tens of thousands of lights floated over the surface of the doldrums.

Islands mixing forests and rocky cliffs were scattering colorful birds into the sky like fireworks.

"It's a wonderful place."

Sirone shook his head.

"But the mission comes first."

After passing through the 10 island kingdoms from east to west, Sirone parted with Ratusa in the skies above the Kingdom of Arachne.

"Thanks. I'll buy you something delicious when we get to Kashan."

Kiii.

After patting the Caydra's head, Sirone launched himself before it got any later and fell toward the ground.

As he descended aiming for Arachne's capital 'Bengol,' he could hear the crowds filling the streets and music.

"It's a festival."

Unlike with Minerva, rudely breaking through the royal castle walls didn't suit his disposition, so Sirone landed on a building.

Since people's attention was captivated by the festival, no one noticed the foreigner who had fallen from the sky.

"So this is the Kingdom of Arachne."

It was the third island located among the 10 island kingdoms extending eastward from the southern continent's coastline.

'The natives who crossed by boat from the south long ago were Arachne's beginning.'

Perhaps because of this, despite developing under the influence of the continent that led civilization's advancement, southern customs remained.

"Should I go down and look?"

When Sirone jumped down toward the alley and came out to the main street, open carriages were parading.

As Arachne dancers in bikinis swayed their hips, an announcer said:

"Everyone! This is Miss Yakma!"

As the Yakma Republic's representative participating in the World Beauty Contest passed by, everyone's attention focused.

"Miss Yakma! Show us your face!"

The star was hidden behind curtains, and at someone's request, a silhouette waved.

"She waved at me! I love you! I love you no matter who you are!"

People burst into laughter.

"Miss Tormia!"

Sirone's gaze naturally turned.

'That's our kingdom!'

Again only a silhouette was visible, but the side profile with hands placed on knees belonged to an elegant woman.

'I wonder who it is? I'm really curious.'

The curiosity everyone harbored would be resolved on the day the World Beauty Contest was held.

"Miss South Almond!"

The announcer's voice adorned the southern sky.
