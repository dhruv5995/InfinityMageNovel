Face to Face (4)

As Sirone and the 12 figures knelt around him, murmurs arose from the allied forces.

"Who are they?"

Very few people knew their identities.

"Those things..."

Sensing the fire igniting in Miro's eyes, Zulu spoke.

"Show restraint. The battle isn't over yet."

Though he had scattered Heaven's army across the world with Hand of God, with their abilities, regrouping would be instantaneous.

Among the 12 Apostles, a black woman with elongated limbs and developed muscles spoke.

"Sorry for being late. We were searching for where the Messiah had gone..."

It was Aviris, the Black Dragon.

She wore a gypsy-style skirt and was adorned with accessories imbued with mystical meanings.

Despite her arrogant personality—calling herself the Black King Mad Storm Dragon—and constantly bickering with the Light Dragon, her natural enemy in terms of attributes, she was always respectful before the Messiah.

Phaeton smiled with an expression unbecoming of a boy.

"Hmph, that's just being slow, isn't it? You should pay proper attention."

Since Sirone's quantum transmission transcended the light-speed barrier, in reality, even Phaeton could only track him belatedly.

Gaitan, the Earth Dragon, scolded sternly.

"Don't be arrogant. Competition is always welcome, but teamwork is also important to fulfill the Messiah's will."

He was a giant with dark skin and tremendously developed shoulder muscles, actually the strongest among the 12 Apostles in terms of physical strength.

Sirone apologized.

"I'm sorry. It was a situation where problems would arise if I didn't deploy simultaneous events. But now that we've bought time, we'll proceed according to plan."

The 12 Apostles bowed their heads.

"We follow the Messiah's will."

Shaking off Kang Nan's hand, Miro approached.

"Before that, isn't there something that needs to be resolved? If it weren't for me, even Sirone couldn't have stopped the elemental bomb. In the end, doesn't that mean your calculations were wrong?"

Infercus, the Fire Dragon, curled his lips.

"So what? That's why we sent you, isn't it?"

Miro seemed rather pleased as she lifted her head.

"Hohoho!"

Abruptly stopping her laughter, she glared fiercely.

"You were quite excited when you had me tied up and beaten, weren't you? Want to try being on the receiving end this time?"

As if proving her sincerity, the wrathful form of the Thousand-Armed Guanyin rose with a mad smile.

Argan, the Spirit Dragon, raised both hands to stop Miro.

"Everything worked out well, so let's not fight. We all have our circumstances, don't we?"

He was a man as tall as a beanpole, with a clown-like white face and black eye makeup.

His lips were extended with black lipstick, creating a sinister impression.

"Shut up. Your hits hurt the most."

"No, that was... because of the circumstances."

As Argan, terrible at arguments, scratched his head, Asriker, the White Dragon, stood up.

"I apologize."

The area instantly fell silent.

"I apologize for what happened before. Now that we've come to follow the Messiah, we will show respect according to the Messiah's personal relationships going forward."

More than Miro, the people around her were mesmerized.

'Beautiful.'

No, it seemed as if a charm beyond such words enveloped her entire being.

'It's not charm. It's magic power.'

Even the cool-headed Lufist felt dizzy, and even Tess and Amy, who were women, couldn't take their eyes off her.

They were focusing on Miro at the moment, but if anyone made eye contact with her, their legs would give out and they'd collapse.

"Hmm."

Miro had already experienced the White Dragon's extreme allure.

Though she didn't have the ability to dismantle magic like Sirone, the Thousand-Armed Guanyin with no blind spots endured by putting up iron walls against all senses.

'But delicate combat is impossible in this state. Then can this also be considered an attack?'

Anyway, if the 12 Apostles followed Sirone, it aligned with Miro's purpose too.

"Fine, then let's get to the point. Sirone, you must have had a reason for deliberately scattering Heaven's army."

"Yes. That was my limit for now."

Sirone spoke honestly.

"Hand of God is an example of aggressively using Idea's link. It creates the user's will in the form of a hand."

As everyone looked up at the sky, the giant hand of light made an OK sign with its index finger and thumb.

Lowering her head, Miro asked.

"What's the point of that? Of course, it'll take time for them to form ranks again, but there's no special defensive method."

They could only fight head-on.

"No."

Sirone shook his head.

"From now on, we'll defeat Heaven's army one by one."

"Huh?"

Everyone blinked.

A carriage that had left the Holy War was racing quickly toward Bashka.

With Iruki seated in the place of honor, Dorothy was on his left and Aromi on his right.

And on the bed across from them...

"Quantum transmission?"

Sirone was there.

"Yeah. It's Hexa's ability."

As Sirone raised his index finger, the hexagonal Hexa spun rapidly.

"It's also the first ability I created."

Actually, Guffin could have done it too, but it would be more accurate to say it wasn't necessary.

"In the era of the Gaians, everyone was strong. Not just in terms of force, but how should I put it? Everyone was like Guffin."

Since it would take time to reach Bashka, Iruki could listen calmly.

"After receiving Omega from Karatorsa, the first thought I had was that I couldn't be like that."

"Current humanity isn't that strong."

"...Unfortunately. So I thought about it. What would be the most efficient way to use the Ultima System?"

"That's the ability you explained earlier?"

Iruki couldn't believe it.

"Yeah. Quantum transmission is... Oh, the 12 Apostles just arrived. Anyway, quantum transmission is..."

Dorothy extended her hand.

"Wait. I don't understand, so you mean there's you in Bashka, and you here, and you exchange information with each other?"

Sirone shook his head.

"No, I'm not split in two. There's only one me in this world."

"But you're right now..."

"Right, I'm also in Bashka. Hmm, how should I explain this easily? I know."

Snapping his fingers, Sirone said.

"Actually, the city called Bashka doesn't exist. It doesn't exist in this world."

"Hmm."

As Iruki nodded as if understanding something, Sirone pointed to the window.

"Dorothy, what do you think is outside right now?"

The window had curtains drawn.

"Well, mountains or forests? Animals or something..."

Dorothy stopped speaking and blinked.

"You mean there's nothing there?"

"Right. At least not for us as observers."

As Sirone pulled back the curtains, a vast meadow was revealed.

"And the moment we observe like this, the world comes into being."

Aromi, who was a layperson, asked an innocent question.

"Then what if you pull back the curtains really fast? So fast that it's not even visible to the eye. Would we be able to confirm there's nothing there?"

"Haha."

Sirone laughed, but it didn't feel bad.

There was a sense that it was a good question.

"That's a logical imagination. But when extended to the realm of thought, nothing that exists in this world can ever surpass the background signal. We're trapped by a solid wall."

"What's that wall?"

"Time."

"Ah..."

"It's called the light-speed barrier. The basic signal that forms this world is photons. It's not because light is fast, but because it's fundamental that it can't be surpassed. Therefore, the speed of light is constant, and no matter how fast you pull back the curtains, you can't see the background."

Aromi kept nodding.

"Oh, that's right. No matter how fast an arrow is, if time stops, it can't advance at all. Ah, is this example correct?"

"Exactly."

A smile spread across Aromi's face.

"Hehe, now I understand. In the end, everyone trapped in the photon system can't transcend the speed of light."

"Yes."

Sirone nodded and added.

"But I can transcend it."

As Aromi's mouth hung open in bewilderment, Iruki chuckled.

"Is that quantum transmission?"

"Yeah. The mind can transcend the speed of light. Actually, imagining the end of the universe is incomparably faster than light."

Dorothy asked.

"But that's just imagining, isn't it?"

"Even so, nothing would change. Actually, even now, Bashka doesn't exist, does it?"

"That's from our perspective. So... you here are the only one, and whether you exist in Bashka or not is unknowable until we observe it—I get that. The problem is you. The feeling of existing in different spaces simultaneously doesn't seem logical."

"That's because humans have one body for one mind. Actually, life forms on other planets sometimes have one brain controlling millions of creatures. Their logic would be different from humans."

Sirone spread his palm and held up his index and middle fingers vertically with his other hand.

"These two fingers are in different spaces, but whether either finger moves, I can know instantly. Of course, this isn't an exact analogy. This is transmitted through nerves, but I'm connected by quantum signals."

"The mind."

Iruki said.

"An integrated mental system."

"Yeah. I found a way to maximize the Ultima System's capabilities. Of course, since I'm one person, the system isn't strengthened. But I can defeat enemies one by one. And above all..."

Sirone's eyes sharpened.

"This is the only method that can integrate humanity's consciousness most quickly."

Iruki realized.

'This guy really...'

He's planning to revive the Ultima System.

"Range doesn't matter?"

"Yeah. There are no spatial constraints. Because it's the mind. But."

Sirone placed his index and middle fingers on his palm again.

"It's still the mind. If the me in two spaces observe each other's existence, one has to disappear."

The moment the fingers touched, Sirone quickly moved his middle finger outside his palm.

"I see."

Iruki's mind raced.

"Even so, it's strategically sufficient. To summarize, if you exist in areas where you can't observe each other, the phenomenon you described is possible?"

"Yeah."

Both Sirones in the two spaces spoke simultaneously.

"Simultaneous events."

Dante, Amy, Nade, and even Miro wore blank expressions.

"What kind of absurd talk is this?"

While Lian had already given up on understanding, Poine, the Poison Dragon, burst into laughter.

"Kekeke! Has the young lady been fooled all her life? Our Messiah's abilities move heaven itself."

"Tsk."

Though Miro glared disapprovingly, it was the truth.

'Hmm, so that's why he forcibly disbanded them. The foundation of the idea is the Ultima System. It's definitely a decent method.'

Having finished her thoughts, Miro asked.

"What's the standard for transmission? If space doesn't exist, you can't set coordinates."

"Right. The observer's quantum signal is needed. In other words, I can't go to places where there are no people."

"Well, that's nothing."

With Sirone's mobility, it was a wall he could easily overcome.

"Then from now on..."

Having finished explaining simultaneous events, Sirone looked around at everyone and said.

"Let's form teams to fight alongside me."

No one stepped forward.

Because Sirone would be on every team.
