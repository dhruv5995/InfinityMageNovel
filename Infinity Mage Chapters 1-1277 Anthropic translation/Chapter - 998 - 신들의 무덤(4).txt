The Graveyard of Gods (4)

Ymir's Mind.

Sirone's group, having reached the 5th depth level, had been unable to descend any deeper for a whole seven days.

"This is driving me crazy."

Arius grew impatient.

As expected, the 5th depth level was quite a rational environment, but the problem was that it lacked any distinguishing features.

"Hello, Mr. Sirone."

A resident that looked like a wooden doll with a white egg placed on top bowed their head.

And in another location, someone who looked exactly like the previous resident greeted them.

"Hello, Mr. Sirone."

Sirone simply passed by without responding.

'I have no idea who they are.'

The residents had no names, no age, no gender, and the surrounding scenery was the same.

It was a world where the simplest structures—circles, triangles, squares—were randomly arranged.

"This is disgusting."

Miro couldn't stand it and frowned.

What they were seeing now—the residents and scenery—was truly how Ymir viewed the world.

"Even so, this is ridiculous. How can all the residents be identical? There should have been at least someone memorable, right?"

Sein said.

"Looking at this, it seems there aren't any. He doesn't even care about the background. Is the world we live so fiercely in really this simple to Ymir?"

"You called it the graveyard of gods," Sirone said.

"At least they're people Ymir acknowledged. So it's not like there's no one memorable at all. At minimum, Lian should be here."

Miro grabbed a passing resident and shouted.

"Hey! Where's Ymir?"

Using the ego's name as a keyword in the mental world was taboo, but the resident didn't care.

"Hello, Mr. Sirone...!"

Miro's fist punched right through the resident's face.

Sein sighed, but it was just a mental construct anyway, and honestly, it felt satisfying.

When Miro withdrew her fist, the resident swayed like a puppet with cut strings and collapsed.

"You know what's really annoying? We've met this exact bastard three thousand times."

While no one could actually prove it, Miro's words made sense for that very reason.

"Let's get rid of them all. We need to reduce their numbers first to increase our chances of meeting new residents."

Sirone said.

"You already destroyed one city, Mr. Gaold."

They had already tried everything possible in the world of the 5th depth level.

Arius said.

"The key point here is that no resident reacts to any keywords about Ymir. Perhaps this is a world ruled by someone other than Ymir."

"We already tried all the names of the gods Ymir fought, right? Using Sirone's Omega. We even tried 'Sirone' from this world's most popular phrase, 'Hello, Mr. Sirone.'"

Arius stopped in his tracks.

"Hello, Mr. Sirone?"

Miro's eyes widened.

"You want to get hit?"

"No, this is worth thinking about. Why do the residents of this world greet Mr. Sirone? They don't even react to Mr. Gaold, who broke through the nightmare."

Sirone said.

"You said it might be connected to the Ultima System. But we tried various things and it was all useless."

"Of course. What I want to say is that while it's structured like consciousness, this is strictly the unconscious. It wasn't about finding and activating specific keywords like in the surface layers. That was our mistake."

Miro said.

"So you're saying you were wrong in the end?"

"I admit failure, but... calling it being wrong is hurtful to a professional. You can't be wrong about something you don't know. This is my first time with this type of depth too."

"Fine. Keep talking."

"If this were the surface layer, the reason residents lack individuality could be interpreted as Ymir's perspective on the world. But in the unconscious, many things are overlapped."

"Ah."

Arius spread both arms.

"It's everything in the end. All of them—meaning this entire world itself—is the keyword."

It made sense.

"But does knowing that change anything? We still tried everything the same way."

"Perhaps..."

Arius paused briefly before speaking after long consideration.

"There seems to be something we haven't tried."

Sirone asked.

"What's that?"

"Reverse integration."

Arius raised his index finger.

"The residents are Ymir's perspective, but they're also Gaians. The unification mentioned in the nightmare. In other words, they're the simplest schematic of the Ultima System that Ymir conceived. And Mr. Sirone couldn't break through it."

"Ugh..."

Watching the residents busily moving through the streets, Sirone honestly admitted.

"It's impossible for me alone."

"Exactly. That's why there was no reaction. But what if Mr. Sirone integrated with them?"

Mixing in with those who wandered the streets without meaning or purpose.

Sirone, who had trained mental techniques to the extreme, could move in a state of indifference.

"Probably. The residents here are integrated, but they're actually just empty shells without minds."

Only the concept of integration remained.

"Understood."

As Sirone immediately erased his mind, Sein felt an eerie sensation.

'Perfect indifference. The current Sirone exists only through the functions of mind and body.'

Sirone said.

"Then I'll begin."

Though the words came from his mouth, the tone was devoid of emotion like a machine.

As he walked toward where the residents were, they bowed their heads and greeted Sirone.

"Hello, Mr. Sirone."

Sirone listened to their words indifferently, then at some point quietly opened his mouth.

"Hello, Mr. Sirone."

All the residents in the world stopped dead.

Sirone's group anxiously watched the world caught in perfect silence as if time had stopped.

Arius said.

"Ymir's unconscious has reacted. Something here..."

At that moment, golden light emanated from the residents' bodies, shooting toward the sky.

"Idea?"

It was a massive hexa created by the 10 billion Gaians that comprised Ymir.

A giant voice came from the sky.

*You who do not belong to us, we deny your existence. Leave this world.*

In reality, heaven and earth would have shaken, but here, only Sirone's group suffered.

"Urgh!"

*Deny! Deny! Deny!*

As the entire world created waves and pressed in, Sirone's group was endlessly pushed back.

They quickly regained their composure, but had already been pushed back several kilometers, and Miro deployed her avatar technique.

'Thousand-Armed Guanyin.'

The avatar of Thousand-Armed Guanyin, growing endlessly large, clapped its palms together.

A tremendous explosive sound erupted, but it couldn't block the force defined by this entire world.

"Sirone! Break the Ultima!"

Sirone responded mechanically, regaining his mind from where he had been mixed among the residents.

'I deny the denial.'

The Ultima System instantly split in two, and the explosive force generated from that...

Was enough to devastate the world.

As the landscape radiated like thorns, all structures crumbled to dust and residents screamed.

"Kieeeee! Kieeeee!"

Forms positioned between humans and dummies clutched their heads in agony, creating a spine-chilling terror.

"It's broken! What do we do now?"

Sirone had caught up with Miro's group, but that area was also saturated with residents.

"Fight!"

With the weakest, Arius, positioned in the center, the others surrounded him and formed a defensive formation.

And toward them, countless residents began charging.

"Get out! Get out!"

A resident thrust their white face forward and raised a crude spherical fist.

'How strong are they?'

Being Ymir's mind, they would have power equivalent to what he felt toward Gaians.

*Kwaaaaang!*

Gaold's form scattered in the shockwave after directly blocking the resident's strike.

"Gaold!"

As Kang Nan tried to approach, Gaold, still gripping the spherical fist, revealed himself.

"I'm fine. This much is manageable."

"The graveyard of gods."

Arius said.

"This world is just the shell of Ultima. In the end, within Ymir's mind, no existence can be stronger than Ymir himself."

What followed was continuous battle.

Air Press crushed down and Hand of God backhanded the residents.

'Too many. This won't end like this.'

When fatigue appeared on the group's faces, Ruber, who hadn't acted until then, spoke.

"I'll do it."

Flying up to the sky, he spread both arms left and right, creating rings of light in front of each palm.

"Dream Machine."

With the condition of being inside a mental world, the Dream Walker could convert all dreams into objects.

However, the farther from the REM domain, the lower the grade of objects that could be summoned.

'The 5th depth level makes it possible.'

In the level just below the REM domain, the object Ruber summoned was a small wooden box.

"⟨Zhuangzi's Butterfly⟩."

Though unimpressive in appearance, if extracted to reality, it would be a dangerous item beyond any grade classification.

"Awaken from the dream."

As he opened the box, all Gaians remaining in this world began dissolving into particles of light.

"Wh-what?"

⟨Zhuangzi's Butterfly⟩ was one of three specially handled dreams by the Drimo administration.

A kind of enlightenment.

If brought to reality, its effect would be 'momentarily transcending the photon system.'

"Urgh!"

As Drimo shook from the shock of summoning, the aftereffect directly hit Ruber, who was its avatar.

Still, he didn't close the box.

'Not enough yet. Just a little more!'

What ⟨Zhuangzi's Butterfly⟩ actually attacked wasn't the residents but Ymir's mind.

However, even in the unconscious, it was the 5th depth level, so delivering massive shock was impossible.

"Mr. Ruber! Any more is dangerous!"

Sirone shouted, but Ruber seemed determined to endure with the box open.

"Sirone! Over there!"

As Miro pointed to the sky, everyone looked up.

The floating light particles moved chaotically, then began gathering into a single point in the sky.

A giant voice was heard.

*I deny.*

As everyone crouched and covered their ears, Ruber screamed and crashed down.

"Aaaaah!"

The box closed by itself, ignoring his grip strength, and a pillar of light struck the ground like an awl.

*Kuuuuuuung!*

Feeling vibration for the first time since entering the 5th depth level, Sirone looked ahead.

"Huh?"

There stood Maclean Guffin with steel-like hair and a beast-like intense impression.

"Guffin?"

As Sirone muttered, the group turned around.

"What?"

"It's Maclean Guffin."

Miro stared intently at Guffin's face.

Though she couldn't remember, she discovered her heart was beating frighteningly fast.

'Does the heart remember?'

"Focus."

Gaold interrupted.

"He's moving."

As Guffin slowly approached, Miracle Stream rose and shot toward the sky.

"Hand of God."

A gigantic hand, on a completely different dimension from what Sirone deployed, dominated the entire sky.

To be continued in the next volume.
