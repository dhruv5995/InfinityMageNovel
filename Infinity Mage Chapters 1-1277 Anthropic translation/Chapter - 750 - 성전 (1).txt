[750] Holy War (1)

The Kingdom of Tormia.

Heading south from the capital Bashka, you reach the Mapal region, known for its mining districts.

Though it was an important area responsible for 45 percent of the kingdom's iron ore production, it was relatively underdeveloped.

In other words, it suffered the most severe damage from demons, and currently hundreds of war orphans in Mapal were struggling with extreme hunger.

"Here, over here."

In a place where collapsed mine shafts had turned into abandoned mines, there was a small hut where workers used to eat and sleep.

When seven children from Dorkin Orphanage opened the door, a woman with disheveled hair and a gaunt appearance was waiting inside.

"You've come."

Though she now wandered the world with nowhere to turn, she had once been the Minister of Spectrum for Radum.

Flarino of the Flower tribe.

When the ancient weapon 'Saenghwa' broke, a powerful shock struck her mind, but she ultimately survived.

Her position as head of Radum made her an enemy of the kingdom, and this abandoned mine in Mapal was where she had hidden away.

"Hello? Are you hungry? Eat this."

The orphanage children wrapped up leftover food in a bundle and handed it to her.

Flarino, who had been hurriedly stuffing the food into her stomach, felt the children's gazes and bowed her head.

"Thank you for always taking care of me like this."

Her extreme passivity made it impossible for even children to treat her carelessly, and the children found this curious.

"It's fine. Even the dogs at our orphanage eat this stuff."

The delusion that if one was simply beautiful and obedient to their master's words, they too would risk their lives to protect you.

That delusion, which only flowers could have, was the tribe's greatest failure.

"So what should we do now?"

"Let's play hide and seek. Flarino, you find us."

Still, children were pure, so Flarino could stay here comfortably for a long time.

"Yes. Then I'll look for you."

Just as the children were about to take Flarino's hand and leave the hut, the door opened and a boy a head taller than his peers entered.

"Hey, you guys!"

Though the orphanage only accepted children up to twelve years old, his face easily looked sixteen.

Lying about age was common, and Director Dorkin also needed someone to control the children.

"Ugh! What, what is it?"

Though he knew about the hut situation but hadn't cared, they didn't understand why he was suddenly scowling like a goblin.

"Everyone follow me. The director wants you to bring that woman."

Dorkin Orphanage.

It was a newly established orphanage that opened when the altar was activated, and the director was a man over 60 named Dorkin.

'Children are truly awful.'

The reason this man, who had experienced all of life's hardships, bothered to establish an orphanage was because of the subsidies provided by the kingdom.

'But it's quite profitable.'

Success comes from crisis.

"Director, I brought that woman."

According to rumors, she was a bit simple-minded and would listen to whatever the children told her to do.

Dorkin, who also thought the children were a bit simple-minded, had dismissed it, but a report from a sixteen-year-old was not something to take lightly.

"Tell her to come in."

When he spoke in a kindly voice, the door opened and Flarino entered with an awkward expression.

"Oh ho?"

Dorkin's eyes immediately changed.

If she had just been an idiot, he would have thought to stick her in the orphanage and make her do menial work, but even among nobles, such beauty was extremely rare.

'Is she a prostitute who went mad?'

Watching Flarino as she kept her gaze down in fear, he stood up from his seat.

"So, you stole and ate food from our orphanage?"

To be precise, it was dog food.

"Yes. Thank you for helping me."

When she meekly took a submissive stance, Dorkin also revealed his hidden emotions and raised his hand.

"Then you know well what you need to do."

"......"

Flarino had no choice but to accept a new master, but suddenly there was a commotion outside.

"What, what are you, mister!"

The moment she saw the face of the man roughly opening the door and entering, Flarino's shoulders trembled violently.

The shock from when Saenghwa was broken came flooding back completely.

"How, how did you find this place?"

It was Rufist, the Chairman of Tormia's Magic Association.

"How did I find this place? I've known from the beginning where you are and what you've been doing."

He had just been lying low for a while to avoid the attention of the ivory tower.

"The seed of Saenghwa, where did you put it? Have you already planted it?"

For Flarino, he was like a natural predator, a terror, and as she slowly backed away, Dorkin stepped forward.

"Hey, what are you? Are you this woman's sugar daddy or something?"

With his scarred face and considering the conversation they'd heard, it was a perfect situation for misunderstanding.

"You shut up. I'm taking this woman."

Having once ruled the back alleys, Dorkin couldn't simply hand over the woman.

"Look at this young punk's attitude? You, do you know where this is? This is a kingdom-designated place directly supported by the royal palace...!"

When Rufist swung the back of his hand, Dorkin's head crashed straight into the wall with a bang.

"Owwwww...!"

Ignoring the old man crouched and trembling, Rufist strode toward Flarino.

"Did you... come to kill me?"

"Kill you? Why would I kill such a talented person?"

For the project being conducted at Yongroe to succeed, the more Flower tribe members, the better.

"Just hand over the seed of Saenghwa. If you obediently follow instructions, I'll guarantee your safety as Magic Association Chairman."

Dorkin turned his head, forgetting even his pain.

"Ma, Magic Association Chairman?"

It was surprising enough that the Magic Association Chairman had come to this crumbling town, but the fact that the reason was because of a woman was shocking.

'Just who is that woman?'

Flarino spoke with trembling jaw.

"You're just going to... break it again anyway..."

To her, Rufist was terror itself.

"I'm going to gather the Flower tribe members. I'll provide a village where you can live. And there's work to be done."

"Work to be done...?"

It was such exceptional treatment that she expected the price to be miserable, but Rufist spoke unexpected words.

"We're going to build a flower garden."

Of course, what would be planted there wouldn't be beautiful flowers, but ancient weapons made of steel.

"......"

"Think carefully. It's an alliance. This is probably the only and last chance for your Flower tribe to survive."

No answer came back, but reading Flarino's eyes, Rufist turned around.

"Follow me. We're going to the capital."

As the two headed for the door, Dorkin hurriedly got up.

"Th, there... Chairman."

If today's events reached his superiors, the orphanage would close that very day and he would be headed for prison.

Rufist warned from the doorway.

"These are sensitive times. I don't know what kind of trash you are, but don't get too carried away."

Dorkin immediately understood his meaning.

"Yes! I'm sorry! This will never happen again."

It would be a lie to say it wasn't disgusting, but Rufist said no more and went outside.

'Every organization lacks people. Right now, we can't afford to be picky about trash or criminals.'

According to Rufist's system theory, humans were like machines that only worked when coins were inserted.

Even humans like Dorkin would provide the labor force society demanded once money was invested.

'Orphans are also future resources. It's good to have minimal arrangements in place to manage them.'

Even if it was a corrupted system, once money had been invested, the kingdom couldn't afford to destroy it carelessly.

'That guy will never understand.'

Perhaps because the world was rushing toward destruction, today the face of one man, hateful as an enemy, came to mind.

"Are you really okay?"

Kang Nan, who had burst into tears while holding Gaold for a long time, suddenly sat up as if remembering something.

"If I'm not okay? Are you telling me to die?"

Gaold's body was still soaked in pain.

"You showed no signs of waking up all this time... how were you able to come back?"

"A door opened."

Though he couldn't recall the memories of the Under Coder, there was information his senses told him after returning to reality.

He had probably walked endlessly and finally crossed the boundary of the dead to enter hell.

Just in that burning pain, while countless souls around him melted in hell's flames...

"I just kept walking."

Gaold's soul, with one foot in life, never melted away, enduring only eternal pain.

"And I opened the door and came out."

When the altar opened, a spiritual realm was created, and for Gaold, that point was the end of hell.

"Is that really what you should be saying right now?"

Despite having made an unimaginable journey, his matter-of-fact tone actually left Kang Nan bewildered.

"But that's the truth."

Gaold drew deeply on his cigarette and rubbed out the ember with his fingers.

"There's no need to cause yourself pain."

"Pain..."

Gaold, who had been indifferently looking down at his fingertips, looked back at Kang Nan.

"My pain sensitivity has increased."

The moment she heard it, her heart sank, because even before falling into deep sleep, it had been unbearable pain.

"How, how do you live like that..."

Kang Nan started to sob again, but Gaold only wore a bitter smile.

"Pain is the only proof of life. No one in this world is as intensely alive as I am."

"But in that condition..."

Just as Kang Nan was about to speak, the screams of the dead reached the lowest level of the pyramid.

"...Zulu seems to have finished."

Gaold realized just from the sound, and shortly after, Zulu entered the room.

"The demons have been completely eliminated."

Kang Nan tried to explain that Gaold had awakened, but Zulu already knew through the pyramid's vibrations.

"...You've returned."

"Thanks to you. I owe you again this time."

"Wandering through hell. It wouldn't have been meaningless time for you. What did you bring back?"

Through unimaginable hardships, what had he realized - was it Nane or Sirone?

"Nothing special."

Gaold clenched his palm.

"I just became stronger."

Zulu nodded and pulled up a chair to sit beside Gaold's bed.

"Then you must decide where to use that strength."

Zulu calmly recounted everything that had happened since Gaold had fallen into deep sleep.

Though Gaold showed no particular reaction, his eyebrows twitched when he heard about the Zion Project.

"It's chaos. Nothing is decided, only everyone's beliefs collide."

"Nane is right."

Kang Nan's eyes shook at Gaold's words.

"If not a single person remains, it could be called this world's true happy ending."

No one to feel wronged, no emotions to feel wronged with.

"Then you just need to go to Nane."

Since Gaold was undoubtedly the most painful person in the universe, it was natural for him to agree with Nane's thinking.

"But... Miro is opposing Nane."

Gaold's face contorted.

'Obsession.'

Even knowing that he could be freed from pain by simply closing his eyes, he had walked endlessly through hell's flames.

'Nane is salvation.'

Ultimately, the void where everyone disappeared was the only way Gaold could break the chains of obsession.

"Haah..."

A reckless, arrogant filly of a woman who knew nothing about a man's true feelings.

"Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh."

The more he thought about it, the more pathetic it seemed, and hollow laughter burst out.

"I'm really going crazy."

Having made his decision, Gaold suddenly raised his head.

"I just need to crush this guy called Nane?"

Zulu and Kang Nan didn't answer, but they knew there would be no changing his mind.

Gaold's heart was also larger than the universe.
