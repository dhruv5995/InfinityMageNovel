Rain (2)

"Huh?"

"Rain."

Lian, who had lowered his weapon, looked up at the sky.

Trapped within an incomprehensible dome-shaped barrier, he could see particles of light falling from the sky.

"No, is it light?"

The demon realm that Gaitan had opened was completely annihilated without a trace by the pouring light.

"Wh-what is that?"

The survivors trapped in the dome began to rise one by one and pointed at the black clouds.

Part of some flying object of immeasurable size was visible beyond the clouds.

'This isn't good.'

Lian was worried about Sirone, but he didn't dare venture outside the blue dome.

It was a downpour of such power that it had completely stripped away buildings 10 meters high in less than a minute.

Dying aside, the moment he stepped outside, his body would be crushed to nothing without a trace.

Most of all, there was a scene that made him certain that the current phenomenon was caused by Sirone.

Ratatatatata!

Each time the particles of light that roared and destroyed the world touched the surface of objects, light flashed.

That light, so beautiful it hurt the eyes, was glowing in the precise shape of hexagons.

"Hexagon."

From the spire of the Great Temple, Taeseong watched the events unfolding in the Gustav Empire.

On the planet visible below the glass floor, Yahweh's clouds were covering the empire.

"Terraforce."

And cutting through those black clouds, a massive spaceship the size of half the empire was approaching.

Thud! Thud!

Feeling vibrations from the floor, Taeseong turned around.

"You are..."

"The administrator of Gaia."

Gray skin, an elongated head front to back, large eyes covered in an oily sheen, and a pointed jaw.

It was a 3-meter-tall alien creature awkwardly swinging its thin arms as it approached - the Terraforce Chief Justice.

"You've come in person."

"The Hexagon program has been activated. According to user protection protocols, Terraforce is sending an ark."

The Chief Justice stood beside Taeseong and looked at the terrestrial scene displayed on the screen.

Taeseong asked.

"What is Hexagon?"

"It is presumed to be a unit of the Ultima System and a type of annihilation code. Hexagon's signal corresponds one-to-one with all information, erasing the source of the Akashic Records."

The Chief Justice continued speaking while watching the scene of the world's information being erased by the rain of light.

"This is the second time I've witnessed a minor purification with my own eyes."

"It happened in the age of Gaia. The fact that the ark has come - does this mean we're selecting two people again?"

"Nothing can stop Hexagon. Even the electromagnetic barrier will eventually break. We must select two people before that happens."

A man and a woman - only two humans would board the ark and emigrate to another planet.

"Yahweh's wrath will grow greater and cover the entire planet. It's over. He has closed this world."

"Though it's not an eternal end."

That's why it was called a minor purification.

"Hmm, the selected man and woman will eventually settle on another planet and call forth countless users."

The Chief Justice turned to look at Taeseong.

"Just as the two Gaians selected in the ancient minor purification made humanity flourish on this land."

Taeseong remained silent.

"I understand they're here? The only Gaian remaining in the photon system, the first human of this planet."

"He is no longer human. He exists only as a brain containing memories."

It was a choice he had made himself.

"So, who are the man and woman selected this time?"

"We're reviewing many combinations. There are roughly 300 candidates. The council will make a decision soon."

"Two people having to open a new world together - that's too harsh. Who are the candidates?"

"For example, Miro and Havitz."

Taeseong looked at the Chief Justice with drowsy eyes.

"The ultimate good and ultimate evil?"

"It's the best method to maintain the system. Miro will understand. The errors of the past must not be repeated."

The first humans made a mistake.

"You mean Eve."

"She broke the rules. She tried to become everyone's mother. In the end, Eve's partner..."

Lives on as a brain, unable to perish.

"In any case, that combination cannot succeed. If it were the old Miro, perhaps, but now she's different. She won't accept anyone but Gaold."

"That's why they're candidates. We'll examine them closely first. Currently, the council has Ethera and Shagal in mind."

"Ethera and Shagal?"

It was a truly puzzling combination, but after thinking for a moment, Taeseong understood.

"Perhaps that could work."

Only when the Terraforce Chief Justice personally came leading the ark did it truly sink in.

"Once again, it's ending."

The Chief Justice placed a hand on Taeseong's shoulder.

"Don't be disappointed. This is just a stage of trial and error. Someday humanity will reach the ultimate."

"Is it really possible - a perfect world?"

A world with nothing left to fix.

"Whatever a god creates is merely the god's perfection. True perfection is when we become gods."

Humans must define it.

"That's why gods are indifferent and don't interfere with this world. What they can send from outside is at most..."

The Chief Justice focused on Sirone.

"A signal borrowing a human body."

"Is that Yahweh?"

"If the one most distant from humans is Buddha, then Yahweh is the one closest to god. That's what loving all things means, but Sirone is ultimately just human."

Faced with the eternal suffering of the Holy Sound, even Sirone had no choice but to choose emptiness over universal love.

"This time we'll start with a different combination. We'll select the best two people. There's still plenty of time."

Easily hundreds of billions of years remain.

"Search for a planet where the ark can arrive. Preferably as far from here as possible."

"Yes."

If it was providence for maintaining the system, he had no choice but to follow, but Taeseong's heart ached as if it were tearing.

'Sirone...'

Was it his imagination that the droplets of light annihilating the world seemed like Sirone's tears?

'Are you really planning to end it like this?'

The 8th Corps Commander Miturah was engaged in close combat with the five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower above the sea.

Countless demons were guarding nearby, but they didn't dare interfere in the violent battle.

"Th-this..."

The combined attack of humanity's four strongest mages was terrifying, and Miturah couldn't avoid struggling.

"Commander! Open the demon realm!"

When his frustrated subordinates shouted, Miturah's face twisted viciously.

'Damn bastards! Since it's not their problem...'

If he opened the demon realm, he would perish eternally.

'Should I really just open it?'

While sword-fighting with Freed, such thoughts suddenly occurred to him.

"Grrk!"

Sting's law bound Miturah's limbs, and Amanta's wheel struck his head as it passed.

With a bang, just as Miturah's head turned and he looked fiercely back to the front.

Kiiiiiiing!

Minerva's jet struck his solar plexus.

"Graaah!"

Pushed back several kilometers by the force, flying demons hurriedly followed behind.

"Commander! Quickly, the demon realm..."

"Aaaah! Shut up!"

The heads of innocent demons were torn off.

"This is driving me crazy."

A special being who received the authority of the demon realm upon birth.

Miturah had considerable pride in that, but when the moment actually came, he couldn't muster the resolve.

'Return to eternal nothingness just like this?'

What was Amon thinking when he opened the demon realm?

"Unexpectedly timid."

As the four Great Stars pursued Miturah, flying side by side, Minerva spoke.

"That's why demons fear Buddha. Unless they can resurrect from hellfire, it's the same as dying."

Freed snorted.

"Such a coward is actually serving as a corps commander."

Sting said.

"Other than containing only the nature of evil, they're essentially no different from humans. We should be able to defeat him easily."

"Don't be too careless. If we get blindsided, it becomes troublesome from then on."

Unlike the Great Stars preparing for contingencies, Miturah's heart didn't change course easily.

'This won't do. I must open the demon realm for Satan's sake. Open it, open it, open it!'

Flames shot up from Miturah's eyes.

It didn't seem to be time yet.

"Damn! Let's fight a little more! I can win!"

Just as he was steeling his fighting spirit, a massive fireball came flying and exploded on the water's surface.

Melania looked toward the horizon.

"Yahweh's tears."

The roar of light particles striking the entire empire and destroying objects was enough to evoke thoughts of the apocalypse.

Even Melania's black umbrella wouldn't last long, but her expression was calm.

"This kind of ending isn't bad either."

According to the doctrine of the Underworld, when Yahweh's tears overflow in the world, demons perish.

Indeed it was so.

The power contained in the rain of light was more than enough to sweep away all the demons in the empire.

"Do you know why we hate you?"

Melania approached Sirone and slowly extended her hand to caress a particle of Hexagon.

Pop pop pop pop pop!

In the striking light, her hand instantly burst apart.

"If I don't do this..."

The black umbrella disappeared, and in that state, Melania embraced Sirone's body.

"You won't look at us."

Countless droplets of light struck her body.

"What can we do about being born this way?"

Even with a corps commander's durability, she could only endure a few minutes longer than other demons.

"What is love?"

Neither demons nor Havitz know how to love.

"I could die for you. If you wanted, I could even kill Satan. But..."

Waiting for Sirone's answer, she opened her mouth with a sad smile.

"I really don't know what that is."

As her beautiful face collapsed, her body began to be shaved away from above.

Sirone said nothing.

"You came?"

Sirone, existing only as a signal, moved quickly toward the source of the voice.

"Where is this?"

Hexagonal particles rapidly assembled and began to transform into human form.

"I don't know. Must be the afterlife."

In front of Sirone sat Augent Gai in a cross-legged position, chin resting on his hand.

"The afterlife?"

Sirone confirmed that a single ray of light flying from the distant darkness was connected to Gai.

"You can see this light too? It's not pulling me, but it keeps calling - it's unpleasant. An irresistible temptation, you could say?"

Sirone examined his own body but found nothing connected anywhere.

"Coming here, I understand something. This is probably the true nature of Idea. So it seems only I died. Ah, but you dying is the same thing."

"We... died?"

He had no memory after being stabbed by Gai's sword.

'Is this a dream?'

It didn't feel like reality.

"I'd like to explain in detail, but there's no way to explain it. That's the kind of signal being sent. Anyway, the reason I waited for you is because I want to make a proposal."

"What kind of proposal when we're already dead?"

"You can return alive."

Even if it was a dream, these were words he couldn't ignore.

"Hah, how do I explain this? So, if I don't follow this light, you can live. Should I say I'm giving you my place? Should I say there's one spot left? Anyway, that's the feeling."

"I don't understand what you're saying. And why would you save me? You have no reason to."

"You really don't remember what you did at all, do you?"

"What did I do?"

Gai burst into laughter and asked with a raised corner of his mouth.

"So, has your anger cooled down a bit now?"
