[409] Task Force (1)

Magic Association.

Investigator Sakiri from the Inspection Department 3, who had previously interrogated Canis and Arin, was heading to the special criminal detention facility in the basement of the association.

Beside him walked Blener, the Third Director of the National Intelligence Service.

The Third Department of the National Intelligence Service was the Daecheon Information Management Division, a secretive organization composed entirely of black agents whose ranks were not disclosed to civilians.

The reason the head of such a department had personally visited the association was to obtain one item that could thwart Gaold's plans.

Namely, the confession of Third-Class Grand Mage Isabel.

"What a problem, what a problem. That Gaold fellow. A disgrace to the kingdom, I tell you. I never liked him from the start. Making everyone miserable and then slipping away all by himself."

Sakiri wasn't fooled by Blener's good-natured appearance.

It was a fact known to everyone in the Inspection Department that Lupist, the current interim Magic Association president, had lobbied Blener.

"That Isabel woman is really vicious too. With such a pretty face and all, tsk tsk. This is why mages are no good."

It wasn't pleasant for a mage to hear a non-mage badmouth mages.

Especially when the target of the slander was a publicly recognized Third-Class Grand Mage he had always respected.

But Sakiri didn't show his emotions. When necessary, he could easily shut off his feelings like this.

"I heard you're the best in this field. Cook her up as you please. I'll handle the aftermath. Make sure you get that woman to talk."

"It won't be easy. Even if she's non-combat personnel, she's still a Grand Mage. She's absolutely not someone who would commit perjury out of fear of pain."

"Hehe, that's exactly why I called you. Sakiri of Inspection Department 3, who can break any criminal down to the bone once he gets his hands on them."

"I'll do my best."

Sakiri answered halfheartedly while lost in thought.

Interim President Lupist had long considered Gaold a thorn in his side. If he had his way, he would want to mobilize the association's entire force to eliminate Gaold.

'But things didn't go as planned.'

He had seized the opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished wish, but the problem was that Gaold's reputation within the association wasn't as bad as expected.

A madman, but therefore pure, and though his temperament was terrible, he was stronger than anyone.

And this was certainly beyond Lupist's calculations.

The incident where Isabel risked her life to protect Gaold at the National Emergency Hearing left considerable unease among the association's mages.

Someone who wasn't part of Gaold's inner circle had claimed Gaold's innocence.

Moreover, if it was the guarantee of publicly recognized Third-Class Isabel, regardless of the facts, it would shake the standards of judgment.

Lupist, with victory in sight, became desperate.

He needed justification to mobilize the association's forces to eliminate Gaold and become the official association president, so he reached out to Blener, the Third Director of the National Intelligence Service.

'That's the conclusion I've reached. But...'

Questions still remained.

Forcing perjury and torturing a certified mage was dangerous even for the National Intelligence Service. So how exactly had this been approved?

'Who's behind this?'

Sakiri subtly probed Blener's intentions.

"How far should I take the confession? That Isabel was actually part of Gaold's inner circle and that's why she protected himâ€”would that be sufficient?"

"Hmm, shouldn't it be a bit stronger than that? Something like actively planning the assassination attempt on His Majesty would do. Whether she designed it or circulated funds, handle that as you see fit."

'He's planning to completely destroy her.'

What would happen in the basement today must not be known by anyone. The plan was to cut off every branch that could be cut.

This was why Sakiri was handling the interrogation alone without even an observer.

"As long as she doesn't die, you can do whatever you want, just get the confession. I've installed video recording devices. Then take out Obscura B and bring it to me. And you'll get a special promotion."

'So that's what this is about.'

The final puzzle piece fell into place in Sakiri's mind.

The torture process of the beautiful Grand Mage would be recorded in its entirety. What better snuff film could there be for old politicians who had joined depraved social circles?

It was just for such a reason.

Outside, an assassination attempt on the king was unfolding, the Magic Association president was changing, and the world was about to be turned upside down, but someone was simply indulging in their hobbies.

'Perhaps this too is quintessentially human.'

Sakiri understood.

If humans have the ability to do something, they are beings who will do it.

Upon arriving at the special criminal detention cell, Sakiri fixed his gaze on the iron door.

Perhaps having heard something, Blener didn't show interest in what was happening inside the iron door either.

"Well then, I'm counting on you. Handle it as quickly as possible. We need the confession within 48 hours."

48 hours.

"Don't worry. I've climbed this far with just this one skill."

Blener patted Sakiri's shoulder trustingly and turned around.

Only when the footsteps echoing in the corridor disappeared did Sakiri place his hand on the iron door's security device.

As he entered the Spirit Zone, the iron door's lock read his personal information and clicked open.

Pulling open the half-opened iron door and entering, he saw Isabel sitting on a series chair installed against the wall of the dark prison.

The model employee of the Magic Association who had always maintained a neat appearance and took pride in it.

But now she had become a shabby criminal with disheveled hair covering her face and mana control device handcuffs on both wrists placed on her knees.

Two on the left and right sides, and one positioned away from the iron door. A total of three video recording devices were installed.

Only the one in front was blinking with a red light, recording Isabel's condition for several days.

"It feels strange meeting in a place like this."

Isabel showed no reaction.

She was just slumped like a corpse, repeating empty breaths.

Sakiri paid no attention and checked the video recording devices while unbuttoning his sleeves.

"Do you know what's the most frightening thing I've realized in life? That humans are granted infinite freedom. It's really true. No matter how absurd something is, humans can do it."

After confirming that the left video recording device was off, Sakiri moved to the right wall.

"Would it be impossible to strangle the child you love more than your own eyes? If you think so, isn't that too foolish a belief? No matter how much you love them, you just do it. That's exactly what human freedom is."

After checking the second device, Sakiri looked into the lens of the last device that was on in front and said:

"Resetting Obscura B for record storage."

When he pressed the button, the device turned off and prepared to restart.

Only after all three video recording devices were turned off did Isabel raise her head. Eyes that had given up hope confirmed Sakiri's face.

"Come to think of it, tomorrow is the anniversary of my first son's death."

Sakiri was currently a father of two daughters, but originally had one more son. However, that son suffered from Trice disease, which caused his entire body to rot, when he was two years old, and died two years later.

Sakiri was an Irregular.

"Well, I guess this is what life is. Shall we begin?"

When he flipped the switch installed on the wall, the incandescent lights on the ceiling turned on, brightening the prison like broad daylight.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

Then the walls opened in succession, expanding the prison to the length of the corridor.

Every torture tool and equipment that humans could imagine was arranged there.

"Usually torture chambers are decorated darkly, but I prefer bright ones. Torture is also a kind of communion. You'll feel dirty watching your body get destroyed, but just give up."

Sakiri picked up scissors to cut the prisoner's uniform and examined the blade.

"What should we start with? What are you weak to? Pain? Foreign sensations? Fear? Physical deformation? Shame?"

Isabel spoke in a calm voice.

"How considerate of you, Sakiri."

"I'll take that as profanity. There's nothing good about provoking before we even start. We should start with water torture. For the show, it's better if the body is clean first."

"If not... why are you conflicted?"

Sakiri's hand movements with the scissors stopped.

"Conflicted?"

"You should know. No matter what you do to me, I won't retract my statement from the hearing. But your Irregular 'Scales of Truth' is an exception. I don't know the activation conditions, but there's no need to waste time with such child's play, is there?"

Sakiri, who had been silently staring at the scissors, sighed and turned around.

"Hah, this one and that one, all just talk."

Clang!

The scissors fell irritably back to their original place.

Sakiri stood still for a moment, then slowly turned his body to look down at Isabel.

"...Why did you do it?"

Isabel tilted her head slightly as if she didn't understand the meaning.

"Why Gaold? You're not even part of his inner circle. Whether it's Gaold or Lupist, they're the same in using the association for personal purposes. Lupist who seized the association to gain power, Gaold who became association president for revenge. So why did you protect Gaold?"

Isabel's answer was simple.

"I don't know either."

"You don't know?"

"Sakiri, I don't know either. It wasn't a decision I made after thinking. Yes, as you said, both Gaold and Lupist are equally self-centered humans. Yet the reason I chose Gaold is..."

Isabel thought for a moment, then smiled bitterly.

"I just liked Gaold a little more than Lupist. That's all."

"..."

Sakiri clicked his jaw joints left and right.

Then, turning his body back toward the shelf with torture tools, his face was contorted like someone in pain.

'Damn it. There was such an easy way.'

Since when had the name "mage" come to be called a politician's dog?

Were there no longer any iron-willed intellectuals left in the association who fought to uphold what they believed was right?

"...48 hours."

Sakiri picked up a torture tool that looked like a 20-centimeter awl.

"In 48 hours, Lupist will move the association regardless of public opinion. Of course, if you commit perjury before then, the time will be shortened."

Isabel hadn't even considered such a situation.

"48 hours. That's quite tight."

"That's how anxious Lupist is too. He'd prefer to become association president with the support of a majority of association members, but as long as Gaold is alive, even his current position is precarious. In other words, the longer you hold out, the more time Gaold can buy."

Sakiri poked the awl with his fingertips, then suddenly looked back at Isabel with cold eyes.

"I'll preserve at least your final dignity as a human being, as a woman. It's not because I have good feelings toward you. I just don't want to cater to the tastes of perverted old men as a mage. However, the pain will be considerable."

Isabel didn't care. She was just lost in thought, looking up at the ceiling, oblivious to the terrible time ahead.

'Hehe, Gaold. Really, how much trouble are you going to cause for so many people?'

Yes, why was it?

Why had she defended Gaold, who had nothing to do with her?

'Perhaps I too was bewitched by your madness.'

The video recording device restarted and lit up.

After activating the remaining two devices, Sakiri stood where all three focuses were captured and announced the start of the official interrogation.

"I will now begin the interrogation of Isabel, former Magic Library manager of the Magic Association."

Life appeared in Isabel's eyes for the first time.

'Go, Gaold. Beyond good and evil, beyond humanity's future, go to the ultimate realm that humans can reach.'

Sakiri grabbed Isabel's hair and violently yanked it up.

His eyes bulged as he stared at her delicate nape.

'48 hours from now. Hold out.'

Screams echoed through the detention facility corridor.
