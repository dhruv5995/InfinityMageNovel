HIGH GEAR (1)

The moment the operator ended the voice conversation, Shirone turned around and said.

"Let's go. I need to meet them right now." Fermi realized.

"You've never done anything like this before, have you? The operator's level is 487. They're ranked 4th overall in the level category. Meanwhile, you'll have to start from level 1. You don't seriously think you'll be able to use magic in High Gear, do you?"

"I have a rough idea myself. But you can't know for sure without actually fighting, right?"

Magneti's mouth fell open in bewilderment.

"Fine, listen."

Fermi said with a sigh.

"In High Gear, you gain bonus status points every time you level up. You can raise your level by hunting creatures, and it's usually proportional to playtime. Since the death penalty is severe, it's more profitable to hunt creatures lower than your own level. But the operator is both a user and an administrator. Do you know what that means?"

"Short playtime?"

"Right. Much shorter compared to other users. Yet they maintain 4th place in the rankings. This means they hunt extremely efficiently, and in other words, they're not an idiot who simply relies on level and equipment. Of course, their equipment is top-tier. And on top of that, there's the bonus status of 487."

Shirone nodded.

"I know it's disadvantageous. But I have to defeat the operator to mine The Abyss."

"No, it's not just disadvantageous..." Fermi stopped speaking.

He could say this because of his experience turning countless impossibilities into possibilities.

'Gritting your teeth in High Gear is useless. The numbers in the system are everything.'

Being more desperate doesn't change the numerical values.

"Whatever, just try playing first. Once you get inside, you'll definitely change your mind."

Shirone looked back at Magneti.

"How do I get in?"

"I can transport you to the tutorial, but first we need to create a user code. Please tell me your desired code name. However, codes already taken by other users cannot be used except in special cases." In a world he wouldn't be staying in for long anyway, the code name didn't seem to matter much.

"Well, anything will do..."

"It's best to choose your code name carefully. 80% of High Gear's customization features are free content, so it's often difficult to identify targets by appearance alone. That's why the code name becomes the user's face."

Fermi added.

"Choose something you like. It's not just about mood - it's an important element even inside High Gear."

"Then I'll go with Shirone."

He wanted to discourage using a real name, but it wasn't completely unheard of either.

"Good. Let me check." Magneti manipulated the screen and shook her head.

"It's a duplicate code. There's already a user with the code name Shirone."

"What?"

Shirone was dumbfounded.

"Someone is using my name?"

"Actually, it's common to borrow famous people's names. Most importantly, it becomes an alias for them. In Shirone's case, it would probably be traded at quite a high value."

"Even trading..."

"If you really want your real name, how about adding numbers at the end? Like Shirone1234, something like that."

That didn't seem right.

"I'm Shirone, so I don't want to use a fake one. How about Ariane Shirone?"

"Let me check."

She shook her head again.

"It's a duplicate code."

Just as his temper was about to flare, Fermi suggested.

"How about Yahweh? Of course it'll definitely be a duplicate, but at least you can add numbers. It's a specific realm after all."

He had only hoped Shirone wouldn't use his real name, but Shirone considered it seriously.

Before a conclusion was reached, Magneti checked.

"It's a duplicate code. Amazing. From Yahweh1 to Yahweh12, they're all duplicates. How about Yahweh13?" Who the hell are these people?

"If there are this many just for the name Yahweh, just how many users does High Gear have?"

Fermi said.

"Quite a lot, but not as many as you'd think. Those are all ghost users. They bring people from reality and pre-register them. Vagrants, or people with huge debts. When a user dies in reality, the reservation is released."

Shirone's eyes hardened.

"They kill people just to sell a single code name?"

"I don't know if it's just a code name..." Magneti said.

"If you don't like the numbers, I can suggest recommended codes that include the word Yahweh. These are codes analyzed from specific user patterns that haven't been claimed yet."

Magneti read the recommendation list.

"I'm the real Yahweh. Yahweh super man. Yahweh I'm just right. Female Yahweh. Annoying Ya..."

"Stop."

Magneti nodded as if understanding his feelings.

"Really incredible popularity. If these are the recommended codes, then all the decent code names must already be taken. Well, it also means you're that famous."

Fermi pointed.

"Number 1 isn't bad, right? 'I'm the real Yahweh.' The 4th one, 'Female Yahweh' is also a good concept. You can change gender using paid content."

"No. No way."

Fermi chuckled.

"Well, anyway, you seem to be getting immersed in High Gear, so that's not bad. How about this method then? Purchasing a platinum code name."

Magneti immediately added.

"Platinum code names are paid content. Since the code name appears in gold, it doesn't matter if there are duplicates. Of course, there's fierce competition for reservations here too, but since the price is quite expensive, the probability of getting a decent code name is quite high."

"How much?"

"100 million galactic."

It was the amount Fermi had received as a referral reward.

"Plus there's a purchase limit, so it's only possible once. As I said again, the code name is the user's face within High Gear."

"Hmm. What's the value of 100 million galactic? I have no sense of it at all."

"It's not low. The 100 million galactic that Lord Son of Yolgah received is the highest amount in referral rewards. The reward amount varies according to the referrer's ranking."

Magneti raised her index finger.

"But the reason 100 million can't be called high is because value varies tremendously depending on the standard. For example, if it's to fill a hungry stomach, even 1-point food wouldn't matter. But there's also 100 million point food in the world. When rarity becomes the standard, there's no limit to luxury. High Gear is the same - even minor performance differences can make values jump by 100 million times or more."

Fermi said.

"Go with platinum. Since it's money received as a referral reward, it's right to spend it on you, but to do 'normal currency exchange,' you need to clear certain sections. Most importantly, if the goal is to defeat the operator, 100 million galactic won't even cover snack money."

"Haha! That's true."

Magneti smiled with her eyes, then quickly hid her expression.

"Then let me search for codes with platinum."

She narrowed her eyes.

"Huh? Yahweh is already taken, but Yahweh2 is available. Yahweh3 and Yahweh4 are also taken, but Yahweh2 being empty means..."

Fermi said.

"The user probably died."

"Yes. Actually, quite a lot of codes have been deleted since the psychic realm opened. Of course, reservations have increased as well in return. This was probably deleted recently."

Fermi recommended to Shirone.

"How about going with this? Even if it's not the original, this is worth investing 100 million galactic in."

Shirone's eyes looked hollow.

"Yahweh2..."

He felt like he could somewhat understand why people obsess over code names.

Magneti consoled him.

"You might not like it, but there's hope. You can become a ranker in the duel category. If you just get into the top 100, you get the privilege of changing your code name. Even if it's another user's code name, rankers get exclusive rights."

"Yes, I'll go with Yahweh2. The code name doesn't matter anyway, so please let me in now."

Fermi looked at his wristwatch.

"Then I'll log in soon too. When the tutorial ends, come straight to a city called Atogram. Let's meet tomorrow evening at the Freedom Square there."

Since it was a world without magic, no matter how fast he traveled, it would take half a day.

Fermi requested from Magneti.

"I'll depart first. Please send me with the avatar's memory. Code name is Son of Yolgah."

"Transmitting. The last remembered location is Lightning Mountain Range, Giant Machine's Graveyard."

A circular blue light formed under Fermi's feet, and his body decomposed into thin air.

Shirone, who had been watching this with fascination, turned his head at Magneti's words.

"Then I'll register Yahweh2 as the user code. You'll be transported automatically once the avatar scan is complete."

A circular ring also formed under Shirone's feet, but it didn't decompose as quickly as Fermi's.

He felt a strange sense of restraint.

"This feels a bit uncomfortable."

"You're sensitive indeed. Users connecting to High Gear have special coding embedded in their avatars. Without it, we can't synchronize the simulation's numerical values. Restrictions are also placed on the avatar. It's a kind of lock mechanism - without it, events can't be triggered. Also, if you willfully destroy the system, you'll be considered an illegal user and lose all rights, so be careful."

"Does that happen often?"

"No. In High Gear's history, there have been zero users who destroyed the system with avatar techniques. But this time is different."

He was the real Yahweh.

As the explanation ended, Shirone's avatar began dissolving like foam.

Just before leaving, something came to mind.

"Um, Miss Magneti. Thank you for earlier. Thanks to you, I was able to contact the operator..."

"There you go again."

Magneti rested her chin on the table and smiled with her eyes.

"I told you, didn't I? This is a fake world. Fake names, fake faces, all kinds of lies run rampant here. If you overlook that, no matter how strong you are, you'll suffer quite a bit."

"But you understood my sincerity. Miss Magneti must be a good person in reality too."

"...I'm honored."

Knowing she shouldn't, she opened her mouth.

"Mr. Shirone, this is what I think. Although the world is fake, that's precisely why the people here are real. In reality, we live bound by countless restrictions. We decorate and hide many things to avoid tarnishing our own names and faces." "But there's none of that here. High Gear is a world where the true nature of living beings is nakedly revealed. Don't expect situations like today. You too must live thoroughly as Yahweh2. So please... no matter what situation comes..."

"I hope you won't get hurt."

"Ah...?"

Shirone's voice dissolved into the air and particles of light ascended to the ceiling.

In the empty castle, Magneti's voice was heard.

"New user registration complete."
