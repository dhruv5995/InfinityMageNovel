Missing Link (4)

Holy Castle.

The maids walking through the corridors of Delta headquarters turned pale at the sight of a man.

"Kyaah!"

There sat Havitz, the Satan whose name alone now struck terror into hearts, leaning against the wall.

He had abandoned the 9 o'clock murder game.

'It doesn't matter anymore.'

When Shirone had blocked Wizard's path at 8 o'clock, that was the extent of his disillusionment.

Like parents suddenly showing up at a fairy-tale playground and throwing cold water on the children.

'Since Wizard's parent is Shirone.'

Havitz had tried to listen to Wizard's heart through God's frequency, but ultimately failed to achieve his purpose.

'That child isn't an easy opponent either.'

That's why it was still unclear whether the person Wizard loved was Shirone or himself.

"Kekekeke!"

What nonsense.

'How could I not know? Of course she loves Shirone. You can tell just by watching her actions, can't you? I'm being used.'

But on the other hand.

'I don't know, do I?'

Because he had never directly looked into her heart.

'Maybe she loves me. Maybe she's conscious of me and deliberately acts more affectionate toward Shirone.'

He knew it wasn't true.

It's just that if he didn't think that way, he felt like he might kill Wizard right now...

'Why won't she like me?'

Havitz finally had to admit what he had wanted to do with Wizard.

"Hey."

At the voice from the corridor, Havitz turned his head to see a familiar face.

"Vulcan."

His appearance was haggard, but his eyes were still alive.

Havitz looked forward again.

"What is it?"

"Your expression is terrible. Did you get rejected or something?"

"...Probably."

Vulcan plopped down next to Havitz.

"I don't think I'll live much longer. I don't even have the strength to walk anymore. Tomorrow will probably be goodbye between you and me too."

"I see. Farewell then."

Havitz spoke indifferently.

It wasn't that he was trying to be cold, but rather like a farewell greeting to a friend he met and parted with daily.

"Keke, right. Anyway, how is it? I heard you have someone you like."

"...It's not going well."

Being a taciturn friend, he could tell how much Havitz's insides were burning.

"Why? Did you get rejected?"

"She seems to show interest in me, but then suddenly turns cold."

Vulcan looked intently at Havitz.

"Well. You're an interesting guy. There may be people who hate you, but no one thinks you're boring. If someone feels bored by you..."

Blood trickled down from Vulcan's mouth.

"That would truly be boring. It means you're not being yourself."

Havitz blinked.

"You said it yourself - if you don't define anything, you'll eventually achieve what you want. Let's run around freely. You decided to live doing whatever you want."

That is chaos.

"Right."

Havitz stood up.

"I'll kill them all. Not one person per hour, but everyone I can see."

Because he had been too conscious of Wizard, Shirone was able to exploit that gap.

Vulcan smiled.

"You're ready to defeat Yahweh."

"Heh."

"Work hard at it. We'll be moving to kill you too. It'll be quite tough."

"Haha! Will it really?"

Havitz pointed his longsword at Vulcan's neck.

The two men silently stared at each other, both wearing pleasant smiles.

"Farewell, Vulcan."

Kill everyone in sight.

As Havitz's sword traced a swift yet smooth trajectory, Vulcan's head flew off.

Even as the head that fell to the floor rolled around, he calculated the odds of this gamble.

'Keke, this is how it should be fun.'

Havitz would no longer hesitate, and would become a true demon sweeping through the Holy Castle.

"Havitz."

A hoarse sound leaked from Vulcan's severed head.

"Sunset..."

Leaving that voice behind, Havitz strode away down the corridor.

He didn't ask.

Vulcan's true intention in comforting him over his heartbreak, even knowing he would die.

Was it friendship as his closest friend, or was this too a calculated move?

Havitz didn't ask.

Because that was the only pleasure that Havitz and Gustav's 4th period had shared.

"I'll kill them all."

Ten minutes after he left the corridor, cat-like nimble steps approached Vulcan.

Natasha saw the body slumped against the wall and the head lying much farther away.

Kneeling down, she embraced Vulcan's head, which wore an expression with his mouth split to the very ends in a smile.

"...That's too much."

And when she raised her head again.

"Havitz."

Her two eyes, without eyelids, contained the deepest abyss in the world.

The Holy Castle was in chaos.

"The death toll has already exceeded 20. It's presumed to be the work of Havitz, Satan."

After killing Vulcan, Havitz slaughtered humans without being constrained by anything.

The security forces were fully mobilized, and royal guards from various nations maintained iron-tight vigilance.

"Huh?"

No one could remember Havitz.

"But why are we so busy? Who are we all gathered here to stop?"

They didn't know.

The fact that Havitz was approaching them, cutting down their colleagues' necks one by one.

"Strange. What on earth is..."

A guard with his heart pierced coughed up blood and said.

"...happening?"

As deaths occurred at a rate of one per minute, the heads of the Holy Castle's five major departments held an emergency meeting.

"Havitz is running wild."

"What is Yahweh doing? Hasn't he been finding Havitz's location until now?"

Since Elicia had already been activated from the Ivory Tower, it would take time for Ultima to recharge.

Dorothy from the Military Department said.

"Right now we're aware of Havitz, but we don't know when Vanishing might activate again."

"Why did he release his ability?"

Mito Shirano from the International Court said.

"It might be mockery, but more than that, it seems like he's stimulating our fear. Dying without knowing it is actually quite unpleasant."

"This isn't the time to talk like it's someone else's problem. If we don't come up with some countermeasure, the vote will be ruined."

The chairman was on Gis's side, so he tried desperately to proceed with the vote.

Constantine from the Religious Department spoke for the first time.

"How long will we depend on Yahweh?"

"Your Holiness."

"The fundamental cause of this situation is precisely because of Yahweh. He provokes Satan under the pretext of saving humanity, yet provides no solution."

He stood up.

"I, the Rami Church, will no longer stand by and watch."

"Do you have a method?"

"Come in."

As soon as the Pope spoke, the Holy Knights of Rami Church's Anti-Demon Department burst in again.

'Now they come and go like it's their own home.'

Legally there could be issues, but with Havitz rampaging, no one raised objections.

"Yahweh deceives people by impersonating God. But God does not persuade. He is omniscient and omnipotent in himself, so from now on I will prove God's workings."

As brilliant light spread from Constantine's body, Shirano squinted one eye.

'Definitely a holy aura. Most demons wouldn't be able to leave even bones against that. But...'

She didn't underestimate Yahweh's power.

'I don't know what kind of ability it is, but even that Yahweh could only break through Havitz's Vanishing once per hour at most.'

What could the Pope be thinking?

Just then.

"This is terrible!"

When an aide holding a fairly high position entered with a pale face, the chairman was immediately annoyed.

"What's this commotion! Do you know where you are!"

"O-outside..."

"Outside? Are you talking about the protesters?"

"It's not at that level."

The aide pondered for a moment whether he should say this, then finally opened his mouth.

"It's a riot."

Although it was past 9 PM, the number of protesters in front of Delta headquarters had grown even larger.

The opposition and supporters raised their voices with a gap between them that seemed impossible to bridge.

"Impeach Gis! Investigate the truth!"

"The King of Zive as representative of the Holy Castle! Let's make Zive the world's leading nation!"

At that moment, a new current began surging through between the two factions.

"Oh Cria God! Look down upon us with mercy!"

The Anti-Demon Department that had left to investigate the pyramid was returning while chanting prayers.

Their expressions were pious, but their eyes were lifeless as if their souls had left them.

'Kill Maya.'

A procession of people advancing with only that single mission charged straight through the crowd.

"What kind of behavior is this? Even if it's the Rami Church, driving away protesters like this..."

The words didn't last long.

"Oh God."

The eyes of people near the Anti-Demon Department all lost focus simultaneously, then turned in the same direction.

"Save us."

The transmission speed of the people was so fast that in an instant, all the protesters lost their minds.

In the hearts of those who had achieved unity under the law, there was only one will.

'Kill Maya.'

It was God's will.

With 30 minutes left until the finale performance, thousands of people began surging into Delta.

"Damn! Why are they acting like that? Like they're hypnotized or something!"

The main gate security captain gave orders.

"Block them! Don't let them approach within 100 meters! Permission to kill granted!"

Faced with the procession surging like a single organism, they didn't even feel shame about killing civilians.

"Charge!"

The troops collided with the protesters.

"...Oh God."

Soon they became people who had lost their minds and turned their steps toward the Delta they had charged from.

The security captain realized the gravity of the situation.

"Report to headquarters."

"Yes!"

It didn't seem like any particular solution would emerge, but it was the best he could do.

"Ugh!"

The security captain retreated his forces to match the slowly surging crowd's pace.

'Can't fight. The moment we touch them...'

Death - that was definitely the feeling.

"God commands."

The Anti-Demon Department at the front controlling the people raised their holy swords and shouted.

"Advance!"

"Uooooooo!"

As people charged with tremendous shouts, the security captain closed his eyes tight while pointing his spear.

"Damn it!"

At that moment, dark-skinned warriors passed the security forces from Delta's headquarters direction.

It was the Southern Tribal Alliance.

"Everyone guard your hearts! Follow Yahweh's will!"

As they clashed with the Anti-Demon Department, a situation that could finally be called battle unfolded.

The security captain's eyes widened.

'H-how?'

Could they overcome a phenomenon that had instantly turned even his strong-willed subordinates?

"Stand aside."

Southern Chief Entara approached with his royal guard.

"Your Majesty."

Entara waved his hand.

"I'm not worthy of such address. Nor do I want to be. Have your men return to barracks. We'll handle this."

"I cannot do that! This gate being breached would be like death to me."

"But you might not even be able to die, right?"

He instinctively knew what that feeling was.

"Listen to me. The fact that they came here means there's something they need here. If we waste our strength here, it might be stolen at the crucial moment."

"Stolen? Who would do such a thing?"

"God."

The security captain's expression became blank.

"An indifferent god and a god with heart. And two faiths following one of them. Do you understand? From now on, the battle taking place here isn't just war."

Entara declared.

"It's a holy war."
