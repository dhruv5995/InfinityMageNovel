Smile, Smile (2)

Royal Cemetery.

Numerous screams were being born in this resting place of the silent dead.

Lights came on one by one in the houses, but no one could come outside.

"Charge! Charge!"

Zenia kept urging them forward.

'It's not far away.'

An intense wave strong enough to make every hair stand on end was drawing Silver Bone's instincts toward it.

"Argh! You bastards!"

Every time Pourer swung his mega gun in all directions, they could hear the wet sound of flesh bursting from the cloud-like masses of smoke.

"Die! Human!"

Though Vesika was the lowest rank among purebloods, their power was on a completely different level from the half-breeds.

"Power pack!"

As the drug's effect wore off, Katein quickly prepared medicine on the spot and injected it into the hunters' necks.

Their heads spun for a moment, then the world seemed to slow down compared to before.

"Let's go!"

With their pain reduced by half, the hunters equipped with metal gear swung their weapons and carved out a path.

After a bloody battle, they arrived at the graves where great figures were buried, only to find the corpses of security guards drained of blood.

'Suction.'

Simply draining blood wasn't enough to become a vampire.

"More blood is needed."

An old man with an umbrella stood atop a gravestone.

"You all should be sufficient."

"Do you think you'll get away with this? You killed the Royal Cemetery's caretakers."

No matter how strong vampires were, humans were the species that ruled the world by borrowing the sun's power.

Since nothing had ever gotten this out of hand before, Zenia was actually anxious.

"Do you know the misery of people who have lost their king?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Today will be the last day we endure the humiliation of hiding in darkness and having our world stolen by you weaklings."

Every hair on Zenia's head stood up.

'What, what is this?'

From one of the gravestones behind the Umbrella Man, tremendous fighting spirit was emanating.

"Lord......"

The corpses drained of all blood, the blood bank - now it all made sense.

The Umbrella Man's lips curved into a smirk.

"Today, our king is resurrected."

"Run!"

Zenia shouted upon seeing the grave shake, but it was already too late.

"Argh!" As Pourer fired his mega gun, the Umbrella Man quickly shot up into the sky.

"Wh-what is that?"

Like gas erupting, pitch-black smoke shot up tens of meters high from the cracks in the grave.

"This makes two."

It was the moment when 2 out of 3 Lords were being resurrected.

"Kekekeke! Kekekekeke!"

A woman's laughter that seemed like it would tear their eardrums just from hearing it echoed out, then the smoke gathered together.

When it crashed to earth like a meteor, the ground vibrated like waves, and finally a beautiful woman's naked body appeared there. The Umbrella Man landed beside her and knelt.

"I greet Agnes, Ruler of Blood."

Hibernation, which involved removing all moisture from the body to stop bodily functions, was an ability only Lords possessed.

And to awaken from that hibernation required the blood of 300 humans.

"A Lord..."

It was a powerful aura unlike anything any creature could feel, not even from Nike or Rian.

It was simply such a law.

The identity of Lords inherited from the True Demon was positioned at the very top of the biological pyramid from birth.

"Damn it..."

Blood vessels burst in Pourer's eyes and veins bulged at Katein's temples.

They were like rabbits facing a lion, but these rabbits had lost their fear to rage.

"I'll kill you!"

Their hearts, which nothing could console, had finally found an outlet.

Looking at the hunters charging head-on, Agnes extended her white finger.

"Blood Control."

All the blood remaining from awakening from hibernation rose up and gathered into a massive sphere above her head.

The blood, cooled by pressure, became a single sword that was grasped in her hand.

"It's been 2,000 years."

Her body, which had leaped toward the hunters, had somehow passed through them and landed far away.

"Guhk!"

At that terrifying speed, the blood sword evaporated and wounds were carved into the hunters' bodies.

"Blood Control."

As she crossed her hands and activated her ability, blood spurted from their bodies like fountains.

"Faster! Faster!"

At the chain of explosions occurring in the city center, Benoff led the vampire special task force and raced their carriage.

"This damn..."

When they arrived, all the buildings had collapsed as if a typhoon had passed through.

KRAAANG!

At the explosive sound from the distance, Benoff turned his head.

"Th-that's..."

Two long shadows were freely moving between air and ground, colliding with each other.

"Grrrr!"

Rian's body, breaking through Nike's whip, was in tatters like a rag.

In the ultra-high-speed battle where they couldn't even worry about cover, Rian swung his heart sword.

'I will definitely cut!'

The moment he brought down his sword with the limits of his conviction, Nike's shoulder was sharply severed.

'Incarnation technique won't work.'

As long as he couldn't destroy 《Idea》, the half-spirit half-soul body was also just matter.

'But it won't die.'

Nike, who instantly restored her body with powerful regeneration, collided head-on with Rian.

"Kiyaaaaa!"

At the point where they cut, tore, flesh shot into the sky, and blood poured down like rain.

'How far can we go?'

Rian suddenly wondered how far a living being could be destroyed.

At that moment, his body was torn to shreds.

"Hiyaaa!"

Divine Transcendence.

Even in that moment, 《Idea》 moved and Nike's body was also decomposed into dozens of pieces.

This was all in an instant.

Benoff heard the phantom sound of 'pop.'

The two afterimages he could see because he was watching from hundreds of meters away burst like firecrackers upon collision.

"C-Captain. That..."

Can people explode like that?

"What are you all doing! Hurry up and move!"

Even Benoff was stunned, but he needed a target for his current emotions.

"Rian..."

It was probably Rian.

"Huuuu."

The bodies of Rian and Nike, decomposed into pieces, were tangled together haphazardly in one place.

With his face cut above the nose bridge, Rian turned his gaze to glare at Nike.

In the sky, 《Idea》, having lost what to cut, was still dancing its sword dance.

Nike, with only her neck remaining, rolled her eyes upward in the direction she was looking at the sky.

"You won." Nike, a creation of God and heretic hunter, had questioned the essence of life long ago.

"You went further."

Nike's body gathered into black smoke, then a bat struggled to move.

"You..."

Rian's severed hand grabbed Nike's face.

Even under the piercing pressure, Nike gave a bitter smile and conveyed her words.

"From the moment we abandoned God, there is no mercy for us."

There was only endless pain.

"Only one who reaches the end can kill God."

Smile, smile.

As that damned hallucination was heard again, the bat sank its fangs into Rian's neck.

"Grrrr!"

As prions seeped in through the injection, Rian's half-restored body writhed madly.

"...Go forward."

As the bat disappeared, Nike's body turned to black ash and scattered on the ground.

"Rian! Rian!"

Benoff, who had arrived at the scene, stopped dead in his tracks 10 meters away.

"R-Rian?"

Rian, who had crookedly raised his body and was regenerating his last remaining right hand, turned his face.

With a face full of only suffering, grinding his teeth, he looked like a wild beast.

"Get a hold of yourself!"

"Grrrr!"

As indescribable pain consumed his body, Nike's memories flooded in like a tide.

"Damn it! Everyone standby!"

Thinking he might become a vampire like this, Benoff drew his long sword and watched the situation.

Me. The me beyond the physical body.

He heard the hallucination of Smile.

How far can you go?

"Huuuuu..."

Steam generated from burning cells leaked out between Rian's teeth.

To the very end. Only when I destroy even the smallest pieces that make up me... Burn, regenerate, burn again.

In the process of driving out Nike's prions, Rian exceeded the limit of how far a living being could collapse.

That was the true me. Ozent.

"Arghhhh!"

As Rian spread his upper body wide and let out a roar, powerful wind pressure blew the soldiers away.

"Damn it! What is that!"

Divine Transcendence.

Idea.

Smileeeeeee!

As every cell in his body twisted into the form of a yaksha, information from the distant past flooded into Rian's mind.

"Smile."

As that information mixed with Nike's remaining memories, Rian's head snapped around.

"I have to save Smile."

The moment he kicked off the ground and charged, numerous buildings in front collapsed with thunderous sounds.

"What the hell is going on?"

Benoff, who had been blown away by the wind pressure, rubbed his head and looked at where Rian had disappeared.

The mansion of the great magnate Miguel.

Miguel, one of the most successful nobles in Rodenin, was a Vesika-class vampire.

"Have you arrived, Lord?"

Agnes, who had arrived at the mansion with the Umbrella Man, dropped the pale hunters to the ground.

"Canoa's resurrection?"

"The blood is about two-thirds filled, but still insufficient. He should awaken from hibernation around midnight tomorrow."

"You, you bastard..."

The only conscious Zenia raised her head, but due to lack of blood, it was difficult to support her body.

Agnes, who had been coldly glaring at her, turned toward the basement and gave instructions.

"Bring them. He needs the Silver Bone."

Vesika-class vampires picked up the hunters one by one and boarded the elevator.

A massive vampire hideout was built 3 kilometers underground.

"You're awake, Agnes."

Benedict, another Lord, greeted her.

"What about the True Demon?"

Being disturbed from hibernation was extremely unpleasant, but if the one giving orders was the True Demon, that was different.

"He's waiting for you."

In the deepest place, True Demon Faust was waiting at a location with eight massive glass spheres installed.

Anyone who had been to heaven would immediately sense the technique involved, but to Zenia, it was simply horrifying.

"Kill me! Just kill me!"

It was better to die than become a lab rat.

"Calm down. You're not the protagonist of this experiment."

While the Vesikas put the hunters into the glass spheres one by one, several people woke up.

"Damn it! What is this!"

Ignoring them, Faust asked the Umbrella Man.

"How did it go?"

"Nike is gone. Even if we couldn't kill him, the injection should definitely work."

Zenia asked.

"What do you plan to do with us?"

"Nothing special. You are merely fertilizer. Fertilizer to reach the end of life."

"The end of life?"

Faust's gaze toward the ceiling pierced through 10,000 years of time and arrived in the past.

"There was a human called Ozent."

"Smile... Smile..."

Rian raced toward Miguel's mansion, destroying everything that blocked his path.

His eyes were looking at the scenery, but countless scenes that his brain couldn't analyze shimmered in his mind.

As if emerging from a tunnel, all the scenes were pushed outside his field of vision, and the landscape of heaven appeared.

Led by memory, he crossed seas and passed through forests to arrive at some ancient village.

A man with long black hair turned around with a beautiful smile.

"Smile."
