Singularity (4)

While wandering the capital evacuating people, Lian suddenly sensed a change.

At some point, the number of demons had begun to dwindle, and now not a single one was in sight.

"What's going on?"

"A temporary ceasefire."

An old man with a walking stick emerged from the corner of an alley.

He had a small frame with prominent cheekbones, and wrinkles covered the skin clinging to his facial bones.

Though his hands trembled on his walking stick as if he might hold a funeral tomorrow, Lian kept his distance.

"Who are you?"

It was a demon, and this one's demonic energy ranked among the strongest from all the battles so far.

"Are you asking my name? It's Gaitan."

Gaitan, 10th Legion Commander of Hell's Army.

In the demon realm he was known as the Insect Plague, and in the shadow world he bore the alias of ruler of all filthy bugs.

"A legion commander."

"Well, yes."

Gaitan leaned on his staff and gazed up at the sky.

"It seems your lord has negotiated with the other legion commanders. The demons won't attack for a while."

Lian lowered his sword.

"What do you want to say?"

"I heard you slayed the demon beast Argantis. So there's something I want to ask you."

Gaitan turned his gaze to Lian.

"What do you think exists at the end of the world?"

"I don't know."

Lian always lives in the present.

"Demons, you see, are different from life. We're like system errors. I don't know why things like us are necessary. Perhaps we weren't born from necessity at all."

"Whatever you are, if you torment anything other than yourselves, you have no right to exist."

Gaitan's lips curled upward.

"I intend to open the demon realm." "If I open the demon realm, I can never return to myself again. I'm not afraid of death. What's truly frightening is emptiness. But humans don't seem to understand that well."

"Are you threatening me?"

Gaitan shook his head.

"No, I suppose this should be called a request. I heard your swordsmanship can even cut the meaning of existence."

It transforms information itself.

"Won't you cut my demon realm? I who have mastered all the wisdom of this world. That's why I have no fear. All that remains now is the only unknown—beyond emptiness."

Strength entered Lian's hand gripping the great sword.

'Dangerous.'

It would be best to cut him down before he opened the demon realm.

"I said it was a request, but you won't be able to refuse. Yes, let's call this my wisdom too."

The moment he finished speaking, Lian twisted his waist and swung his great sword.

Gaitan's head fell with a single stroke, and the buildings behind him came crashing down with thunderous roars.

Gaitan's face, which had fallen to the ground, rolled around before speaking while upside down.

"What on earth could there be..."

Gaitan's eyes filled completely with white.

"That traps us in this suffocating illusion?"

The demon realm, Palapinas.

Gaitan's face rapidly corroded, transforming into a collection of black dots.

Then even his body turned black as if burning up, dissolving into smoke and expanding across hundreds of meters.

"Ugh!"

It wasn't smoke.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Though they resembled flies in form, their suction power as they clung to Lian's body and drained his blood was like being bitten by snakes.

"Aaaaah!"

Vision opened along the trajectory of his swung great sword, but countless insects were already covering the capital.

"Damn it!"

It was a different kind of annoyance from Argantis.

* * *

'Ozent Guy.'

The fact that he was Lian's older brother did create ripples in Shirone's heart.

But since he had already lost his reason to madness when they met before, Shirone didn't soften his cold gaze.

"What? Did you two develop feelings for each other?" Guy laughed, resting his sword on his shoulder at the bizarre sight of a legion commander and Shirone together.

"I heard you have authority over the Prison of Time."

Guy looked back at Melania.

"Hmm."

He didn't know the circumstances.

But seeing her maintaining silence with an indifferent expression, Guy found what he needed to do.

"Yeah, I have it. So what?"

"Summon the Prison of Time."

"Why should I?"

Shirone gritted his teeth.

"You know too. A human has fallen into hell. We need to save her."

Still hoping for some trace of humanity since he was Lian's brother, Shirone appealed to emotion.

"The woman who sealed the Psychic Realm. I heard about it. But aren't you asking the wrong person? Do you think I'd free an enemy who weakened our forces?"

"You're... human too."

Shirone's eyes blazed fiercely.

"Why do you side with the demons? Lian is fighting to save humans even now! Why do you..."

"Shut up."

Guy cut him off.

"Is appealing to family bonds all you can manage? Lian's pitiful to have someone like you as his master."

"He could die."

Finally, killing intent was unleashed.

"Puhahaha! Of course he could die. It's war. Fine, I'll teach you the method. If you kill me, no—if you can drive me to the brink of death..."

Guy pointed his scabbard at Shirone.

"The Prison of Time will appear."

'Lian, I'm sorry.'

Shirone closed his eyes.

'I might end up hurting your brother.'

The moment his thought ended, dozens of photon cannons fired at Guy.

CRASH!

The room instantly became a mess, and Shirone cast teleportation to fly outside the castle.

Guy, who had already launched himself into the air, drew his sword and spread both arms.

"You do have learning ability."

Launching a preemptive attack against a swordsman was good judgment.

"But it's a bit weak!"

Though he hadn't directly witnessed Shirone's combat, he knew the number of demons that had died since his appearance.

'200 million in one night. That's not a level achievable with just this degree of magic.' A woman had sacrificed herself for the world.

The price was spending eons—time's end, equivalent to nothingness—in hell.

'He must be angry.'

The fact that he held the key to saving her was Guy's assessment of the current situation.

'But such half-hearted attacks?' Despite being angry enough to abandon his accumulated enlightenment, the reason he couldn't kill was...

'He's a good guy.'

Because he was Lian's brother.

"Heh."

There was sufficient reason for Lian to pledge knighthood to Shirone, which made him angry.

"Idiots!"

While falling toward the ground, Guy twisted his torso and swung a powerful strike.

'This is...!'

Shirone's eyes widened at the sword energy tearing through the landscape and rushing toward him.

CRASH!

The castle's spire was completely blown away, and Melania, who had been standing guard, flew into the air.

"Is it beginning?"

A single streak of light, bending like rapids, was pursuing Guy at terrifying speed.

"Kahaha! What a surprise!"

As Guy reached the ground and swung his sword at tremendous speed, the atmosphere shuddered.

'It's Lian's technique.'

Just as the sword energy was about to strike his neck, space distorted and Shirone's body vanished.

"Spatial movement?"

With the sound of grinding metal, a single streak of light was weaving a net across the vast sky.

"It's a decent idea, but..."

If he hadn't abandoned Yahweh's realm, he would have manipulated time through avatar techniques.

"That's as far as it goes."

The ground where he stood exploded as Guy moved at frightening speed.

He caught up to the wide radius of spatial movement in an instant, and vicious shockwaves swept through.

RUMBLE!

Watching the capital's buildings collapse from the sky, Melania wore a puzzled expression.

"Why is he doing that?"

The photon cannons weren't producing enough power to blow up entire blocks with a single shot.

'He doesn't want to kill.'

Having reached that conclusion, Melania shed tears with a sad expression.

"Look at this."

Hadn't he already killed 200 million demons?

"You always only hate us."

"Hahaha! Is this all you've got!"

As Guy swung his sword upward, a mountain-like shockwave struck Shirone.

"Ugh!"

Shirone, who defended with Brilliant, teleported 500 meters away.

"Too slow!"

Guy was already approaching right in front of him.

'Get it together.'

To summon the Prison of Time, he had to at least bring Guy to the brink of death.

'I have no choice!'

A photon cannon containing near-light-speed propulsion vibrated menacingly above Shirone's palm.

The moment the flash left Shirone's hand, Guy felt time slow down for the first time.

'Can I dodge...?'

A massive explosion occurred from particle friction, and Shirone squeezed his eyes shut.

In the last scene before closing his eyes, the explosion had definitely engulfed Guy's body.

Something that couldn't happen if the Prison of Time had activated.

"Kekeke."

As laughter echoed from within the smoke, Shirone hastily opened his eyes and looked.

Guy, his armor tattered, was approaching with a mad smile.

"No way..."

Watching his severed left arm gradually regenerate, a thought flashed through Shirone's mind.

"Right, you can't kill me this way. But could you do it? It would be quite difficult."

He knew about the realm of Ideas from what Lian had told him.

"I'm not trying to kill you."

Shirone's expression changed.

"I made a mistake."

Hundreds of spheres rose around Shirone, preparing to launch.

As Guy's face turned pale, all the photon cannons burst forth and struck him.

BOOM!

As the entire central radius of the capital collapsed, Melania's eyes sharpened with intensity.

"Yes! That's it!" Once he poured out everything until he had no strength left to be angry, the advantage would return to the demons.

"Kahaha! I told you it won't work!"

Even as the ground collapsed, Guy endlessly restored information while pursuing Shirone.

Finally, his sword pierced through Shirone's solar plexus.

"Gah!"

The sensation of a cold blade penetrating his body and protruding from his back was terrifyingly unpleasant.

"How unfortunate."

There was no particular joy in defeating a half-baked mage who had lost his Prajna abilities.

"If it had been avatar techniques, it would have been a good match."

Then he felt Shirone's weight disappear through the blade.

"Huh?"

When Guy looked down, the area around the solar plexus where the sword had penetrated had turned to white light.

'What?'

When he hurriedly looked at Shirone again, his pupils had already disappeared, and eventually his entire body transformed into light.

"Ugh!"

Even as he pulled out his sword and stepped back, there was no resistance from Shirone's body.

'How did this...'

Guy's mind went blank as his head turned upward to the sky.

"What the hell is that?"

A giant avatar was looking down at Guy.

Nane spoke.

"What plants love cannot be destroyed. That is why love is the antithesis of emptiness."

Shura was listening.

"Conversely, what can be destroyed has no heart. Then what is Buddha?"

Nane raised his index finger.

"One who steps on love to realize emptiness. One who destroys what they love most becomes Buddha."

That would be true emptiness.

"Then Shirone is..."

"Walking the opposite path from me. But nothing about it is easy."

Nane smiled sadly.

"How can one love after realizing nothingness?"

Though that would be true love.
