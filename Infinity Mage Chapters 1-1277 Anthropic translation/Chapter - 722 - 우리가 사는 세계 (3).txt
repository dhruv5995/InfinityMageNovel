[722] The World We Live In (3)

When Kai shot up a flare, an identical light responded from beyond the mountain.

Burying the empty flare shell in the ground, Kai said:

"Hehe, they still gave us flares since we're on the same side. Maybe... the situation changed and they had no choice but to kill."

To deceive Kai, they would have had to distribute flares to the other Black participants as well.

'That's what he wants to believe.'

Shirone didn't bother to voice his thoughts.

The fact that Kai had decided to trade for high-grade cards using his magician's special ability already showed he knew the truth.

"Will you be okay? Using tricks between Black teammates will be dangerous in the final showdown."

"No one... cares about my life anyway."

Kai turned his head with a dark expression.

"When my parents died, the village chief of Black told me to fend for myself. Said it didn't matter if I died."

Black was a world of survival of the fittest.

"In the Black zone, if you're not needed, you have to die. But you saved me, hyung. If I'm going to be on your side, I need to do something too. I'll gather the high-grade cards."

If this were White, they would have decided by vote.

'The rational choice is always right, but...'

The desperation of a child struggling to survive couldn't be called wrong either.

'Kai can't go to White. Then I'll have to settle this in Black too.'

After waiting about 20 minutes, three Black participants emerged through the bushes.

Approaching only close enough to identify friend from foe, they surveyed the area and smiled upon seeing Kai.

"Well, well, Kai. You actually pulled something off?"

At the words filled with obvious killing intent, Kai stepped back, but the Black team's leader stopped his companions.

"Wait. There's one more."

Since Shirone wanted to avoid combat if possible, he waited in a spot where they could see him.

"That's the guy who eliminated Paroa."

Until the White-Black law ended, death could never be definitively determined in any case.

"Kai! How dare you deceive us!"

As a Black team member pulled out a card, Kai frantically waved both hands.

"No! He's a Seeker! He's on our team now!"

"Seeker?"

When the Black team questioned this, Shirone pulled out his job card and approached Kai's side.

"I can choose which law to follow. And right now I'm on the Black team. As long as Kai is safe, I have no intention of changing."

Though it was hard to believe at face value, they had experienced White zone meddling to the point of exhaustion.

"Hmph, hypocrites. Still living by voting? Hey, go check it out."

A Black team member approached cautiously, verified the Seeker card, and retreated with the same wariness.

"It's confirmed. Currently Black team."

"Hmm, a Seeker. I thought you were a mage."

Anyway, having a skilled fighter who had avoided the violence bomb and eliminated Paroa on the Black side was a good thing.

"So... what cards are you trading?"

Kai boldly showed off an S-grade card.

"This is the CPR we obtained. We want to trade it for two S-grade cards or four A-grade cards."

"CPR?"

It was certainly a card of tremendous value, so even the Black team's eyes changed.

"How did you get it?"

Shirone spoke up.

"I obtained it. As you probably guess, I'm a mage. I can use magic even without the White-Black law."

If true, the outcome of this survival test had already tilted toward Black, but the fact that he was a Seeker was concerning.

'Damn! There was a mage on the White side?'

Though the White-Black population was small, it wasn't as if there were no Spirit Zone awakeners at all.

"But why were you in White? Normally you should have devastated them and come to Black."

"That's for me to judge. I'm on the Black team now anyway, right? Are you going to trade or not?"

After the Black team whispered among themselves, the leader pulled out cards and approached closer than before.

"We offer one S-grade and two A-grades. We have Medios Mage, Bond Relationship, and Actis City Zombie."

Kai muttered with a surprised expression.

"Medios Mage..."

It was S-grade, an effective possession card for combat.

Medios Mage (Possession)
Description: Corrupt mages are said to be exiled to Medios for life.
Effect: Can cast powerful magic for 60 seconds. Cooldown time 360 seconds.
Current cooldown: 0 seconds.

'With just that card...'

For Kai, it was like a lifeline.

"Wait. What we proposed was two S-grades or four A-grades. One S-grade and two A-grades doesn't add up, does it?"

"No, it's definitely not a losing trade. Even if it's A-grade, there's Bond Relationship. Kai should know about it, right?"

Bond Relationship (Function)
Description: Trust is proportional to time, inversely proportional to distance.
Effect: Doubles the activation time of possessed cards.

Shirone's eyes lit up after checking the effect.

'I see. When combined with Bond Relationship, the Medios Mage possession time extends to 120 seconds.'

This also meant the value of CPR was that high.

Actis City Zombie (Summon)
Description: The zombie outbreak in Actis was determined to be evolution, not mutation.
Effect: 20 entities. Fast and powerful. Destroy the head, or destroy everything except the head.
Special Ability: Infection. Become a zombie if bitten.

The Actis City Zombie he checked last would also become a reliable ally for Kai.

"What do you think, hyung? Should we trade?"

At Kai's bold question, Shirone also pretended to consider for a moment before nodding.

"Good. Getting more weapons is important for now."

"Wait. There's something to check first."

The Black team leader extended his hand.

"Show me Kai's job card. Just in case. I'll reveal my job too."

The leader's job was Thief, with the special ability Pickpocket.

'An ability to steal one card when entering within 2 meters while the opponent is unaware.'

If it were a law effect, situations where one couldn't sense presence might occur, but there were no cards to be stolen anyway.

'The problem is Kai.'

The magician's special ability Magic Card could only change one card into any desired card.

Therefore, having already changed the old copper shield into CPR, there was no room to change the job card.

"What are you doing? Hurry up and reveal your job card too."

Kai's smiling lips trembled.

"Fine. But there's a condition. Only you and I check it together. If you get too close, Pickpocket will activate."

Though he had no cards, bluffing was also part of tactics, so Kai's proposal was reasonable.

'But he shouldn't have the wit to deceive the Black team. Does he have some strategy he didn't tell me?'

Kai looked back at Shirone and said:

"Don't worry. I'll finish quickly and come back."

Reassuring Shirone quite maturely, Kai faced the Black team leader in the center of the clearing.

"Check the cards first."

"Here are three cards. Now show your job card and CPR together. You must show them together."

"Of course. Here they are."

The job was Magician.

But the motion of presenting the card was so nonchalant that the leader felt momentary cognitive dissonance.

'What, it's Magician? Huh, Magician?'

The CPR was fake.

"You little..."

Just as the belated rage was about to override reason, Kai snatched the cards from the leader's hand and shouted:

"Hyung! Run quickly! I'll hold them off!"

Finding the Medios Mage, Kai held the card high and was about to shout whenâ€”

"Gahhk!"

The leader's dagger pierced Kai's stomach.

"Damn brat... deceiving me?"

"Kai!"

As Shirone kicked off the ground and approached, the leader who had stolen the cards from Kai immediately activated Medios Mage.

"Magical Fire!"

Blue light rippled from the leader's body possessed by the mage, and a massive fireball fell from the sky.

"Activate! Actis City Zombie!"

"Graaahhhhh!"

Twenty zombies were summoned and rushed toward Shirone at tremendous speed with claws extended.

"These bastards...!"

As Photon Cannon blew off the zombies' heads, the remaining two Black team members joined the battle.

"Activate! Wails of the Buried Alive!"

Wails of the Buried Alive
Description: The people of Kvastra village were buried alive by a mad lord.
Their voices hold back the steps of the living.
Effect: Restrains opponent for 2 seconds after activation.

"Woooooo!"

As phantoms of the dead emerged from the ground and grabbed his ankles, zombies from all directions converged on Shirone.

'Berserker!'

As zombie limbs scattered like fragments against the light barrier, the Black team's giant launched his body forward.

'Special ability. Werewolf.'

Fur began sprouting from the giant's body with the Druid job card, and his long snout split open wide.

"Kraaaang!"

The weapon card caught on the wolf's claw tips glowed.

Wild Action
Description: Anyone can become violent.
Effect: Reproduces imagined actions exactly. However, safety is not guaranteed.

"Can you really dodge this?"

The werewolf's dazzling movements reproducing scenes from his mind pierced through Shirone's defenses.

'Shunpo Bardo!'

As sharp claws passed through where Shirone had been, all the Black team members' eyes widened.

"What?"

Disappearing before the effect of Wails of the Buried Alive ended meant it didn't violate the law.

"Damn! Where did he disappear to...!"

The moment the leader turned his body, Photon Cannons scattered like buckshot and pummeled the entire Black team repeatedly.

"Gahhk! Kugh!"

Flying away almost simultaneously and collapsing in the grass, Shirone had no time to check on the fallen Black team as he rushed to Kai.

"Kai! Stay conscious! Kai!"

With the spot where the dagger was embedded turning bright red with blood, Kai opened his eyes.

"Hyung... I'm sorry."

"...Why?"

Why on earth did he do that?

"Why didn't you ask for help? You know I'm a mage, right? Why did you do such a foolish thing?"

Kai weakly shook his head.

"I don't know. I was just... scared."

"Of what? What were you so afraid of?"

"That you'd be disappointed in me."

Shirone was speechless.

"I tried to be helpful somehow... I'm sorry. Acting big and loud like an idiot, then unable to do anything..."

He seemed to understand what Kai wanted to say.

"You don't need to say anymore. Let's treat you first."

"You saved me... so I wanted to be acknowledged... I was scared of being suspected by you..."

"I said don't talk! The bleeding won't stop!"

"I'm sorry... hyung."

Kai's head fell to the side, and the pounding of his gasping chest gradually settled into stillness.

"Kai! Kai!"

What is this world?

The contradiction of White-Black is that there exists no way to return from Black to White.

'True good...'

Does not distinguish between good and evil.

Lost endlessly in thought, Shirone laid Kai's body to rest in a cozy patch of grass.

Shirone's eyebrows curved sadly as he examined Kai's job card that he had clutched until the end.

Magician: One who deceives almost everyone.

For a child abandoned by the world, this was probably the first emotion he truly wanted to protect in his life.

"CPR."

Shirone gently placed the job card on Kai's folded hands.

"Wait. I'll come get you soon."

What were the odds that among the hundred cards created by the harmony of White-Black, CPR would exist?

"No, it has to exist."

Glaring at the moon of law, Shirone's body transformed into a flash of light and shot up into the night sky.
