[779] The Definition of Evil (1)

When Sirone and Uorin returned to the room, Minerva had placed *Legal Murder* on the table.

To her right sat the card players in order—Goudio, Agaya, Nes, and Mais.

"Have you calmed down a bit?"

When Minerva smiled as if it wasn't her responsibility, Uorin responded with a smile as well.

"Sorry. I showed an unseemly side to my immature younger brother."

Having confirmed Sirone's feelings, there was no longer any reason to be shaken by Minerva.

'Something happened.'

Since Mitochondrial Eve's perspective far transcended that of ordinary people, Minerva decided not to pry further.

"Let's talk business. I brought *Legal Murder* as promised. Now tell me how you plan to eliminate the ultimate evil."

Uorin turned her gaze to the card players and gave a meaningful smile.

"Impressive people have come."

There was no way Uorin wouldn't recognize the faces of the world's four best gamblers.

'The Ivory Tower is quite concerned too. These people will be of great help in handling *Legal Murder*.'

As Sirone took a seat next to Minerva, Kando served tea, and finally Uorin sat down.

"As you've probably guessed, the ultimate evil I'm designating is the Emperor of the Gustav Empire, Gustav Habitz."

The card players' eyes narrowed.

"The Gustav Empire has already finished preparing for war. World War will break out within the next 48 hours."

Several nobles near the border had already liquidated their assets and fled to other countries.

Uorin spread out a world map.

"The war will begin here, in the Cotria Republic."

The Cotria Republic, a peninsula nation jutting out toward the Pacific from the northern continent, was being pressured by the Gustav Empire.

"Gustav cannot expand without eliminating the Cotria Republic. Of course, it should have been devoured already, but..."

Minerva spoke up.

"The ancient weapon Exmachina."

"Right. I'll explain later, but that's why Gustav hasn't been able to invade the Cotria Republic until now. But once full-scale war breaks out, occupation will only be a matter of time."

Sirone asked.

"What's the Cotria Republic's stance?"

"They haven't issued an official statement. They're probably weighing their options between the Holy War and Gustav. Their nation's fate will depend on which side they choose."

Minerva snorted.

"If it were me, I'd obviously side with the Gustav Empire. They're at too much of a geographical disadvantage. By the time the Valkyries arrive to help, their country will already be in ruins."

"I think the same. So naturally, they're probably conducting alliance negotiations behind the scenes. The problem is, if Habitz truly is ultimate evil, he won't accept any proposals."

"So the key is Habitz. It would be best to eliminate the ultimate evil as quickly as possible before war damage grows, right?"

"Exactly. That's why we need *Legal Murder*."

Since Habitz had broken the perfectly balanced three-way structure, killing him would restore the balance.

Uorin looked around at the card players.

"What you need to do is design a law through *Legal Murder*'s ability that will definitely kill Habitz. You can change any aspect—humans, emotions, funds, culture, law. The Holy War will provide all support."

"It won't be easy."

Goudio spoke, and the card players fell into agreement-filled silence.

"Of course it won't be. We're talking about killing an emperor. That's why we called you, the world's greatest gamblers."

"We're not the world's greatest."

Mais looked at Uorin with narrowed eyes.

"No one probably knows how we met or why we entered the Ivory Tower."

"What do you mean?"

The bald old man Agaya spoke.

"Yes, we were once the world's greatest. But we have something in common. Fourteen years ago, we all lost to the same person."

This was news even to Minerva.

"Lost? To whom?"

The skull-like Nes's face grew even darker.

"He's apparently called one of Gustav's Four Horsemen now. The God of War, Vulcan."

Uorin recalled Vulcan's rough, bandit-like impression she'd seen at the Holy War.

"What's his win rate?"

Goudio spoke.

"There's no win rate. We never won a single game. In any game with rules that divide winners and losers, Vulcan doesn't lose."

She thought such a difference was impossible.

"How is that possible? No matter how excellent a gambler is, they can't break probability."

Agaya shook his head.

"I don't know. We calculated perfectly, but after the game ended, we felt bewitched. Like that guy alone knew the game's rules."

"It's not probability."

Nes, with the shock from fourteen years ago flowing back through time, spoke with intensity in his eyes.

"He reads the crowd atmosphere."

Also called mass psychology.

The Gustav Empire's imperial capital, Marshak.

One of the world's largest artificial structures, along with Hell's Yama of Jincheon and Aganoth of Kashan.

While each department was frantically preparing for war, only Military Commander Vulcan was leisurely playing chess.

Hundreds of chess boards were connected as one.

"What are you doing? Move quickly!"

The empire's 23 military officers facing Vulcan were struggling with the positions of over 2,000 pieces.

'I don't know. What should I move?'

When competing with a single chess game, whether winning or losing, you can usually see the advantage.

Just moving the first piece exponentially reduces future possibilities.

'But when hundreds of boards are connected...'

It crosses into the realm of intuition that's impossible to calculate with the human mind, losing the standard of probability.

"Let's try moving this."

After discussion, the 23 officers moved a pawn on the chess board at position horizontal 127, vertical 278.

'I don't know.'

The pieces could use all connected chess boards, so they couldn't be sure if their current choice was correct.

"A foolish decision."

The military officers flinched at Vulcan's words.

"If you respond like this, isn't there no way out?"

A bishop on chess board horizontal 7, vertical 16 moved, seemingly completely unrelated to what the officers had done.

'I can't understand it at all. What connection could there possibly be?'

If the pieces moved about 2,000 more times, something might become visible, but the number of choices available to the officers and Vulcan before reaching those 2,000 moves was infinite.

'Prediction is impossible. It's not a matter of calculation but probabilistically completely open. This is just the beginning.'

But why had they never won even once?

'In the end, it goes as the Military Commander says.'

The military officers looked at Vulcan with fearful eyes, blessed by gods of both literature and martial arts.

'What exactly does that person see?'

At the far end where hundreds of boards were spread, Vulcan sat cross-legged looking down at the battlefield.

'That spot is weak.'

The golden melody swirling between thousands of pieces was clearly visible to his eyes.

The officers had moved their pieces to a spot where the light was particularly weak among the radiance filling the board.

"A weak decision."

Even a Servant could calculate the entire formation of how the pieces were arranged.

'It would be easier to give up, but...'

Crowd atmosphere denies probability.

What crowd atmosphere sees is not the formation itself, but the crowd's gaze that changes moment by moment due to that formation.

"Let's stop. You've already lost."

Through the positions of the pieces the officers moved, what the crowd atmosphere conveyed was reverence for the human called Vulcan.

"What about His Majesty?"

"Ah, I heard he's taking a walk around the grounds..."

"I'm bored to death."

Vulcan yawned as he spoke.

"Why is today dragging on so long?"

Sirone asked.

"Is he that difficult an opponent?"

The card players answered in unison.

"Difficult."

Agaya raised his index finger.

"Crowd psychology could be called the pinnacle of relative response, not objective probability. In other words, in games with opponents, no one can beat him. If such a person is by Habitz's side, they could sufficiently counter *Legal Murder*'s laws."

"But also..."

Nes spoke.

"That's precisely why he's an enemy worth breaking. We will definitely win this gamble."

The card players' fighting spirit blazed.

"Good. Then let's begin the analysis. First, we need to know the enemy we're facing."

Uorin looked at Sirone.

"Ultimate evil. Have you ever met one in your life?"

"Hmm, well? I've met quite a few bad people..."

Minerva pointed to herself.

"Me?"

"You're not ultimate evil."

Uorin shook her head.

"Of course, Minerva, you're really bad too, but ultimate evil isn't something that can be expressed at that level."

Minerva pouted.

"So you probably don't want to hear this..."

This is a story.

"You'll want to avoid it for life..."

This is a story about ultimate evil, the human most distant from the world.

"Please save him! My husband is dying!"

In the commoner district of the imperial capital Marshak, a woman had come out to the street screaming at the top of her lungs.

"What's wrong?"

The man who rushed over urgently was a 50-year-old man in clown costume with a drum on his back.

"Oh, well..."

The woman who had been seeking help frowned when she saw the man dressed as a medicine peddler.

"Someone please help! My husband is...!"

She didn't recognize the face of Zetaro, one of Gustav's Four Horsemen, the Universal Merchant.

"So tell me! I may look like this, but I've studied medicine. We must save lives, mustn't we?"

Zetaro was the most skilled doctor in the empire.

"Can you really save him?"

Since this wasn't a matter to approach without confidence, the woman decided to trust Zetaro's words.

"Here, over here. He suddenly foamed at the mouth and collapsed."

Her husband lay collapsed on the floor while their young daughter and son cried by the stairs.

"Let me examine him first."

After checking the husband's complexion and pupil response, Zetaro immediately recognized the symptoms.

"Baskia virus. Have you been to a lake in the past two months?"

"What? Oh, yes! He went fishing with friends!"

Zetaro rummaged through his universal merchant's bag and pulled out a vial containing brown liquid.

"This medicine..."

"If he drinks that, will he live?"

"No, this is my medicine. I have some chronic conditions."

The woman stared in bewilderment as Zetaro uncorked the vial and gulped down the medicine.

"Please save my husband! You can save him, right?"

"Baskia virus. The treatment is..."

Pulling out a scalpel while hesitating, Zetaro bit his lip, then suddenly screamed.

"How the hell would I know something like that!"

With bloodshot eyes looking up at the ceiling, he slashed the husband's chest with the scalpel.

"Aaaah!"

The woman screamed, and the children fainted at the sight of blood spattering everywhere.

"Wh-what are you doing..."

Having already taken the vaccine, Zetaro splashed a bowlful of hot blood on his face and went outside.

"Hey, Zetaro. I'm hungry, want to go eat something?"

Habitz in shabby clothes and Natasha in a suit approached with royal guards in tow.

"Your Majesty, another life has been lost. I'm so, so sad..."

Overcome with unbearable sadness, Zetaro couldn't continue speaking.

"I'll play a tune."

Hopping on his left foot and pushing with his right to beat the drum, he grabbed a trumpet and blew it.

"Turu-bap-tudu. Turu-bap-bap-tu."

The trumpet sound played by the empire's greatest vocalist touched the hearts of passersby.

"You bastards! What are you doing after killing my husband...!"

When the woman rushed out of the house with a knife, the royal guards immediately slammed her to the ground.

"Aaaah! It's the Emperor!"

People who had been watching the performance in a daze finally grasped the situation and fled.

"Puhahaha! Puhahaha!"

Finding the current situation so amusing, Habitz clutched his stomach and burst into explosive laughter.
