EXO Universe (3)

"Do you know why I hate evil?" Sirone said.

"Because you mistakenly think happiness and misery are equivalent exchanges. If someone receives ten compliments and ten insults, should their heart be perfectly balanced?"

Sirone's fist struck Havitz's face hard.

"Ugh!"

"...It's only natural to feel disgusted."

The human heart is not neutral.

"Stop trying to make everything the same. No human being places equal value on happiness and misery. There isn't a single person in this world who wants to be unhappy. Even you, who took pleasure in preying on countless humans..."

As particle destruction magic poured down, Havitz, collapsed on the ground, screamed out.

"Aaaaah!"

"Isn't this single moment of pain far more terrible?"

But why?

"You're so desperate to torment others that you spout nonsensical logic..."

Sirone grabbed Havitz's head with both hands and cast magic again.

"Uuuugh! Uuuugh!"

Sparks flew from Havitz's eyes as blood streamed from his eyes, nose, and mouth.

"Why should I forgive you people?"

Sirone was almost sobbing.

"Tell me! You've been happy until now, so a little pain should be fine, right? You mocked others, so why don't you smile!"

To reach Ultima, one would have to accept even evil into their heart...

But Sirone couldn't swallow that.

"S-Satan, my lord."

Twelve demons from the Sanctuary, their faces burned black, crawled toward Havitz.

"Kraaaah! Kraaaah!"

Screaming, Havitz seemed to have an out-of-body experience, looking into his own brain.

The sensation of light racing at impossible speeds.

"Uh, uhhhh?"

When his thoughts reached an impossible state, strange words tumbled out without his knowing.

"...Mama."

Surprised by his own words, he snapped back to his senses and activated Vanishing.

'I need to run.'

Anywhere, as long as Yahweh wasn't there.

'I know the method now. I just won't kill him. I'll have Giyorgi kill him instead.'

Sirone stood up.

"Too late."

Having already anticipated Havitz's Vanishing, he murmured:

"Elicia."

As the brilliance of light exploded outward, Havitz's jaw trembled as his Vanishing was dispelled.

"Hup! Hup!"

Without even daring to look back, he ran with all his might.

'Mama.'

Was that a dream, or a near-death experience created by his dying brain cells?

Havitz tore off the tattered flesh from his face and burst into hollow laughter.

"Hehehe!"

He hadn't actually seen anything.

He had simply felt, realized, and understood what kind of existence he was in this world.

'Why chaos, you ask?'

Because there's nothing that needs protecting.

"Mama."

Not caring about his peeled skin, he smiled like a seagull and spoke like a child.

"I want to have fun playing."

The moment his words ended, Elicia's flash flew toward Havitz's back.

"Protect Satan!"

The moment the demons blocked the path, the flash spread like electricity, burning them all.

"Kyaaaaaa!"

The demons turned to ash, lingering in the air for a long time without being washed away by rain before finally disappearing.

Sirone's expression was calm.

"Phew."

Even before coming here, he had suspected that he couldn't kill Havitz.

'Satan can transcend the law and avoid Yahweh. If he sets his mind to it.'

If he had activated Elicia from the beginning, Havitz would have run away without question.

"I hope this provided some small comfort."

He hoped Havitz would understand even a little of the pain suffered by the stars of the Ivory Tower and the victims of Satan's claws.

'He said "Mama."'

When he heard Havitz's words, several things came to mind, but they were still just hypotheses.

'More importantly...'

The holy knights of Lamigyo and the southern warriors were still continuing their slaughter.

"Yahweh."

Chief Entara approached with support.

"Chief."

"I watched you fight Havitz. It seems Elicia's power wasn't enough."

"He would have run away anyway. There's a law that Satan and I cannot settle things through direct confrontation."

That's why the Wizard was necessary.

"Is that so? Anyway, the situation is urgent. Those fanatics seem to want to enter the sanctuary."

Sirone looked back at the people who had lost their hearts.

'Those who have lost their hearts and follow God's will. What they're probably after is... Maya.'

For reasons unknown, Maya's death was meaningfully recorded in future information.

Sirone recalled Yucus Man's words.

The song was too loud, so we had no choice but to block it. There were too many songs, so we had to cover the planet. Thick, thicker, even thicker...

'Could this be connected? But there's too little information to jump to conclusions.'

Sirone said:

"I'll stop them. Please help me."

Satan had fled and the demons were annihilated, so only the faction of humans remained.

"That's what we should do, but..."

Entara looked back at the main street.

"Can you stop all of them?"

Where Sirone turned his head, a procession of people filled the view endlessly.

It felt like the entire world's population was converging.

"...I have to."

Sirone activated Miracle Stream and swept the front of the crowd with Hand of God.

"Ugh!"

He felt tremendous impact.

'Magnetic field.'

If they were mere objects, they could be changed according to Yahweh's will, but OPARTs were different.

'If humans are God's chess pieces...'

Each existence was at the extreme of law, each one having the same intensity as Nane's sermon.

"Hyaaaah!"

Sirone gritted his teeth and swung his arm, grasping people with Hand of God.

Hundreds of people were displaced, but like trying to grasp water, even more slipped through.

'...This isn't easy.'

But if he destroyed them with magic, he might have to commit genocide against humanity.

The people spoke in unison:

"Yahweh."

It was a message God was sending to Sirone.

"You are an error."

Perhaps that might be true.

In a cold, indifferent world, living beings might have had to simply live in compliance with the law.

"No."

Sirone's eyes widened.

"We will define it."

To move toward a world without any discrimination, without more sacrifice, without terrible misfortune.

"The master of this world is the heart."

Sirone spread Miracle Stream to its limit and swept up the crowd of people.

"Ooooooh!"

As if the world itself was screaming, the streets shook from the collision between heart and law.

"Grrrr!"

As all laws denied the heart, brilliance exploded in Sirone's eyes.

"This concludes all official proceedings of the sanctuary..."

Applause spread through the annex.

Though no one clapped carelessly, their expressions were rigidly frozen.

Everyone was thinking the same thing.

'The aftermath from the main gate clash isn't reaching us. Maybe it can be stopped. If so...'

Must Maya be killed?

'If it goes to a vote, Tormia has an overwhelming advantage. But we don't know yet. If we attempt a reversal here, the results could change.'

The desire to become the world's leading nation endlessly fueled the murderous intent of each nation's kings.

"Now we'll have a finale performance wishing for peace in the sanctuary. Please welcome them with applause."

Clap...

A few people clapped their hands together, but as if by agreement, silence returned.

It was probably hesitation about sending a welcoming signal to someone who would soon have to die.

"Uh..."

The host was flustered but skillfully continued.

"Now, let me introduce them! A performance by the world's greatest artists, the Panier Orchestra."

Applause erupted as if making up for the earlier mistake, and 36 artists came onto the stage.

Lufist said:

"Sirone is blocking them well. He should be able to hold out until the performance ends. So has the future changed?"

Albino's eyes narrowed.

"Hmm, there are still several variables. First, King Basak of Iron. According to the prophecy of the future, he kills Maya and takes the position of world leader. He will definitely make his move."

To seize the destiny given to him.

"But now everyone knows the future. Other nations won't just stand by. If we can just stop Iron here, we might be able to change the future."

Regardless of what thoughts Fermi had, Lufist judged for Tormia's sake.

"I agree, but it's probably already in the calculations."

"What?"

"Fermi and Sirone. Those two share the same information but their actions are completely opposite. Fermi knows but doesn't try to change it, while Sirone tries to change it because he knows."

"That's their nature."

"This is the key. Those two different approaches seem to split God's calculations in two. Sirone will do his best to block the procession of people. But because that too is within God's calculations, God bypasses Yahweh to enforce the result. And that enforced result..."

Lufist realized.

"Fermi will... change it again?"

"That's probably the strategy. Sirone likely knew. He must have found a way to control information somehow. That's the true meaning of 'deceiving God.' Are they both insane? They've come up with quite an audacious idea."

Lufist thought the same.

"Anyway, the future is one layer above what we think. Even if something happens right now, it won't be the true future."

As long as Fermi controls the information.

'Then...'

Lufist examined each of the artists standing in line on stage, bowing.

'What is the future we don't know?'

Pope Constantine walked down the corridor.

"Oh my, Your Holiness."

Though not a follower of Lamigyo, he was a world-famous figure, so the maids showed their respects.

"Yes, you're working hard."

"What brings you here? Someone of Your Holiness's stature should be in the annex..."

The maid's expression became vacant.

"Ah."

A blue light briefly flickered in her eyes, then emotion disappeared from her face.

"Follow the truth of Lamigyo."

"...Yes."

The maid immediately turned and headed toward the dormitory where the sanctuary staff were staying.

Probably within a few hours, most people in Delta would become followers of Lamigyo.

"What is the problem?"

And Pope Constantine belatedly made his way to the annex.

"What God desires."

Following Panier's conducting, the artists began their music as El Kiana stepped forward first.

Her voice singing of world peace was so beautiful it seemed like light was flowing.

But the audience remained unmoved.

'When do we kill her?'

What they were waiting for was the moment Maya would be in the center of the stage under the spotlight.

'According to the prophecy, Iron killed her after the performance. We need to strike first.'

Panier couldn't see the audience, but felt a chill that made his spine tingle.

'What is this?'

He had performed countless times, but this was a first.

'Next, Maya.'

Panier regained his composure and nodded slightly to Maya, turning his gaze to her.

The spotlight moved and Maya walked to the center of the stage with calm steps.

The officials from each nation's eyes widened.

'Now? Now?'

Maya turned toward the audience, raised her gaze slightly, and slowly parted her lips.

"When I was..."

The shock of that moment was—

"Very young."

So stirring to the human heartstrings that it made them forget about world leadership and murderous intent—

"I met a boy."

Creating a silence more quiet than silence itself.

"And loved him."

When she finished the verse with a smile, everyone's eyes were moist.

'Why did they kill her after the performance?'

Albino realized.

'Probably... because they couldn't kill her.'
