Major Premise (1)

For those who had guessed at Sirone and Ikael's relationship, and for those who had no clue at all, it was equally shocking.

The question that would shake the very foundations of biology—that an angel could have a human child—didn't even occur to them.

What mattered was simply the fact that Yahweh, representing humanity, and the commander of Heaven's army were connected by such a powerful bond.

'Sirone is... Ikael's child?'

For the administrators who were Adolf XIII's close associates, strengthening Sirone's cause was not good news.

Though little time remained until the coronation ceremony, they too were people who had reached this position through experiencing countless reversals of fortune.

'There's no giving up until the very end. We still have a card or two to play. But if what was just said is true...'

Their future was certainly growing darker.

'Should I switch to Pony's side even now? At this rate, I might really end up purged too.'

Though the demon realm had opened on each continent and humanity faced the crisis of annihilation, who would really care about such things?

The reason they were here was to protect their own lives, absolutely not to save the world.

Sirone, who knew most of humanity's history, was also reading their hearts.

'That's understandable.'

As he had heard in Guffin's final message, protecting oneself wasn't a sin.

Waiting for everyone in the Grand Hall to sort out their feelings, Sirone opened his mouth again.

"Though Ikael's joining would be a great help to humanity, that alone won't be enough for us to endure. If we classify the world situation by the concept of enemies, humanity currently faces three powerful foes: Nane, Ymir, and Habitz."

They were adversaries against whom no counterargument could be raised.

"Any one of them would be fatal to humanity. In fact, I believe that in terms of the depth of enlightenment, I'm not inferior to them. But the reason I couldn't stop them is..."

Miro spoke up.

"The Ultima System."

"Yes. Because the realm I've reached is based on the heart. Once the coronation ceremony ends, I'll travel the world to gather humanity's hearts. Though I can handle kingdoms and cities through Pony, I plan to personally visit villages and remote areas that social systems haven't penetrated."

"And then?"

Turning his head toward where the voice came from, Sirone saw Gaold sitting gloomily in a corner.

The one caring for him was Kang Nan, and Miro immediately looked away from Gaold after glancing at him briefly.

"What are you going to do once you get there? Go around one by one begging them to change their hearts for the sake of the world?"

Sirone remained silent.

"That might be fine too. But you know, don't you? The human heart is..."

As he put a cigarette to his lips, Kang Nan lit it for him.

"Cough! Cough!"

Setting aside that this was in front of Pony, who would become the next king, Kang Nan had also half given up by now.

After coughing repeatedly, Gaold took another long drag from his cigarette and continued speaking.

"If a human wants to eat an apple, they absolutely won't eat a strawberry. Even though they could just eat it. In the end, the heart is something that can't be swayed even by such a trivial matter as which fruit to eat. If you threaten them with a knife, they'll naturally eat the strawberry, but that's far from the heart. Changing one's heart means changing oneself. In other words, becoming a completely different, new human being."

He threw the still-burning cigarette butt, causing the row of administrators to hastily scatter.

"There's only one way to change the heart of a human who wants to eat an apple so they'll eat a strawberry instead. Do you know what that is?"

Gaold held up two fingers.

"Give them both."

Though Sirone still remained silent, he responded with eyes as deep as Gaold's instead of words.

"If you tell them to eat both the apple and the strawberry, humans will gladly eat the strawberry. That's the heart. A monster that wants to devour everything, uncontrollable. Even Miro of Ultimate Good can only cage it at best. Habitz completely liberated it. Probably only Nane can kill that monster."

Perfectly excising the heart.

"But you want to tame it? I don't want to pour cold water on you, but I'll say this definitively—that's absolutely impossible. Not all humans can become you."

Though he appeared to be a wreck on the surface, Gaold's analysis still retained its sharpness.

Miro acknowledged it too.

'At least he hasn't completely lost his mind.'

Come to think of it, perhaps Gaold's very life embodied the reality of the monster he had just described.

'Can't cage it, can't liberate it. Can't tame it, can't kill it.'

That life's name would be Miro, but she didn't want to think that far.

"Mr. Gaold is right."

Now everyone's gaze turned back to Sirone, and he readily acknowledged it.

"As I told my friends yesterday, this is a problem that needs to be approached technically. I don't think it's possible to reach Ultima in time through normal methods."

"Then?"

Just as Miro was speaking, a knock was heard.

The large doors opened, and Blitz and Aetra, who had left somewhere the night before, entered.

"Messiah, we've brought them."

Following the apostles were Luver and Mong-A, familiar to some as members of the dream race.

Luver greeted them with a benevolent smile.

"I've come at the summons of the Five Great Stars."

While those who had experienced Drimo showed surprised expressions, Miro suddenly realized.

"Don't tell me, Sirone, you..."

Such a method existed.

"Yes. Mr. Luver is a dream keeper, managing the domain of Drimo. In other words, he's connected to the minds of all humanity worldwide."

Through Omega, Sirone had also realized what kind of existence Luver was.

Though not at the highest level like Taeseong or Argones, he too was undeniably an administrator handling part of the system.

"Here's the plan. With the approval of Mr. Luver, the administrator of Drimo, we'll install the Ultima System in all humanity's maternal psychology. We'll implant it directly into their minds."

"Uh..."

Several people tried to speak, but their minds still couldn't process it.

Once she finally understood what it meant, Amy opened her mouth with an expression of rapture.

"Such a method..." 

Miro interrupted.

"It's contradictory."

It was a problem that only she, with no blind spots in her thinking, had caught.

"The method itself is good. But it includes a major premise. The Ultima System must actually exist. At minimum, it must be conceptually complete. But if that were the case, we would have already solved it through education, training, or mental resonance. The reason we can't do that is because it's a realm of sensation. It's easy to explain what intuition is, but who knows what kind of sensation that actually is? Even I can't begin to guess."

"That's why the pilgrimage is necessary."

Sirone explained.

"This world is formed through the exchange of photon and quantum signals. In other words, half is background, and beings with hearts fill in something to create the world. This means all events exist as probabilities, and any impossible occurrence can happen."

Sirone raised his index finger and asked.

"Then why don't quantum phenomena occur?"

Everyone listened intently.

"Why don't we suddenly fall through the floor to the first level, or get transported to strange places while walking, or transform into bizarre monsters?"

Miro spoke.

"Because such things don't happen. More precisely, because they've never happened before. You want to say that though it's contradictory, that contradiction is the truth, right?"

"Yes. If this world were made only of hearts, anything you wanted would be possible. It would be chaotic and messy, but logical in itself. But fundamentally, it's photon signals. Those signals create preconceptions and drop the faint probability that such things might happen all the way to zero."

Sirone turned his gaze to the people.

"Assuming a world made of electricity, the combination of photons and quanta appears surprisingly efficient. It lays down a background and lets users define things among themselves. Photon signals function like a kind of consensus mechanism. Since everyone's definitions combine to become the world, no special coordination is needed."

The world is constructed at the speed of light.

"Long ago, those who used this world realized the truth and developed and used those signals to their limits."

And finally, one of them came to deny the cold world and ascend against the Gonggeup.

"Not everyone reached Ultima from the beginning. However, a single trivial incident—that one incident could change everyone."

"The limits of cognition. You're talking about the realm of belief."

Nodding at Sein's words, Sirone created a small sphere with Material.

"In the world of light-quanta, all truths are obtained inductively. For example, the fact that this sphere cannot pass through walls isn't because that's actually the case, but because such a thing has never happened before. But..."

Sirone, who had been bouncing the sphere in his palm, turned toward the window and threw the sphere.

"One day."

The sphere that flew straight passed right through the window and flew outside.

"When that inductive logic is broken."

As everyone stared with their mouths agape, Sirone turned his head.

"Human cognition can surpass its limits and enter a new realm. In other words, probabilities that had been crushed down to 0 percent would surge rapidly."

Because half the world is made of hearts.

"People often say they believe in God. But even clergy cannot be perfect. I'm not disparaging them—no being can believe in something they cannot perceive. This is why Eden's barrier cannot be perfect. But if God truly descended to this world, or even if one small miracle occurred, probably the entire world would come to believe in God."

Sirone summarized.

"This is why I want to purify people's hearts through pilgrimage. Since quantum signals are like multiple users using the same bandwidth, the effect diminishes unless their sincere hearts are intertwined. Though I just made the sphere pass through, if someone powerfully wielding heart techniques had rejected it, the two phenomena would have collided."

Sein said.

"But there's no such person. No one else has achieved cognitive expansion like you."

"Yes. Because they can't even conceive that it's possible. But for all of you who have already confirmed it with your eyes, who knows."

Miro said.

"Even if you say that, you know it won't work. It's not a technique that can be imitated just by seeing it. That's why you want to directly implant the Ultima System."

Therefore, Sirone's words were merely about possibilities, but Miro didn't argue further.

As long as it wasn't impossible, humanity's current situation required attempting anything.

"Fine, I understand what you're thinking. But there's a second problem. Even if you transfer the Ultima System to the deep layers, what about the aftermath? You yourself only realized Ultima in Heaven. Obtaining only the 11th sense without going through the 6th to 10th senses won't allow integration. Even if they understand all signals, it would only cause social chaos."

Arius, who was lying on the floor with his chin propped up, added.

"Whether humans will accept it is also a problem. In Sirone's case, Ikael implanted Ataraxia. But even then, he probably came close to mental destruction. Can ordinary humans who aren't even Unlockers endure such shock?"

Come to think of it, his nickname was the Grave Robber.
