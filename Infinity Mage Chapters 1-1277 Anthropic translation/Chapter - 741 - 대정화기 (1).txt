[741] The Great Purification Period (1)

The Star Conferment Ceremony.

Unlike the residents who spend their entire lives within the Ivory Tower, those who go out into the world directly to spread its teachings are called Stars.

Their authority is not received from someone else but enforced by themselves, so no grand ceremony is necessary.

However, having one's intellectual worth recognized by the incarnation of stars would be an unfamiliar feeling for anyone born on this land.

"Sirone, I confer upon you the highest five stars. Please become the Five Great Stars and protect this land."

As Taeseong's voice sounded gentle, a star badge appeared before his eyes.

"This is..."

The high pass of this planet that only those who received the title of Star could possess.

"Please accept it. As the master of this land, this is a heavy burden I entrust to you."

'Master of this land...'

There were countless kings and nobles with territories in the world, but even they were not the true masters.

"This badge represents me. All those who dwell on this land are my children, so they will gladly help you."

What those in power feared was ultimately the Ivory Tower's military might, but at least he liked the meaning.

"Yes. Thank you."

The star badge engraved with five stars had a texture like a mixture of iron and wood that Sirone had never touched in his life.

"It's made from star fragments. Just carrying it on your body will have considerable effects."

"Star fragments..."

If he understood the principle, he could summon it as Material.

"What kind of effects does it have?"

"I heard it promotes blood circulation and is good for vitality too."

Sirone hung the star badge around his neck.

"Is it over now?"

"Usually, yes. But since Sirone is one of the Five Great Stars who leads the other stars, there are things you need to know. Of course, there are privileges too."

'Privileges.'

He wondered what could be given beyond the power that makes even a nation's king tremble.

"First, most stars keep satellites by their side. If you want, I can help you with that. What do you think, Sirone?"

"Hmm, satellites..."

Rian came to mind first, followed by several other people flashing through his thoughts.

"I don't think I'll need them."

Taeseong nodded as if he had expected this.

"I see. Actually, none of the Five Great Stars have satellites. It's too peculiar to be considered a coincidence."

Satellites must orbit around stars to assist them, possessing not only mutual complementarity but also the directionality of orbiting Taeseong together.

"Each star has a firm philosophy. So they don't select satellites based on ability alone. Especially for the Five Great Stars..."

"Yes. What I'm trying to do isn't something that can be achieved through compromise with someone else."

It was work that had to be carried through to the end despite countless opposition from the pinnacle of intellect.

The stars of the Ivory Tower existed in such a world.

"So stars who don't choose satellites sometimes request weapons or means of transportation. In some cases, they ask us to search even other worlds to find satellites."

"Other worlds..."

He thought of Tokay, Arte's satellite.

"So how about you make some request of me, Sirone? I can provide whatever you desire."

It wasn't bragging, since even the mental world, the source of Objects, was under the control of Luber, a 4-star resident.

"I'm not sure. Something I absolutely need..."

Now that he could use Material, there was no object he desperately wanted to have.

"My explanation was insufficient. The type isn't important. What matters is registering it with the Ivory Tower."

Sirone lifted his head, emerging from his thoughts.

"Registration?"

"As you know, stars can register one other existence besides themselves with the Ivory Tower. Usually it's a satellite, but the same applies to objects."

Taeseong showed the badges that satellites carry.

"Having a star's badge means receiving absolute support from the Ivory Tower residents. For example, suppose you registered a dagger that anyone can use as a star's object."

The badge transformed into a dagger, with a mark of orbiting around a star engraved on the handle.

"If the owner lost the dagger and someone picked it up and killed a person with it. And if that murderer was about to be punished by a kingdom..."

The mark engraved on the dagger emitted intense light.

"The Ivory Tower residents would do everything in their power to erase that kingdom from the map."

Sirone gulped.

"Ivory Tower residents have absolute trust in stars. Even if someone dies from a lost sword, they believe there must be some inevitable reason unknown to the criminals."

That's why not just anyone can become a star.

"Nothing is perfectly wrong or perfectly right. We are always the ones who define it. Sometimes compromise isn't everything. Sometimes there's only the method of enforcement."

If they had tried to solve every problem through compromise, humanity would have already perished before Nane.

"Registering with a star's title is the minimum problem-solving capability the Ivory Tower can have. In other words..."

Taeseong extended the dagger's handle.

"Even if it's wrong, a star's judgment is always right."

"Ah..."

When Sirone grasped the handle, the dagger transformed into bluish light and scattered as beautiful fragments.

"Choose carefully. It can be a person, an object, or an animal. Besides Sirone, you can register exactly one more thing with the Ivory Tower."

"Yes, I'll keep that in mind."

Thinking his meaning had been properly conveyed, Taeseong smiled with satisfaction and clapped his hands together.

"That's the basic rights of a star. And the Five Great Stars receive a special gift."

"If you're giving it, I'll gratefully accept it."

He didn't particularly have material desires, but since he had become one of the Five Great Stars, shouldn't he accept what was offered?

"What kind of gift might it be?"

Taeseong asked playfully, but when it came to actually thinking about it, it was a difficult question to answer.

"Haha, well? Something like a souvenir?"

He thought it rather suited the Five Great Stars, but Taeseong shook his head and pointed to the sky.

"I'll give you a star."

"...Yes. Yes?"

Sirone doubted his own ears.

"What are you giving me?"

"Actually, all I have are stars. Everything else was achieved by the Ivory Tower residents."

That was his reasoning, but Sirone couldn't even imagine what it meant to own a star.

"If I have a star... does it really become mine?"

"Of course. I govern all the stars in this world, and I'm giving you one of them."

When Taeseong swung both hands in a wide circle, the glass walls of the Grand Temple brightened and reflected the scenery of space.

"Wow..."

This time even Sirone was somewhat amazed.

"Stars, especially the Five Great Stars, have truly much to think about as leaders of stars. Sometimes I think you need a space to leave the human world and contemplate alone."

"No, but still, to go to another star..."

"Stars without names are lonely."

Sirone closed his mouth.

"The universe is surprisingly empty. Not all stars fulfill their purpose. There are countless stars that exist merely to fill probability. I thought it would be nice if even one person gave names to stars, so that's how I started this."

It was a thought only possible for the incarnation of stars.

"I see. I'll gratefully accept it."

Though he called it a privilege, Taeseong seemed more excited, clapping his hands as he showed the star candidates.

"Good! Then I'll select a few stars where people can live. Choose a star you like and give it a name."

The countless stars spread across the Grand Temple's ceiling rushed in at light speed and soon displayed one enormous planet.

'It's beautiful.'

It was entirely blue water with tens of thousands of islands scattered across that vast ocean.

"The average temperature is 28 degrees. It's a planet similar to this planet's tropical climate. With many islands, it's perfect as a resort. Though there are no beings to name things, countless different animals and plants are evenly distributed across each island, so it's good for taking walks depending on your mood."

Taeseong proudly introduced this masterpiece born from the near-infinite probability of the universe.

"It's wonderful."

"I highly recommend this work too. And next is the star of blue earth."

A planet with endless vegetation spread across vast continents was rotating while floating blue clouds.

"Countless animals live here. Since food isn't scarce, they don't eat each other. They're all gentle. If you like animals, I'd recommend this planet."

When Taeseong pulled the planet closer, mermaids were sitting on rocks by a small lake, singing beautiful songs.

'Amy would love this.'

As Sirone watched with a pleased expression, Taeseong introduced the final planet.

"This one can definitely be called a work of art created by nature."

It was a planet with countless scenic views that were extremely rare even on the planet where Sirone lived, stretching endlessly.

"It's definitely the finest among those created by volcanoes, typhoons, tides, crustal movements, and such. It's currently in a stable period, so it's safe to bring friends. Of course... you might twist your ankle while climbing mountains."

Mountain peaks jutted up above the clouds, and blue seas spread below sheer cliffs.

Jungles were formed along enormous rivers, and herds of animals were moving across endlessly spread plains.

"Hmm... I see."

Sirone retracted the thought he had when he first heard Taeseong's words.

'There was something I wanted to have.'

He really wanted it.

Even if he made it with Material, he doubted whether he could create such beauty, not to mention the time it would take.

"It's not an expression befitting a star, but it's rich in resources too. There are many materials not found elsewhere. While mass importation can't be permitted as it would destroy the star's balance, personal use extraction is fine. When you have time, learning alchemy would be good too."

Having finished introducing the stars, Taeseong looked back at Sirone.

"If none of them appeal to you..."

"I'll take that star."

When Sirone raised his hand and pointed to the ceiling, Taeseong smiled with his eyes and nodded.

"Then, please give it a name."

"The planet's name is..."

Sirone's eyes became moist for a moment.

"Hexar."

May it no longer be a lonely name.

"That's a wonderful name. From now on, planet Hexar belongs to Sirone. This is guaranteed by me, who governs the stars of the universe, and no one can claim ownership."

Taeseong checked the time.

"There's a little over a day left until the altar opens. You've fought fiercely. You may do whatever you want."

It sounded like telling him to organize his remaining life, making Sirone anxious.

"No. I'd rather go to Nane again. This time I'll settle things for certain."

Taeseong shook his head.

"If Sirone loses, no one can stop Nane. Wait for the right time. Time is needed."

"Are you telling me to just watch the world head toward destruction from here?"

"It won't be destroyed."

Taeseong spoke with conviction.

"Sirone, humans are weak beings, but they're not fragile. Those who have overcome countless crises so far won't easily give up the world."

Having said that, when Taeseong looked down at the earth, Sirone also turned his gaze to the blue planet beyond the glass floor.

'What's happening?'
