[656] The Air of Life (5)

There is no cause, only results.

That is Hexa.

"I see."

Lufist rested his chin on his hand, lost in thought.

He couldn't be sure if Anchal, who had investigated Estas with Sirone, had kept his promise to share information, but Lufist had already encountered the report on Hexa through the 'Holy War.'

If Sirone was a Hexa, he would be La Enemy's natural enemy, and if that were the case, there was no way they hadn't made contact.

"And Shagal caught that scent."

Brooks couldn't understand.

"What on earth are you talking about? What incident? And who is La Enemy?"

Instead of answering, Lufist stood up from his seat.

"Good. I'm going to meet Venezia now. Guide me."

"Wait a minute. Isn't this too much? Even if you're the association president, it's problematic to just demand someone hand over what's theirs."

Radum was Tormia's biggest headache, and Venezia was the head of the largest faction there.

"Name a price and I'll match it."

Brooks chuckled.

"You're underestimating me. I'm a legitimate businessman too. I know that any amount of visible money is just pocket change."

He had never even imagined putting a price on Venezia's value from the beginning.

"I'm in a hurry. If you have something to say, say it quickly."

Lufist was indeed reasonable, but precisely because of that, petty rhetoric wouldn't work on him.

"Earlier you said you'd close down Radum."

Brooks asked with a serious expression.

"I did."

"I want to manage it."

"Hmm."

"The kingdom will need to establish a separate management department anyway once the terrorist organization is eliminated. If you designate 'Brooks Mercenary Agency' as a private cooperation company, I'll provide the mercenaries needed for sub-human management."

If he could monopolize Radum, it would open up a completely different dimension from the business he'd done so far.

Ryan recalled how Sirone had purchased all the information cards from the Silverling branch.

'Whatever's visible is just pocket change.'

The same went for swords.

What's more frightening than a visible sword is the countless possibilities that sword contains.

By that measure, La Enemy was a single sword aimed at the world.

"Fine, Brooks Mercenary Agency gets exclusive rights to Radum."

"Deal."

Brooks downed the liquor in his glass in one gulp and headed for the door.

"Let's go. I'll guide you."

The place where Venezia was confined was a punishment room prepared in the basement of the mansion.

The room of about one pyeong had not even a torch hanging in it, and she sat on a shabby wooden chair.

'This woman is a Three-Brain Tribe member.'

When Sirone had heard about it, he had imagined a monster with three heads and was quite tense, but the woman he actually saw was normal enough to pass for human.

However, her pupils were blue with no whites, and embedded in her forehead as a bodily organ rather than decoration was a teardrop-shaped jewel.

"The head of Spectrum, Venezia?"

At Lufist's question, the corners of her mouth rose slightly.

"You're Lufist."

As far as Lufist could remember, this was the first time he had faced Venezia directly.

Both spoke simultaneously.

"How do you know me?"

Lufist closed his mouth and Venezia continued.

"Yes. It's short-term precognitive ability. I analyze the present based on the past and predict the future."

This was the reason she had been able to integrate numerous terrorist organizations and protect the sub-humans from the kingdom.

Ryan asked.

"Even so, is it possible to predict the next words?"

"That's because you have human thought patterns. What I analyze isn't events but time itself. Because I can distinguish between past and present, I can also differentiate between present and future."

Lufist asked.

"When did you know I was coming here?"

"By your standards, one minute ago."

"Then you must also know why I came."

"To understand La Enemy's intentions."

"Did you meet him?"

Venezia frowned.

"What an ambiguous question. If I could be certain of that, I wouldn't have confined myself."

Sirone stepped forward.

"Is it true that La Enemy exists only as incidents?"

Venezia looked blank.

"Who are you?"

"I'm Arian Sirone..."

"No. How long have you been here?"

Lufist's eyes sparkled.

"You couldn't foresee it?"

Sirone's Ataraxia destroys time, providing a perfectly open future.

It was natural that the Three-Brain Tribe's brain couldn't perceive it.

"The reason I came here was you."

"No, I..."

Lufist cut off Sirone's words.

"Explain it comprehensibly. What is La plotting?"

"There's probably no one in this world who accurately understands La's intentions."

Venezia pointed to her head.

"The Three-Brain Tribe has three brains that separately perceive past, present, and future. Currently, La seems to be imprinting special experiences on numerous people. Of course, these are things that actually happened. It's just that those events exist 'only in the past.'"

"So they're realities that have already passed."

"Yes. Humans living in the flow of time cannot distinguish them. But my brain structure is different. In my brain that perceives the past, La Enemy remains vivid. But my present brain can't obtain any information. The biggest problem is that despite this, my future brain still makes predictions. Do you know what this means?"

Sirone said.

"There is no present."

"Exactly. From the Three-Brain Tribe's perspective, having the past change the future without going through present analysis means I have no choice. It means nothing in this world can be changed according to our will."

Human will is the exclusive domain of the present.

Therefore, if the present is taken away from humanity, everything in this world will have no choice but to move according to La's will.

This was also why Yorga had risked his life to persuade Miro.

"What I can do is confine myself so I won't be used by La. But the other comrades in Radum can't do that. They're acting on causality from events that definitely existed. Even though they're actually moving according to La's design, they think they're making judgments of their own will."

"What's happening in Radum?"

"Systemic overthrow."

Venezia said with a sad expression.

"The resistance will fight for freedom. La made contact with numerous comrades. He would have injected hints to some, anger to others, hope to yet others. When they're all integrated by La's will, the Kingdom of Tormia will be rebuilt as a nation of sub-humans."

Sirone bit his lips tightly.

"How could that be..."

The reason why the Ivory Tower, which hadn't moved even during the war with Heaven, was searching for La Enemy became clear.

La is air.

The air permeating human life.

"Remember this. All those who made contact with La will eventually move under La's special design."

"Now I understand."

Lufist turned to look at Sirone and asked.

"You've obtained information about La Enemy before?"

"Yes. I stopped by the guild and got information cards..."

"Then this will be easy. The association has also obtained numerous pieces of information. But none of them had anything in common."

"Same here. Some said he was blind, others said he was deaf."

"Right. But the problem isn't that. All the information providers the association tracked down died or went missing. Twelve of them were suicides."

"They took their own lives?"

As soon as he said it, Sirone shook his head.

"No, I can't really say that."

"Right. It would be La's design. I don't know how he led them to suicide, but somehow he influenced..."

Lufist, who had suddenly realized something, turned to Brooks.

"Where is Shagal now?"

The moment he asked, screams from the guards could be heard from the first floor of the mansion.

The screams that had poured down like a localized shower suddenly stopped, and realizing something serious had happened, Brooks ran up the stairs with Lufist following.

"Sirone, stop La Enemy."

As Sirone was about to turn around, Venezia spoke to him.

"He is humanity's tragedy. Very few can criticize La's events with human brains."

It would be difficult unless one was a considerable Carga.

"But you are one who has escaped the bonds of causality. Find a way. If you can't succeed, the world will head toward destruction."

Sirone nodded briefly and went up to the first floor with Ryan.

The incident was already concluded, and numerous corpses were scattered on the floor.

Brooks stamped his feet and spat.

"Damn it. It took less than three seconds to kill 23 people."

If the screams were all they had for last words, it wasn't an exaggeration, and above all, these were strong fighters incomparable to bandit groups.

'Is this Shagal's real skill?'

Ryan examined the corpses, checking what could be called the killer's fingerprints.

They had all been stabbed, and blood was spurting from the holes at higher than normal pressure.

"The bleeding condition is strange?"

"It's the trademark of rapid-fire swords."

Lufist approached a corpse leaning against the wall.

When he slowly extended his hand toward where blood was spurting, a translucent blade finally became visible.

"Is that his weapon?"

"This is my first time seeing it too. The weapon Shagal uses is a short sword with dozens of thin shells layered together as you can see now. Each time he stabs, a shell comes off. This way, even if muscles contract the moment the short sword penetrates, the shell stays behind while only the core comes out, making it easy to deliver consecutive attacks. But the real terror of these thin blades is something else."

Lufist held out the sharp end of a shell.

"There's a hole at the tip of the blade. So the moment it penetrates, massive bleeding occurs due to pressure difference. Anywhere he stabs becomes a fatal wound. Of course, one can stop some bleeding through Schema abilities, but..."

Lufist threw the shell and pointed at the corpse.

"There's no solution when he tears you up like this."

Ryan looked at the corpse bleeding from dozens of holes.

Particularly around the heart area, three shells were embedded in a triangular formation.

'Shagal of the Rapid-Fire Sword.'

The next time they met, he would have to forget about battles like the one in the underground waterway.

Sirone asked.

"Why did he leave? Is this also La's design?"

"Probably so. Shagal is troublesome. If he were a typical psychopath, catching him would be easy, but he's an acquired killer. You don't get the modifier of being among the world's 100 most dangerous people just by following evil methodologies. You need unwavering philosophy."

"So Shagal isn't evil?"

"Of course not."

Lufist nodded readily.

"He's evil among evils."

"..."

"Anyway, this settles it. Radum will be closed."

Brooks said.

"But... with all my subordinates wiped out, immediate mercenary supply is impossible."

It wasn't as if Magic Association personnel could be deployed either.

"Unofficial at best. That would be the way to handle Radum."

Having made his decision, Lufist turned to Sirone.

"Sirone, let's make a deal with the association. If you help with this matter, I'll consider myself in your debt."

Judging by ability alone, it was actually a better decision than using association staff.

"Alright. What should I help with?"

Since he was planning to investigate Radum anyway, their interests aligned.

"Form a mercenary unit of about 20 people and incorporate them into Brooks' side. The association will cover everything needed for that."

As Lufist headed for the main entrance, Sirone quickly asked back.

"What kind of people should I recruit?"

"You're the captain."

Lufist closed the door as he went outside and said.

"Figure it out yourself."
