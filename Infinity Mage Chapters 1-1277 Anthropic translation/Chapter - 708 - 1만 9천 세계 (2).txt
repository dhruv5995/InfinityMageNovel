[708] The 19,000 Worlds (2)

The Arctic.

In the middle of an endless expanse of ice, an ivory tower soared toward the sky.

Except for the Stars, it was a quiet place where people spent their lives purely pursuing academic knowledge, but today the atmosphere was different.

'How very strange.'

In front of the elevator leading to the Great Hall, Chief Internal Administrator Araka stroked his beard, lost in thought.

'A summons of all the Stars currently residing in the ivory tower.'

It was the first time in 29 years that the Supreme Star had called together Stars from each department rather than holding individual meetings.

"It's been a while, Mr. Araka."

The first to arrive was a 3-star resident of the Balance Department, Star Arte of the Ghost Goblins.

"You have come, Star of Wisdom."

Arte wore neat clothing and was waving a fan with a bell attached.

Since minor stars were excluded from observer status, Tokay was nowhere to be seen.

"An unusual event, gathering so many like this."

"Oh? Arte, you were here too?"

Star Byeolya Tsuoi, a 2-star resident of the System Inspection Department, walked along the mirror-smooth corridor.

"Yes. I arrived yesterday."

Though the number of stars varied according to one's level, hierarchy within the ivory tower wasn't strictly defined anyway.

"Then do you happen to know what this is about? Personally, it's my first time seeing Stars summoned like this."

Arte said, fluttering his fan.

"Most recently, it was when a giant meteor collision with the planet was predicted. The Five Great Stars did manage to stop it, though..."

It was a fact unknown to most of humanity.

"Hmm, a giant meteor. What could compare to something like that?"

"It seems to be about the altar. It's probably not unrelated to La Enemy's current condition either."

A hoarse voice came from down the corridor.

"Heh heh, looks like all the unlucky Stars got caught and gathered here."

A man wearing blue Eastern robes and with yellow talismans plastered all over to completely cover his face was walking toward them.

Ivory Tower 3-star resident, Star Heukgangsi.

Alias: Law Teacher.

Belonging to the Law Department, he managed the flow of all laws in the world and was a master of avatar arts who had sealed his own avatar.

Arte said with cold eyes.

"Being unlucky is just your opinion. It's an honor that the Supreme Star seeks us out."

"Kek kek! Is that so? Well, everyone's entitled to their judgment, but it seems even ghost goblins fear the Supreme Star?"

Arte's fan snapped shut with a sharp sound.

"Words that mock others ultimately come from one's own head. If that's as far as your thinking goes, perhaps those words apply to you instead."

"..."

Though Heukgangsi fell silent, a battle of killing intent more terrifying than any war raged between the two.

Tsuoi paid no attention, but Araka broke into a cold sweat despite his 117 years.

'This is why they shouldn't gather together.'

Since these were people who had pushed their convictions to the extreme beyond mere stubbornness, major accidents were likely when conflicts arose.

"I'm late. Hello. Nice to meet you."

A woman with her waist bent backward and both feet brought forward over her shoulders was crawling toward them like a spider.

Her straight black hair dragged on the ground, her pale face had no eyebrows or eyelashes, and her lips were flesh-colored, indistinguishable from her skin.

Ivory Tower 2-star resident, Star Morai Borbor.

Alias: Mollusk.

She wasn't called Mollusk simply because her body was flexible.

Belonging to the Balance Department, her conviction was to have no convictions, and she was a master of mental magic with transcendent psychological fluidity that could even resonate with microorganisms.

Tsuoi blinked and asked.

"What? Borbor, you were here too? I heard you went south. Did you resolve the demon terrorist incident?"

"No, well..."

A voice came from the top of Borbor's head.

"I told her to come."

Looking closely, a woman the size of a human thumb was sitting holding onto Borbor's hair.

Her face was too small to make out her features without looking carefully, but she was definitely beautiful.

Ivory Tower 2-star resident, Star Twelve Mini.

Alias: Super Giant.

A resident of the Integrated Universe Management Department who specialized in scale magic and was a lonely girl who stuck close to Borbor whenever she had time.

Tsuoi frowned as she looked down at Mini.

"Even so, how can you tell her to abandon her mission and come?"

"It's okay. Borbor said it was fine."

"No, that's not the point. Borbor will agree to anyone's request..."

Mini hugged the top of Borbor's head.

"And we're best friends. Right, Borbor?"

"Huh? Oh, right. We're best friends."

Satisfied with the answer, Mini beamed and waved at Arte as she looked up at him.

"You're still so cool, Mr. Arte. Want to sleep with me?"

Arte, who had been engaged in a battle of wits with Heukgangsi until then, opened his fan and covered his face.

"I'll pass. I don't want to drown."

Having responded thus, he turned his gaze to Araka.

"It seems everyone's gathered with these numbers? Shall we depart?"

"If you leave without me, the Supreme Star will be disappointed, won't he?"

Where everyone turned their heads, a white-haired old man in a suit was approaching with a pipe in his mouth.

Not only was his beard neatly trimmed, but the fact that he wasn't wearing dream attire caught the residents' attention.

"Even Mr. Ruber...?"

"He specially called for me. It must be that important a matter."

Ivory Tower 4-star resident, Ruber.

Alias: Dream Person.

Though belonging to the Integrated Universe Management Department, his origin was Dreamoi, and he currently managed human dreams.

'What kind of matter requires a 4-star resident?'

Arte watched Ruber from behind his fan, lost in thought, and even Heukgangsi sensed the gravity of the situation this time.

Borbor lifted her head and said.

"Let's go up now. Everyone's here, right? Hello?"

"Not yet... it seems one more is coming."

Where Ruber turned his head, what appeared to be a human-sized brain was floating through the air toward them.

It was simply a brain, and thus its name was Brain.

"..."

Ivory Tower 4-star resident, Star Brain.

Alias: Someone's Unknown Brain.

Belonging to the Human Safety Enforcement Department, it appeared in various forms through illusion magic, but no one had ever held a conversation with it.

When Brain cast magic, a woman with straight hair that exposed her forehead appeared.

"You only transform into something pretty when I'm around."

Mini grumbled, but Brain didn't even respond and simply walked toward the elevator.

Ruber said.

"Now everyone's gathered. Please inform the Supreme Star."

"Understood."

Though Araka wasn't young either, he couldn't compare to the Dream Person's time.

'At least it's fortunate that Mr. Ruber came.'

A Dream Person who controlled dreams wouldn't dare show insolent behavior before the Supreme Star, even at 3-star level.

"Supreme Star, the Stars request an audience."

While waiting to be called, Tsuoi asked.

"If it's as big a matter as a meteor collision, could it really be because of the altar?"

Heukgangsi shook his head.

"It's not immediately urgent. The Council of Ten isn't showing any particularly major movements either. I think it's probably because of the ivory tower test."

Mini said.

"You're talking about Nane, right?"

Borbor rolled her eyes upward.

"Nane is dangerous. His sword transformation is impressive too. But is that serious enough to compare to a meteor collision?"

"It might be even more serious."

Arte said.

"It's much faster than previously predicted. If he maintains this pace, he'll achieve enlightenment before even taking the test."

Tsuoi stroked her chin.

"Could it possibly be because of Shirone?"

Dream Person Ruber turned his head as if reacting, and Mini raised one eyebrow.

"Hexa is also a problem that can't be overlooked, but it wouldn't be bigger than Nane, would it?"

"There was a rumor that the Supreme Star was the one who cast a vote for Shirone. Of course, it was just a ceremonial vote, but..."

"Nah, that can't be it. Honestly, even I doubt whether I could handle Nane. They're not comparable."

Until recently, Tsuoi had thought the same.

"After meeting Shirone this time, I felt that..."

Before she could finish speaking, a pillar of light fell on the elevator and the Stars' forms disappeared.

Screams echoed through the labyrinth.

"Please remain calm! Andre Tourism has a terrorism response team, and with support from the Territory Management Department...!"

The guide tried to calm everyone down, but people who had lost their reason to fear ran toward the exit without looking back.

"Rian, let's prepare. They won't be able to stop them."

If it was the Maga Bandit Group, ranked S-class even in the Kashan Empire, the world's largest nation, the terrorism response team would be helpless.

Kido said.

"Will you be okay? Even if we open doors and enter simultaneously, the Spirit Zone needs to be maintained, right? The main body has to remain."

The possibility of the main body's mind remaining intact while multiplied into 19,000 people converged on zero.

"Shirone will be fine. I'll stay too."

Hearing the sounds of battle cries echoing from the distance, Rian drew his great sword.

"Go. I'll protect this place, so release the seal."

Rian could be trusted.

"I'm counting on you. Kido, you be careful too."

As Shirone flew deeper into the labyrinth, the guide reached out and shouted.

"Where are you going? There's a secret passage this way!"

"We're not leaving!"

Hearing the absurd answer, the guide looked stunned, then turned to Rian and Kido.

"You're not leaving either? Bandits have attacked!"

Kido, who had gathered all the water bottles dropped by tourists, gulped down water and waved his hand dismissively.

"You'd better run. The labyrinth's seal will be released soon. Then you'll know what hell is."

"...You're insane."

Convinced they were indeed insane, she ran toward the secret passage while Rian surveyed the situation from the entrance.

"They're certainly skilled. It seems there are hardly any stragglers."

Nearly 40 members of the Maga Bandit Group were rushing toward Andre after instantly defeating the terrorism response team.

"The Council of Ten, did that woman come too?"

Rian frowned at the sight of Kido continuously unscrewing water bottle caps.

"Why are you drinking so much? How are you going to fight with your stomach sloshing around?"

"Huh? Oh, sorry."

As Kido approached with his tongue hanging out like a puppy, Rian sensed something different and asked again.

"What's wrong? Is there some problem?"

"No, it's nothing. I was just a bit thirsty. Maybe from crossing the desert."

That's what he said, but his inner thoughts were different.

'This is strange. Why do I keep getting so thirsty?'

No matter how much water he drank, his thirst wouldn't be quenched.

'This is really driving me crazy. I want to drink more.'

Like a starving ghost with a burst stomach, or like drought-stricken earth yearning for nature's rain.

"They're coming, Kido."

Standing beside Rian, he could see the Maga Bandit Group led by Baknyeo, covered in sand.

"They don't even look tired. Can we do this? Shirone said at least seven days, right?"

They had to stop the Maga Bandit Group for seven days.

"We won't need to last that long. I'm going to cut them down."

"What kind of nonsense is that? Do you know how much of a monster that woman is...?"

Kido's eyes widened.

A terrifying demonic fighting spirit unlike anything he'd seen before was emanating from Rian.

'This guy, he's serious?'

Rian's Divine Transcendence was always powerful, but...

'I will definitely protect you, Shirone.'

His avatar when protecting Shirone was beyond compare.

"Here I gooooo!"

Divine Transcendence.

Denai.

The will that denied all laws rushed in like Mach speed as Rian's body shot toward Baknyeo.
