The Weight of Existence (3)

The Hall of Evil.

Having heard about the birth of good and evil, Sirone's group left Lilith's room and walked down the corridor.

"How much evil exists?" Cain asked.

"This hall contains all evil from beginning to end. I don't intend to rank them, but there's a kind of ranking system, you could say? Most evils have only a single line of records remaining."

Every room in the corridor was a library, and the size of each room couldn't be gauged from the doorway.

"The truly powerful evils get special solitary rooms, but oh, Havitz is here too. Quite high up. Ranked 7th. This level could even compete with our mother."

The group didn't respond.

"Usually they're recorded in rooms arranged chronologically. You'd have to walk quite far to see the evils of the current era."

Sirone discovered a portrait hanging in another solitary room.

'Ms. Minerva.'

Though there was no intention to rank them, when judged by room order, she was ranked 87th. Iruki said.

"We don't have time."

"I know. You want to meet Giyorgi. That guy's holding a woman named Seina captive."

With the world being eroded by the Lamigyo cult, Seina was absolutely necessary.

'The person who will officially confirm all the circumstances of the Holy See.'

Cain turned around.

"Will you be alright? I don't know much about it, but Giyorgi is plotting. To kill you."

Sirone said.

"It's something I need to take responsibility for. Giyorgi is a demon born from my emotions."

"Responsibility."

It was a word that didn't suit evil.

"You're certainly similar. I wondered why Giyorgi didn't seem like a demon. Well, fine. I'll watch."

The end of an era.

"Now, from here on is the era you lived in. Let me see, there was one person among you here too, wasn't there?"

Cain looked back at Curtis and pointed to a room.

"Anyway, since you've come to the Core, you should receive a reward. How about going in and erasing your criminal record?"

When there was no answer, Sirone called out.

"Mr. Curtis."

"No, forget it. It doesn't matter anymore anyway. Let's just go. Punish me all you want." When the group stubbornly remained in front of the room, Curtis frowned and shouted.

"Yes! Damn it! I killed them! I killed those lovely girls! Disgusted? Then be disgusted!"

Pena said.

"You, really those women..."

"We were in love!" He fell to his knees and tore at his hair.

"Nia and I really loved each other. Yes, it was adultery. A man with a wife fooling around with his daughter's friend - I wouldn't look human! But my life...!"

"Why did you kill them?"

Sirone asked the main question.

Realizing that any words would just be rationalization, Curtis let everything go.

"Edrina, Nia, Belita, and Daisy had been friends since childhood. I was having an affair with Nia. But my daughter found out about it. It was Nia's fault. There was a small argument and in anger... she let it slip."

Perhaps she too wanted to get it off her chest quickly, using that opportunity.

"It was the day they were going on a trip. Actually, I was supposed to meet Nia at the travel destination. I told my wife it was a regional patrol. It's common for detectives. But eventually Edrina learned everything..."

"She didn't go on the trip."

"Right. She parted from her friends and went to the plaza. She saw the cottage address written on the bulletin board and went there. And there... she hanged herself."

"How do you know? According to your fellow detective, it was a situation where suicide wasn't possible..."

"The knot."

Curtis's hands trembled.

"It wasn't a noose tied with a hunting knot. It was a knot method where you twist it once more and hook a loop. First, she would have stood on a foothold and tied an old rope to the ceiling pipe. Then hung by her hands and cut the rope. Then removed the foothold and locked the warehouse door from inside. That completed the locked room."

The scene formed in the group's minds.

"Edrina would have positioned herself as if she had fallen and lain down. Then tied the rope around her neck using that knot method and pulled hard..."

The rope wouldn't come loose.

"That's how she left. My daughter..." Curtis imagines again.

His daughter lying on the cold warehouse floor, waiting for death with her neck constricted.

The single tear she would have shed.

"I..."

Curtis turned his head and burst into tears.

"It was the knot method I taught her."

"From childhood, Edrina liked that I was a detective. She probably thought I was some agent of justice catching villains. In reality, I was just a guy doing all sorts of odd jobs trying to live decently."

The moment he first discovered Edrina's body, what came to his mind was a memory from when his daughter was eight years old.

"My daughter, come here."

"Why, Dad?"

"Here, hold out both hands. I'll teach you something fun."

Curtis tied the little one's white wrists with a knot, then twisted it once more and hooked a loop.

"Ta-da!"

"Huh? What? Why won't this come off?"

"Hahaha! How's that?"

When Curtis tickled her sides and she laughed hysterically, Edrina complained.

"Stop it! Untie me quickly! I'll get you back!"

"Look at this."

Curtis sat his daughter on his knee and flicked off the loop caught between the knots with his thumb.

"Just flick it once like this and it comes loose. It's called the handcuff method. Magicians use it."

"Wow! Dad, teach me too. Please? Please?"

"Alright. Shall we try again?" "...She could have untied it."

Curtis felt his soul collapsing.

"Even at that moment, if she had changed her mind, she could have easily untied it. But why... AAAAHHH!"

Iruki, who had been watching him wail and beat the ground, raised a question.

"The detectives not discovering the knot..."

"I untied it."

When Curtis first discovered the body, his hands had automatically released the handcuff method.

"It wasn't to cover up the crime. What did adultery matter when my daughter was dead? I don't know. It was just so heartbreaking, that single knot that could just be untied. I couldn't believe it, wondering if somehow my daughter might come back to life..."

"But you killed them."

Edrina's friends Nia, Belita, and Daisy.

"When my daughter was dying, I was waiting at the travel destination where I was supposed to meet Nia."

It was an incident at another location.

"We were supposed to meet separately, but she brought all her friends. I was annoyed, but then I noticed my daughter wasn't there. When I asked what happened, Nia said it was all over."

Curtis turned his head.

"What do you think my feelings were then? A father who'd been caught fooling around with his daughter's friend by his daughter. I was furious and got into an argument with Nia. Nia threatened me about my wife. Said she'd destroy my family."

That's always how affairs end.

"I thought I needed to see my daughter first. But I couldn't just leave Nia alone. Her friends too. So I locked them in the cottage attic. I threatened that if they weren't there when I got back, I wouldn't let it slide. They seemed pretty scared."

"Even so, they could have escaped."

"If they really felt their lives were threatened, well. It was the second floor but the window was open. But it was just that kind of thing. We'd spent passionate nights until yesterday, it was the usual quarrel. This time it was just more serious because family was involved. Nia probably planned to wait too. It was an expensive cottage rental. She'd probably trash-talk me with her friends to her heart's content. Belita and Daisy would have found it thrilling."

Sirone said.

"But you never did meet your daughter."

"I went to Siff Plaza, our meeting place. An acquaintance merchant said she'd been anxiously looking at the bulletin board. It was a cottage rental ad. It was strange that it was an empty house, but on the other hand, my daughter with no money would have nowhere else to stay. Being a detective's daughter, she was fearless and had peculiar traits. So I called my friend Ryver. I can't tell you the details because it's embarrassing, but he could at least fabricate an alibi that I'd really gone on regional patrol. But what we saw at that cottage..."

Was his daughter's corpse.

"The rest doesn't need explanation. I won't make excuses about not being in my right mind. At first it was impulsive. But then a certain temptation came over me. Couldn't I make it as if it never happened? I'm just a murderer. A murderer who knows exactly how to evade investigation."

Curtis leaned against the wall and took out a cigarette.

"That's how most unsolved cases are. Coincidences outside of probability. The attachment to life is tremendous. When it was processed as an unsolved case, I thought I still had to live. I don't actually remember how I lived. Then... a letter came to where I work."

Click, the cigarette lit.

It's not Dad's fault.

"Phew."

Curtis blew smoke toward the ceiling and said.

"I couldn't bear the shame. I just wanted to forget. I should just die, but even if I disappeared, what I did would still remain. That bothered me so much that I wanted to erase it completely, so I came to Melkidu."

This was the full story of Edrina's case.

"Go on. I'll stay behind. Don't worry about paying for my crimes. I only have one thing left."

He planned to erase the record and end his life.

With the handcuff method that killed his daughter.

'That would do it, right, Edrina?'

Curtis threw his cigarette butt in the Hall of Evil.

"Living really fucking sucks."

"That's why you should live."

Pena approached.

"What changes if you die? There are things in this world that can't be made right with death."

Curtis wasn't unaware of this.

"So what should I do? Do you think she'd even blink if I rotted in prison for life?"

Even Parme's capital prison would be livable compared to Curtis's guilt.

"...I don't know. That's why it's a sin. Because you can't take responsibility, you shouldn't do it."

Pena continued.

"What did you feel when your daughter died? You're doing the exact same thing now. If you die like that, what happens to us who you leave behind? If you're going to die, die alone somewhere nobody knows, damn it. Please have some sense of responsibility."

She looked back at Sirone's group.

"I'll stay. Don't worry and go. I absolutely won't let him just die."

After thinking briefly, Sirone turned around.

"Let's go."

With Cain leading, the group disappeared, leaving Pena alone with Curtis, who said.

"That was good acting."

"What?"

"Erase the record and run away. The Core is reality. You could take a ship or whatever and find a new life."

Honestly, he'd thought about it.

"Forget it. I want to stop."

"Stop what?"

Pena sat beside Curtis.

"There are probably many people hurt because of me. Coming here, I realized there's no such thing as a new life. If I don't change, whatever happens, it'll be the same life."

That there was no such thing as a holy land for demons.

"Then... what do we do now?"

"Let's just stay still. Let's not think about what we should do. We're the ones who messed up. Whatever judgment the world makes, we'll accept it. With a repentant heart. Nothing will change, but..." Holding back tears, Pena said.

"We should at least take responsibility for the sin of not taking responsibility."

The sin of not taking responsibility.

"...I see."

In the Hall of Evil, Curtis looked toward the sky.

'I'm sorry.'

I ruined everything.

'So, God.'

If God truly exists, if that God has something like a heart as humans do.

'Please...'

Do not forgive me.
