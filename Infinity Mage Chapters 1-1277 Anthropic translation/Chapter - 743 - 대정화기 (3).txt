**[743] The Great Purification Period (3)**

'Truly terrifying obsession.'

The executives of the Ten Elders were those who had overcome the fear of death, so Veron's obsession also held meaning.

'But your opponent is me.'

Even though the rulers of each nation had already grasped the nature of the altars, they couldn't take action because there were no means to stop it.

'There is no way to stop Buddha.'

Poor soul.

Veron's iron determination would be an obstacle to the future Nane envisioned, but there was no resentment in his voice.

'Rather, pity.'

If suffering arose from obsession, then Veron's iron will had reached the limits of obsession that a human could possess.

I shall save you from suffering.

The cloud bearing Nane's form clenched both fists and took a charging stance toward Veron.

"Shura, leave."

"No. I will protect the Chairman."

Veron twisted his lips into a smirk, pushing them left and right.

"Sometimes you're poor at lying."

"......"

"I can't let this opportunity slip by. Haven't I been waiting for this day since the moment I became human without going through reincarnation?"

Veron's jaw swelled like a balloon and his eyes bulged out halfway like a toad's.

"Only one who kills Buddha can become Buddha. Nane's righteousness is also merely the righteousness of now."

As a blood-red, elongated tongue protruded from between Veron's lips, Shura's shoulders trembled.

'The Chairman is serious.'

As far as she could remember, it had been well over five thousand years since Veron had given his all to pursue something.

"I will kill Nane and become the new Buddha."

Anyone can become Buddha.

As Nane's cloud, over 2 kilometers tall, plunged toward the ground, vegetation swayed violently.

"Chairman!"

Just as Shura shouted, Veron raised his staff with mad eyes gleaming.

"This is my determination."

As he struck the ground with his staff, the atmosphere rippled like a rubber sheet and a hole burst through Nane's cloud.

Evacuation alarms rang in Shura's mind.

'It's beginning.'

Judging by the scale of battle, she should properly retreat at least 100 kilometers away, but her gaze remained fixed on the battlefield.

Since Nane was also not completely perfect, she thought she must watch this confrontation to the very end.

"Go!"

As Veron's staff struck the ground a second time, Nane's cloud compressed into a single point in mid-air and exploded.

Looking up at the enormous band spreading to the horizon's edge, Veron muttered.

"...Is the real one coming?"

Where the cloud had disappeared, brilliant multicolored light was born as Nane revealed himself.

**Sermon**

**Tathagata.**

Shura's lips fell open in a daze.

'It's as if he's come from an infinitely distant place.'

Swords of light spread in a circle around Nane, making the surroundings so bright that even the sun couldn't be seen.

**Sermon**

**Immeasurable.**

In an instant the radiance exploded, shooting down swords of light as numerous as sunbeams toward the earth.

"Uoooooooh!"

Looking up at the light pouring down like a downpour, Veron swung his staff at terrifying speed.

*Kurururururung.*

Thunder-like sounds erupted from the ground, and in an instant a 1-kilometer radius was laid waste.

'Where's the Chairman?'

As thick smoke rolled away, a strong voice burst forth.

"You dare call yourself Buddha with just this much!"

As Veron spun his staff and deflected the swords of light, Sermon Immeasurable caused chaotic reflections.

"Heuuk!"

Shura squeezed her eyes shut, but the light was so bright that silhouettes of the landscape showed through her eyelids.

'He's equal even against Tathagata. This might actually...'

Since no one had yet become a god, Nane too didn't know the limits of strength and wasn't immortal.

"Trapped in the concept of 'only I'..."

As Nane smiled and spread both arms, a gray sword vibrated above his head.

"How could you comprehend selflessness?"

**Sermon**

**Pierce.**

A gray line was drawn from the heavens, and before anyone knew it, a sword that had cut Veron's staff in half thrust toward his chest.

"Ugh..."

Spreading all ten fingers wide, Veron clasped his palms together just before the blade could penetrate his chest, grasping the blade.

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

The Law focused between his palms, blocking the blade's penetration, but his body was pushed backward at terrifying speed.

*Kwakwakwakwakwakwakwakwak!*

Even while being pushed back a full kilometer, Veron's Law was compressing ever more powerfully.

'I have no choice but to destroy it!'

Just as he tried to crush the blade, Nane spun with an empty expression and formed hand seals toward Veron again.

"Sermon. Giant."

The gray sword grew endlessly larger, gradually forcing Veron's palms apart and dramatically accelerating his backward momentum.

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

"That's..."

Interest flickered in Shirone's eyes as he observed the ground from the Great Temple.

In the Southern Hemisphere, at some point in the Iron Kingdom, a gray sword had risen, vibrating at 7.8 times the size of the planet.

'No, it's advancing.'

According to his mage's senses, it was faint but definitely advancing at 1 kilometer per second.

"That Amita holding out against it is impressive too."

Taesung asked.

"What do you think? You've faced him directly, so you'd know. If it were Shirone, could you block that current sermon?"

"Yes."

In terms of scale mastery, they were roughly similar, which was why the universe hadn't closed yet.

"It's not substance but the expansion of substance. Defense is possible through the Law."

"Hmm."

Taesung listened carefully to Shirone's opinion.

"But it's growing endlessly stronger. Eventually it will reach a level even I cannot handle."

That was exactly what Taesung wanted to say, but it wasn't yet time to voice it.

Not alone, not as many, but everyone must fight together.

'Even if it may be impossible...'

"Heuuuuuh!"

At the end of the 18-kilometer scratch that Nane's Sermon Pierce had carved into the planet, Veron cruelly contorted his face.

'Can I not block it?'

Along the path he had traveled, a tunnel stretched to the horizon's end, and flames blazed from the surrounding heat.

'It's coming in.'

As the blade, now immeasurable in scale, broke through between his palms and touched his chest, searing pain rushed over him.

'So this is my end.'

Suddenly it came to mind.

'Why did I... cling so desperately to life?'

*Gurgleuk. Gurgleuk.*

When Veron still had no name, he was merely a harmlessly plump poison toad.

*Gurreuk!*

A system of settling somewhere in a pond, hopping around, and occasionally extending his tongue to swallow passing flies.

'I want to eat. I want to reproduce.'

Living each day with the same desires wasn't particularly a bad life either.

'Predator! Predator! Predator! Predator!'

He realized this fact when a snake, the poison toad's natural enemy, swallowed Veron in one gulp.

......

The snake's venom was more terrifying than the toad's poison, and trapped in the cramped stomach, he could only blink his eyes in terror.

'I'm dying!'

The reason he couldn't even scream was surely the biological fate he was born to fulfill.

'It hurts. It's suffocating. I'm dissolving.'

Like countless poison toads before him, Veron too should rightfully become nutrients in the snake's stomach.

'Dying?'

Everything that constitutes me will be annihilated.

*Kieeeeeee! Kieeeeeee!*

As he lost consciousness to the paralyzing poison, Veron opened his mouth wide and howled.

'I don't want to die! Like this... like this...!'

As the toxin concentration seeping into the mucus intensified, the snake's stomach compressed even more strongly.

Save me.

Predators are born with all abilities to digest their prey, but this one was quite venomous.

The snake writhed roughly to accelerate digestion, and it might have ended that way.

Sharp teeth pierced through the snake's hide and stabbed into Veron's back.

*Gururreuk! Gururreuk!*

The snake's stomach began expelling Veron again, and the mucus prevented the fangs from tearing his skin.

When Veron emerged outside and looked back, the snake was being mauled by its predator, a wildcat.

'I'm alive!'

If Veron hadn't struggled, the snake wouldn't have moved, and the wildcat wouldn't have discovered them either.

'Alive! Alive!'

Fleeing madly and hiding in the depths of the lakeside, Veron fell into sleep as if fainting.

*Gururreuk.*

And when he awoke again, countless stars were twinkling in the sky.

Looking up at the sky, Veron was seized by a strange feeling.

'Shameful.'

The raw emotion, unfiltered by language, enveloped his entire being.

His writhing violently in the snake's stomach, screaming and pleading to be saved.

'Why is this so embarrassing?'

The answer to the question Veron pondered for the first time in his life contained truly mysterious principles.

'Because it's meaningless.'

His own appearance, struggling without even a reason to live, couldn't have been more pathetic.

'Meaning. The meaning for which I must live.'

The toad who had awakened to incarnation gazed at the stars in the sky all night until dawn.

'You called it obsession?'

As Nane's sword raced endlessly and Veron's body began burrowing into the ground.

'Perhaps that might be so.'

The flesh of his palms had completely fallen away and the blade had penetrated from collarbone to abdomen.

'But this is my eternal life.'

Even if his physical body disappeared, the meaning he left behind would eternally sustain this world.

'Death is also life.'

Death too becomes life.

"It's not shameful!"

As Veron struggled with all his might, the Law encompassing the world concentrated between his two palms.

"Go!"

*Kiiiiiiiing!*

Nane's sword twisted violently and shattered into pieces starting from the blade's tip.

"Heuuuuu..."

Barely regaining his balance, Veron took in the apocalyptic landscape before his eyes and moved his lips.

"Shura, are you there?"

Shura appeared, tearing through space.

"Chairman, are you alright?"

"Go to Hexa. Don't let the meaning I've left in this world become meaningless."

"I refuse! You know how much I hate that brat! And what about the Ten Elders?"

Meeting Veron's eyes, which had let go of everything, Shura quietly averted her gaze.

"Why, why me of all people..."

Veron patted Shura's shoulder.

"...Live on."

With those final words, as Veron collapsed, Shura furrowed her brow into a frown.

"I don't know how to live forever or anything like that..."

At the sound of footsteps, she turned to see Nane approaching with calm movements.

"So you chose to remain in the end?"

For Veron's sake too, who couldn't go anywhere and would wander the nine heavens, this world had to be closed as soon as possible.

"Being of obsession, do you also wish to follow your predecessor?"

Shura looked down at Veron's corpse.

*Go to Hexa.*

Recalling Veron's voice, Shura's eyes grew cold as she turned and knelt before Nane.

"How could I dare offer any opinion to one who has overwhelmed the head of the Ten Elders?"

Shura's forehead touched the ground.

"I will follow you."

As Nane nodded and turned around with his hands behind his back, Shura approached from behind.

"What do you plan to do?"

"Open the altars."

Though the altar where Veron's iron will had been planted was laid waste, 3,599 altars still remained in the world.

"Sermon, Open."

A single sword pierced through the heavens and flew to space, then split into thousands of flashes and struck down.

Taesung said.

"The Great Purification Period has opened."
