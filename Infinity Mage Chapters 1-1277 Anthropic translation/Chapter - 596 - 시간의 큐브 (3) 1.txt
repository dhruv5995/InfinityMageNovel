[596] Cube of Time (3)

The hunched old woman ran along the treacherous mountain path.

Though she was 82 years old, she could not stop walking while carrying the kingdom's fate in her arms.

'Your Highness, you must survive.'

The First Prince of the Kingdom of Kazura.

Though he had to be abandoned to escape the invasion of the Yakma Republic, someday he would return to Kazura and ascend to the throne.

'Anywhere... a place where people live...'

The place to hide the prince had to be somewhere even she couldn't explain, and finally she discovered a hunter's cabin.

"What's that...?"

Seeing the old woman opening the stable door and entering, Sirone hastily held his breath.

Anchal's intermediate heaven barrier was activated so she wouldn't notice, but his heart pounded roughly when she came right up close.

"Your Highness, please preserve your precious body."

After setting the child down, the old woman clasped her hands together for a brief prayer, then immediately left the stable.

"Who is this child?"

Miro asked.

"The child born between Orcamp IV, First Prince of the Kingdom of Kazura, and Eliza."

Sirone knew Kazura's political situation better than anyone, having been directly invited to the royal castle and endured all sorts of hardships.

"But this is our house."

"It would be if you were Hexa. And from now on, I'm going to switch you with Kazura's prince."

"What?"

Leaving Hexa here meant that Kazura's prince, who should have originally been here, would go to the upper floors.

"Why must it be that way? We could raise both of them together. No, before that, how did you know the prince would come here?"

"There's no way to know, not before experiencing it firsthand."

Confirming that the old woman's footprints disappeared on their own, Sirone realized.

"Reset?"

"Right. The reset is already in progress. However, because Guffin separated the time of the upper floors from original time, we can observe it."

Anchal said.

"The inflection point between before and after the reset. They inserted and connected the event of switching the children at that moment's coordinates."

"Exactly. That's why no one can approach it, except for Estas's upper floors."

As Miro set Hexa down and tried to embrace the prince the old woman had left behind, Sirone gripped her shoulder.

"I still haven't heard an answer. Why must you take him?"

"Because he shouldn't exist. According to Guffin, Hexa is a life form for whom every measure has been taken so that he won't be exploited by Ankera's reset or any other factor."

His body trembled as he recalled Behemoth, who had now become one with his own avatar.

"But this child is different. If we leave him like this, he'll be exploited."

"I can't accept it."

Sirone's breathing grew rough.

"If I survived through someone else's sacrifice... what does my life even become?"

Yorga would think the same way.

'Sister would absolutely never do such a thing.'

That's why he had to do it.

"Sirone."

Miro took the prince in her arms.

"I'm not killing him. He'll stay in Estas's upper floors."

"That's the same thing! He'll have to live repeating a short time forever! This child who knows nothing of reason, language, or even the existence of the world!"

"That's right."

Miro doesn't turn away from reality.

"If there had been a better way, I would have done that. This is Guffin's final conclusion, and humanity must make a choice. I too have made my choice, and I'll be forever trapped in the walls of space-time."

Sirone thought it wasn't worth responding.

"Anchal, dispel the illusion magic."

Anchal didn't move, and Miro became angry.

"Sirone! Think rationally!"

"How can I think any more rationally than this?"

"Do you know what happens if Ankera freely activates resets? Our future disappears! All humans will lose their free will and move according to Ankera's design!"

Even Sirone couldn't help but feel chilled this time.

While some dictator might dominate humans, even under such a dictator there would at least be the freedom to resist.

But in a world ruled by Ankera, even time would be stolen and they'd have to live forever as his puppets.

"If Ankera's weakness disappears, humans won't even be able to die! He'll reset and eliminate the cause!"

Perhaps that was truly divine power.

"Do you want such a future? A life where you can no longer decide on development, progress, or even regression? The moment he becomes god, humans will lose their value as living beings!"

Sirone's eyes grew cold again.

"That might be so. But that choice is also ours to make. All of ours, not Guffin's."

Miro reacted sensitively.

"Don't talk like Yorga."

"What's wrong with that? Now I understand. Mars might be different, but at least Yorga came here to stop you, Miro. Because you have dangerous thoughts."

"Dangerous thoughts?"

"There's no choice. How is this different from Ankera?"

"That's sophistry. That's why I said I'd sacrifice myself."

"Then why must you sacrifice yourself, Miro?"

"Because I'm human! Humans are a species that can't move forward without someone's sacrifice! You were also born to sacrifice yourself, so why don't you understand!"

"Sacrifice?"

When Sirone asked back, Miro bit her lips.

"If you truly pity this child, humbly accept the sacrifice."

"I don't know what you mean."

Miro sighed.

"Do you know why you should be free from Ankera's reset? To perfectly create the dimensional door."

"What are you talking about?"

"...Honestly, I was confused when I learned you were Hexa. Because Hexa is a life form that must become material for the dimensional barrier I'll create."

As Anchal listened with crossed arms, Sirone muttered.

"Material..."

"Guffin will leave. And I'll create the dimensional barrier in his place. But with angelic power, it will inevitably be breached someday. The countermeasure created for that is you, Hexa."

Having heard that much, Sirone recalled when he first met her in Miro's space-time.

"Don't tell me..."

"I'll create another dimension within the dimensional world I create. You, who aren't affected by resets. Then neither angels nor even Ankera can break through the dimensional wall. And humanity will survive forever."

Creating dimension within dimension, drilling endlessly inward.

It would create a perfect, flawless gap, completely different in concept from the samadhi Miro had attempted alone.

"It's infinite because there are two of us. I can't do it alone."

"But I'm here."

Even Miro was puzzled about that.

"Honestly, I don't know why you still exist in this world."

"Because you sent me away, Miro."

"No. That can't be. I assure you, I will definitely put you in my barrier. Because I have to."

"But it's the truth."

With evidence from 19 years in the future right before her eyes, there was no way to refute it.

'I can't understand. If Hexa didn't create the barrier, how is the world still maintained?'

This was still before Gaold had abandoned god.

"Anyway, the threat hasn't disappeared. That's why you entered the upper floors too. If you're thinking of sacrificing yourself in place of this child, rather become an offering for my barrier."

It was cold speech, and therefore like Miro, but...

Let's keep in touch.

Remembering what she had said the night before they parted after finishing training, Sirone opened his mouth.

"I can't accept it. The Miro I know wouldn't make this kind of choice."

"No, I know myself. The possibility of changing my mind is..."

"Waaah. Waaah."

At the sudden sound of the child's crying, Miro's gaze shook as if shocked.

'Hexa...'

Sirone felt the same.

A sorrowful story that could only be told through tears.

That story brought to the surface one fact that everyone had been forgetting until now.

'This child is also a living being.'

"Who is it, making noise in the middle of the night!"

At Vincent's voice, Sirone looked up with a start.

"Damn bastard! I'll cut you to pieces!"

Vincent's appearance as he opened the door and entered was unimaginably young, and tears welled up in Sirone's eyes.

Discovering the newborn, Vincent hastily hid the axe behind him and approached carefully.

"Waaah. Waaah."

"Father! Abandon that child!"

Sirone pounded on the intermediate heaven barrier and shouted, but Anchal's illusion magic, borrowing the power of his demon eyes, was strong.

"Father! That's not the right child! Father's son is...!"

It should have been Kazura's prince.

'It's not me. The prince should have lived.'

It should have been a life of growing up loved by good adoptive parents named Vincent and Olina, then returning to the royal castle.

"Who is it! Who's playing pranks! Abandoning a child, you bastard! Come out right now!"

"Father..."

Such were these parents.

"You really abandoned him! There's no more chances! Just try appearing before me! I'll turn your face into mush!"

Sirone could no longer tell them to abandon him.

Because he couldn't deny the lives of those who had devoted everything to raise their son.

"Honey, what's wrong?"

When startled Olina opened the stable door and entered, Vincent's trembling hands supported the child.

"What is that child?"

At Vincent's following words, Sirone finally burst into tears.

"Well... I think he's our child."

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 48 minutes.
Space: Supernatural Psychic Research Society.

Among countless overlapping events, the event of Mars's unit discovering Lucan's corpse occurred.

"Death confirmed."

Mars's captain Nickel focused more on the child collapsed where the chain scythe had fallen than on his subordinate's death.

"Instant death. This is definitely the child Miro had with her."

"It's done."

Only then did Nickel's gaze turn to Lucan.

"The mission is complete. With the child dead, Guffin won't be able to leave."

"No. There's still one final mission left."

Nickel's eyes flashed.

"Find Yorga."

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1:13.
Space: Warehouse 44.

"Phew."

As Raicon opened the door to Warehouse 44 and entered, the safe designated by Fermi was waiting.

"Let's see... how much has accumulated?"

Though he had detoured a long distance due to changes in Estas's spatial structure, he had ultimately achieved his objective.

'Here, cause and effect cannot be distinguished.'

Though he was an assassin for hire, Raicon was also a mage.

He knew how the upper floors currently operated, having experienced countless events.

'3 degrees left. 16 degrees right.'

His heart fluttered like a child opening a present box as he worked the safe's lock mechanism.

"How long do I have to wait?"

Before casting the stop magic, Fermi had answered Raicon's question like this:

"Time isn't important. What's important are events. If the event of you putting the <Last Cry of the Jaeger Family> into this safe is completed, past and future will repeat endlessly and accumulate in an instant."

"Until the event of the safe becoming full occurs."

Fermi had winked.

"Exactly that."

'I'll make a fortune.'

Since 5 billion gold worth of objets would come pouring out, Raicon positioned himself to catch them as soon as he opened the safe.

"...What?"

Before his blinking eyes lay a completely empty safe.

"Why?"

Just in case, he put the objet he was carrying into the safe and left Warehouse 44 before entering again.

'Does the event need to be concluded?'

The moment he opened the safe again and couldn't even see the objet he had just put in, his face crumpled like a monster's.

"Event."

Then there was only one conclusion.

It meant someone taking the safe's contents was a preceding event.

"You even deceived me?"

And as far as he knew, only one person knew the safe's secret.

"Fermiiiii!"

Blue lightning blazed up Raicon's body.
