[518] The Nameless Swordsman (2)

Faced with Fox's murderous glare, Rian slowly averted his gaze.

It was better to avoid fights that could be avoided—another lesson learned from wandering battlefields.

Actually, that was a lie.

He had seen countless people who weren't afraid to die and held onto their convictions.

'What exactly is the problem?'

It wasn't a one-dimensional fear like pain from wounds or that death would end everything.

He lacked confidence in his sword.

The anxiety of having to throw himself into an uncertain future at every moment was sometimes more frightening than giving up one's life.

Fox, who had been carefully observing Rian's hardened expression, seemed to realize something and burst into laughter.

"Keke, a greenhorn who's still wet behind the ears."

It was a common sight.

Young punks who had learned a bit of swordsmanship showing off to ordinary people with their meager skills.

There were such types among bandit groups too, but Fox was on a completely different level from them.

Most importantly, he could use Schema.

"Let's settle the payment later..."

Muttering this, Fox suddenly twisted his head and glared at Silvia.

"What's going on here, Silvia? I treated you so well, yet you brought in another man? Are you just another woman after all?"

Silvia's face crumpled at the disgusting misunderstanding.

"You despicable man. I don't want to hear such words from someone who covets his friend's woman."

Fox's face reddened.

Though he had given up everything when he abandoned being a soldier to become a bandit, whenever he thought of Silvia's husband—his former comrade—his last remnant of conscience always bothered him.

"Shut up! He's dead! He's no longer in this world!"

Fox recalled the magic phrase to shake off his guilty conscience.

"And I've liked you since we were young. I want to love."

"Taking interest in a married woman with a daughter isn't love. It's dirty obsession."

"Dirty obsession?"

Fox's face turned cold as if he had become a different person.

"So that's what you thought? I could have had you anytime. Yet you call it dirty obsession. Fine, then from now on I won't hold back either."

As Fox approached with a menacing aura, Liz stepped in front of her mother.

"Don't bully our mom! Dad won't forgive you!"

Fox's cold gaze pierced through Liz.

"Liz, I'm not trying to bully your mom. I'm trying to save her from this hellish life. I'm sure your dad would be grateful to me too."

Silvia felt dizzy at his shameless words.

"You're not in your right mind. You're insane."

"Keke, maybe so. But what difference does staying sane make? If I can have you, I'd rather choose madness."

Realizing that Fox couldn't be persuaded by any means, Silvia pushed Liz toward the door and shouted.

"Liz! Run!"

Then she grabbed the soup pot from the table and threw it at Fox.

"Hmph!"

The moment Fox struck the pot with his thick fist, Silvia suddenly approached and stabbed a fork into his abdomen.

Fox flinched slightly but calmly examined the wound.

Household utensils weren't enough to penetrate his steel-like muscles.

"Insolent...!"

When Fox slapped her, Silvia's body crumpled to the floor.

"Mom! Mom!"

Fox ignored Liz's voice.

"Don't resent me. You brought this upon yourself."

"Stop."

When Fox turned his eyes, he saw Rian rising from his chair with an unpleasant expression.

He knew Rian was well-built, but seeing him standing revealed a remarkably well-balanced physique.

"Are you talking to me?"

"No matter how crazy you are, you shouldn't do such things in front of a child."

"...You're right."

Fox said, cracking his neck left and right.

"I should kill you first. How about it? If you're confident, come at me."

The moment he fell for the provocation, Rian's shoulders would bear an immeasurable burden.

"..."

Rian looked back at Liz.

The eyes full of expectation held the kind of selfishness only a child could possess.

"Let's go outside. I don't want to spill blood inside the house."

When Rian proposed a match, Fox's lips trembled as they curved upward.

He couldn't ignore Rian's build after all.

"Bastard, acting tough. Fine, let's go outside. I'll make sure the villagers know clearly who owns this house."

As they left the house, villagers who had heard the commotion were hiding out of Fox's sight, secretly watching the situation.

Rian surveyed the twelve bandits surrounding him.

There would be no fairness or evening the numbers.

'Twelve against one.'

Fox swung his longsword widely and shouted.

"Hey, greenhorn swordsman! What are you waiting for instead of attacking? Don't tell me you're waiting for someone to ring a bell?"

A preemptive strike was effective in any situation, but if one wasn't planning to throw away their life, the side with greater numbers didn't need to attack first.

Knowing this fact, Rian slowly aimed his greatsword.

When the heavy iron mass extended to a distance that completely shifted the center of gravity, the bandits' faces turned pale.

It was truly murderous strength.

"Vice-captain, isn't that guy actually incredibly strong?"

At his subordinate's whisper, Fox's face crumpled.

Such talk in front of the enemy would only lower morale.

"Shut up. He's alone anyway. If twelve of us rush him, anyone would die."

Though he had demonstrated powerful strength, Rian's inner thoughts were only troubled.

When he knew nothing, all that mattered was charging desperately to achieve victory, but as his understanding of the sword deepened, he realized how reckless and insane it had been.

'Everything until now was just luck. My sword isn't perfect. Perhaps... I might die.'

Though it was a bandit group of veterans who had rolled around battlefields, with Rian's skills, he could easily cut them down.

But would he really?

Endless doubts about the sword filled his mind.

Without confidence, he couldn't act, and without action, he would make mistakes at crucial moments.

'Is my sword truly right? Can I really... cut them down?'

Watching Rian's face gradually turn pale, the bandits soon showed bewildered expressions and burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! What's that? He's completely scared! Now I see he's just a strong idiot."

"Hey, what will you do? You're going to die now."

As Rian's momentum weakened, his subordinates naturally closed the distance.

"Brother..."

Disappointment showed on Liz's face, and Silvia, who had been desperately praying for Rian to win, also turned pale.

"Boys! Kill him!"

As the bandit group charged, Rian instinctively checked behind him first and saw a longsword thrusting toward him.

"Kuk!"

Blocking with his greatsword while his center was pushed back, Rian swung his sword widely without even checking his opponent's position.

'Truly childish swordsmanship, Rian.'

Divine Transcendence was a yaksha technique that used anger as its source.

Without confidence in his sword, it was difficult to focus his will entirely on a single action.

"What are you doing! Just go and stab him!"

Several swords fell toward Rian's head, while others aimed at his abdomen in thrusting stances.

'I can't avoid it!'

Convinced of this, Rian twisted his upper body while raising his greatsword above his head.

Contrary to his thoughts, his defense and evasion were executed perfectly.

But Rian still wasn't satisfied with the current result and only fell into self-loathing.

'It's luck. This isn't skill.'

When he spun his greatsword like throwing a lasso and struck, a bandit's neck flew off with a thud.

'This isn't the right angle. It's just luck.'

Rian could see what the bandit group couldn't.

Even Fox, who used Schema, couldn't understand the simple truth hidden within the high realm Rian was demonstrating.

"Damn it! Lucky bastard!"

When Rian stepped forward and swung his greatsword diagonally, two bandits were cut into pieces with a wet sound.

Faced with a sword strike that cut two people through bone, the bandit group finally recognized the severity of the situation.

"Wh-what is this bastard...!"

"Move aside, idiots!"

Thinking it became more dangerous as numbers decreased, Fox raised his greatsword and personally charged to cut off Rian's head.

The bandit group's momentum with even their leader joining overwhelmed Rian, but surprisingly, the battle was evenly matched.

'I went too deep. This isn't swordsmanship.'

Though he didn't even feel like he was cutting, the bandits' numbers were steadily decreasing.

He didn't feel like he was winning.

He wanted to perfectly implement the trajectory in his mind and explosively release it satisfyingly, but there was no way to prove its reality.

He couldn't even distinguish whether he was performing swordsmanship or dancing with a sword like a madman.

Clang!

When the sharp metallic sound snapped Rian's mind back to reality, eleven were already dead and only Fox remained.

"Damn it!"

Under Rian's storm-like offensive, Fox was pushed back repeatedly.

Even though he had already greatly enhanced his physical abilities through Schema, avoiding attacks was all he could do.

In combat, the presence or absence of Schema created a difference as vast as the barrier between species.

The fact that this gap wasn't felt meant the technical difference was incomparably huge.

'What is this guy? He's no ordinary swordsman.'

What was even more irritating was that despite possessing such skill, there wasn't a trace of hope in Rian's eyes.

'Wrong! This, that, everything's wrong!'

Rian could see what Fox couldn't.

That's why despair like death visited him with every sword strike.

'No.'

He didn't have the genius insight to strike the shortest distance.

The only way for him to reach the next level was the process of swinging hundreds and thousands of times, adjusting errors at the sub-millimeter level.

'This isn't it.'

But he could see it.

Some ideal realm that couldn't be explained in words.

Because that realm flickered before him, all his standards had become tangled.

"This isn't it!"

The moment Rian burst with frustration, Divine Transcendence activated for the first time.

The greatsword stopped only after cutting through even the sword Fox raised to block and splitting his torso vertically.

A silence as if the world had stopped.

When Fox's body fell to both sides with a thud, the villagers finally began entering the buildings.

He had cut down twelve bandits by himself.

In a village so completely ruined that there wasn't even a blade of grass left to eat, he was a master they could never have seen.

"Huff! Huff!"

Rian felt relief for the first time since the battle began, but no matter how much he tried to recall, he couldn't remember his posture from moments before.

'What the hell was that...'

As he sheathed his sword and looked around, no one was visible except Silvia and Liz.

'Did I win?'

No, he had survived.

Through luck upon luck, fortune upon fortune, he had merely survived.

But how long could he hold out like this?

"Ah..."

Meeting Rian's eyes, Silvia unconsciously let out a moan.

His eyes seemed to carry all the world's troubles.

But as if he didn't want sympathy, Rian turned his head again to examine the corpses scattered everywhere.

'I've done it again.'

Unable to even take care of himself, he had meddled again.

"Clean up the bodies."

Rian informed the villagers who were probably listening.

"If you don't want to take responsibility, that would be best."

Since no one would want to take responsibility for today's incident, there was no reason for Rian's explanation to be lengthy.

"Let's go inside. Please tell me the details."

When Rian said this and turned toward the house first, Silvia snapped to attention and followed him in.

Meanwhile, Liz remained in place, staring blankly at the gruesome scene Rian had created.

"That brother... he's really strong, isn't he?"
