**Strike of Annihilation (3)**

Iruki pointed at the map.

"The Abyss Cliff."

It was a 160-kilometer-long valley that stretched along the border between Tormia and Kazra.

"It's easy to think this is a place where ambush dangers lurk, but Vulcan will come through here."

Geographically just a valley, the Abyss Cliff was actually a massive terrain feature over 17 kilometers wide.

"Most importantly, passing through here allows the shortest route to Tormia. Also, we've lost half our forces at the Kanian Plateau."

It was damage sustained from just one day of battle.

'And Amy...'

Iruki erased the thought and continued speaking.

"But the greater the damage, the more we can strike at vital points. With the Valkyries' insufficient forces, they can't even think of setting traps in such massive terrain."

"And there really aren't any."

Iruki nodded.

"Right. There are no traps. Just an elemental bomb that can blow up the entire valley."

"Phew."

Since this was the key strategy that could end the war, the commanders' tension reached its peak.

"We'll stop them here."

The baton pointed to the center of the valley, 70 kilometers from Tormia.

"The power of the elemental bomb is beyond imagination. The terrain will absorb some of the impact, but not only will our own forces suffer damage, nearby cities won't be safe either."

A commander spoke.

"This is an opportunity gained at the cost of countless sacrifices. Not doing it isn't an option. All we can do is detonate it at a point where the expected damage is minimized."

Iruki remained silent.

"Grand Marshal."

"Yes. I have no intention of being the only one to preserve my conscience. The operation will proceed as planned. The day of final battle approaches. There must not be even the slightest mistake."

As he ended his words firmly, the commanders left the meeting room with relieved expressions.

Aromi approached Iruki.

"Is the decision difficult to make?"

Not being someone who didn't understand the weight of being Grand Marshal, she was anxious about his unusually wavering appearance.

"No. That's not it."

"Then perhaps... is it because of Major Amy?"

He couldn't deny it.

'I couldn't recover her body.'

If there had been a definitive conclusion, he wouldn't be suffering such heartache.

'If she survived, there's no way she wouldn't return to her unit. So was she captured by the demons after all?'

With the entire army of hell descending, it was like dropping a bomb on her head.

"Grand Marshal, I know it's presumptuous of me to say this but..."

Aromi spoke hesitantly.

"If Major Amy is alive and captured as a prisoner by the demons, killing her would actually be helping her."

Knowing how cruel the demons were, Iruki agreed to some extent.

"The reason Vulcan didn't realize the variable of Kitaruman was..."

Iruki finally voiced his inner thoughts.

"Because his range of thinking was different from mine. Even if you can read the flow of crowds, you can't read the flow outside the board. You can't worry about things you can't think of."

"That's right. But why are you suddenly saying..."

"That's me right now."

The feeling that he was missing something wouldn't leave him.

"If Amy was captured, she would suffer terrible things, and Vulcan would use that. There's no better way to break my rationality."

"Hmm."

"But there's no response at all. Maybe Amy wasn't captured by the demons."

Aromi wanted to give hope, but now was a time when only cold judgment mattered.

"Grand Marshal, to make such inferences based on just that..."

"I know."

Iruki knew too.

"Even if Amy was captured, there are hundreds of reasons not to announce it. It might be a setup for Shirone, for Yahweh. So it's probably at the level of delusion but..."

The psychology of hoping for a precious friend's safety might have changed his thought process.

"I keep getting interference. Whether I apply experience or logic, nothing seems clear."

Aromi realized Iruki was in a calm state.

"You mean something might be happening outside the Grand Marshal's thoughts."

"Yes."

Iruki looked back at the Abyss Valley.

"Like with Kitaruman, it might determine the success or failure of this strategy."

Where on earth was Amy?

---

"Huff. Huff."

In a cabin built in the mountains of the central continent, Amy's rough breathing spread.

Her hair was short, and her body, which had suffered burns all over, was wrapped tightly in bandages.

Fortunately, the heat hadn't penetrated deep into her skin, and the scabs would peel off soon.

"There's no sign of her waking up."

Shura said, looking at Amy lying on the bed.

"Her body has recovered, but the serious part is her mind. It's fundamentally different from Samadhi."

While Samadhi was based on the universal principle of emptiness, Amy's multiple personalities were quite artificial.

"She's essentially dug into the ground and closed the exit herself. She won't be able to get out on her own."

Nane said, biting his index finger.

"Remove the bandages."

"What are you planning to do?"

"She's currently in a state where she's closed her eyes, blocked her ears, and shut off all her senses herself. Human transmission power won't be able to pull her out of the abyss."

When Shura unwrapped the bandages around her abdomen, new flesh had grown, revealing mottled skin.

Nane sat cross-legged after writing bloody letters in a circle around her navel.

"Stay as far away as possible. It won't be bearable."

To bring Amy back, a sermon of the same intensity as giving enlightenment to a rock was needed.

"Don't overdo it."

As Shura left the cabin, Nane smiled kindly and gently lowered his eyelids.

His lips opened softly.

"Maha Prajna..."

As the sermon with its unique rhythm continued endlessly, the mountains, rivers, plants, and trees began to tremble.

"Ugh!"

Shura, who had rushed into the forest, covered her ears.

'It's not sound.'

Nane's voice, piercing her mind, echoed in her head without going through her eardrums.

"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form..."

Inside the cabin where the sermon rang out, Amy's body became as hot as if it were burning.

"Hah. Hah."

Even while unconscious, her breathing became rough, and a thin voice leaked from her throat.

"Shirone."

The Great Sanctuary of the Ivory Tower.

With all five stars gathered at the Taesung's call, Shirone finished his story.

"Armageddon."

It was shocking content.

"So what, whether Nane wins or Harvitz wins, the world ends?"

Freed continued with an unpleasant expression.

"There's a limit to how much you can look down on the Ivory Tower. Do you think we'll just sit still while that happens?"

Silence followed.

"Hey, why is everyone like this? Don't tell me you're scared?"

Minerva spoke.

"It's not about fighting or not. It's a situation where the fundamental system activates. The best thing would be to end it before reaching that situation."

She looked at Shirone.

"Shirone has no choice but to achieve an integrated mental system before Nane reaches enlightenment."

There was no disagreement.

In the same sense, none of the stars of the Ivory Tower told Shirone.

'Amy has disappeared.'

If even Taesung couldn't find her, then some specific individual or force equivalent to him had taken her.

'It could be Nane. But it could also be Harvitz.'

Both individuals were capable of such a thing.

'I can't reveal it now.'

Sein opened his mouth.

"Shirone, before preparing for the end, there's something we need to address. There's a fact you don't know."

Minerva turned her head with a pale face.

'Tch! That stubborn one.'

Sein, who believed everyone except himself was an illusion, felt no need to lie.

"A fact I don't know?"

Sein turned his head and said.

"In the central continent..."

At that moment, the Great Sanctuary of the Ivory Tower shook.

"What?"

While a spire on the ground might shake, there was no reason for the Great Sanctuary floating in space to shake.

Taesung spoke with a bitter expression.

"It's finally coming."

Through the glass window illuminating the planet, something burning hot from air friction could be seen.

"A dragon?"

The sight of it ascending vertically while emitting electricity from its blue scales was truly wondrous.

Shirone remembered the dragon's identity.

"Thunder Dragon Blitz."

One of the twelve apostles of the dragon tribe that guard time, a creature he had met in Andre's First World.

It was also one of the few first-class dragons capable of leaving the planet and entering space.

Kuuuuuuung!

Blitz pressed its massive body against the ceiling of the Great Sanctuary and bent its long neck to look inside.

"Taesung."

A cold voice that pierced directly into everyone's minds without going through the air was heard.

Taesung looked up at the ceiling.

"Apostle of Time, what brings you to visit here?"

The large eyes surveyed the Great Sanctuary here and there before fixing on Shirone.

"Our Core seeks you."

"Core, you mean..."

Mudeung Dragon Karatosa.

"Are you saying he's awakened from eternal sleep?"

The anecdote of him leaving with the words "When no one else can handle it, I will handle it" was famous.

"Something great is coming. It's only a matter of time before Mudeung Dragon awakens. Shirone, you who opened the sense of Mu-tae. Follow me. The Core will tell you."

Shirone approached Taesung's side.

"Tell me what?"

"How to fight."

"Fight whom?"

Blitz turned his head greatly and looked down at the northern hemisphere of the planet.

His gaze captured the Eastern Zhongtian Cave.

"Heaven."

A peak that rose through the clouds.

On the highest ground of the Eastern Zhongtian Cave stood a shrine built by humanity's strongest magician.

Guffin's Gate.

A massive iron sphere inscribed with angelic language began to vibrate high in the sky.

The iron sphere rippled like liquid, then caused a violent explosion that blew away the entire peak.

Kwaaaaaaaang!

What remained in place of the explosion was a tunnel so huge it could swallow the entire Zhongtian Cave.

"Is this the earthly realm?"

A foot suddenly protruded from a black sphere and stepped directly onto the ground.

Kuuuuuung!

A small hill exploded.

"Heh, it's incredibly small."

Following that, countless giants revealed themselves, and fairies flew up into the sky.

Angels and their kin, the Mara, passed through the tunnel with arrogant bearing, and finally, four archangels appeared.

Though they were incomplete halves that had lost their respective defining concepts, the world shook from their emanating aura alone.

Uriel, the Archangel of Destruction, expressed his feelings.

"We've finally arrived. It took longer than expected."

Rayel, the Archangel of Light, said.

"It could have taken even longer. That's why it's strange. The dimensional barrier was broken too easily."

Uriel muttered.

"Miro..."

What had happened to humanity's strongest monk who had single-handedly blocked heaven's army?

The giants and Mara, who had been waiting only for this day, couldn't suppress their fighting spirit and screamed.

"Let's fight! Let's punish the arrogant humans who deny God!"

Ikael was watching them.

'Shirone.'

The reason she couldn't share their feelings was because Hexa was here.

"Archangel! Please give the order to sortie! Give us the chance to teach these insects God's dignity!"

Ikael softly opened her mouth.

"...Ataraxia."

Her Seongwangche expanded at tremendous speed, spreading colorful halos.

"Huuk!"

Silence fell as if by magic.

"I address the entire army."

Only her voice was amplified and echoed.
