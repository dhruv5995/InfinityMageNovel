[602] A Tree Without Roots (4)

After arriving at school, Shirone and Nade headed to the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society.

Sitting on the sofa, Shirone rolled his eyes and said, "Didn't you say you wouldn't come even if you died?"

His mind must have changed instantly upon hearing that Liz was coming to visit the school.

"What, me? I just came because I felt like I should apologize to the kids. Should I leave again?"

Either way, bringing Nade here was an achievement.

"Forget it. You should rest too. You must have had a hard time living up in the mountains."

Lying on the opposite sofa with his arm as a pillow, Nade recalled the story he had heard from Shirone on the way here.

'You must have had a hard time too, Shirone.'

Just as he was lost in thought, someone knocked on the door and both of them jumped up simultaneously.

"Who is it?"

Since the Scramble Royale had ended not long ago, it was natural to feel hostility toward uninvited guests.

"It's Richard."

Richard of Alchemy, a member of the Golden Ring.

As Nade hesitated at the appearance of someone completely out of place here, Shirone said, "Come in."

He was curious about the outcome between Fermi and Lykan.

The door opened slowly, and Richard entered, trailing afterimages of red eyes.

His solid build and strong jawline. Though his body was no different from a human's, beneath his artificial skin, mechanical devices created through alchemy would be operating instead of muscles and bones.

"Why are you here? Is this a message from the Golden Ring?"

"No, it's Fermi's personal request. The Golden Ring was disbanded as of yesterday."

"What?"

It was truly shocking news.

"Why?"

"I don't know the exact reason either. Fermi and Lykan had a falling out."

It seemed neither of them had died.

'Well, Fermi was seriously injured at the time.'

Nade asked, "What about the other members?"

"Cayden is missing. Hercy is furious about being used in the Scramble Royale."

It was an understandable situation.

"Then what about you? Why did you leave Fermi?"

They were people who had gathered for the profits Fermi generated rather than loyalty.

But that made this decision all the more surprising.

"Fermi's value shouldn't have decreased, right?"

"That's right. But Fermi was the one who made the proposal first. If we didn't disband the Golden Ring, we'd have to assist two of your team members in the graduation exam."

"Ah..."

If the Golden Ring itself disappeared, the promise to assist two people would be nullified.

"He was calculating from the beginning."

If he was planning to disband the Golden Ring anyway, he could freely make empty promises in negotiations.

"Probably so. Fermi never makes deals where he loses out. I don't know what happened, but he seemed satisfied."

Shirone recalled the final scene between Fermi and Yolga.

"I came here to tell you that fact. The Golden Ring has been disbanded. So I'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from any unnecessary conflicts."

"Is Fermi planning to graduate this time?"

"Yes. It might actually be better for you guys. I also withdrew after receiving money. Severance pay, you could say."

With those words, Richard left the research society.

At first it felt like being stabbed in the back, but thinking from Fermi's perspective, all the circumstances fit together perfectly.

"We were completely played. We should have known from the beginning."

"That's impossible, which is why Fermi was able to strike first."

"Sigh. I'll have to tell the kids."

Two hours later, Amy and Iruki entered the research society after finishing their evaluations.

"Nade! What happened to you?"

Amy shouted upon seeing the wounds carved into Nade's face.

"I'm sorry. I messed up. I have nothing to say even if I had ten mouths."

Iruki said, "Forget it. We won anyway. From now on, you should think about raising your rank too. There really isn't much time left until the graduation exam."

"Oh, speaking of which..."

Shirone told them about the Golden Ring's disbandment, and their shock was no different.

"Fermi, that coward! Playing tricks until the very end?"

"Let's think positively. The distribution would have been awkward anyway, and internal conflict could have arisen. The other team members will understand."

For someone who had prepared for over ten years just to meet Yolga, they had no choice but to give him a pass this time.

Having simply finished Nade's welcome ceremony, Shirone's group returned to their dormitory to prepare for tomorrow.

"Iruki."

Shirone called out in front of Iruki's room.

"Do you happen to know a senior named Liz?"

"Liz?"

Iruki's expression showed surprise, which was unlike him.

"How do you know that senior's name?"

"Well, I met her this morning. With Nade."

"I see."

Iruki looked back toward Nade's room.

"No wonder he seemed dejected. So, did you talk much?"

"Yeah. She even bought us food. Liz senior is someone precious to Nade, isn't she?"

"I suppose so. She's the one who made that monster-like guy get his act together and live properly."

"What kind of person was she?"

"Hmm, if you're asking what kind of person she was..."

Iruki, reminiscing about Senior Liz, gave a brief definition.

"She was exactly like Nade is now."

It was four years ago, when Nade was fifteen years old.

At that time, he emanated such a menacing aura that he could frighten opponents with just his gaze.

He only exchanged a few words with Iruki and didn't talk to anyone else, and this solitary behavior was most prominent during lunch time.

When Nade got food on his tray and turned around, friends who had been stealing glances at his back hurriedly turned their heads away.

They were afraid he might sit next to them.

"Hmph."

Snorting as he looked around, he saw that Iruki was also occupying a table by himself.

While they acknowledged each other's abilities, it would be ridiculous for people pushed away by others to eat together, so Nade sat at a table in the corner.

That's when Liz approached.

"Hello?"

When Nade looked up, he saw Liz smiling, and behind her he could hear students whispering.

Liz, who was in the upper ranks of Class 4.

He couldn't understand why a senior who had no connection to Nade would suddenly act like this.

"What do you want?"

Nade at that time showed no respect even to seniors.

"Saying 'what do you want' to someone who said hello - isn't that going too far, no matter what?"

"If you don't have business, get lost. You're ruining my appetite."

"Is eating alone tasty? Don't be like that, let's eat together. It's good for seniors and juniors to get along."

Liz had a temperament that couldn't stand seeing someone being left out.

"Annoying. I told you to get lost."

Rather than Nade, it was Liz's friends behind her who got angry at his cold treatment.

"Rude bastard. We're being nice because he's young, but he really thinks he's tough."

"Liz, just come here. It's better not to get involved with crazy guys like that."

Still, since they were seniors, Nade held back once.

"Why don't you go? Your friends are calling you."

"Fine. I'll go if you tell me honestly."

"Tell you what?"

"Are you really not lonely?"

Bang!

When he slammed the table, all the students turned to look, and Liz, who had flinched, froze with her eyes wide open.

In the cold silence, Nade, who had taken in all their gazes, stood up and placed his hand on Liz's shoulder.

"Don't mess around in front of me again. You might really get beaten to death."

Liz's face went slightly pale, but she still playfully stuck out her tongue.

After Nade had moved away, friends gathered around.

"Liz, are you okay?"

"What kind of bastard is that? Should we call him after class?"

"I'll teach him a lesson. Guys like that don't need to be at magic school."

Liz, still with a flushed expression, finally seemed to come to her senses and let out a big breath.

"Whew, that guy's really no joke. He's more prickly than I heard."

"That's why you shouldn't talk to him. He skips classes all the time, and I heard he hangs around with bad kids outside school."

"Hmm."

Despite her friends' worried words, Liz looked at Nade's back with apparent interest.

"Tch!"

After parting with his friends and entering his room, Nade crouched on his bed, recalling that time.

If only she hadn't approached him like that from the beginning, he wouldn't have this suffering.

But he couldn't blame her, because the life she had left behind had become too precious to him now.

'Engagement?'

Nade felt heat rising to his head as he buried his face in his bed.

"Argh! What am I supposed to do!"

A few days later, Liz came to visit Alpheas Magic School with Oscar.

"Did I really need to come? This isn't even my school."

Oscar was clearly reluctant.

"Still, he's my mentor, so I should pay my respects. I need to tell him about the engagement too."

This was exactly why.

"Liz, let's talk for a moment."

Oscar stopped walking in the corridor where the principal's office was located.

"Why are you in such a hurry? We can bring up the engagement slowly."

"Who's in a hurry? What's wrong with mentioning it while we're here?"

"This is a complicated matter. I have to think about work too. If I take a position here, what happens to the armory?"

"Yes, I know. But Oscar, I'm not rushing you. It's just..."

After some thought, Liz opened up.

"Aren't we in love?"

Liz was a wonderful woman, which is why Oscar had fallen for her at first sight.

Honestly, he didn't want to lose her.

'Love. If only love were everything...'

Seeing Oscar hesitate, Liz felt a surge of fear, and as always, she was the one to compromise.

"Alright. I think talking about engagement is premature. Let's just pay our respects."

"Sorry. I have a lot to think about too. You know joining the association is a huge opportunity..."

"Haha! I said I understood. Come on, relax and let's go!"

After Liz consoled Oscar, she knocked on the principal's office door and entered. Alpheas, who had already been notified, greeted them with a smile.

"It's been a while, Liz."

"Hello, Principal! You still look young!"

"Haha! Such jokes were enjoyable just a year ago. Please sit here."

Alpheas offered them seats and brought out tea.

"But who is this handsome gentleman?"

Oscar, facing a certified 4th-class mage, greeted him respectfully.

"Hello, sir. I'm certified 8th-class mage Clyde Oscar."

"He's my boyfriend. He's likely to be appointed to the Creas Magic Association."

"I see. He looks dependable."

Various conversations followed, and Liz asked, "But what did you mean earlier? Is something wrong?"

Alpheas shook his head as if dying.

"Don't even mention it. I've aged terribly in one year. There are so many troublemakers in the graduating class."

"I met Nade recently. He said he's currently in last place."

"Aren't those kids who have already transcended things like rankings? I mean your research society's direct juniors."

"Hehe."

Liz took it as an honorable compliment.

"But it's not just because of that. This year's graduating class is really high level. There's never been such fierce competition in the school's history."

"Oh my, is it that bad?"

"Yes. The students' average ability is 3.8 times higher than other schools."

Oscar couldn't understand.

"The average is 3.8 times higher?"

"Yes. The gap between the top and bottom ranks is unimaginable. It's no exaggeration to say rankings are meaningless."

Liz said with a blank expression, "That's incredible. It must be hard for you too, Principal."

If he could, he would want to let all the graduating students graduate.

"Yes. But this is also just part of the process. It's difficult right now, but the students who graduate this time will grow faster than anyone to become mages who will illuminate the kingdom."

And such mages were needed in turbulent times.

"Then Nade..."

Reading Liz's heart, Alpheas said, "Don't worry. The kids from the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society are in no way inferior to the top-tier competitors. They're fighting admirably."

Since Alpheas had a kind personality but never spoke empty words, Liz smiled brightly.

"Of course. Whose juniors are they, after all?"
