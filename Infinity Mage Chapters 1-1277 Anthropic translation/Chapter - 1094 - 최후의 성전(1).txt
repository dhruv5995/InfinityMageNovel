The Final Holy War (1)

The Arctic, Ivory Tower.

The tower was massive, and roughly 80 people lived in the small village on the 387th floor.

Inside a small cabin, a woman who had been in deep sleep slowly opened her eyes.

Ivory Tower resident, Bipa.

In High Gear, she was a tutorial administrator who used the gear mark.

"The meetup? What for."

She had no intention of attending.

Nevertheless, the reason she logged out was probably because Yahweh's actions had moved her heart.

As she stepped out of the cabin, other residents looked at her with surprised expressions.

"Bipa? What brings you out here?"

She was someone who would stock up on food and water and not go outside for months at a time.

"How's the situation?"

The residents opened their eyes drowsily, but this was such a major event that it couldn't be kept secret.

"See for yourself."

When they arrived at the outer wall they pointed to, the hologram barrier disappeared and the mechanical steel wall was revealed.

The 387th floor of the Ivory Tower was high enough to look down even upon the blizzards raging across the Arctic.

She looked through the window.

At the end of the horizon, flames that evaporated the cold air were blazing in the Corona Kingdom.

"Demons."

Click. Click.

Her pupils rotated like apertures, pulling the scenery of the Corona Kingdom into sharp focus.

The stars of the Ivory Tower were visible, and among them was a demon swordsman slaughtering countless soldiers.

Hell's army, 1st Legion Commander Baal.

'Finally, he's come.'

The fact that the only legion commander who hadn't opened the demon realm was targeting the Arctic held great significance.

'Deadly Cross. I think that was the name.'

He intended to bring down the Ivory Tower.

Kashan. Aganos.

As Uorin, who had logged out of High Gear, left her bedroom, Kando bowed his head.

"You've arrived."

Since she had been devoted to High Gear while putting state affairs aside, he was as puzzled as he was pleased.

"Is there anything special you need me toâ€”"

"No."

Uorin smiled and walked past Kando.

"It's over. I've obtained everything I could from High Gear. How much time is left until the holy war?"

"Three days."

Kando followed behind and asked.

"What you could obtain, you mean..."

Uorin, who had been walking alongside him, turned back with a cold face as if she had never smiled.

'It's been a while since I felt this way.'

As Kando gulped nervously, Uorin's thoughts deepened further.

'The Minus Universe.'

Not everything, but Fermi had delivered general information as they had agreed.

'This could become the worst holy war in history. No, perhaps this will be our last...'

Uorin stopped walking.

"Kando, I will participate in the holy war."

At her words about reclaiming the emperor's throne she had passed to her son, Kando immediately responded.

"Understood."

"Don't be too disappointed. The survivors, factions, kingdoms, and monsters that remain after the Great Purification will all gather there. It seems too much for you to handle alone."

Just the fact that she was considering his feelings made Kando tremble with emotion.

"This is Your Majesty's empire."

A faint smile spread across Uorin's lips, but her expression soon turned cold.

'I will never give it up.'

She said.

"Bring me Kido."

Southern Continent, Keshia.

Since most of the citizens were intoxicated by Angel, there weren't many shops doing business.

The place Sirone chose for the meetup was a franchise cafe operated by Kumhwaryun.

"Welcome."

As he opened the door and entered, an employee with hazy eyes greeted Sirone.

He could see tables where nobles were seated, and they too seemed to be under the influence of drugs.

'The problem is...'

Even the group sitting in the corner of the shop didn't look particularly different.

'This is really something to see.'

Five High Gear administrators had gathered for this meetup, and none of them made eye contact.

It was an expected scene since they had gathered people with zero social skills, but the extent was severe.

"Huh? Could it be...?"

The only child sitting with a bright expression saw Sirone and raised their hand.

"Yahweh hyung?"

"Lollipop?"

They knew each other's identities as administrators to some extent, but didn't bother revealing real names.

"Wow, you look exactly like in High Gear. Come over here. The atmosphere here is totally dead."

Even though Sirone had arrived, the administrators didn't even glance his way and just kept doing random things.

'Lollipop is here.'

The middle-aged bearded man with a large frame hunched over was probably Smile Mark.

The thin woman who looked like she just let her hair grow because it grew naturally was Black Circle Mark.

'And the remaining two people are...'

The ones who caused trouble in High Gear - Operator and Number Seven.

'Number Seven. I wonder if he's the same age as me?'

Despite his sturdy build, his anxiously shaking legs revealed his personality.

The Operator sitting at the head seat, wearing large glasses, kept brushing his bangs with his hand.

"Ugh. Ah, seriously."

'He must be self-conscious about his acne.'

Sirone guessed why the Operator's avatar covered his eyes with bangs.

"Well then."

Sirone sat in the chair across from them, ordered tea from the employee, and spoke up.

"First, nice to meet you all. I'm Sirone."

No one answered, and Smile Mark tried to say something but turned his head away.

'They really lack social skills. No opinions are coming out at all. How are we supposed to work together like this?'

They had to.

These were the developers of High Gear, which achieved unprecedented success at Under Coder.

'They're the world's best coders.'

Lollipop Mark broke the ice first.

"Let's start with introductions. This is what you usually do at meetups. I'm Lollipop. In High Gear, I handle the impact and collision processors."

It was a position that required the best reflexes.

"Hehe, should I go next? Um... so I'm called Smile Mark. What I handle is..."

A lengthy explanation followed, and then Black Circle Mark, whose turn was next, spoke.

"I'm Black Circle. I handle the meta processor."

Just when they thought they'd gotten this far, Number Seven seemed like someone with speech impediment.

"Hyung, it's your turn."

"Ah. Ah."

His ears turned red and his pupils were dilated, as if he was already in another world.

Sirone brought him back to reality.

"Speak comfortably. You're just introducing yourself."

"Huh? Um... well."

He seemed to snap back to attention, but this time he just kept glancing at the Operator at the head seat.

She shook her bangs and snapped at him.

"What have you been glancing at? Why? Disappointed? Because I'm ugly?"

"No, nobody said that! You're just pretty!" 

Shocked by his own words, Number Seven hung his head low, and the Operator bit her straw.

Silence followed.

"...Well, introductions are done."

Sirone changed tactics.

"I proposed this meetup to the Operator. As some of you may know, from now on the Operator will help me with certain work in reality."

The administrators showed interest for the first time.

"What kind of work?"

Sirone explained the strategy for mining Apocalypse from The Abyss territory.

Black Circle muttered.

"Hmm, cytoplasm hardening program. To inject it into the main system, we'd need to know the terminal patterns."

Number Seven said.

"We could use artificial intelligence. Release creatures with large excavation functions to map it out in 3D and..."

"The time it takes to breach the firewall is also an issue. If we embed invasion code in the program..."

Those who had been silent until now aggressively offered opinions as if they were fighting.

Sirone smiled bitterly.

'Their bodies are in reality, but...'

Their thoughts still remained in Under Coder, the virtual world.

The Operator, who had been listening with her chin propped up, raised her index finger.

"Anyway, so... I've decided to help Sirone oppa, but what are you guys going to do?"

As the administrators exchanged glances, Number Seven slowly raised his hand.

"Tch! I guess I'm definitely included, right?"

The Operator said.

"No. Attending here was the condition, so if you don't want to do it, you don't have to."

As his face reddened and he was about to lower his hand, she curtly snapped.

"Just kidding. After all the mess you've made, you want to end it like this? You'll have to weld thousands of tons."

Number Seven was moved, but he was happier that the Operator had joked with him.

"Haha! There's nobody else who could do it but me. You'll never be able to mine Apocalypse without me!"

"That's true too."

Number Seven's mouth closed again, but unlike before, the atmosphere was heated.

Sirone stood up from his seat and said.

"Well then, shall we go to work?"

Middle East, Paras Kingdom.

The world war started by the Gustav Empire dealt considerable damage to the Paras Kingdom.

The biggest shock was the death of King Casartark, who had ruled Paras for 40 years.

However, the Middle Eastern powerhouse called the source of ancient civilization did not easily kneel.

"Time to set off."

A young voice echoed softly through the antique grand hall of the royal castle Delaima.

King Kitra.

The youngest son of Casartark, with an androgynous appearance due to black makeup around his eyes.

"Your Majesty, preparations are complete. In this holy war, the Paras Kingdom will become the world's ruling nation."

The retainers believed it without doubt.

Kitra's abilities, having ascended to the throne at a young age, were most suitable for Paras, which prided itself as the origin of intelligence.

"Hmm..."

The viper wrapped around Kitra's neck flicked its tongue toward the assembled retainers.

"Bring me Zulu."

All the retainers raised their heads at once.

"However, Your Majesty, Paras's ultra-ancient civilization has never allowed access to outsiders... Urk!"

Hissssssss!

At the sound made by the snake's trembling tongue, the retainers' faces turned pale.

"Shh."

When Kitra made a sound with his mouth, the snake turned its head and stuck its tongue out to him.

With licking sounds, as if kissing, he lapped up the poison the snake offered and spoke again.

"Bring Zulu here."

A soldier quickly left the grand hall.

Shortly after, the door opened and Zulu, Sirone, Canis, and Arin entered side by side.

Zulu, sucking on a pacifier, made sucking sounds as he knelt before the king.

"You summoned me, Your Majesty."

"Zulu."

The pride of the Paras Kingdom and the great mage whom Casartark loved until the end.

"It brings back old memories. Father really liked you. I used to follow you around calling you big sister too. It's hard to see you. Did you hate our father that much?"

Suck, suck.

No emotion could be found on Zulu's face as he sucked on the pacifier.

'Beautiful.'

Would daily abuse of a newborn child create such a twisted something?

"So, you want to explore the Pyramid of Truth?"

"Yes, Your Majesty. My colleagues and I will uncover the secrets of the outside world there."

Kitra's gaze moved beyond Zulu to the three people standing behind, focusing especially on Sirone.

"Star of the Ivory Tower's Five Great, sorry for keeping you waiting. As you know, our domestic situation is a bit busy."

Almost all kings put on a bold front before stars, but Kitra's attitude was genuine.

'What a truly unique aura. This holy war will be fierce.'

Sirone answered politely.

"Opening a nation's treasures requires great resolve. Please allow it for the sake of humanity."

"Humanity, well..."

Kitra casually crossed his legs.

"I heard all the oases dried up because of the Demon Realm of Explosion. The damage would have been worse if not for you."

"You're too kind."

It was all buildup to hear one response anyway, and Kitra didn't drag out the time.

"I grant permission."

As the retainers stirred, Canis and Arin's eyes filled with intensity.

'We did it.'

The ultra-ancient civilization would be opened.
