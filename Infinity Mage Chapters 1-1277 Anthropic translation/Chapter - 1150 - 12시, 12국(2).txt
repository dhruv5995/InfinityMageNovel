12 O'Clock, 12 Nations (2)

Fermi didn't give up.

'I'm not too late.'

Among all the regrets one faces in life, there aren't many times when it's truly too late.

While running through the Kesia Sector, he encountered fewer than three people.

They would all be intoxicated by Angel.

As he increased his speed, time seemed to slow down, and Fermi had countless thoughts.

He had received Kesia's support.

Even his insane idea of manufacturing drugs was accepted without suspicion by King Manolca.

That wasn't a rational judgment—it was blind trust in Fermi.

"Tsk!"

In less than a second of that brief time, Fermi opened the door to Manolca's room.

"Old man..."

His gaze, which had stopped urgently at the door, fixed on the old man sitting at the desk.

How many times had he been fooled by seeing him asleep in such a corpse-like, emaciated state?

But the blood dripping while his head hung low couldn't be fake.

Suppressing the thought that he was too late, Fermi moved toward Manolca.

The moment he reached out toward his shoulder, Manolca flinched and raised his head.

"Heoeoek!"

Fermi's eyes widened.

"Old man!"

The moment he confirmed Manolca's survival, the first thing he did was cast healing magic. As warm light spread through the room, Manolca's pained expression gradually stabilized.

"Don't make such a fuss. I was just dozing for a moment."

"Let's go. I have a doctor friend."

If he asked Seriel, he could get help from the World Health Organization.

Manolca shook his head.

"You know, don't you? This isn't a disease of the body. It's a disease of the heart. It can't be reversed."

Just as Fermi was about to speak, Manolca spat up another basin full of blood.

'What the hell is this?'

Though invisible to the eye, he could feel the chilling energy of the other world down to his bones.

"Fermi."

Manolca smiled.

"We had quite a good time together. Now it seems it's time to go. That's the natural order."

"Don't talk nonsense. This is assassination."

"Do what you're trying to do. Don't be swayed by emotions. That's really not like you."

"What do you think I am? An emotionless machine? A drug lord who contaminated the entire world with drugs?"

"A capable guy."

Fermi closed his mouth.

"Right, you're not a good guy. But when you live in this world as long as I have, even troublemakers look cute."

"I am—"

Just as he was about to speak, Manolca's hand roughly grabbed Fermi by the collar.

"End it as a troublemaker. End it as a troublemaker. You must not become a demon. There's nothing worth achieving by abandoning yourself."

Manolca's eyes burned with an intensity as if consuming his life.

"What's the difference between a troublemaker and a demon?"

"...There isn't much difference."

Manolca released Fermi's collar and relaxed his body again, grinning broadly.

"You're a decent guy. Though you seem to be desperately trying not to let it show."

In front of Manolca's eyes that were losing their vitality, Fermi gave up arguing.

"I have to reach the top of the world."

"The top..."

As if he could actually see that place, Manolca gazed wistfully at the ceiling.

"I'm glad you're here."

With those words, Manolca's eyes slowly closed and his last breath escaped from his lungs.

The King of Kesia had died.

In the lonely room where no one else had entered, Fermi slowly stepped back.

'Time was too tight.'

He couldn't respond immediately to the attack from the Paras Kingdom and the change in the world's laws.

'Sirone was late. If I had stayed in Apocalypse instead...'

Would the mining have been a bit faster?

'There's not enough manpower. From conception to design, it's all my responsibility. Everyone's intoxicated by drugs...'

Thanks to that, we suppressed the expansion of Satanism.

'Angel should be used in moderation too. I clearly ordered them to patrol in shifts every two hours. Why are they so stupid...'

Fermi stopped thinking.

'Stop.'

He must not blame anything other than himself.

'Get it together, Fermi.'

Stop whining, you bastard.

'It wasn't that I couldn't do it. If I had given up sleep entirely, I could have done the patrols.'

The thought that securing about 40 minutes of sleep daily to maintain brain function was efficient.

'A misjudgment. I shouldn't have done that. I was incompetent. I should have split time even more finely, gathering information, categorizing it, managing personnel, understanding the political situation...'

After finishing his self-criticism, Fermi pointed an imaginary revolver at his head.

'Pull it.'

Click, click, click. With each pull of the trigger, his anger cooled down.

'Let's think.'

Because that's what primates do.

'What I can do and what I can't do. Among the things I can do, what I need to do first. Identify all immediate problems and solve them one by one sequentially...'

He was angry, and his head was spinning.

"Ah, really."

Fermi took out a cigarette, lit it, and muttered while exhaling smoke.

It was a dirty curse.

The bell announcing midnight rang out in the dark alleys of Jive's capital.

"Hmm. Sirone..."

Gustav's Fourth Corps heard how the Wizard had come to be here.

From the Wizard's perspective, there was nothing to lose if they could receive their help.

'Kill Havitz.'

When concentrating, the Wizard was more cold and calm than any other mage.

Natasha thought.

'He's not like a child. When that child becomes an adult, will he become a mage with this kind of feeling?'

Even without hearing it, she could guess what price the Wizard had paid to create this mentality.

Vulcan said.

"Now I understand. The moment one harbors hostility, Satan escapes outside the law. Therefore, to kill Havitz, murder without killing intent must occur."

Even <Legal Kill> had failed, but the Wizard was different.

"Sirone created a <Legal Kill> that can think. That's you. But you lost to Satan, and now you can no longer face Havitz in a pure state."

"Right."

That was why the Wizard couldn't act.

"Even the slightest logical thought makes Havitz slip away from my cognition. I still won't be able to read the voice of his heart. The initial strategy needs to be revised."

Vulcan stroked his chin.

"Hmm. A way to penetrate Vanishing. I do have one method..."

At that moment, the Wizard activated Thoughtless God.

Before Gustav's Fourth Corps could react, she stared forward and shouted.

"Take cover!"

The moment Vulcan turned around, the surrounding air felt as cold as below freezing.

He didn't know what it was.

'What?'

However, the Wizard with her super-empathy sensed a chilling energy that felt like her bones would freeze.

'It's an emotion beyond imagination.'

Blood-red screams, anger with a rotten smell, a heart torn like fragments.

"Cough!"

The moment a basin full of blood poured from Vulcan's mouth, Zetaro's face turned pale.

"Vulcan!"

The massive body trained by Schema collapsed with a thud like a tree struck by an axe.

"Vulcan, get it together!"

Natasha asked the Wizard.

"What is it?"

"I don't know either. Some kind of energy. Not of this world, but not of the afterlife either..."

It was terrible resentment lingering at the boundary.

"Cough! Cough!"

Vulcan, receiving emergency resuscitation from Zetaro, exhaled roughly and regained consciousness.

"Grrrr!"

But his body, already struck by the attack, was rapidly deteriorating.

"It's fine. I'm okay now."

Though Vulcan waved his hand dismissively, Zetaro grabbed it again and checked his pulse.

"Stay still. This is..."

As if listening to the pulse with his ear, Zetaro tilted his head and his expression gradually crumpled.

'Damn it.'

He was tough enough to endure for now, but if he were an ordinary human, he would have died immediately.

Vulcan felt it too.

"Something... an attack came."

When Natasha glared at the Wizard with killing intent, Vulcan raised his hand.

"No, it's not like that. There's nothing that child could gain by killing me."

Smodo asked.

"Then who?"

"Someone from another country. The only reason I need to be eliminated is that I'm the Emperor of Gustav. Something has penetrated inside me. Extreme anger..."

Vulcan spat blood again.

"It's a kind of energy. At most a month, at least one or two weeks I can endure."

There was no reason to be sad, and Natasha asked.

"Havitz?"

"Well, if it's this kind of attack, he wouldn't be unaware. Anyway, that's not what's important."

Vulcan spat bloody phlegm on the floor and looked up at the Wizard.

"If you're willing to join hands with us, there's a way to kill Havitz."

The Wizard asked calmly.

"What method?"

"A game."

Vulcan's eyes filled with determination.

"A way to commit murder without killing intent. We just need to create such a system. A kind of game. The question is whether Havitz would be interested, but with you, there should be no problem."

He was confident.

'Havitz didn't kill the Wizard. This isn't chaos. This is clearly emotional and logical.'

Then he could be stabbed.

"I understand."

The Wizard said.

"Approaching with a system rather than emotion. It would certainly be effective if it ends as a game. But this isn't a game. We actually have to kill Havitz."

The moment of delivering the final blow wouldn't be a game, so emotions would inevitably be involved.

"Don't worry."

Vulcan looked at Zetaro and said.

"We have a game expert on our side. We can definitely take Havitz's head."

The paradox that because he's human who only seeks Havitz's pleasure, he might actually be able to kill him.

"The moment we drive Havitz to the brink of death, we'll certainly face Vanishing. But Zetaro can do it. Right?"

Zetaro just had a sad expression.

"And I..."

Vulcan said with a twisted smile.

"Have never lost at a game."

"Are you sane?"

Uorin, having heard Havitz's demands, asked with an incredulous expression.

"You're really going to do such a thing?"

"It doesn't matter. The kill has already been fired. The strongest kill at that. Tomorrow the holy war will be turned upside down."

Havitz looked at Uorin's hardened expression.

"What's so serious? This is what you wanted. If you can't control it, make it chaos. Then the initiative will return to you."

Of course, it was true.

Also, from the moment Satan mentioned a request, disaster was already foretold.

'No, it's much more logical than what I was prepared for. It's even rational. As long as it benefits Kashan, there's no loss in this strategy.'

The reason she couldn't readily agree was because it involved matters related to Sirone.

Havitz said.

"Don't worry. This is just a game. A very interesting game. What I want to do is separate."

The Wizard who loves Sirone.

'I want to meet her again.'

Even while conversing with Uorin, Havitz couldn't forget her for a moment.

'I want to meet the Wizard and... so first I need to meet her. And then... huh?'

He suddenly realized.

'I...'

What did he want to do with her?
