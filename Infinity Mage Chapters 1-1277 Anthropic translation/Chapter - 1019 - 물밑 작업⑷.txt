Underwater Maneuvering (4)

Benahar hurriedly packed his belongings.

'I have to leave.'

He didn't know where to go in the vast ocean, but it definitely wasn't this ship.

His attendant, who had been watching from the side, asked with a puzzled expression.

"Chief Secretary, what's the matter?"

"It's over. It's all over."

He stuffed the expensive watch he'd bought with a fortune deep into his bag and zipped it shut.

"You pack quickly too. In the worst case scenario, this ship might sink."

The Chief Secretary wasn't one to speak nonsense, but this time he couldn't understand.

"The ship will sink? Is it demons? Or is a tsunami coming?"

Benahar hesitated.

Could Yahweh really be considered more dangerous than the demons or tsunami his attendant mentioned?

"Huu..."

As he recalled Sirone's eyes from earlier that day, his metabolism began to tangle again.

How narrow is the human mind?

'I couldn't even imagine it, until I felt with my whole body that such a thing truly existed.'

"Chief Secretary."

As Benahar trembled like a madman, his attendant grew even more suspicious of his behavior.

"Are you feeling unwell? Should I call the medical officer?"

"Yahweh is..."

Benahar clenched his teeth hard.

"Yahweh is on this ship. He's negotiating with the Foreign Minister right now."

"Then that's good news. As you know, Minister Cairns' negotiation skills are the best. Of course, Yahweh is also under the Ivory Tower's protection, but in cases like this..."

"Heh. Hehehehe."

Perhaps because it was so absurd, laughter flowed out even in his terrified state.

"Do you know what Yahweh is?"

"One of the Four Great Transcendents and a symbol of philanthropy. The reason he's here is to help refugees. It's also a tendency I personally support."

There were times when supporting one of the Four Great Saints became fashionable among politicians...

"Do you think it's possible?"

Only when one encounters the extreme truth firsthand, like Benahar, do they finally realize.

"Do you really think loving all of humanity is something a human can do? Absolutely not. That's going insane at the extreme of some thought. He's not sane. He's a monster."

His attendant blinked.

"Extreme Evil is bad and Yahweh is good? No, none of the Four Great Saints are normal. They exist outside the category of humans, and from there they only fight to enforce their own thoughts."

"But... Yahweh is a good person."

"I saw it."

Benahar's hands trembled violently.

"Those eyes. That mind. The moment he thought it wouldn't matter if I blew up the sailing ship, Yahweh..."

It wasn't murderous intent, hostility, or anger.

"Yes, deprivation. At that moment, Yahweh clearly felt that my existence was simply 'unnecessary.' That's not human emotion by any stretch of thinking."

It was close to divine logic.

"Once that happens, your head goes completely empty. You can't think of anything. Negotiations, deals... that's just stuff humans do in the human world."

If he could save all humanity, it didn't matter to Sirone whether he was human or not.

"A world where common sense doesn't work. But I want to be human. I want to make money, meet women, and live it up even with fake honor. That's what we're all trying to do. I'm leaving."

As if he didn't need to hear his attendant's response, Benahar opened the door and left.

After the door slammed shut, only the chaotic scene of the room, like the confusion in his head, remained.

Cairns was displeased.

"Hmm."

Sirone's smile was one thing, but what annoyed him more was having his specialty crushed.

"Even if you say that, I don't know who this Fermi person is. Is he someone famous?"

"A magic school classmate."

'This is ridiculous.'

If it was personal connections from the start, wouldn't he look like a fool no matter what answer he gave?

"Sigh. Mr. Sirone, let's not do this between professionals. Getting emotional in international..."

"Cairns."

Sirone interrupted.

"Let go."

Cairns, still embracing Rangi's waist, moved his jaw and engaged in a staring contest.

A suffocating silence.

After a moment, the hand wrapped around her waist like a snake slipped away and returned to its place.

"I apologize if you were offended."

While Cairns avoided the confrontation for now, his eyes looking at Sirone remained cold.

"I didn't mean to upset you. I just wanted to emphasize that Mr. Sirone has a choice."

"That's why you're third-rate."

His tone had returned to calm, but the content of his words was merciless.

"The reason I mentioned my classmate's name is because he knows me better than anyone. No, I've never met anyone who sees through humans as nakedly as that guy."

After experiencing Cairns' negotiation style, he finally understood Fermi's strategy.

"The very fact that you're telling me to choose shows you know nothing about me. That guy probably..."

Though it doesn't remain in his memory.

"Wouldn't have given me any choice at all. A situation where I had no choice but to follow. He knows that."

There's no way Sirone would deal with the drug lord otherwise.

"I'm starting to get angry."

Actually, he was already angry.

"I'm fine with giving Rangi to the pirates, and I'm fine with the Five Great Stars helping me. Neither is a loss. This is what negotiation skill means."

Cairns extended his hand invitingly.

"What remains is Mr. Sirone's choice. Take Rangi or abandon her. What more is there?"

"Your resolve."

As Sirone's eyes turned cold, the entire dining room began to vibrate up and down.

"Th-this is...!"

Cairns stood up unsteadily, and Rangi's face turned pale as she looked around.

"Don't worry. I'm not trying to intimidate you with force. I'm just... in a bad mood."

Are you prepared to accept even that?

"The real reason I'm in a bad mood is that the option of me choosing nothing at all from the choices you presented has been completely excluded."

"No, that's..."

As Cairns got up and tried to come around the table, Sirone's eyes widened.

"Sit down."

Even if he didn't follow the command, his legs were too weak to stand any longer.

Sirone continued.

"So now I'm going to reverse positions. If I choose the options you presented, I'll feel defeated. I'm in such a bad mood that I might lose my reason. The probability is fifty-fifty."

"Now that we're in equal positions, let's proceed with negotiations again. If you tell me to make a choice, fine. I'll make a choice. But what happens after that, I don't know what will become of me either..."

Sirone said calmly.

"Can you handle it?"

The public's view of Yahweh.

If you think you can gain an advantageous position in negotiations by taking hostages, you only know half of Sirone.

'Nothing will change. If I speak, Sirone will make a choice. But what happens after that...'

Is it really something he can handle?

'No. He wouldn't really sink the ship. It's just bluffing. I've experienced this kind of threat countless times.'

That was also true, but the human in front of Cairns now was a completely different type.

Scary.

'What if he really does it?'

It was his honest feeling, and he realized what it meant to negotiate as equals with a star of the Ivory Tower.

"Rangi."

Though he tried to hide his emotions, Cairns' expression was already distorted with humiliation.

"Go sit next to Mr. Sirone."

He was still annoyed at treating people like objects, but the key to hostage negotiation was coldness.

"Ah, that is..."

After hesitating briefly, Rangi hurriedly gathered her clothes and moved to the seat next to Sirone.

The ship's trembling stopped, and as if nothing had happened, a smile appeared on Sirone's lips.

"Thank you for your consideration. You really are good at negotiating. Arachne's future looks bright."

It was genuine praise.

"Hahaha! I really can't match you. I tried desperately to gain the upper hand, but I got outmaneuvered."

Watching Cairns cool himself with a hand fan, Sirone upgraded his evaluation of him.

"Not at all. If the result is good, that's what matters. Now that the big issue is resolved, won't the small ones be finished quickly?"

"Of course. Hey, is the food still not ready? It's all cold. Bring us hot food again."

The staff immediately replaced the food, and Cairns got up to personally pour the wine.

"Come, let's toast. To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Arachne and the Ivory Tower. I'll work hard too."

You can never know what's in a person's heart, but sometimes you don't need to dig deep.

"Yes. Then."

Sirone, clinking glasses at the center of the table, brought the sweet grape wine to his lips.

'...This is difficult.'

The brilliant chandelier hanging from the ceiling seemed as foreign as something from another world.

'Where... am I right now?'

The next morning.

The emergency horn of the sailing ship Sirone was on spread across the horizon.

Those on the ship felt their eardrums would burst, and everyone came out onto the deck covering their faces.

"What! What's happening!"

While those in charge of security calmed people down, Sirone entered the captain's cabin.

"What is it?"

"We're under attack! It's pirates."

Looking toward the northeastern sea the captain pointed to, black dots flickered on the horizon.

"Dionas?"

"The probability is high, but they haven't entered our territorial waters yet."

Poine said.

"If they aimed for this, they timed it perfectly. They'll be able to make excuses if caught later. The problem is..."

"Why?"

Sirone tilted his head.

"We should have finished talking with Arachne. Why did they come all the way to these distant seas? And with such a large force..."

There was only one thing he could think of.

"They never intended to negotiate with Arachne from the beginning."

"I think so too. They plan to plunder all the treasures Arachne loaded as tribute and then pretend otherwise. It's a very pirate-like idea, but..."

Poine said quietly.

"It doesn't seem like a strategy to use against a powerful nation like Arachne. Do they have some kind of confidence?"

"Mikea's relic."

It was the first thought that came to mind.

"Please execute the evacuation program. Then we'll distance ourselves from the civilians at maximum speed. We need to finish this before the enemies enter firing range."

"I'll do my best."

The captain took the megaphone and shouted.

"To all passengers aboard! This is an emergency! Women and children, except for trained professionals, board the A7 lifeboats immediately. I repeat!"

While people evacuated to the stern, Sirone and Poine reached the bow of the ship.

"Miracle Stream."

As smoke of light gathered to form a giant lens, the distant ships became visible.

"Armed warships."

The moment Poine muttered, smoke rose from one ship and a cannon fired.

"What?"

Since the distance was too far for the cannonball to reach, Sirone removed the lens to check with the naked eye.

An incredibly fast object was approaching in a direct trajectory, seemingly ignoring even gravity.

'Faster than sound?'

The fleeing people looked back and pointed at the sky with surprised eyes.

"C-cannon fire!"

Before the words finished, Poine blocked Sirone's path as the approaching cannonball arrived.

A thunderous explosion erupted.

"My, my."

Poine, who had slid across the deck, was holding the cannonball with one hand near his temple.

"What an interesting object."

Smoke rose from the crumpled iron ball.
