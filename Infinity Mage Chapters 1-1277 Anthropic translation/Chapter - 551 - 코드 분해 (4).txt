[551] Code Decomposition (4)

"Miro... Miss?"

An unforgettable face entered Shirone's vision.

Though they had fought together against Heaven's army, they had operated in different regions, so he hadn't even known she was alive.

"It's been a while. How have you been?"

This was their second meeting since encountering each other in Miro's space-time.

Instead of the sacred feeling from back then, a realistic sense of her physical presence came first, but her beautiful appearance remained unchanged.

"How did this happen? Why is Miss Miro here...?"

"Sit down first. You've been starving for quite a while."

As if responding to her words, a rumbling signal came from his stomach.

Without complaint, Shirone sat at the dining table as Miro served him grass porridge in a bowl.

"Eat. There's plenty."

"Yes, thank you for the meal."

Since he was on the verge of going crazy without eating anything, Shirone picked up his spoon and immediately took a large bite.

'It tastes awful.'

The unimaginably bitter taste made the grass porridge flow down like a waterfall, spilling back into the bowl.

Miro rested her chin on both hands and smiled with her eyes.

"What's wrong? Is your jaw uncomfortable?"

"Is... is this some kind of medicine to treat me?"

"No. It's just my breakfast."

Having nothing to say in response, Shirone just stared as Miro reached toward the bowl.

"If you don't want to eat it, have it later."

"No, no!"

Shirone hurriedly swallowed the bitter porridge.

As he ate, he thought perhaps she was concerned about his stomach's condition after starving for so long, but maybe this was just Miro's cooking skill.

In any case, the feeling of something entering his stomach was satisfying.

While he ate, Miro told him about what had happened in the meantime.

The events in Heaven, how Theraze and Miro had cooperated to enter Apocalypse to save Shirone, whose debt had been seized by Valhalla Action.

"Rian..."

Shirone's nose bridge stung.

Though Under Coder was merely copied information with no connection to memories, the scene of Rian fighting with his life on the line came to mind as if he had seen it with his own eyes.

"Rian had a hard time. Though I had the hardest time, of course."

When Miro grinned, Shirone realized his mistake and added more words.

"Ah, thank you. Both Miss Miro and Sister Marsha and Fermi too. I've incurred a debt I can't handle."

"Right. But you'll have to handle it soon enough."

Shirone, who had finished the bowl of porridge in no time, put down his utensils and blinked.

"Handle it, you mean...?"

"Did you think we saved you for free? Follow me. There's work you need to do from now on."

Miro went outside the cabin without even clearing the bowl.

When Shirone stepped out the door, a mountain landscape with the refreshing feeling of late summer was revealed.

"Where is this?"

"Where else? It's the place where you'll roll around like a beast from now on."

"Roll around like a beast?"

Miro didn't answer and entered a small training hall behind the cabin.

Inside the wooden building, candles were lit in a row along the walls, and there was nothing but two cushions.

"Sit. From now on, follow carefully what I teach you."

Though he sat facing Miro, Shirone was in no state of mind for this.

It had only been two hours since he escaped from Valhalla Action's debt.

He hadn't even had the thought that he had returned alive from Heaven, and above all, the faces of his parents and friends who would be waiting for him came to mind.

"Um... are we going to train?"

"Probably. Why, don't you want to?"

"No, absolutely not, but..."

Shirone asked carefully.

"First, couldn't I at least contact my family?"

Miro's smiling face suddenly turned cold.

"Don't get cocky, Shirone."

Whoosh, the candles all tilted toward Shirone at once.

Meeting those cat-like eyes, saliva naturally went down his throat.

"Whatever experience you had in Heaven is already past. What remains before you is the magic school graduation exam. Your competitors are training fiercely even now. Or what, do you think your current skill level is sufficient for graduation?"

Shirone, lost in thought, looked straight at Miro and said.

"Yes."

Miro's expression relaxed as she sighed.

"Right. Actually, I think so too."

Shirone's magic had improved dramatically in Heaven.

His confidence that it would be sufficient even in the graduating class wasn't arrogance or delusion, but came from his judgment in coldly analyzing his own condition.

"You're strong. Among your peers, there's hardly anyone to compare you to. Of course, Valhalla Action is sealed for now, but it's a function installed in Armand anyway, so it's separate from the graduation exam."

Shirone waited for the continuation with a calm attitude.

"You'll be able to graduate. But that doesn't guarantee you'll necessarily become a mage."

"What does that mean?"

"Exactly what I said. The graduation exam only determines whether you graduate or not. What kind of organization you'll work for as a mage and what kind of life you'll live depends entirely on scout evaluations."

"I heard that from Teacher Collie. That's why completing the graduating class schedule is also individual freedom."

"Exactly that. And I can say with certainty..."

Miro twisted her lips slightly as she spoke.

"You won't be able to become a mage."

Shirone's eyes widened.

"A mage..."

"To be precise, the kind of mage you want. Graduating from Alpheas Magic School gets you an unofficial certificate. You could become a mercenary, or there might be ways to enter the black line. But don't even dream of entering the association as an official mage or rising to high positions in the kingdom's magic departments."

It felt like his heart was on fire, his insides turning upside down.

"Why?"

"Because you killed a god."

"..."

"No matter what, the world is moved by a small number of rulers. Power holders from countries around the world are watching you. Theraze won't abandon you, but even she is just one of the three emperors in the Holy See. Will the other two emperors stay still? I guarantee you'll be caught up in all kinds of political intrigue, used, exploited, and then discarded."

Though it didn't feel real, it was probably true.

Because it was coming directly from Miro, who had suffered from the checks of world leaders through the Tribunal of Twenty.

"Do you understand reality now? I too was trapped behind dimensional walls for 20 years. Of course, it was my own choice, but if I had refused, I would have died. Just like my family was exterminated."

Shirone suppressed the urge to cry miserably.

"The strongest Prajna who stopped Heaven's army. That's the title given to me. Of course, as a single entity, I'm strong enough. But Shirone, above humans are nations. Systems are stronger than force. Even Gaold, whom you know, lived holding his breath for 20 years to save me."

"...Then what should I do from now on?"

"Get stronger."

Miro's answer was simple.

"Graduation isn't the problem. Until you graduate, no country will step forward. Theraze will also use her power. The real storm comes after graduation. By then, you need to be strong enough to at least protect your own body."

Miscellaneous thoughts disappeared from Shirone's mind.

"I'll teach you about becoming a mage later. But that's also after you get stronger."

"Yes. I understand. I'll start right now."

Thinking it was convenient to talk with someone who changed attitudes quickly, Miro explained her plan.

"I'll guide you, but actually, what you need to focus on learning most during your time with me isn't magic."

Shirone tilted his head.

"What else is there besides magic?"

"Avatar techniques."

It was avatar techniques spoken by humanity's strongest Prajna.

"Everyone has an avatar. They just don't realize it. Also, even if you realize it, mastering it enough to call it a technique is a different matter."

Miro demonstrated directly.

Behind her, the avatar of Guanyin slowly emerged and bloomed its twelve arms like petals.

"This is..."

"Thousand-Armed Guanyin. If Prajna is revealing the avatar outside the body through mental transcendence, then Prajna's will affects the laws of the world."

When Miro widened her eyes, Guanyin's arms flew forward.

Shirone couldn't even react until the palm penetrated his body, and his heart pounded belatedly.

"You'd be dead if I had done it for real."

Shirone nodded with a stiff expression.

"Up to here is merely the workings of the mind. It's just that working appearing materialized through mental transcendence. This could also be called a technique of sorts, but..."

Saying that much, when Miro closed her eyes, Guanyin's avatar began to grow enormous.

At a size that filled the training hall, Shirone opened his mouth and looked up at the ceiling.

"With refinement, this kind of thing is also possible."

Mental Transcendence.

Unity of self and object.

When Guanyin clasped its hands following Miro's movement, hundreds of candles all went out with a pop.

While the smell of burning wicks permeated the air, no one spoke.

The wall side sparkled, and soon Miro's figure could be seen lighting the candles one by one.

"...How did you do that?"

"Simple. As many arms of Guanyin as there were candles simultaneously grasped the wicks. You just couldn't see it."

"Can the avatar's power also work on objects?"

"Not just anyone can do it. Avatars differ from person to person, and individual characteristics also play a role. The level is fixed, and I just applied it through Scale magic."

Miro, who had lit all the candles with Ignite, sat down.

"The basics of avatar techniques are strengthening the avatar. There are various methods, but since being too focused on the Way is boring, let's do it in an easy-to-understand numerical sequence method."

"Yes. I've learned numerical sequences too."

Miro chuckled.

"What you learn in magic school is stuff like how many seconds zero to a hundred takes. But avatars are on a different dimension."

Miro's finger quickly drew across.

"Zero to a hundred, that is, the speed of numerical sequences increases mental power. It uses the momentary concentration of counting to 100 in one second. Therefore, unless the speed keeps getting faster, mental power doesn't strengthen endlessly."

Shirone had also experienced this in practical exams.

"On the other hand, what's important in techniques for handling avatars is the enormity of numbers. You graft the magnitude of numbers onto the avatar. Let's try it now. Since you're also Prajna, it should be easy to apply."

"Yes, I'll try."

Shirone took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

Entering mental transcendence, the afterimage of an angel with wings of light revealed itself.

'Strengthen this with numerical sequences.'

Using the modularization learned at school, he instantly broke through zero to a hundred and entered thousands, then ten thousands.

'Still not enough?'

About five minutes later, Miro yawned.

He had no idea how far he needed to count for the avatar to strengthen.

'Then...!'

Shirone, driven by stubbornness, opened Immortal Function.

Though it would be extremely dangerous to fully expand and transcend numbers, he controlled it, but the enormity of numbers increased exponentially.

Shirone's avatar began to become clear, then the afterimage disappeared, revealing distinct boundaries.

"Huff!"

At that moment, Shirone, who had departed from the numerical sequence, breathed roughly.

"Not bad. Being successful from the first try is quite impressive. So, how far did you count?"

Shirone, catching his breath, said while searching his memory.

"Um, 58 billion 387 million 21..."

"Okay, that's enough."

Miro cut him off as soon as the first digits came out.

"Being slow doesn't matter, but that's too little for 10 minutes. You can't handle avatars like that."

"Then, how far did Miss Miro go?"

"Me? Hmm. I didn't particularly use numerical sequences. For example, when I extinguished the candles earlier..."

Miro, crossing her arms and pondering, said.

"Didn't it exceed gyeong (10 to the 16th power)?"

"Gyeong..."

He could only think it wasn't a unit humans could count.

"Why are you so surprised? This is the level you need to reach during vacation from now on."

Shirone's face turned pale.

"Me?"

"You can do it. I'll help you."

Though Miro was a talent unprecedented in human history, he still couldn't feel confident.

"I won't say it's easy. But it's troublesome if you get scared already. You've entered that kind of world."

Miro spoke, recalling a recent incident.

"There was a situation in Heaven where I had to stop Satan. It took some time, but I eventually delivered the ultimate strike. What level do you think that avatar technique would be in numerical sequences?"

When Shirone, who didn't dare to guess, shook his head, Miro raised her index finger and said.

"Il."

"Il?"

"Bulgasaui (inconceivable)."

At a unit that couldn't be intuitively felt, Shirone began counting as he had seen in books.

'Jo, gyeong, hae, ja, yang, gu, gan, jeong, jae, geuk, hanghasa, aseunggi, nayuta.'

As the units grew larger, his pupils gradually rolled upward.

'Bulgasaui...'

It was 10 to the 64th power.
