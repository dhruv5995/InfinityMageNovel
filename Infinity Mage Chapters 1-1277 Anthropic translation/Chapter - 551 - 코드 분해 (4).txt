[551] Code Breakdown (4)

"Miro... is that you?"

An unforgettable face came into Shirone's view.

Though they had fought together against Heaven's army, they had operated in different regions, so he hadn't even known she was alive.

"It's been a while. How have you been?"

This was their second meeting since encountering each other in Miro's space-time.

Instead of the sacred feeling from back then, a realistic sense of substance hit him first, but her beautiful appearance remained unchanged.

"How is this possible? Why are you here, Miro...?"

"Sit down first. You've been starving for quite a while."

As if responding to her words, his stomach let out a rumbling signal.

Without complaint, Shirone sat at the dining table as Miro served him grass porridge in a bowl.

"Eat. There's plenty."

"Yes, thank you for the meal."

He was on the verge of going crazy from not eating anything, so as soon as Shirone picked up the spoon, he took a large bite and put it in his mouth.

'It tastes awful.'

The unimaginably bitter taste made the grass porridge flow down like a waterfall, spilling back into the bowl.

Miro rested her chin on both hands and smiled with her eyes.

"What's wrong? Is your jaw uncomfortable?"

"This... is this some kind of medicine for treating me?"

"No. It's just my breakfast."

With nothing to say in response, Shirone just stared as Miro reached toward the bowl.

"If you don't want to eat it, have it next time."

"No, no!"

Shirone hastily swallowed the bitter porridge.

As he ate, he thought perhaps she was concerned about his stomach condition after starving for so long, but maybe this was just Miro's cooking skill.

In any case, the feeling of something going into his stomach was satisfying.

While he ate, Miro told him about what had happened in the meantime.

The events that occurred in Heaven, and how Theraze and Miro had cooperated to enter Apocalypse to save Shirone, whose debt had been seized by Valhalla Action.

"Lian..."

Shirone's nose bridge stung.

Though Under Coder was merely copied information with no connection to actual memories, the scene of Lian fighting for his life came to mind as if he had witnessed it directly.

"Lian had a hard time. Though I had the hardest time, of course."

When Miro grinned, Shirone realized his mistake and added more words.

"Ah, thank you. Both you and Sister Marsha and Fermi too. I've incurred a debt I can't handle."

"That's right. But you'll have to handle it soon enough."

Shirone, who had polished off a bowl of porridge, set down his utensils and blinked.

"Handle it, you mean...?"

"Did you think we saved you for free? Follow me. There's work you need to do from now on."

Miro didn't even clear the bowls and went outside the cabin.

When Shirone stepped out the door, a mountain scenery with the refreshing feeling of late summer was revealed.

"Where is this?"

"Where else? It's the place where you'll roll around like a beast from now on."

"Roll around like a beast?"

Miro didn't answer and entered a small training hall behind the cabin.

Inside the wooden building, candles were lit in rows along the walls, and there was nothing but two cushions.

"Sit. From now on, follow carefully what I teach you."

Though he sat facing Miro, Shirone was in no state of mind for this.

It had only been two hours since he escaped from Valhalla Action's debt.

He hadn't even had the thought that he had returned alive from Heaven, and most of all, the faces of his parents and friends who would be waiting for him came to mind.

"Um... are we going to train?"

"Probably. Why, don't you want to?"

"No, absolutely not that, but..."

Shirone asked carefully.

"First, couldn't I at least contact my family?"

Miro's smiling face suddenly turned cold.

"Don't get cocky, Shirone."

Whoosh—the candles all tilted toward Shirone at once.

Meeting those cat-like eyes, saliva naturally went down his throat.

"Whatever experience you had in Heaven is already in the past. What remains ahead of you is the magic school graduation exam. Your competitors are still training fiercely. Or what, do you think your current skill level is sufficient for graduation?"

Shirone, lost in thought, looked straight at Miro and said:

"Yes."

Miro's expression relaxed as she let out a sigh.

"Right. Actually, I think so too."

Shirone's magic had improved by leaps and bounds in Heaven.

His confidence that it would be sufficient even among the graduating class wasn't arrogance or delusion, but came from the judgment of coldly analyzing his own condition.

"You're strong. Among your peers, there's hardly anyone to compare you to. Of course, Valhalla Action is sealed for now, but since it's a function installed in Armand anyway, it's separate from the graduation exam."

Shirone waited for the continuation with a calm attitude.

"You'll be able to graduate. But that doesn't guarantee you'll necessarily become a mage."

"What does that mean?"

"Exactly what I said. The graduation exam only determines whether you graduate or not. What institution you'll work for as a mage and what kind of life you'll live depends entirely on scout evaluations."

"I heard that from Teacher Collie. That's why completing the graduating class schedule is also individual freedom."

"That's exactly it. And I assure you..."

Miro twisted her lips slightly as she spoke.

"You won't be able to become a mage."

Shirone's eyes widened.

"A mage..."

"Precisely, the kind of mage you want to be. Graduating from Alpheas Magic School gets you an unofficial certificate. You could become a mercenary, or there might be ways to enter the black line. But don't even dream of becoming an official mage entering the association or rising to high positions in the kingdom's magic departments."

It felt like his heart was on fire, his insides turning upside down.

"Why?"

"Because you killed a god."

"..."

"However you look at it, the world is moved by a small number of rulers. Power holders from countries around the world are watching you. Theraze won't abandon you, but even she is just one of the three emperors in the Holy See. Will the other two emperors stay quiet? I guarantee you'll be caught up in all sorts of political intrigue, used and exploited, then discarded."

Though it didn't feel realistic, it was probably true.

Because it was coming directly from Miro, who had suffered from the checks of world leaders through the Tribunal of Twenty.

"Do you understand reality now? I too was trapped for 20 years creating dimensional walls. Of course, it was my own choice, but if I had refused, I would have died. Just like my family was exterminated."

Shirone suppressed the urge to cry miserably.

"The strongest Prajna who stopped Heaven's army. That's the title given to me. Of course, as a single entity, I'm strong enough. But Shirone, above humans are nations. Systems are stronger than force. Even that Gaold you know lived holding his breath for 20 years to save me."

"...Then what should I do from now on?"

"Get stronger."

Miro's solution was simple.

"Graduation isn't the problem. Until you graduate, no country will step forward. Theraze will also use her influence. The real storm comes after graduation. By then, you need to be strong enough to at least protect yourself."

Miscellaneous thoughts disappeared from Shirone's mind.

"I'll teach you about becoming a mage later. But that's also after you get stronger."

"Yes. I understand. I'll start right now."

Thinking it was convenient to talk with someone who changed attitudes quickly, Miro explained her plan.

"I'll guide you, but actually, what you need to focus on learning most during your time with me isn't magic."

Shirone tilted his head.

"What else is there besides magic?"

"Avatar techniques."

It was avatar techniques spoken by humanity's strongest Prajna.

"Everyone has an avatar. They just don't realize it. And even if they realize it, being able to use it skillfully enough to call it a technique is a different matter."

Miro demonstrated directly.

The avatar of Avalokiteśvara rose behind her like smoke, then bloomed its twelve arms like petals.

"This is..."

"Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara. If Prajna is manifesting the avatar outside the body through mental transcendence, then the Prajna's will affects the laws of the world."

When Miro widened her eyes, Avalokiteśvara's arms flew at him.

Shirone couldn't even react until the palm passed through his body, and his heart pounded belatedly.

"You'd be dead if I had done it for real."

Shirone nodded with a stern expression.

"Up to here is merely the workings of the mind. It's just those workings materialized and manifested through mental transcendence. This could be called a technique in its own way, but..."

After saying that much, when Miro closed her eyes, Avalokiteśvara's avatar began growing huge.

Large enough to fill the training hall, Shirone opened his mouth and looked up at the ceiling.

"With refinement, this kind of thing is also possible."

Mental Transcendence.

Unity of subject and object.

Following Miro's movements, when Avalokiteśvara put her palms together, all hundreds of candles went out with a flicker.

During the time the smell of burning wicks permeated the air, no one opened their mouth.

The wall side sparkled, and soon Miro could be seen lighting the candles one by one.

"...How did you do that?"

"Simple. As many arms of Avalokiteśvara as there were candles simultaneously grasped the wicks. You just couldn't see it."

"The avatar's power can affect physical objects too?"

"Not just anyone can do it. Avatars differ from person to person, and individual characteristics also play a role. The realm is predetermined, and I just applied it through Scale magic."

Miro, who had lit all the candles with Ignite, sat down.

"The basics of avatar techniques are strengthening the avatar. There are various methods, but since being too focused on the Way is boring, let's do it in an easy-to-understand sequence formula."

"Yes. I've learned sequence formulas too."

Miro chuckled.

"What you learn in magic school is stuff like how many seconds zero to hundred takes. But avatars are on a different dimension."

Miro's finger quickly drew across.

"Zero to hundred, that is, the speed of sequence formulas increases mental power. It uses the momentary concentration of counting to 100 in one second. Therefore, unless the speed keeps getting faster, mental power doesn't strengthen endlessly."

Shirone had also experienced this in practical exams.

"On the other hand, what's important in techniques for handling avatars is the enormity of numbers. It's about applying the magnitude of numbers to the avatar. Let's try it now. Since you're also Prajna, it should be easy to apply."

"Yes, I'll try."

Shirone took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

Entering mental transcendence, the afterimage of an angel with wings of light revealed itself.

'Strengthen this with sequence formulas.'

Using the modularization learned at school, he instantly broke through zero to hundred and entered thousands, then ten thousands.

'Still not enough?'

About five minutes later, Miro yawned.

He had no idea how much he needed to count for the avatar to be strengthened.

'Then...!'

Shirone's competitive spirit kicked in as he opened Immortal Function.

Though expanding it completely beyond numbers would be extremely dangerous, so he controlled it, but the enormity of numbers increased exponentially.

Shirone's avatar began becoming clear, then the afterimage disappeared revealing distinct boundaries.

"Hah!"

At that moment, Shirone, who had departed from the sequence, breathed roughly.

"Not bad. Being successful from the first try is impressive. So, how far did you count?"

Shirone, having regulated his breathing, said while searching his memory:

"Um, 58 billion 387 million and 21..."

"Okay, that's enough."

Miro cut him off as soon as the first digits came out.

"Being slow doesn't matter, but for 10 minutes, that's too little. You can't handle an avatar like that."

"Then how far did you go, Miro?"

"Me? Hmm. I didn't particularly use sequence formulas. For example, when I extinguished the candles earlier..."

Miro, who had been pondering with crossed arms, said:

"I probably exceeded gyeong (10 to the 16th power)."

"Gyeong..."

He could only think it wasn't a unit humans could count.

"Why are you so surprised? This is the realm you need to reach during vacation period from now on."

Shirone's face turned pale.

"Me?"

"You can do it. I'll help you."

Though Miro was an unprecedented talent in human history, he still couldn't feel confident.

"I won't say it's easy. But it's troublesome if you get scared already. You've entered that kind of world."

Miro spoke while recalling a recent anecdote.

"There was a situation in Heaven where we had to stop Satan. It took some time, but we eventually delivered the ultimate strike. What do you think that avatar technique would be in sequence formula terms?"

When Shirone, who didn't dare predict, shook his head, Miro raised her index finger and said:

"One."

"One?"

"Inconceivable."

At this unit that couldn't be intuitively grasped, Shirone began counting as he had seen in books.

'Jo, gyeong, hae, ja, yang, gu, gan, jeong, jae, geuk, ganghasa, aseunggi, nayuta.'

As the units grew larger, his pupils gradually rolled upward.

'Inconceivable...'

It was 10 to the 64th power.
