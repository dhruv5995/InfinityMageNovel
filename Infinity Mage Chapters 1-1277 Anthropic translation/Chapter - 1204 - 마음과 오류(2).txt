Heart and Error (2)

"Hmm."

When Armand made a suspicious expression, Yo Rahan hurriedly turned his head away.

"Right, let's eat. We should eat."

It was an unidentified fish.

Of course, it was a familiar species to the Fire Tribe, but Armand didn't bother giving it a name.

Perhaps she was experiencing the magic of flavor that fire brings, but she never judged it.

After their modest meal ended, the two stared blankly at the campfire.

"What do you want to do?"

Armand asked.

"You said you wanted to change the world. Are you planning to enlighten the Fire Tribe and make them fight?"

"Fight..."

Yo Rahan rested his chin on his knees again.

"I think violence can't change anything. Many thinkers try to find peace through war. In some sense, they might be right. But ultimately, that only applies to their own kingdom, their own city, their own family. Looking at the whole picture, their logic is no different from saying they'll sacrifice half to save the other half."

"So what?"

Now trusting Yo Rahan, Armand also spoke the words she had kept inside.

"That's how we live. How are we any different right now? To eat, we have to kill something else."

Yo Rahan asked.

"Do you want to fight?"

"The Fire Tribe has suffered much persecution. Just because we're passive, humans treated us like livestock. To be honest... I might be angrier at the Fire Tribe than at humans. Power that can't protect anything is just too pathetic."

"That's not true."

When Armand looked up, Yo Rahan's eyes held conviction.

"Being able to share each other's hearts is a blessing. I think humanity's future depends on the Fire Tribe. That's why I stayed in the village."

Is that really so?

As Armand fell into thought, Yo Rahan continued.

"Nothing can be changed through the logic of force. Humans are just afraid. Afraid of being devoured by someone stronger. If they come to understand each other like the Fire Tribe does, fear will disappear and true peace will come. You are the strong ones."

Armand smiled.

"Yes, you might be right."

For a moment their gazes crossed, and Yo Rahan gathered courage to speak.

"Um..."

"But."

At the sudden addition, Yo Rahan choked.

"Cough! Cough!"

Whether she knew his heart or not, Armand spoke with intensity in her eyes.

"Even so, we can't just take this lying down. You might not know well, but the Fire Tribe has suffered truly severe persecution from humans. If you knew what happened, you wouldn't be able to forgive them either."

"...Right, I don't know." Others' pain.

"But I'll start from there. Creating a world where the Fire Tribe and humans can live together."

As the campfire weakened, Yo Rahan spoke with a relieved expression.

"Let's sleep for now. We have to leave early tomorrow morning. The villagers will be worried."

Avoiding the waterside and entering the cliff area, Yo Rahan spread his blanket away from Armand's spot.

Though his body was pressed against coarse gravel, the excitement he felt today made his sleeping place feel like clouds.

'I should have brought my notebook. I'll have to write as soon as I get back tomorrow.'

As he repeated words in his head to not forget what he had realized, he sensed someone's presence.

"...Why?"

As the startled Yo Rahan tried to get up, Armand pressed his chest down.

"I know your heart."

His mouth wouldn't open, only his heart beat wildly.

"This time I'll show you my heart."

Yo Rahan still said nothing, but she could tell from his heartbeat alone.

'Small World Creation.'

As their hearts joined again, Yo Rahan felt a tremor.

"Ah."

Perhaps the reason he was born was only for this moment.

It was an emotion that couldn't be expressed even with the word love, a moving feeling that would leave no regrets even if he disappeared forever like this.

"Let's become one."

Since they had already shared everything, pretense was unnecessary, and the two achieved an integration that transcended concepts.

'A heart greater than the universe.'

That moment's realization would later become the most crucial data for Yo Rahan's eventual reach to the divine realm.

The artists from various countries were in the midst of final rehearsals for the 10 PM performance.

El Kiana and Maya, who adorned the finale song, finished their song with decent harmony.

Though Maya had stolen the climactic part, El Kiana was also a professional.

Panier said.

"You pass for now."

Knowing what a meticulous producer he was, the musicians inwardly felt relieved.

Reina from the Ozent family, who handled piano, also collapsed face-down on the keyboard.

'This is hell, hell.'

Panier added.

"Of course, I mean you pass based on my judgment that the actual performance will be better than rehearsal. Don't let your guard down."

"Yes sir."

Reina hurriedly straightened up and answered.

"Excuse me."

When the door opened and someone entered, the artists made expressions of disbelief.

Maya and Kayden spoke simultaneously.

"Fermi?"

Since he had now become the king of the Kesia Kingdom, Panier hurriedly approached.

"Your Majesty."

"Sorry for coming without notice."

Indeed he had.

If a king of a nation was moving, contact should have already come through an aide.

"What brings you here..."

"I was passing by and the music sounded good. May I observe for a moment?"

Fermi made that excuse.

'Cell Buster cannot be stopped.'

At least not yet.

According to the latest updated information from Apocalypse, humanity still faces destruction.

'Maya and Kayden and...'

There were as many as three people positioned in the rehearsal room who could be hints about that great disaster.

"Long time no see. How have you been?"

As Fermi raised his hand and approached, Maya hurriedly bowed her head and answered.

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"Speak comfortably, we're classmates. By the way, how have things been lately? Has anyone come looking for you..."

Kayden blocked his path.

"What business do you have with Maya? Tell me."

Having once been involved with the Golden Ring, he knew Fermi wouldn't approach without special reason.

'And most of those reasons are... for his own benefit.'

Fermi looked back and forth between Kayden and Maya, then smiled.

"Are you Maya's manager now? You've really developed though. You're probably her most successful fan."

"Just say what you came to say and leave."

"I'd like to be alone with Maya. If she accepts my proposal, she'll become much more famous."

Given the Arachne entertainment incident, the artists reacted sensitively to sponsors.

"How about it, Maya? Is your schedule okay?"

"Well, that's..."

As Maya glanced at Panier, Fermi made a reality-check comment.

"Think about my reputation too. I'm the king of a Holy War participating nation, I can't be rejected."

At that moment, everyone realized.

'Right, even if it's another country, he's still a king. If we refuse here, our lives are ruined.'

Kayden bit his lip.

'Still as underhanded as ever. But I can't step in now. If I block him here...'

He doesn't know what will happen to Maya's life.

Though he had resolved that, the moment Fermi approached Maya, his right hand moved on its own.

'Damn! No!'

Seeing the fist flying toward the king's jaw, the artists' faces turned pale.

"Oops! Dangerous."

But as if he had already expected it, Fermi lightly leaned back and avoided the attack.

Only then did Kayden grab his right hand.

"I, I..."

Watching him panic for a moment, Fermi's eyes turned coldly calm.

'So this is the prison break.'

Even with Maya's career at stake, Kayden's right hand couldn't be controlled.

'This much will do for now.'

Fermi stepped back with an eye-smile.

"Just kidding, just kidding. Really so sensitive. Just putting an arm around a fellow celebrity's shoulder."

Then he looked at Maya.

"Sorry for startling you. I'm your fan too. I'll be looking forward to the finale performance."

Maya, who had been terrified about receiving a sponsor proposal, still couldn't feel at ease.

"Didn't you have something to say?"

"I said it was just a joke. Who would mess with you?"

He wanted to say Sirone wouldn't just stand by, but he was mindful of Kayden's presence.

Turning around, Fermi erased his smile as if nothing had happened and headed to Panier.

"Could we have a word?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

After giving the artists free time, Panier led Fermi into a room.

"Shall I bring some tea?"

It had been a long time since entertaining someone of high status, so Panier paced awkwardly.

"That's fine. Please sit."

Then Maya's singing voice could be heard.

"The parts have changed. Ms. El Kiana must be disappointed."

Since this was information that couldn't be known without specific investigation, Panier narrowed his eyes.

'As expected, he's no ordinary person. I heard he was the real power behind the Kesia Kingdom even before becoming king.'

Fermi asked.

"Is it a matter of skill, or is there another reason?"

If Maya was a keyword for the future, he needed to know as much as possible about changes happening to her.

'Results are the sum of all causes.'

Panier said.

"As a producer, I evaluate many artists. But what I've learned from living is that there's no perfect standard to evaluate a human being."

"Oh."

"Humans are beings who can't even take care of themselves properly. I'm the same. When I evaluate someone, I tend to look at how much they gave their best effort."

"Of course, it's not an accurate standard, especially in the art world. But coming this far and thinking about it..."

Panier felt bitter.

"Still, that seems closest to the truth."

Truth.

The spotlight of the performance would go to Maya.

'Perhaps this could be the crucial hint about Cell Buster. But the pieces don't fit yet.'

"First, I'm sorry for coming without notice. It's something I had to hear directly."

Information about future events couldn't be shared with anyone.

"Yes, please speak."

"Do you know someone named Robe Lanstin?"

"Pardon?"

It was an unexpected question.

"Your Majesty, how do you know about Lanstin?"

How could he not?

Guitarman of the Seven Great Mages was famous among magicians, not artists.

"I don't know him directly. I heard he was at your company, so I wondered if you're still in contact."

"I see."

Though quite some time had passed, Robe Lanstin was still an unforgettable name.

"He is a big part of my life. But I don't know news of him now. Whether he's dead or alive."

"To cut to the conclusion, he's alive."

Is that so?

'Right, you were alive? Still unable to let go of that path, living like that?'

Panier asked.

"Your Majesty, what kind of human do you think an artist is?"

"Well."

It wasn't a question for an outsider to answer.

"Is there really a definition? They're all the same job. Nothing special or great about it. What I want to say is, no matter how successful I become, I don't call myself an artist anywhere. I call myself a musician. Someone who makes money through music."

Sensing the subtle difference, Fermi asked.

"Then what kind of person is an artist?"

"Life itself."

Panier said.

"Bastards whose very existence is art. Living however they want regardless of what the world says. Of course, occasionally great artists emerge, but nine times out of ten, they're destined to die on the streets."

Panier's eyes became distant.

"Robe Lanstin... lived a life closer to art than anyone I know."
