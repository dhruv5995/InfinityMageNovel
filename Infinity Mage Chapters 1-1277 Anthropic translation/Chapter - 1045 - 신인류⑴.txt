New Humanity (1)

Even as midnight approached, countless lights remained lit throughout the imperial capital Yeomra of Jincheon.

Jingang summoned Sirone.

"I'll enter."

As he entered the emperor's quarters, Jingang sat alone, tilting a wine cup.

"Come in."

The door closed and as Sirone carefully sat down, Jingang lifted a ceramic wine bottle.

"You seem busy with work."

Sirone said while receiving the wine.

"Jincheon is vast, after all. Thanks to your help, various matters are being processed quickly."

Jingang was Sirone's active ally, and this would be of great strength at the Holy War Council.

Breaking the awkward silence, Sirone spoke.

"Currently, the Holy Sound is..."

"Don't misunderstand. That's not why I called you. If a promise was made, waiting is what a true man does."

How could he not be curious, but Jingang wasn't the type to view ambassadors through personal emotions.

"The people of Jincheon are grateful. If it weren't for you, the damage from the demon realm would have been much worse."

The Azure Dragon Mountain Range where Bassago had opened the demon realm was currently in a state of perfect isolation.

"I only did what needed to be done. It's fortunate that the range of mental radiation wasn't wide."

A radius of 300 kilometers couldn't be called narrow, but compared to Jincheon, it was localized.

Jingang brought up the main topic.

"Have you ever heard of the New Humanity?"

"Yes. It's what the intelligent ones among the mutants of the Azure Dragon Mountain Range call themselves. They're currently isolated, but once the matter in hell is finished, we should be able to find a way."

"They've started a rebellion."

Sirone narrowed his eyes.

"I just received intelligence myself. They've left the territory designated by the imperial court and annihilated our forces. The northern and eastern gates of the mountain range have been breached, and mutants are attacking nearby cities."

"Is that... possible? The northern gate is guarded by Yucheong, and the eastern gate by Hwangyiseong."

The reason they had directly dispatched the Five Dragon Generals was because they judged there were that many risk factors.

"The scale of the rebellion seems enormous. I don't know how they multiplied their numbers. But if they could suddenly emerge like this, it's one of two things. Either it was planned from very long ago..."

"Or an unexpected variable occurred."

"That's right. Both the former and latter are possible. In any case, the New Humanity is different from humans."

'Different from humans.'

That was true.

"Please quell the rebellion. If their forces expand, there's no guarantee they won't march all the way to the imperial capital."

"Yes. I'll go see for myself."

From Sirone's position too, the imperial authority of Jincheon had to be maintained for him to fight in the Holy War.

Since the situation was urgent, he packed his things right away and left the imperial capital.

Earth Dragon Gaitan and White Dragon Asriker were waiting.

"Are you departing immediately?"

"Yes. We're going to the Azure Dragon Mountain Range. Let's adjust our speed to arrive by tomorrow morning."

Rising into the sky, Sirone looked toward the direction of the mountain range and spread his wings of light.

'Biological mutation.'

Since quite some time had passed since the demon realm opened, they would be entirely different beings from what he imagined.

"Let's go."

Explosively pushing his wings of light as he flew, the apostles followed closely behind Sirone.

Dawn was faintly breaking beyond the Azure Dragon Mountain Range.

"The sun is rising."

The scene reflected below was much more serious than Sirone had initially expected.

Barriers made purely through labor had crumbled like teeth, and corpses formed fields.

Asriker's expression changed.

"Shall we enter immediately?"

If they had raised the banner of New Humanity and carried out a rebellion, there would definitely be a ringleader.

'Strike the head with a quick decisive battle.'

It made sense, but seeing the scale of damage on the ground, Sirone changed his mind.

"Let's assess the situation first. I have a bad feeling. There must be something we don't know about."

Flying to the northern gate that had suffered the most damage, Sirone landed in the ruined area.

"Five Great Stars!"

Soldiers who had been searching through collapsed buildings for survivors all bowed their heads in unison.

"Where is the general?"

"He's resting in the medical ward. We heard he suffered serious injuries, but fortunately his life isn't in danger."

"Serious injuries?"

Did that mean Yucheong, the Great Swordmaster of the Five Dragon Generals, had been hurt?

"Gaitan, stay at the scene and gather information. Start with last night's situation, thoroughly."

"Understood."

This wasn't something Asriker could do.

Following a soldier's guidance into the medical ward, Yucheong struggled to sit up with a pained expression.

"Five Great Stars."

He was wrapped in bandages from chest to abdomen.

"Just lie down."

"No. For a warrior, wounds of this degree... Ugh!"

He wanted to maintain his pride, but he couldn't help the groan that escaped.

'What kind of disgrace is this.'

Asriker stood in a corner of the medical ward, keeping her gaze down and mouth shut.

Ever since being scolded by Sirone, she avoided making eye contact with people as much as possible.

Nevertheless, she was everything to Yucheong's heart.

'She's truly beautiful. It's only regrettable that I can't become her lover.'

Even the abdominal wound torn almost to rag-level couldn't be felt right now.

"Who did this to you?"

But the moment he received Sirone's question, his mood that had been like walking through a flower garden turned into a nightmare.

Terror so great that even his feelings for the White Dragon shut down.

Yucheong's body trembled violently.

"It wasn't... human."

It still flickered before his eyes.

"No, the appearance was human. But the feeling itself was different. Not an animal, not human, not plant, not insect. How can I explain that..."

"Was that guy the ringleader of the rebellion?"

"I don't know. At some point, they had infiltrated the gate. Then they revealed their true nature and began slaughtering indiscriminately. When I came to my senses, all the soldiers had been torn apart like paper."

As Yucheong clenched both fists, blood slowly spread through the bandages he was wearing.

"My sword couldn't even graze him. Of course it couldn't. He never even came close."

"Then how did you get these wounds?"

"His eyes changed."

Yucheong's face turned deathly pale.

"Not just the feeling, but his entire pupils turned black. That was the end of it. When I regained consciousness..."

Like a dissected frog, his belly had been split open with limbs spread out.

Aaahhhhh!

As his own screaming tore through the veil of memory, Yucheong curled up his body.

"Ugh! Damn it! Son of a bitch!"

As the facts he had desperately tried to ignore surfaced, his mind began to break down.

"I don't know! How I'm still alive! I couldn't even feel pain back then. Damn it, what did that thing do to me! That monster, that monster—"

As Sirone stepped back, Asriker, understanding his intention, gently patted Yucheong's back.

"It's okay. You did your best. Leave it to us and rest comfortably."

"Ah, ahh..."

Yucheong, who had been shedding tears in overwhelming gratitude, gradually closed his eyelids with drowsy eyes.

Asriker gently laid him down, but seeing the blood soaked into the bandages, it seemed treatment was needed.

"New Humanity."

While the doctor treated the wounds, Sirone was lost in thought in a corner of the medical tent.

Asriker approached.

"Messiah, eye techniques can only affect the mind, they can't produce physical effects."

Sirone's suspicion was also focused on that point.

"Right. You can't split someone's belly just by looking at them. If it were possible..."

Mental techniques.

"Could it be using quantum signals?"

"I don't know. There were demons in hell with mutant abilities too. They gained transcendent intelligence through 4th generation upheaval, but to use quantum signals, you'd need to exceed at least the 7th generation."

It was an evolution that might or might not happen even if all of humanity mutated for a thousand years.

Gaitan entered.

"Messiah, I have matters to report."

"Yes. Go ahead."

"The New Humanity's mutants went east around dawn. Based on the map, the nearest city is Bukjeon, with approximately 700,000 residents."

Sirone nodded.

"Then let's go to Bukjeon. The proper order is to first identify the New Humanity, then strike their hideout."

"Yes. However..."

Gaitan added.

"According to the administrator, Jincheon Emergency State called in experts. They should have arrived in Bukjeon by now. I thought I should report this in advance."

Sirone furrowed his brow.

"Experts? What kind of experts, when even a Five Dragon General couldn't handle the enemy?"

"That is..."

Gaitan's expression became troubled.

"They're probably people you know, Messiah."

Residents of the Ivory Tower had arrived at Bukjeon's gates.

"Hahaha! It's been a while since we've had a deployment. Nothing beats working in the field!"

A man over 2 meters tall wearing judge's robes fluttered his fan and shouted.

First Star rank of the Legal Department, Chief Justice Tanjura.

"Getting some fresh air like this feels like my heart is clearing up too. Don't you think so, Borvor?"

A woman thin as a toothpick, dressed entirely in black, was walking forward.

Her half-open lips and unfocused pupils proved she was genuinely thinking about nothing.

Morai Borvor.

A Second Star resident of the Balance Department with the nickname "Mollusk."

"Borvor?"

Borvor suddenly turned her head.

After staring blankly at the smiling Tanjura, she suddenly burst into laughter.

"Uhahahaha! Uhahahaha!"

"Kekekeke! That's right! Puhahahaha!"

The laughter cut off abruptly, and as if nothing had happened, Borvor looked forward again.

'Creepy. Creepy.'

The nickname "Mollusk" came from her mental fluidity that transcended human limits.

Tyrant, murderer, seductress—there was no mental preference she couldn't adapt to.

"Halt. Who are you?"

When the gate guard stopped them, Tanjura fluttered his fan and spoke heartily.

"We're merchants buying specialty goods. We came to examine Bukjeon's famous products—may we enter?"

"Merchants?"

The guards exchanged glances and shook their heads.

"Bukjeon is currently under security control. The governor ordered us not to let anyone in. Either turn back or camp until the control is lifted."

"Hmm, security control."

While Tanjura clicked his tongue, Borvor's eyes momentarily focused.

'Already infiltrated.'

Just like when they annihilated the northern gate, it seemed they were attempting internal control.

'To occupy a specific region, destroying the command structure is most efficient. Despite having unknown military power, they're going through such troublesome methods because...'

Because they can't tolerate inefficient means.

'New Humanity.'

"Listen here, actually we are..."

As Tanjura was about to pull out the Ivory Tower's badge, Borvor raised her hand to stop him.

Then she approached the guard and whispered something in his ear with an extremely pitiful expression.

"Hmm."

The guard with wavering eyes spoke to his colleague again, and they whispered together for quite a while.

"Fine. Let's check first."

The two guards took Borvor to a temporary post set up beside the gate.

While Tanjura waited, tapping his foot, giggling sounds leaked out.

"What are they doing in there?"

At that moment, an tremendous exclamation erupted, turned into a scream, and then transformed into sorrowful crying.

Shortly after, the two guards walked out with their heads hung low, wiping away tears.

"Please enter."

The guards who silently opened the gate seemed to have lost their personalities and looked hopeless.

Following behind Borvor, Tanjura asked.

"What on earth did you do to them? I'd believe it if you said they'd commit suicide right now."

"Nothing."

Borvor's focus drifted away again.

"They simply realized what kind of humans they are."
