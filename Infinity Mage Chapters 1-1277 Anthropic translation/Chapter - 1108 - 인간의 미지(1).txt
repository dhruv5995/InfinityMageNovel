The Unknown Human (1)

Past midnight.

Following a secret passage in the Vatican, Shirone's group descended and infiltrated the dark corridor with its lights turned off.

'The Heresy Management Department is at the end of this hallway.' Since what Shirone wanted was the truth about the Heresy Management Department, they needed to infiltrate secretly.

According to Seina, the guards change shifts every 8 hours.

'Regardless of their level, they're clergy. It's better not to use mental magic.'

After waiting, when 2 AM arrived, footsteps could be heard from the darkness.

"Ugh, I'm sleepy."

The regular priests who had been standing guard passed by Shirone's group, blinking their eyes drowsily.

"Standing guard without any light is really tough work."

"Right. Night shifts are especially like that." Replacement members were waiting at the end of the corridor.

"Nothing happened?"

"Well, no one comes here anyway."

Most of the priests didn't even know where the Heresy Management Department was located.

'Now's the time.'

As if on cue, Shirone's group moved simultaneously.

Advancing while relying on firefly-like small lights, they found a large door reeking of iron blocking the corridor.

The time it would take for new guards to arrive was at most 1 minute.

'Can we do it?'

Unlike Seina's worry, Shirone made the Miracle Stream as thin as thread and sent it into the locking mechanism.

'The sound!'

Just as Seina quickly raised her head in realization, the lock clicked open.

No sound was heard.

'Vacuum magic.'

The moment they opened the iron door, countless voices echoed.

"Kuk—"

Even with all sound waves under control, Shirone hastily closed the door.

"Oh God! Please punish me!"

Following the shouts, screams erupted, and Seina's face turned pale.

"This is... the Heresy Management Department?"

Like a prison, iron doors were installed along the corridor, each producing horrific sounds.

"No. This can't be right." Even though it was underground, this was the sacred Vatican, a place where God's dignity resided—these weren't sounds that belonged here.

"If it were before I received baptism from you, I wouldn't have even had such thoughts."

Seina couldn't argue back.

'I already knew.'

Though she hadn't seen it with her eyes, she knew how the Heresy Management Department's paladins would treat heretics.

It wasn't scary because she was just now realizing it.

What was truly frightening was...

'How could I live without thinking about anything?'

Even though such inhumane things were happening in the Vatican's basement.

"Let's go. This is just the beginning."

"The beginning?"

Shirone stared at the end of the corridor.

"Paladins receive training from childhood. Do you know where that is?"

Seina searched her memory.

"Of course I don't know. I was too young, and when I had memories, I just thought it was somewhere in the mountains."

Shirone pointed into the darkness.

"When we leave this place, it'll be there—the paladins' training ground. The Papal States don't just have the Vatican. Mountain ranges stretch to the north. There are countless villages there. Places where those who faced the Heresy Management Department's judgment are exiled."

"In such a place... there's a paladins' training ground?"

"That's what we need to confirm. Let's go."

Even as Shirone's group moved forward, Seina remained lost in thought.

'Harsh training in childhood.'

It was an ordeal that was hard to endure both physically and mentally.

'But I overcame it. I lived solely with that pride. I defeated countless evils.'

How did it come to this?

'I need to regain my divine power. Like Yahweh said, I'll confirm the truth and judge for myself.'

Following behind Shirone, Seina could see what was happening inside the iron bars.

"You damn bastard! Kill me! Kill me!"

Those who were angry.

"I was wrong! I was foolish! Ah, God Cria."

Those who were praying.

"Hehehe! Yeah, do more! Let me taste heaven!"

Those who were laughing.

Seina's hair stood on end.

"This is... exactly like the Heresy Management Department's paladins?"

"That's right. When thinking itself becomes painful, the human mind becomes very simple. That's why they become blind and strong."

Seina was once strong too.

"But that's not true strength. Real strength isn't about destroying—it's the power to protect."

"Huu. Huu."

An iron door opened and a paladin from the Heresy Management Department came out.

Blood was smeared all over his body, and bloody tears flowed from his eyes.

'The weeping one.'

"I... I am sad. This world, this reality..."

Despite Shirone's group being there, he paid them no attention and headed to another room.

Iruki's expression became serious.

'He's completely lost it. It's not that he didn't see us. His thinking is already paralyzed and he's acting like a machine.'

Standing in front of the open room, they saw a man who had been brutally tortured.

Seina approached.

"You've lost too much blood. Wait. Let me at least stop the bleeding..."

"Kill me."

The man spoke.

"Please... kill me. Let me escape from this prison."

Looking at the man with a tearful expression, Seina closed her eyes and shouted.

"I understand enough!"

Yahweh was right.

"I know I was wrong. So there's no need to investigate further. Let's leave. Saving the people here comes first."

That would be normal thinking, but Shirone was still lost in thought.

"Kill me! Kill me, I said!"

The man flailed his hands weakly, and Seina took his hand.

"It's okay now. We'll get you out of here."

"Kik."

A scraping sound came from the man's throat.

"Kikiki! Get out? What?"

"Well, from this prison..."

At that moment, the man's focus became clear for the first time.

"Is there such a wide prison?"

As everyone pondered the meaning of his words, the man suddenly thrust his face forward.

"Kill meeee! Kill me! Kill me, I said!"

Blood splattered on their faces, and just as Seina felt chills and tried to hastily back away...

"It's futile."

An ominous voice came from outside the iron door.

'When did he...?'

It was a man in robes that flowed to the floor, holding chains in both hands.

Iruki asked.

"Who are you?"

"Vanisa."

The Vatican's second-in-command, the Forgiver.

Even Seina, a paladin of the Oracle Management Department, was meeting him for the first time.

"What is the meaning of this?"

Vanisa showed no reaction.

"How can such atrocities be happening in the sacred Vatican? Who exactly approved this?"

"...God."

When Vanisa removed his hood, the robe slid along his body.

Seina's eyes widened and nausea rose from the pit of her stomach.

'What did he do to his own body?'

Specific parts of his body had missing muscle, revealing bone, and there were twisted marks on his abdomen as if organs were tangled inside.

Shirone stepped forward.

"I'll handle this. He's strong." A yaksha or perhaps a hannya.

No, maybe something that possessed both.

"Kill me... kill me."

As the tortured man's moans leaked out, Vanisa pointed with his scythe.

"How fortunate. Why don't you do it? Show mercy."

Shirone shot back.

"Mercy would be taking that person out of this prison."

"Prison?"

The corners of Vanisa's mouth rose.

"We are all imprisoned.

Right here."

His scythe stabbed into his own chest.

"In the prison called flesh."

"A perfect state of confinement that doesn't allow even 1 millimeter of freedom—that is the flesh. Look at my body."

When he spread his torso, broken ribs tore through the flesh and protruded.

York 99

As Seina turned her head away, he spat out.

"Where in this flesh... is there space for me to rest?"

Vanisa slowly approached.

"I cannot hide anywhere. The pain is entirely mine. And that is why God created us."

Nade drew forth electricity.

"He's not in his right mind."

"Right mind? We are imprisoned from the moment of birth, and receive endless pain until we escape this prison. When we can no longer bear that pain, God opens the prison door for us."

Vanisa stopped at a distance where his scythe could reach if swung.

"He liberates minds that have obtained complete truth from their flesh. It's you who are not in your right minds."

Some choose suicide at the end of despair.

"That man cannot kill himself. Because he hasn't yet obtained the truth. Yet he tries to escape from the prison of flesh. I am helping him."

It was sophistry.

Surely it must be, but the reason they couldn't refute it was...

'The outside world.'

Because now Shirone was beginning to guess God's true identity.

'Vanisa doesn't know about the outside world. Therefore, it's a belief he realized himself. But that was also born from extreme pain...'

One human's truth.

"Foolish creatures, God has confined us to flesh. We can never escape from that existential karma. Repent. Realize the truth in pain. I shall forgive you."

"Why?"

Shirone sought to find truth in the madman.

"What's the reason? Why does God punish us?"

"Only one."

His body, held vertically, slowly tilted forward.

"For God's glory."

"Get away!"

Nade and Iruki kicked off the ground.

In contrast, Shirone activated Miracle Stream from his position to protect Seina.

The moment he wrapped Vanisa's arms in streams of light, tremendous pressure was felt.

"Kruk!"

The reason he could move despite severed muscles was divine transcendence.

"Yahweh."

The reason he could overcome Miracle Stream's power was mental transcendence.

"You are the true heretic."

As Shirone gritted his teeth and swung the streams of light, Vanisa was slammed into the corridor wall.

KWAAAAANG!

Before the echo of the thunderous sound disappeared, Shirone shouted.

"Go! Find the exit!"

Having confirmed Vanisa's abilities, Nade and Iruki grabbed Seina's wrist—her divine power now even weaker—and ran down the corridor.

"Conviction, flesh, philosophy, movement."

Vanisa's body, more broken than before, rose like a zombie.

"Do you think you can accomplish something with such things? Not a chance, Yahweh. You're mistaken."

Breaking off one annoying rib, he gripped his scythe again and charged.

"There is no way to escape God's prison."

Caden couldn't fall asleep.

'Maya.'

He, who was guarding the artists' lodging in the Tormia district of Delta headquarters, had been assigned the room next to Maya's.

'Is she sleeping?'

Even staring at the wall beyond, nothing could be seen—only his imagination ran wild.

'Let me not think foolish thoughts. It's enough that I'm protecting Maya. I don't wish for anything else.'

Then he felt a strange sensation from his lower body.

"Huh?" When he raised his head to check, his pants had been pulled down and his right hand was moving.

"Aaaaah! What is this! Damn it!"

Alien Hand Syndrome.

It seemed to respond to desire, but he couldn't grasp the criteria by which it moved.

"You stupid right hand! Stop it! I'm not a monkey!"

As his left and right hands battled each other, Maya burst through the door.

"Caden! What's wrong!"

"Uh uh uh! Uh uh uh uh!"

Caden was grateful that his body possessed superhuman reflexes.

Seeing him hastily pull up the blanket, Maya blushed and waved her hands.

"S-sorry. I didn't see anything. Really."

'Damn it! Damn it!'

Caden's head buried into the blanket in frustration.

'It's over. I'll never be able to protect Maya.'

As if denying his thoughts, his right hand extended its index finger and slowly moved it left and right.
