The Obstacle Called Humanity (3)

In an unknown forest.

"Kraaaah!"

A blazing skeletal swordsman pierced through the veil of the other world and crossed into reality.

In his right hand, nothing but bones, he held a great straight sword that remained unaffected by the flames.

"Kiiiiiii!"

Like the king of the dead returned from hell, he gazed forward with hollow eye sockets and thrust his sword into the ground.

The earth shook from the power of divine transcendence, and as his body gradually restored itself, the flames began to subside.

"Uuuuuh..."

Rian, now regenerated down to his skin, screamed.

"Ugh, it's hot!"

He brushed off the remaining embers with both hands, panting with his smoke-rising body.

"Hah. Hah."

Gehenna's flames had subsided in reality.

However, the fire that had ignited before entering the other world had burned away all his clothing.

"Am I back?"

Rian caught his breath and looked around, but found himself in a vast forest of unknown location.

"Well, Sung-eum will come to get me."

He didn't know the exact principle, but her ability was the pinnacle of spatial magic.

Lete materialized from thin air.

"You're a monster among monsters too."

Landing gracefully on the ground, she alternately examined Rian's body and the great sword embedded in the earth.

"To purify the flames of the Fire Demon and escape. I can see why Yahweh depends on you."

Rian felt awkward at the unexpected praise.

"Well, it was nothing much."

"It wasn't 'nothing much.' Enduring Gehenna's flames means you overcame all of hell's emotions. Some human monks achieved enlightenment by setting themselves on fire."

It's called Jwatalipmang.

"But you went beyond that and exist in reality. Your divine transcendence might truly rival that of a god."

That's what Lete thought.

'Mushin Yaksha.'

At this point, there probably wasn't a human who could defeat Rian after his return from hell.

Rian raised his great sword and examined the blade.

"Is that so? I do feel like I might have gotten stronger. But I won't know until I fight."

"It's in the realm of the mind. You won't feel it until you meet an opponent who pushes you to your limits. However, you need to be careful about your recovery ability. Restoring the Idea's signal to deny death is close to exploiting user privileges, and precisely because of that, it has limits. If it keeps accumulating, the Idea itself will disappear."

Rian was aware of this too.

"How long can I hold out?"

"I can't measure it precisely, but don't you know better? Just from the feeling..."

It wasn't very long.

"It doesn't matter."

As long as he could hold out until Sirone achieved his goal, what happened after didn't matter.

"And..."

Lete, who had been hesitating, finally couldn't hold back and shouted.

"Please stop talking so confidently in that state! Even if I'm not human, I have an emotional program! At least pretend to cover yourself! It's annoying!"

"Hmm."

"Don't 'hmm' me, do it quickly! Pick up some leaves or something and cover your body!"

'She sure talks a lot.'

With Ymir coming, this wasn't the time to leisurely pick leaves.

'Can I win against him?'

He had grown much stronger through his journey in hell, but even so, Ymir was still a massive wall.

Watching Rian lost in serious thought, Lete was dumbfounded.

'What kind of human is this?'

The Sacred War's Jincheon Sector.

As the vassals moved Jingang's body according to national law, Anchal approached Sung-eum.

"Your Majesty the Emperor."

Though he had taken charge of the empire according to Jingang's will, Anchal's extreme formality felt quite awkward.

"Speak comfortably. I'm still not used to this."

"You must get used to it. The fate of Jincheon's citizens, of all humanity, rests in Your Majesty's hands."

Sung-eum nodded.

"I understand. What should I do now?"

"First..."

Anchal quickly explained what had happened in reality while Sung-eum was in hell.

"A simultaneous event."

The more she learned about this person called Sirone, the more limitless he seemed.

'My Step Zero.'

Knowing what Sung-eum's smile meant, Anchal felt sorry.

'He would be a perfect match for the princess.'

Sung-eum straightened her expression and said.

"I understand what you mean. Since the simultaneous event is over, I just need to bring those scattered around the world here."

"That is correct. Since it's a matter of utmost urgency, Your Majesty's role is most important."

In terms of warfare, Sung-eum's ability had the highest efficiency in transport and supply.

"Understood. I'll go to Rian first."

Sung-eum closed her eyes and spread ether waves, collecting spatial information.

'He's there.'

Though quite far away, she crumpled space to make the distance between herself and Rian zero.

"Well then."

A forest unfolded inside the building, and Sung-eum stepped lightly across the boundary.

And one minute later...

"Your Majesty?"

When Sung-eum returned alone with her face as red as a beet, Anchal frowned.

"What happened?"

"Uh..."

"Uh?"

Sung-eum said with a trembling voice.

"Bring clothes. The largest ones. Quickly."

Galliante Island.

Deep in Mount Toa, where the Kergo tribe lived, Sirone was talking with Gaold's group.

"So that's what happened."

The betrayal of the dream person Ruber, and that even the administrator who had sided with humanity was under God's intention.

Miro didn't care.

"If we're fighting God anyway, it doesn't matter how many more enemies we have. The problem is that we failed to extract Ultima."

The fact that Arius had risked his life to accomplish it must also weigh on her heart.

Sirone said.

"There's... one remaining method."

"A method?"

"Using objects to unite humanity failed, but that doesn't make Ultima impossible. If all humanity joins hearts..."

Sain interrupted.

"That's just idealism. It's no different from before we entered Ymir's mental world."

"There is one difference. Tachyon."

Miro understood.

"You..."

"Yes. I can't guarantee success. But this is our only hope."

Gaold asked.

"Didn't you say Ymir is coming?"

Sirone nodded.

"Planet Hexar has been destroyed. Considering its size, he's probably crossing space right now."

"How long will it take?"

"Depending on his intention, it could be right now."

Sirone continued.

"We need to solve the immediate problems first to reach Ultima. Ymir. Cell Buster. And Oparts. If humanity becomes objects under God's guidance, hearts will disappear from this world."

Kang Nan said.

"There are many parts I don't understand well, but I get the gist. Can't we just go to the Sacred War right now?"

"Sung-eum will come to get us. I'll also end the simultaneous event. But before that..."

Sirone looked back at the temple door.

"Let's check first."

The faint smell of blood seeping through couldn't be ignored.

Kang Nan approached and pushed the stone door, but it wouldn't budge, as if locked from outside.

"It won't work. Should we break it down?"

The moment she finished speaking, Gaold's Air Gun passed over Kang Nan's shoulder and struck the stone door hard.

Bang!

The door didn't budge.

When Kang Nan turned with fierce eyes, Gaold grinned and shrugged.

"Hehe, interesting."

Sain said.

"Something's strange. It's as if it's become immune to physical force. But is that possible?"

"Maybe it's because that guy is weakling."

Kang Nan got back at him for the earlier situation, but she actually knew too.

'If Gaold can't break it...'

It really won't work.

"Let me try."

Sirone walked toward the door.

Miracle Stream transformed into Hand of God, and a giant hand grasped the door.

"Krgh!"

Through the sensation felt in his heart, Sirone finally realized the door's true nature.

'Obsession. Yearning.'

A massive emotion was saying this door must be protected.

'I'll tear it off.'

0 = 0 = = = !

As he concentrated high-intensity heart, the stone door began to crumple with an eerie sound.

It sounded like someone screaming, making Kang Nan shiver for no reason.

Crack!

After placing the rectangularly torn stone door on the floor, Sirone examined the passage's scene.

Everyone was dead.

Sain checked the ancient spell patterns carved on the rim where the door had been torn away.

"Perfectly sealed. What happened here?"

Miro, examining the corpses, said.

"Clean work. A professional's handiwork. And they haven't been dead long. At most within 6 hours."

"Over there!"

At the end of the corridor Kang Nan pointed to, a white object disappeared around the corner.

Sirone kicked off the ground.

"Wait!"

The moment he turned the corner, the white object turned another corner.

'That thing...!'

Feeling competitive, Sirone used instant movement to rapidly close the gap.

"You! Who are..."

But when Sirone laid eyes on the unidentified target, he had no choice but to swallow his words.

A man with a white body, as if human flesh had been coated with plaster, stood with his back turned.

Of course, his appearance was shocking enough, but Sirone's hesitation had a different reason.

'Dangerous.'

Ultima's senses, or perhaps tachyon signals, were clearly sending a 'do not approach' warning.

"Reveal your identity."

When Sirone asked again, it seemed like a quite difficult question for the white human.

"Well. Who am I?"

From his hands, ivory-smooth twin swords extended long and connected to his arms.

He seemed fascinated by this too.

'What the hell is this?'

As Sirone thought, Gaold's group, arriving late, walked up boldly.

"Did you kill the tribespeople?"

"Don't approach."

Sirone raised his hand to stop them.

None of the members here seemed likely to lose, but the sense of wrongness that transcended that was the problem.

"I don't know."

As if he had been thinking only about that, the white human finally spoke after a long pause.

"I have no name."

Nameless.

'Could it be?'

What flashed through Sirone's mind was the tale of heaven he had heard from Armin.

He had heard that some angel and Garas combined to birth an unimaginable creature.

'Fortunately, Mr. Quan cut it down before it could grow further.'

Armin had added this:

If we had been just a little later, no one could have stopped that thing.

Then why had the dead returned?

'Damn.'

Sirone realized.

'When I accessed the outer world.'

It was a special administrator sent to reality by God to correct errors, a kind of vaccine.

'If what Mr. Armin said is true, Nameless will absorb any strong person's abilities as his own to eliminate opponents.'

'Literally a natural genius.'

One that would make all previous geniuses seem fake.

'To think God would directly copy mutations that occurred in reality. Does he have no imagination despite being God?'

Of course, it was just complaining about the worst enemy.

In reality, for God who had mastered all the principles of the universe, imagining something was impossible.

Nameless spoke.

"I don't know about myself. How I was born, why I'm here. What I remember is..."

He carefully chose his words as if pulling something from deep within.

"Terrible fear of death and."

Something so thrilling it could make one forget even that death...

"Sword dance."

Nameless's eyes lit up.

'That's right.'

That guy.

"Quan."

In a forest 10 kilometers from the Sacred War, Shiina had brought some fruits.

"Try eating these. I gathered them all day."

"Shiina."

Quan said.

"Protect. I... protect."

Shiina's eyes welled up with tears.

"Me... protect. Shiina..."

The sword genius who had once transcended human common sense had become a fool who had lost everything.
