[618] The Day of Final Battle (2)

The sound of mechanical whirring echoed through Richard's room, where various machine parts lay scattered about.

The sight of him maintaining his body with tools while surrounded by mirrors on all sides was rather eerie, but it was something that had to be done the day before graduation exams.

His right chest was open to his side, revealing the core power engine attached to his heart glowing red.

His detached right arm was wedged between his legs, and after finishing the soldering work, he grabbed the forearm section and attached it to his shoulder.

Following mechanical sounds like scratching an itch, his five fingers writhed like octopus tentacles while the ball bearings in his elbow joint rotated, performing movements impossible for humans.

"Hmm."

Richard was satisfied.

'Next is system synchronization.'

As he squinted one eye and adjusted his brain waves, a blue light hazily glowed from within his mechanically-made iris.

In his blue-tinted vision as if submerged in water, countless measurement data changed their values in real time.

Richard's father, Ainca Marto, was the owner of Ainca Alchemy, the world's second-largest alchemical foundation, and director of the Biorobotics Research Institute, the strategic weapons development division under Valkyrie.

The fact that a direct family member of such a household willingly subjected himself to an experiment with less than 30% success rate gave insight into the family's disposition.

Even implanting mechanical devices in the brain had a success rate of less than 4%, but Marto had opened his eldest son's skull without hesitation.

'Hehehe, we have many brothers after all.'

What he gained by risking his life to modify 35% of his body was the trust of the foundation's board of directors and biologically impossible force.

'Click correction.'

As he extended his right arm and input the command, a crosshair appeared at the final point his fist was aiming at.

'Combat simulation activate.'

The room's scenery changed to a forest, and countless monsters burst out from behind cover, rushing toward Richard.

'Fire magic stone equipped.'

His elbow joint shook greatly.

The magic stones Richard used weren't the disposable ones sold commercially, but special products from Ainca Alchemy—cutting-edge materials that mass-produced the 'Essence of Spirits,' of which only 17 existed worldwide.

'Fire!'

As his right arm made thumping sounds while repeatedly advancing and retreating, virtual fireballs burst out in rapid succession, knocking down the monsters.

'Magic stone switch. Ice.'

With a whirring sound, his elbow rotated and this time shot out sharp ice spikes.

The automatic position tracking function calculated the monsters' current coordinates and acceleration to select the targets that should be hit first, and Richard only needed to shoot accordingly.

After annihilating 200 monsters this way, a mission complete signal appeared along with an analysis chart.

Three monsters had approached within a 20-meter radius, and the click error rate was 0%.

'Combat simulation deactivate.'

As the lush forest disappeared and returned to the room's scenery, Richard's lips curved upward.

"Perfect."

Ainca Richard (Final graduation class ranking: 7th place).

Major: Engineering branch of Alchemy.

Special notes: 35% of body modified with alchemical technology. Next head of the Ainca Foundation.

Amy and Shirone sat side by side on the bed, silent for a while.

"......"

The reason their hearts were racing just from being next to each other was probably because it was a special day.

'Whatever the results...'

Today, the possibilities they dreamed of would become harsh reality.

"Do you think we can pass?"

Though Amy had never left judgment to others even for a moment, this time she truly wanted to hear it.

"Of course."

Shirone needed that confidence too, even if it was a lie.

"We did our best. Think about all the days we worked hard."

"But that's the same for everyone. If we fail here..."

They'd have to fight for another year.

No, could they really keep fighting?

"I'm not confident. I want to work hard and leave it to heaven's will, but... that's not working out well."

"Amy."

Shirone grabbed Amy's shoulder and turned her around.

"You're not inferior to anyone in the graduation class. I can guarantee it."

"Really?"

"Yes. You're one of the best students. Look at yourself objectively. No matter how fierce the competition, if you just don't make mistakes, it's a difficulty level you can pass."

Thinking about it after hearing Shirone's words, it was certainly true.

She had analyzed the graduation class for a year, and if she took the exam normally, she would definitely achieve good results.

"Shirone."

As the tension disappeared, she finally felt like she could see Shirone's face.

'What will happen to us from now on?'

Reading Amy's gaze, Shirone said:

"We are us. No matter what the results are, my feelings won't change."

Even if both of them passed and went out into the wider world, their hearts would remain connected.

"Yeah."

At her small voice, the world seemed to close its eyes, and Shirone slowly brought his face closer.

"A...my."

Sound was muted, and Amy gently lifted her chin.

They came close enough to feel each other's breath, just before a monument would be erected in their shared history.

'Wait, I just earlier...'

Amy's eyes snapped open.

"Shirone, wait. Time out for now."

"Huh? What?"

Shirone, who had been leaning completely toward Amy, hurriedly pulled back with a flushed face.

"Why, what's wrong?"

"Well... it might be inconvenient right now. Actually..."

As Amy pointed toward the bathroom with her gaze, Shirone finally realized.

"Ah, that's right."

From a woman's perspective, a first kiss after vomiting would truly remain as a terrible memory.

In the awkward atmosphere, Shirone slapped both his knees.

"Ahem, can't be helped."

His disappointment couldn't be hidden, and Amy, feeling guilty, hurriedly added:

"It's not that I don't want to. Really. So..."

"I understand. I'm fine too."

As Shirone smiled reassuringly, Amy lowered her head shyly and asked while gauging his reaction:

"Should I go... brush my teeth and come back?"

Staring at Amy's cute questioning face, Shirone couldn't hold back his laughter and collapsed onto the bed.

Among the 30 students, no one thought they would be eliminated tomorrow.

No matter how the graduation class rankings were determined, upsets always happened, and everyone had prepared their secret weapon for passing.

"Strategic alliance?"

In the garden behind the graduation class building, Binder, Suabi, and Luman were gathered for a secret discussion.

"Right. You guys are utility types. My proposal shouldn't be bad for you."

Binder, who hosted the meeting, adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses as he spoke.

Though he barely made it to Class Two, he was an outstanding theorist who scored perfect marks in advanced class theory and had no trouble getting full marks in the graduation class omniscience implementation evaluation.

"As you know, I got perfect scores in basic magic of all categories. However, it's also true that I lack any special advantages."

Suabi and Luman listened attentively to his objective analysis.

"But if you help me, my balance could become the ultimate weapon. If Suabi's buffs focus only on me, and Luman creates situations with his crowd control abilities, I could face anyone in the graduation class."

Elkras Binder (Final graduation class ranking: 20th place).

Major: Omniscience branch of Magical Analysis.

Special notes: Master of 36 standard spells designated by the Association.

"Hmm, that makes sense."

While Suabi received it positively, Luman snorted.

"Do you honestly think that makes sense? That way, only you benefit in the end. When it comes to high-level competition, teams are bound to break up."

Though Luman had gained even more weight from binge eating over the year, his mind still worked quickly.

"Maybe so. That's why I want to make one proposal. If a situation comes where one of us three has to be eliminated, I'll be the first to give up on the exam."

This time even Luman had to think seriously.

"Hmm, so you'll take the risk along with monopolizing the utility users. But how can we trust your word?"

"There's no way to prove it. If you want, we can draw up a secret contract, but even that can't give 100% trust."

"That's exactly it. What if you backstab us?"

"That won't happen, but then I'd be branded a coward for life. Anyway, it's not a bad proposal for you either. This contract is possible because our weaknesses are perfectly complemented."

Binder would be the only one in the graduation class willing to volunteer for elimination first just to get utility support.

"I'll do it."

Suabi raised her hand first.

"Of the six graduation exam subjects, four are influenced by interpersonal combat ability. From my position as a utility user, I have nothing to lose by joining hands with Binder. We're strong in the remaining two subjects."

"Adding me would make it perfect."

If Binder and Suabi had already decided, then Luman joining the power concentration would maximize the synergy effect.

"Fine. Let's team up as three. But I have a condition. The person to be eliminated after Binder is Suabi. If that's not acceptable, I'll abandon this negotiation."

Though it was selfish, Luman's crowd control abilities were absolutely necessary since they could instantly reverse the tide of battle.

"Alright. I'll be second. But let me be clear—this is a strategy we're attempting under the premise that all three of us pass."

"Don't worry. I'm the only one with crowd control in the graduation class. Whether it's 15 vs 15 or 1 vs 29, I'll control the situation as desired."

Podran Luman (Final graduation class ranking: 16th place).

Major: Crowd control branch of Trap Magic.

Special notes: Binge eating. Outstanding situational judgment ability.

"Good. Then we're going with this. Let's make sure all three of our names are definitely included in tomorrow's passers."

By sunset, all 30 graduation class students had finished their final preparations.

The morning of graduation exam day dawned.

Students were waiting for their summons in their respective rooms, and the area in front of the large colosseum where graduation exams were held was already crowded with scout groups from various regions, advanced class students, and parents of graduation exam participants.

"Scouts, please enter first and take your designated seats!"

As the staff opened the western gate, 287 scout members dispatched from 65 countries under the Red Line began moving.

Most of the parents gathered here were prominent figures in the kingdom, but their eyes watching the scouts who would analyze their children's futures contained parental desperation.

Knowing this fact, the scouts also looked only straight ahead or reviewed the student profiles they had received in advance, keeping low profiles.

"Time is so fleeting. That troublemaker is already taking graduation exams."

A man who looked exactly like Iruki stepped out of a magnificent carriage.

The appearance of Mercodain Albino, head of the Thunder Dragon Corps, fixed everyone's attention.

"It's Mr. Albino."

It was quite shocking that the kingdom's brain had personally come to observe.

"If Mr. Albino came... could it be?"

"How could you say such a thing? It's not like Iruki caused that many accidents."

When Iruki's mother got out, attention focused on her in a different way from Albino.

A woman so beautiful it was hard to believe she was in her mid-thirties—Magellan Arganes, the kingdom's top actress.

The saying "humans resemble gods, but Arganes is more beautiful than gods" had become popular, and in terms of beauty, she was the woman representing the Tormia Kingdom and was already known worldwide.

"A goddess."

Everyone agreed with someone's unconscious exclamation that forgot even noble dignity.

"To see Arganes in person..."

Today was a historic day for the parents as well.
