The Great Purification (4)

As lightning-like flashes struck the 3,599 altars spread across the world, the earth shook violently.

As Nane's will seeped in and red light began leaking through the cracks between the bricks, chaos erupted among the occupation forces of each nation.

"Commander! The altars are attempting to open!"

His adjutant shouted, but the commander checked his map one final time before fastening his sword to his waist.

"How strange."

According to the guide from the Holy War involving the Three Emperors, Seven Kings, and Two Warlords, there should still be 23 hours remaining before the altars opened.

"Or perhaps this is only natural?"

The altars, built dozens of meters high, had been constructed so quickly that the kingdoms had no time to intervene.

History made in a single day.

Countless kingdoms had attempted destruction, but the result was always total annihilation.

Eventually, the matter had fallen into the hands of the Holy War.

'But the Holy War isn't truly supranational either. In the end, they too move for their own nations' interests.'

His adjutant reported.

"According to urgent intelligence, the Iron Kingdom made a final attempt to destroy an altar but failed. We've obtained evidence that their elite forces were annihilated last night."

It was none other than the elite forces of the Seven Kings.

"Report to the kingdom. Current time: 14:47. The altars are opening faster than expected."

The same reports were likely being submitted from countless countries, with the final gathering point being none other than the Holy War.

"Understood."

The altar's bricks began disintegrating as if they had lost gravity, and ominous light began spreading.

"Wh-what is that?"

As the landscape touched by that light transformed, a horrific world of organs, muscles, and bones revealed itself.

"Arus! De Mehach!"

As the veil was torn away, beings with melted eyelids and jagged, nail-like teeth came bursting forth.

The Arus, residents of the other world.

Meaning solitude, they were demons that used their sense of smell to devour everything around them.

"Aaaah! Run!"

As the light spreading from the altar rapidly engulfed the troops and Arus appeared right before them, the soldiers lost their will to fight.

"Damn it! Full retreat! Pull back to the 'guidelines'!"

The Holy War had informed nations worldwide of their response policy, and the radius they had measured was 2 kilometers away.

'Too late. They'll have complete control within 30 minutes.'

The demons were conquering the world.

Sad emotions welled up in Sirone's eyes as he looked down at the planet from the Earth Temple.

"In the end..."

This had happened because he couldn't stop it.

"It opened faster than expected. Amita's decision made Nane impatient."

Just as humanity knew Nane's intentions, Nane too could be assumed to know humanity's movements like the palm of his hand.

"Nane sympathizes with life, so he doesn't want to drag out time. He was aiming for the perfect moment with no room for counterattack."

"An acceleration of enlightenment."

"Yes. By my calculations, once the Kar value exceeds ten million decimal places, even Sirone will struggle to stop it."

Though it was a mere 1 percent at the ten-millionth decimal place, in the ultimate realm, this represented an enormous gap.

"The time to reach that point is roughly 48 hours. The Holy War probably made predictions based on such information, but they seem to have failed to properly calculate the variable that is the Council of Ten."

Amita's presence could be felt in how he could advance Buddha's resolved timing by over 20 hours.

"How long will it take?"

The thousands of red dots spread across the continent were rapidly expanding at a speed visible to the naked eye.

If this was the speed visible from space, imagining what people living on the ground were experiencing sent chills down one's spine.

"That red light is called a psychic sphere, which erases the barrier between the other world and the real world. In about a day, it will more than cover the entire planet."

"Is there a way to stop it?"

Taeseong shook his head.

"It's not something that can be physically destroyed. That's not matter—it's a system."

"The Akashic Records."

"Yes. Only beings with the highest authority can directly manipulate the Akashic Records. In biological terms, it's the law that operates in the realm of the tenth sense, the境 of the formless."

Ankera was a being with the tenth sense, and that authority had now been completely transferred to Nane.

"When the altars were constructed, Louver attempted to enter La Enemy's dream. But Louver too was a product of the Akashic Records. He was erased the moment he connected."

Because he was overwhelmed by authority.

"Therefore, to eliminate the altars, either Nane, who inherited Ankera's dream, must do it directly..."

Nane had destroyed one altar in the Iron Kingdom.

"Or we have no choice but to infiltrate and destroy them with a concept that doesn't exist in the Akashic Records."

"...I'm the one who has to do it."

"Yes. Only Sirone has deviated from the whole. Therefore, this is the first mission given to Sirone. Please seal the altars."

Sirone thought of the 3,599 altars.

"I can't make it in time. By the time the sealing is finished, there won't be anyone left alive."

"They will buy you time."

When Sirone looked puzzled, Taeseong displayed the scenery of a massive ice continent on the ceiling of the Earth Temple.

"These are people Sirone knows."

As the psychic sphere's radius rapidly expanded, 680,000 deaths occurred worldwide in just 10 minutes.

The problem was that while hidden by a veil, the other world and the real world used the same space.

In a situation where castle walls, ancient weapons, and any concealment facilities were useless...

"I approve the Zion Project."

18 minutes and 42 seconds after the altars opened, representatives of the Three Emperors, Seven Kings, and Two Warlords gathered at the Holy War signed the documents.

Those documents passed into the hands of Valkyrie's greatest information mage and crossed the continent at the speed of light.

"Miss Miro, approval has come through."

They were transmitted to Armin, the Eternal Contemplator, and handed over to Miro, Zion's representative.

"Too late! Politicians, honestly!"

To operate the sanctuary of law-users assembled with support from 48 countries worldwide, their help was necessary.

"Let's begin. The longer we delay, the greater the damage."

At Quan's words, Miro nodded and opened her mouth while directly facing Nane beyond the Antarctic continent.

"I will gather everyone's will. From now on, we will minimize the psychic sphere's domain as much as possible."

As torches ignited from the 700 totems arranged in two rows behind her, the icy land blazed like flames.

Ancient silence.

"..."

Between the two rows of pillars extending toward the continent, 37,000 law-users gathered from countries around the world stood in tight formation.

Looking up at Miro's face filling the ceiling of the Earth Temple, Sirone felt his heart swell with emotion.

'She didn't give up.'

Though Beron was gone, countless people still remained to oppose Nane.

"Did Miss Miro plan this?"

"Yes. When Ankera reset the world for the third time, she seems to have been the only one who foresaw it."

Hexa, created by Gauffin to prevent the world's reset, and the person who carried out that Hexa was none other than Miro.

"Of course, Estas's memories were erased along with Gauffin, but the circuit of insight still remains."

Ankera sought to become a god, but could never transcend the whole through mere repetition of resets.

"Only a being capable of closing itself can be a god."

Consequently, Miro's excessive caution had proven correct.

"The fiercer the resistance, the more the world will be driven to suffering, but this has bought us time."

Taeseong said, looking back at Miro.

"She's someone who protected the world from heaven's army for a full 20 years. In terms of defense, she's undoubtedly humanity's strongest. Even Nane won't find this easy."

Strength entered Sirone's clenched fists.

'We can still fight more.'

It was a fact he could be certain of precisely because it was Adrias Miro.

"Humans are not your exclusive property, Nane."

As the incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara filled the Antarctic sky, Miro raised both hands.

"Ooooooh."

As if conducting the law itself, following her gestures, countless monks seated in meditation behind her concentrated their consciousness.

Leaders from 984 sects had all gathered in one place: the Yorr Faith, the Karcis Order, monks from the Eastern Middle Heaven Cave called the ivory tower of the spiritual world.

'These are nearly all the good that exists in the world.'

Nane might not be evil.

"But that too is for us to define."

To activate the law's seesaw, it was proper to designate Nane as evil.

'It's shrinking.'

Sirone watched clearly from space as the psychic sphere's domain rapidly contracted.

'This is Adrias Miro.'

The teacher who had awakened him to life's meaning.

"Push just a little harder!"

Following Miro's instructions, the law-users moved in perfect unison, each strengthening their will.

Simultaneously, torches from the 700 totems exploded and ascended as massive pillars of fire.

Though the heat was enough to dispel even Antarctic cold, those already in deep meditation couldn't even feel it.

'Monstrous bastard.'

Fierce strength entered Miro's eyes.

'How can a human body be like this...'

Though she had to oppose Nane inevitably due to the law's seesaw, his will was so powerful that she felt awe despite everything.

'Right, you're closest to being a god. Go ahead and dominate everything!'

The torches were gradually weakening.

'Honestly, this is too much!'

The terror of psychic spheres lay in breaking down the barrier between the other world and real world that used the same space.

It meant that defensive structures built by humans lost their meaning, so the ground-level task of the Zion Project was to reduce the psychic sphere's domain to at least 1 kilometer or less.

'The boundary must not collapse.'

If it were merely holes being punched, even if demons invaded, humans could fight a human war in human territory.

"Damn it!"

Suddenly curses burst from Miro's mouth.

'Demons are not good.'

That's why they were called demons, but they too were beings of the other side created by humans.

"Miss Miro, you must forgive."

As Miro's mind wavered at the extreme of concentration, Armin urgently spoke to her.

"If you collapse, it's over."

Miro felt as if Armin's voice was coming from somewhere infinitely distant.

'Even when the world destroyed the Adrias family completely, I didn't waver. But this...'

Wasn't this too unreasonable?

'Why is suffering always the lot of the good?'

Armin shouted.

"Get a grip! Sirone has already forgiven everyone's sins. This is the one chance we gained from that!"

"Hrrrgh!"

Miro's sequence formula, which had hit a plateau in acceleration, began racing at a terrifying speed once again.

'Sirone, how were you able to forgive?'

Just as Nane's merit was wondrous, Sirone's universal love was equally wondrous.

'I can't lose to my student!'

Finally, as Miro's sequence formula surpassed 10 to the 64th power, reaching the realm of the inconceivable, the totems' flames pierced the sky.

"I absolutely will not lose."

As if rewinding time itself, the psychic sphere's domain was shrinking toward the point where it had first been born.

Psychic sphere radius: 17.4 kilometers.
