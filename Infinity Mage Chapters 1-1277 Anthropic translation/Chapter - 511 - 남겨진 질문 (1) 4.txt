[511] The Remaining Question (1)

"Urgh! How dare such lowly creatures... dare to do this to me... to me!"

The angels who had been hiding throughout Zebul under Ankh Ra's orders were helplessly defeated by Garas.

The Garas that had inherited the traits of Yamyeong's subordinates through the Physics Machine and the Garas currently attempting merciless reproduction with the angels were now completely different organisms.

They had undergone such tremendous evolution that it could truly be called a great explosion.

Leaving offspring in the bodies of angels, the highest-ranking organisms in Heaven, was the optimal choice for species preservation.

Their already strong desire for species preservation soared endlessly, causing their reproductive ability with all species except angels to disappear.

Garas's form, now craving only angels, had changed to resemble giant tadpoles, multiplying through cellular division.

Angels became impregnated with Garas's seed merely by physical contact, and even when eliminated by force, they would self-destruct to somehow transmit their genetic information.

"Rather than suffer such humiliation...!"

The angels chose self-annihilation, and their numbers gradually decreased as more made this choice.

"Kiiaaak!"

A swarm of Garas filling the corridor was burned away without a trace by the radiance emanating from Rayel, the Archangel of Light.

"Crack! Crararack!"

Satiel, the Archangel of Decomposition covering the rear, decomposed the last remaining Garas's body below the molecular level.

Though they knew there was absolutely no chance of Garas touching their bodies, the sight of them flying toward them was still chilling.

"Disgusting creatures. How dare they defile angels?"

"They're not called extraterrestrial quarantine species for nothing. Anyway, the situation is serious. We've already lost half our angelic forces."

Ankh Ra was waiting for Satan to be annihilated.

Having realized this fact, what the two archangels needed to do was keep as many angels alive as possible.

There was the matter of planning for the future, but if Satan's power grew any stronger, they wouldn't even be able to reset and it would be the end.

"How pathetic."

What angered them most was the fact that most angels were choosing annihilation.

'We were too arrogant.'

Recalling humanity's battles to find hope in despair, Satiel reconsidered the meaning of the nobility that symbolized angels.

Kuuuuung!

At that moment, a roar came from the gateway of Arabot that bordered Zebul.

Satiel's face crumpled as he looked down.

The rebels were advancing into Arabot.

"Advance! Advance! Victory is right before us!"

"Execute Ra!"

Though the rebels had seemed destined for defeat just an hour ago, the tide of war had turned dramatically.

As the angels annihilated themselves, their subordinate Maras disappeared.

Grasping that small spark of hope, the rebels broke through Arabot's walls.

'Hope is visible!'

Everyone's eyes burned with anger over lost comrades and determination to win the war.

But the rebels didn't know.

About the existence of God's punishment that was falling toward the center of Heaven even at this moment.

Time remaining until Heaven's destruction.

3 minutes 21 seconds.

Satan roamed around destroying all the buildings in Zebul.

Because he was so massive, there was no need to specifically target anyone.

Wherever he went became ruins and apocalypse.

"This is interesting."

The wretched world viewed from above, weak and pathetic beings that would crumble with just the touch of his foot.

"Kekeke. Kahahaha!"

Satan's laughter was more intense than thunder, and the atmosphere trembled as mountains, rivers, plants and trees all vibrated.

"How big are you planning to grow?"

Ashur, Icael's triangular Mara, was watching Satan's rampage together with giant legion commander Girsin.

"In terms of raw power, he already matches Ymir."

Moreover, since he was a being outside the law, there was nothing they could do until Ra's will activated.

Even Girsin didn't put on airs before Satan's might.

"He's certainly strong. I wouldn't be a match for him either. But..."

Girsin turned to Ashur and glared.

"Don't you dare compare him to that person's might."

Though Ashur's signal was powerful enough to upset the balance of the triangular Maras, for Girsin, the strongest was always Ymir.

True strength was strength where no relativity could exist.

In Heaven, only Ymir had reached that realm.

"Stand back. I'll handle this."

Etela blocked Miro's path as she approached Satan.

Miro's face, glimpsed stealthily, was bitterly cold, unlike her usual appearance.

"What? Got something to say?"

"Ah, I also..."

Etela hastily came to her senses but ultimately couldn't continue speaking.

Even the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara Thunder Strike couldn't even shock Satan's body.

Her will to crush any evil shattered to pieces before Satan.

Miro looked down at Etela's mangled fists.

A person's hands wouldn't reach that state without being swung with ultimate resolve.

"I don't intend to blame you. You can't fight with those fists anyway, can you?"

Etela bit her lips and swallowed her tears of frustration.

'What kind of follower of good am I? What kind of monk fighting for the world?'

The sense of powerlessness struck her as strongly as her firm beliefs.

Miro passed through the path Etela had opened.

She interlaced her fingers and pushed them outward, making cracking sounds from her shoulders and elbows.

As she cracked her neck left and right and approached within close range, Satan turned his head.

'What's this?'

Though his height pierced the sky making visual confirmation impossible at that distance, he could somehow clearly sense Miro's approach.

At this aura fundamentally different from Etela's, Satan's unrestrained malice blazed like fire.

"Kekekeke! What's this now?"

Kuuuuuuung!

When Satan stomped down with his sole, a 100-meter radius was devastated.

Sein, who had evacuated with Etela, quickly cleared the dust cloud with his Iron Wheel Eye.

"Where's Miro?"

When Miro wasn't visible, Sein expanded his Spirit Zone and his face suddenly turned pale.

"She's insane."

Through synesthesia, he sensed Miro's position was under Satan's sole.

"Hoh?"

When Satan lifted his foot with a puzzled expression, Miro's form was revealed, making hand seals with her right hand.

The sole that had stepped on Miro was dented, but compared to his massive body, it wasn't even painful.

"Amusing, human. How dare you oppose me, the incarnation of evil?"

"Amusing? This right now?"

Miro, who had been coldly glaring at Satan, relaxed her expression as if nothing had happened and sneered.

"No, what's really amusing is your ugly face."

Grrrrrrr.

A rough sound came from Satan's throat as he bared his teeth.

"Gahahahahaha!"

But the next moment, his anger turned to mad laughter, causing all humans on earth to cover their ears.

"A mere human!"

Satan, who had suddenly stopped laughing, glared at Miro with eyes blazing with fire.

It was the first moment that he, who had been rampaging through Zebul without restraint, showed killing intent toward a single target.

"We have to stop this!"

Sein grabbed Etela's shoulder as she tried to leap forward.

"Wait. Miro must have a plan."

"I know how strong Miro is. But scale magic won't work on Satan."

Satan was a being outside the law.

The only thing that could destroy that absolute chaos was a will powerful enough to change the law itself.

"You still don't know Miro well."

Sein looked back at Miro.

"She created dimensional walls to protect humanity. She was the only person who could do that. But Miro wasn't originally that kind of person. While Miro's spacetime might have been a great blessing to us, to her it was probably more like shackles."

Etela couldn't readily believe it.

Miro's spacetime was the ultimate that a scale mage could reach.

If even that realm was merely shackles, could such a being truly be called human?

"Then what kind of person is Miro?"

"To be honest, I don't know either. I don't know how to define that free-spirited woman."

Etela's face turned bewildered.

"But one thing is certain."

Sein looked at Miro, who was striking a three-curve pose with her pelvis pushed outward to emphasize her body's curves.

"The Miro I've experienced is someone who can do everything humans dream of."

Even before Satan's overwhelming physique, Miro wasn't intimidated at all and wore a relaxed smile.

"Huhu, let me show you my will again."

"Uoooooo!"

Satan roared toward her and raised his fist high above his head.

This time would be different.

If he crushed her with a punch using all his strength, even the great Miro would be nothing but a mere creature.

With that confidence, just as he was about to bring down his fist, Satan's movement flinched and his eyes widened.

A mystical aura was emanating from Miro's body.

The energy rippling like heat haze gradually condensed in the air, and finally an avatar began to materialize.

The avatar's face, tinged with a gentle blue light, looked peaceful with a childlike smile at the corners of its mouth.

Mental Transcendence

Prajna.

Etela muttered with a blank expression.

"Impossible."

The avatar's afterimage kept growing larger.

Growing, growing, endlessly growing in a manner that could be called expansion beyond mere enlargement.

The avatar rose to Satan's height.

Satan, who had been watching this in silence, slowly began to raise his head toward the sky.

Finally, Miro's avatar exceeded the limits of visual confirmation and escaped into outer space.

The final size it reached was approximately 128 times the size of a planet.

The entire sky was filled with Miro's avatar, visible from anywhere in the hemisphere.

"Ah, ahhh..."

Arius fell to his knees, shedding tears of emotion as he raised his hands toward Miro.

This was Miro.

Before her, any human became nothing but an insignificant existence.

The avatar of Avalokitesvara looking down upon the entire world.

This was why even Arius, called one of the seven great villains of the demonic path, willingly lowered himself to the status of a dog.

'I'll end this.'

As Miro released her three-curve pose and drew large circles with both hands, the giant avatar moved in the same motion.

When the avatar's arms, stretching from one end of the sky to the other, moved, the world seemed to ripple.

"Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara..."

Etela's voice trembled.

The avatar's two arms descending from overhead left and right were branching at each minimum unit of time, leaving afterimages.

The sight of countless afterimages trailing like tails as they surged toward Satan was the greatest enlightenment of her life.

'The avatar's power...'

Miro, concentrating her will with all her might, pressed her palms together and opened her eyes wide.

'Compress it into a single point!'

Prajnaparamita

Paradise Palm.

No sound, no smell, no form.

All Satan could guess was that 180 million palms were flying at him from left and right.

Realizing the serious crisis, Satan's eyes began to dart quickly left and right.

He didn't know what result awaited him, but even if it meant selling his soul, he didn't want to be hit by that technique.

'I must dodge!'

But where to?

The moment he realized this, strength drained from Satan's body.

"Damn it..."

Ddddddddd!

"Kraaaaaaah!"

When the avatar's palms collided with the planet between them, 180 million shock waves surged simultaneously.

Feeling the impact crushing his entire body, Satan trembled madly.

The intensity of the shock from the giant avatar compressed into a single point and striking was truly a sensation that could only be experienced at the world's end.

Each cell composing Satan's body swelled like balloons, and his red skin became bumpy like embossing.

His body, distorted so severely that it lost its original form, exploded with a pop and began to rapidly shrink.

"Kieeeeeee!"

An evil scream spread out as if tearing the sky apart.
