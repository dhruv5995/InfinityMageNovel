City of Magical Engineering (1)

"Welcome! Paromedon's Restaurant... Huh?"

Paromedon, the restaurant owner, looked at the two humans entering through the door.

No matter how he looked at them, they had human forms.

Most importantly, the moment he laid eyes on Shirone, a terrible sense of revulsion welled up from the depths of his heart.

"Yahweh?..."

Demons know.

From their pure demonic state, they know where their essence lies and what they reject.

The bustling restaurant fell quiet, and the gazes of the demons who had been eating focused on them.

"I'll get indigestion before I even eat."

Since there was nowhere in hell that would welcome Shirone anyway, shamelessness was a survival strategy.

"Table for two, please."

As they settled at a central table, Lian plopped down across from him with a thud.

The demons who had been watching Shirone turned their heads away at his attitude that said 'come at me if you dare.'

"How unlucky. Lost my appetite completely." The demons at a corner table stood up and walked to the counter, handing over their card.

"Boss, the check please."

Raviette was a city where credit loans through banking computerization had taken root.

Next to the counter was a human face with an open skull, the brain visible.

When they stuck the card between them, the person's eyeballs began spinning round and round.

Lian looked around the shop.

Intestine-like hoses led to the kitchen, from which the sound of a beating heart could be heard.

"Why is this stuff necessary? If it's just about making things, hell has stones and iron too."

"Because unpurified demons retain all the functions of living beings. Plus they don't decay."

Shirone explained.

"Biological bodies have various functions. For example, brains are used for computing, and eyes serve as lenses or become terminals for transmitting information."

When he pointed to an eyeball embedded in the table, a voice came from the ceiling.

"Boss! Take their order!"

"Of course there are cities that stick to traditional uses, but Raviette is hell's cutting edge. Functions developed here spread throughout hell."

"And the Grand Duke is at the center of it all?"

"Right. Probably functions incomparable to what they use here..."

Just then, Paromedon, having finished the payment, approached.

"You ruined my business today. Just order something. Eat quickly and get lost."

Shirone spoke in the language of the other world.

"Could you give us a menu, please?"

Blood vessels bulged in Paromedon's eyes, but Shirone just waited calmly.

"Yahweh, I'm in a really bad mood right now, got it? I'm warning you, just eat whatever."

"The menu, please."

Whether in hell or heaven, when eating a meal at a restaurant, one couldn't just choose carelessly.

"Tch!"

Paromedon headed to the counter and slammed two menus down on the table.

"Happy now?"

Shirone ignored him and looked over the menu.

"Hmm, so then..."

Considering Lian's stomach power, he picked a few things that seemed decent enough.

"Pumong, three servings of Garbancho, and a large Girinja please. Can you make it quickly?"

The menus were collected without an answer.

"Except for ogre-type demons, they don't eat human flesh, so you can relax. Though since these are ingredients that don't exist in reality, I'm not sure if they'll suit your taste."

Garbancho was an intestine salad, and Girinja was a steak as large as a horse's thigh.

After placing the food, Paromedon brought a bone cup to a mummified human face.

When he pressed the left eye, light green juice poured out of the man's mouth.

"Here, Pumong."

Despite the owner's cold treatment, their stomachs were ready to digest any food.

Cutting the Girinja into large pieces, Lian asked.

"By the way Shirone, do you have money? They're not going to give it to you free just because you're Yahweh, right?"

"Of course I do."

Shirone took out hell's currency, 'Death.'

"Where'd you get it?"

"I had it from the beginning. Gold coins from reality become chips with skulls drawn on them in hell. They call this Death."

"Money and death."

"There used to be a tradition of putting money in dead people's hands. They thought you had to pay the ferryman to cross the uncrossable river. Money was needed to die. That's the origin of 'Death.' Though now it seems to be printed by the Chemical Engineering Cooperative Central Bank."

The meat had a strong smell but the food was edible, and the Pumong was surprisingly sweet.

Just as they were finishing their plates, the door banged open and demons entered.

"There's a Yahweh here?"

It seemed the demons who had first seen Shirone and left the shop had spread the word on every street.

As he watched while sipping Pumong, a rhinoceros-like demon approached.

Pulling out the chair between Shirone and Lian and sitting down, he rested his chin on the table and spoke.

"Heh, it's true? Seeing you in person, you look disgustingly unlucky. What are you doing here right now?"

"Eating, obviously. Can't you see?"

"I can see. I can see very well. That's why I'm asking. Depending on your answer..."

The demon's fist on the table turned black, and mace-like spikes protruded from it.

"I might have to teach you a lesson." Creating a handkerchief with Material, Shirone calmly wiped his lips before turning his head.

"If you're thinking of using force, you know you'll have to handle the consequences yourself, right?"

"Keke!"

The demon raised both arms.

"Kahahaha! Just kidding, just kidding. You think I'd really fight Yahweh for real?"

The laughter stopped abruptly.

"But I don't like you. You get what I mean? Even tearing you apart wouldn't satisfy me."

Using his elbow as a lever, the demon raised his hand.

"How about arm wrestling? If you beat me, I'll let you stay in the city. If I win, you leave immediately."

Comparing hand sizes, it was like adult versus child, but what mattered more was ability.

'Hidden Code.'

The black energy that had produced mace-like spikes earlier was a product of magical engineering.

"Shirone, let me do it."

Though he couldn't understand the words, he wasn't so oblivious as to not grasp the situation.

Before Shirone could stop him, Lian moved seats and grasped the demon's thumb.

"Seems like you've got some strength. Come on then. My stomach's full anyway, so I'll work off some food while I'm at it."

"Keke, you'll regret this."

As the match was set, not only the customers but even Paromedon stopped working and approached.

"Alright! Single match! Victory goes to whoever's hand touches the table or the ground. No complaints?"

The demon nodded, and Lian, who couldn't understand, grinned widely.

"Start!"

The moment the word fell, both Lian's and the demon's bodies compressed like rocks as power was transmitted.

The table cracked from the start, but neither moved an inch from their position.

The demon's face flushed red.

"Graaah! Not bad!"

Feeling the power of Divine Transcendence flowing endlessly, the demon's arm turned black.

"Hyaaaah!"

Black spikes protruded again, mercilessly piercing through Lian's hand.

"Yes! That's it!"

The demons cheered, but Lian's eyes remained the same as before.

'He's strangely strong.'

Even division commanders of hell's army were no match for Lian in pure strength contests.

Shirone was finally certain.

'As I thought... it's not physical strength. That demon has some special code applied to him.'

In reality, the demon's strength was only at brigade commander level by hell's army standards.

'Keke, demonic substance, Desire.'

Something the Grand Duke had ambitiously developed - a substance that physically manifested the power of desire.

'Originally His Grace told me to experiment on Yahweh, but it doesn't matter. After I crush this guy...'

As the demon's fist grew blacker, Lian's arm began to bend back little by little.

"Yahweh! Your turn!"

At the same time, power entered Lian's eyes.

'Divine Transcendence.'

As incomparably massive power surged in, the demon's face turned pale.

"Wh-what!"

Cracks appeared in the demon's blackened arm, then it exploded like a shell with a bang.

Following the crunching sound, the demon's elbow bent backwards grotesquely.

"Aaaaah! My arm! My arm!"

As he rolled on the floor clutching his elbow, the demons clicked their tongues.

"Tch! What a letdown."

As those feeling disgusted by the defeat returned to their seats, Shirone asked Lian.

"How was it?"

"...Incredibly strong. Something's strange about it."

Bending down, Shirone picked up the black shell that had fallen to the floor and examined it.

It was hardened enough to crumble with just a little force, and didn't seem to have any special functions.

'Single-use, or function destroyed.'

Shirone asked the demon with the broken arm.

"Who sent you? Tell me honestly. This isn't something an ordinary demon would carry around."

"I don't know. I don't know anything!"

"Fine, I won't ask."

Trying to get an answer by any means would paralyze the entire city.

"Instead, tell whoever sent you this: I received the declaration of war loud and clear. If you don't send word by tomorrow evening, then the city you built might be destroyed."

The demon's repeated nodding confirmed that the Grand Duke was behind it.

"Let's go, Lian."

When Shirone paid for the food, Paromedon counted the Death with a sour expression.

"What about the property damage?"

"We don't know whose fault it is yet. We'll know by tomorrow evening. I'll come back then."

"No need."

Paromedon bared his teeth as he spoke.

"Drop dead in sewage."

As they headed into the city listening to curses, word had already spread and the residents' expressions weren't good.

Shirone said.

"It'll be hard to walk around anymore. Let's find a place to rest first. The Grand Duke will contact us tomorrow."

"Will it be okay? Obviously, but judging by today alone, they don't seem to have good feelings toward you."

"That's exactly why I want to meet him. That substance from earlier, it's probably still experimental. If it gets supplied to hell's army..."

"Hmm, I see."

Shirone and Lian found lodging nearby.

"No chance of sleeping comfortably."

In a space covered with reproductive organs of various creatures, it was hard to even breathe.

"Let's get some sleep for now. It's better to wait here until the Grand Duke comes."

While they slept with the lights on, Raviette's temperature dropped exponentially.

Whooooooo!

Amid the sound of frigid wind that sounded like wailing ghosts, Shirone slowly opened his eyes.

Lian was already awake.

"Shirone, someone's here."

Though he sensed the presence outside the lodging, the uninvited guest's voice came from inside the room.

"I apologize for visiting so late."

The wall distorted and a one-eyed demon wearing glasses entered and bowed.

"I am called Bielmann. I've come to apologize for what happened during the day and to invite you both."

"Did the Grand Duke send you?"

Even to this pointed question, Bielmann answered with a relaxed smile.

"I'd like to say 'you'll know when you see,' but... Yes, Grand Duke Magritt is calling for you."

'Faster than expected.'

He wanted to find meaning in this, but couldn't guess the Grand Duke's character from this alone.

"Very well. Please lead the way."

In the cold where even the air seemed frozen, a luxurious carriage waited for them.
