Black Shadow â‘´

The crevice that split the Wailing Wall in two was so narrow that it couldn't even be seen from a distance, but when they actually approached it, the width turned out to be quite substantial at 20 meters.

"Haa. Haa."

People who were merely breathing.

"Excuse me, sir. Water. Could you give me some water?"

People pleading for help.

Rian showed no reaction to any of it, simply walking forward in silence.

And when neither the path they'd entered nor the way out was visible anymore, he spoke for the first time.

"Sirone, what are these?"

Or should he call them 'things'?

"Those who couldn't be purified."

Sirone watched as countless hands and feet protruding from the Wailing Wall writhed about.

"The Wailing Wall isn't just here. It's spread throughout various parts of the otherworld. If we're talking about reality, think of it as a warehouse needed for civil engineering projects."

"A warehouse? Are you saying humans are materials?"

"There's an entity called Black Shadow. Actually, it's more like a system. It's the aggressive attack form of the purification system, responsible for capturing creatures that fall into this place."

"Are you saying they stacked humans here? Why? According to what you said, they should be purifying them, shouldn't they?"

"Hell is the reverse side of reality. The properties are opposite, but just like reality, many things are needed to survive. In reality, there are organic and inorganic materials. Organic materials are used as food, and inorganic materials become materials for countless structures."

Rian understood.

"Hell is the opposite of that."

"Right. The food of demons is Ma born from hellfire - that is, refined demons. It might sound like they're eating their own kind, but not all demons are the same. Humans are living beings too, but they eat chickens and pigs. Same with rice and wheat."

Sirone pointed at the wall.

"Conversely, what serves as minerals in hell are unpurified Ma - that is, human turbid emotions in their raw form. But since minerals are often needed in large quantities when necessary, a special warehouse was required..."

"And that became the Wailing Wall."

"Right. With this scale, it'll probably be mobilized for dam construction on the River of Fire or city expansion projects. I hear there are separate subcontractors that process and transport the Wailing Wall..."

Sirone shook his head.

'That's enough explanation about the structure. It's too harsh a truth for Rian.'

To Sirone, who encompassed both reality and the reverse side simultaneously, the Wailing Wall was just a system, but Rian was different.

"More importantly, what we need to watch out for is Black Shadow. They'll be bringing fugitives captured from various parts of hell, and they're definitely here too. Of course, given the massive scale, the probability of running into them is low."

In terms of reality, it was about the probability of meeting a manager in a large logistics warehouse.

Rian's eyes sharpened as he spoke.

"No need to worry. Black Shadow or whatever - if they show up, I'll just cut them down."

It wouldn't be easy.

'Black Shadow's chains are the hidden code with the strongest binding power in the otherworld. Even though he broke Gehenna's chains...'

While he was lost in thought, an old woman's voice came from the left wall where Rian was walking.

"Please save me."

Rian had been trying not to look as much as possible, but he couldn't overcome the desperate voice.

When he turned his head, he saw an elderly person with face and both arms protruding like horn shapes, crying.

"It's too painful. Please get me out of here. I'm begging you like this. Please..."

"Sirone."

Even before hearing Rian's words, Sirone answered.

"It's impossible."

"Is there absolutely no way? For example, if we purified the wall with Gehenna's chains..."

Sirone shook his head.

"Rian, listen carefully. Those here aren't humans from reality. They're their emotions."

"I know that. But they're asking for help. Is there anything more important than that?"

That was the kind of person Rian was.

"Of course there isn't."

That's why he was a friend to be respected, but Sirone knew precisely about human emotions.

"It's different from when you purified hellfire. That was a pure crystal of Ma. It would burn you along Gehenna's chains, and you could overcome it. But these are still unpurified, turbid Ma. If you were to thrust Gehenna's chains here..."

Sirone spoke with a troubled expression.

"All their emotions would be transmitted to you. You might even lose yourself in the process."

Even so, it was Rian's nature to do it, but he would probably bend his stubbornness at this point.

"...I see."

Because he wouldn't want to do anything that would put Sirone in danger.

'I'm sorry, Rian.'

Even knowing this fact, Sirone felt frustrated that he had no choice but to do this.

"Please... save me. Show me mercy."

Sirone, who had been taking in the old woman's desperate appearance for a moment, turned his head away.

"Let's go. If we want to get out of the Wailing Wall today, we need to walk without rest."

Just as Rian was about to follow behind Sirone after turning his gaze away from the wall, a fierce wind blew.

A turbid voice mixed with the wind could be heard.

Foolish sinners.

Looking up at the sky, they could see something that looked like black clouds passing by rapidly.

"It's Black Shadow."

The moment those words ended, both Sirone and Rian pressed their backs against the wall and hid.

'There are quite a lot of them.'

Even though they were looking through a 20-meter-wide crevice, the sky was covered with black clouds.

Rian asked.

"I agree with avoiding unnecessary danger, but are they really that powerful?"

In case of an emergency, it would be better to assess the enemy's strength before facing Black Shadow.

"It's a matter of the system. Their chains exert tremendous binding power on unpurified Ma."

"Hmm..."

Just as Rian was frowning, a skeletal arm reached from behind and wrapped around his throat.

"Here..."

It was the old woman who had asked Rian for help just moments ago.

"They're here! The fugitives are here!"

The sound right next to his ear was painful, but the emotion that arose first was confusion.

'Why?'

As if mocking Rian's heart, countless faces embedded in the wall began to scream.

"Two of them are hiding! Quickly! Quickly!"

The voices continued to relay, climbing up the wall until they finally reached the sky.

Then the black clouds entered the crevice and descended toward Sirone and Rian at a terrifying speed.

"Let's dodge, Rian!"

Rian tore off the old woman's arm and charged forward.

"Here! Here!"

Countless fingers on the wall waved toward them, and screams flew through the air.

"They're going this way! Catch them quickly!"

Rian, who had caught up beside Sirone, asked.

"Why are they reporting us? Do they get released from the Wailing Wall if they make contributions to Black Shadow?"

"No, they're treated like minerals in hell. Liberation is absolutely impossible."

"Then what's the reason?"

The reason these beings reported them to Black Shadow.

In Sirone's mind, there was only one possibility.

"Because they want us to be unhappy."

"What?"

"There's nothing that helps them. They just hate that we're in a better state. So they're desperately trying to drag us down. To make us experience the same misery."

Those who had seemed too weak to even open their eyes just moments ago were now shrieking at the top of their lungs.

"Here! I said here!"

Listening to their voices, Rian calmly settled the flame in his chest.

'Don't think about it.'

They are just them.

'Protect Sirone. Just keep that single thought lodged in my head and move accordingly.'

Black Shadow was coming.

Tattered cloth fluttered, and white faces flashed through the darkness.

'Skulls? No, the problem is the cloaks they're wearing. I can't read their movements.'

Material that didn't exist in the world.

It was a physical transformation as if the three states of gas, liquid, and solid were mixed simultaneously.

Foolish sinner.

"Rian! Now!"

Black Shadows that had blocked the front and back of the path pulled black chains from their cloaks with a swoosh.

At the same time, Sirone and Rian flew upward, and Rian ascended by stepping on the wall.

Kwaaaaang!

Looking down, black chains were embedded in the wall in spider web-like complex patterns.

Unpurified one, you shall face trials.

As something wriggled and was sucked along the chains, the eyes of the people forming the wall widened.

"Kuk! Kkeuk..."

Shortly after.

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

The entire wall vibrated as tremendous Ma energy was sucked into Black Shadow's body.

Capture the sinner!

At the roar surging from below, Rian's face contorted as he sprinted vertically.

"Keuuuu!"

The Wailing Wall was truly high - even though he was leaping at nearly flying speed, the end was nowhere in sight.

Yahweh! Why do you disturb hell!

Meanwhile, Sirone, who had escaped to the opposite wall, flew upward while dodging Black Shadow's chains.

Reaching the top of the wall faster than Rian, Sirone landed on ground that was muddy like a swamp.

People were half-buried, and tiny human figures continued to fall from the black clouds in the sky.

Twenty-four Black Shadows that had followed Sirone, stirring up fierce winds, floated in the air.

'Light of Agape!'

As Sirone widened his eyes, a brilliant sphere of light floating above his head exploded.

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

When the light faded again, a huge, shallow depression had been carved around Sirone.

'As expected, it doesn't work.'

The human wall was crushed as if melted by heat, but the power was smaller compared to demons.

Because it wasn't pure Ma.

'And Black Shadow is...'

Wrapped in black chains that were clearly hidden code abilities, they were perfectly fine.

"Yahweh."

The Black Shadow that uttered the voice withdrew its chains and spread its liquid-like cloak wide.

The figure of a skull holding a scythe was revealed.

"In this world where everyone rejects you, just where are you wandering?"

"I came to meet the administrator of this world. If you let me pass easily, I won't make things complicated."

"...The reason?"

"To eliminate the demon realm in reality. Countless humans are dying because of the codes you created."

Black Shadow bowed its head.

"The words always sound plausible. But Yahweh, do you know? Human death is precisely..."

Numerous Black Shadows that had arrived following behind simultaneously scattered and pounced on Sirone.

Our life.

The movements of Black Shadow, hidden in black cloaks, were completely outside the laws.

'Chaos.'

Incalculable.

Watching the fluttering of the cloaks, it seemed rather that space itself was rippling along with Black Shadow.

We shall purify you.

The moment black chains shot forth with slithering sounds, Sirone's body twisted.

What?

Hundreds of chains failed to hit their mark and passed by Sirone.

'Quantum movement.'

The algorithm wielded by the world's strongest mage was as bizarre as hidden code.

Do not be careless. That one is Yahweh.

Black Shadows began circling around and wrapping Sirone tightly with black chains.

At the same time, Black Shadows that had driven chains into the rooftop activated purification code.

Uooooooo!

It was a scheme to neutralize by combining Sirone's Agape with human turbid emotions.

It's coming! It's coming!

In the eyes of Black Shadow, who raised its head in ecstasy at Yahweh's love, the Hand of God appeared.

The moment the giant sphere of light vibrated, Sirone's voice could be heard from inside the chains.

"Photon Cannon."

A vertical flash struck the right rooftop of the Wailing Wall.

"Eoeoeoeo! Eoeoeoeo!"

As the outer wall swelled like a balloon, the people forming the wall showed expressions of horror.

"No! No...!"

And finally, with the explosion, light began leaking from over 3,000 holes.
