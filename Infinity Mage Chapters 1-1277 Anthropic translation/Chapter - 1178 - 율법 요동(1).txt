The Law's Upheaval (1)

Shirone mulled over Curtis's words.

"So it's a kind of system destruction."

"Right. Some criminals hated Melkidu. Crime only has value when it's actually a crime. If you can commit any act and be found innocent, psychopaths get bored quickly."

Curtis extinguished his cigarette.

"So what methods are there to distinguish yourself here? Attack the system. They went to prison and figured out ways to escape. Melkidu boasts an ancient history, so every possible method must have been applied. That's how they discovered it - the mission hidden in the system."

"Bribing the guards."

"Right. The method was surprisingly simple. In certain areas of the inner track, there are back doors - shops run by dark forces. They're not visible on the surface, but if you pay something through that route, you can bribe the guards."

Shirone's group fell into thought.

"I don't know why such a method exists. It could be a system error, or it might contain some intention of the original designer. I think it's the latter. If they're bold enough to put up a sign calling it a murderer's sanctuary, they must know murderers' nature inside and out. They surely knew there would be people who'd pull this kind of stunt."

Pena spoke up.

"I don't know if I should interrupt... but if you bribe the guards, can you reach the core?"

"I can't know that far. Even if you buy the key with 10 billion points, I don't know if you can reach the core. If someone knew that, it wouldn't be an unsolved case."

'Record erasure, perhaps.'

While Shirone was lost in thought, Curtis continued.

"Once you connect with the dark organization, you can ignore most of the system. Then there's no need to follow Melkidu's rules to reach the core. What do you think? Doesn't it seem promising?"

They couldn't deny it.

"Do we have to go bankrupt?"

"The information I obtained after all my tracking is this: To activate the bribery program, you must extract someone imprisoned. The required points are at least 50 million. Also, there's a dark organization doing business on the inner track that's connected to the guards. And don't worry about my points. I'm already..." Curtis sighed.

"Almost bankrupt anyway."

Pena looked at him and blinked.

"Really? You were doing pretty well."

"How do you think I got this high-level information? I've been going around for 2 years in this place's time. Still, 10 billion points is far off. Then I came across some trivial information, and my detective's instinct said 'this is it.' I've been digging deeper since then."

"It's a difficult method to attempt," Iruki said.

"Most people here are criminals. To carry out a bribery, two people or two teams need to move, but it's hard to build trust easily. Plus, it's a structure where one side has to go bankrupt."

Nade added.

"The mission difficulty is different too. It's not fighting system-created non-players, but directly competing with the system itself. Plus, if you can't reach the entrance to the inner track, you have to go around the outer track at least half a lap. That's enormous time."

Curtis agreed.

"That's why I came to you. While gathering information, I heard about you guys too. Your mission clear speed is incredible. You should be able to solve the inner missions."

"What do I need to do?" Pena asked.

"There must be a reason you called me too, right?" When she was frantically ordering food, he thought she really had no thoughts at all.

"Well, when I go bankrupt, I'll go to prison. There I'll go through trial and be moved to another location. The size of the prison will differ depending on how serious the crimes I've committed are. Track me down and then relay the information to these guys."

"In short, a contact person."

"Right. Meanwhile, you guys solve the mission on the inner track. Oh, and if you have points left over, it's good to strengthen your dice. When dealing with dark organizations, dice will be more important than points."

"You mean we might have to fight?"

"Ah, you've never been to the inner track? On the outer track, points are king, but on the inner track, dice are king. And the dark organization is on the inner track. It won't hurt to prepare in advance."

"Got it. So where do we go now? Attacks between users are prohibited here."

"Melkidu is a space for fugitives. It's impossible to track targets with any item. You have to rely solely on dice probability. However, as an exception, you can go to spaces without missions using designated items."

Curtis pulled out a card.

"Movement item, Royal Capital Entry. It'll transport you to Parmae, called Melkidu's capital. It's the largest and most prosperous city. There's an active market where users trade unnecessary goods or items with each other."

"There must be many people."

"Right. Honestly, those who've given up on entering the core sometimes do business here. With Crime Points, you can commit any crime you want."

Iruki asked.

"Is there an item that comes to Vital too?"

"Of course. You don't think I waited for you by some miraculous probability, do you? Movement item, Murderous Intent's Beginning. I don't have it now since I used it, but it's as expensive an item as Royal Capital Entry. The problem is how to meet up with you guys..."

"One in four times."

Shirone also disclosed necessary information.

"When I roll dice, I can control the numbers. That means I can go to the square I want."

Curtis and Pena were stunned.

"...What are you talking about?"

There didn't seem to be a need for a long explanation.

"It's that kind of ability. It's free in gambling halls or when receiving rewards, but I need to use Crime Points for movement."

"Hmm, so it's magic. How many points does it roughly consume to use once?"

"300,000."

"What?"

Pena's eyes widened.

"That's impossible! Are you blowing up an entire village? The biggest points I've heard of were 100,000."

"Uh, that's... it's somewhat difficult magic. Anyway, that's not what's important."

For the first time showing emotion, she corrected her expression.

"Ahem, that's true though. Well... it's not like I've never seen magic of that level."

Her voice was trembling.

Meanwhile, Curtis was equally surprised, but he was more overwhelmed by the ability's efficiency.

'In Melkidu, dice are everything. No item can manipulate dice numbers.'

Therefore, it's system-destructive.

"I've decided."

Curtis said.

"Time will be drastically shortened. You guys don't need to follow us. First, strengthen your dice on the inner track. With your abilities, you could probably go around all 468 squares of the outer track at once. If you use items, that is."

Because they could set dice numbers to maximum and doubles would apply.

Curtis looked at Pena.

"Meanwhile, you and I go to Parmae. When I get transported from there, track me with dice. You scout for prison bribery contacts. Then meet up with these guys."

"But where should we meet? I only have one Royal Capital Entry card too. Once I leave, that's it."

"Anywhere we can make contact is fine. Why not decide on Vital here?"

"Hmph! I've never even bought something like Murderous Intent's Beginning. I came here with dice, you know. I had a feeling I was lucky, so I put my hopes on gambling..." She didn't want to think about it.

"Still, you must have other movement cards, right? A thorough person like you wouldn't have failed to prepare an escape route?"

"I do have one, but..."

She pulled out a card and made a crying face.

"This thing. Loss of Will."

Even without knowing the content, the sewer-like background and the picture of screaming figures said it all.

"This is maddening."

Curtis explained.

"Loss of Will is a garbage dump. The most backward place in Melkidu... no, it's just a garbage dump."

"I see."

"Other than being able to escape in urgent situations, there are no advantages. Of course, that's also a tremendous advantage, but the problem is you can't leave voluntarily. You have to roll dice once a day and stay there until you get doubles."

Pena added.

"You know why it's a garbage dump? Because the people living here are garbage. Just one day there would drive you crazy. When you guys come, you might see me at a restaurant table."

Iruki asked.

"Then why did you buy such an item?"

"Because it was cheap."

"Are Crime Points a joke? For the price of one Murderous Intent's Beginning, you can buy three Loss of Will cards!"

Curtis intervened.

"Let's set aside problems we can't solve and check each other's routes now. First, the capital's location is..."

The route planning was completed as new information was written on Shirone's group's map.

Pena looked dejected.

"Sigh."

"Don't be like that. I have to go to prison. A garbage dump is rather like heaven."

"Yeah, yeah, I'll definitely put in a good word for you."

Shirone said.

"Ms. Pena, if you need anything, please let me know. I'll get it from the shop. We have to work together now."

"Hehe, why are all the people Curtis knows like this? You know what I hate most? Sincere sympathy. I can get equipment myself."

It was quite unexpected.

"But Ms. Pena, how did you enter Melkidu? It should only respond to the strongest negative energy, so what kind of fraud record do you have..."

"Fraud! Absolutely not. If there's one sin I have, it's probably the beauty God gave me."

At Shirone's group's dumbfounded expressions, she straightened her expression and rested her chin on the table.

"I just loved. When men talked to me, I talked back, and when they bought me nice things, I accepted them. Well, it was good then. A woman like me could receive this kind of love too. But it turned out..."

She smiled broadly.

"All the men who treated me so well were either married or already taken."

They could roughly guess.

"Wives came to pull my hair, threatened me, and finally ended up suing me. Among numerous charges, they specifically chose fraud. I guess they thought if I became a fraudster, all the love I shared with that person would become lies too."

Pena lifted her chin and said.

"I didn't even appeal. I didn't have the money for it, and in cases like this, the sentence isn't that long anyway. Honestly, the scariest thing wasn't going to prison, but the sudden change in the men's attitudes. Were they always such cold people?"

Curtis remained silent.

"Then I got caught up in something big. It must have been someone very high up. Forget suing and whatnot, they just tried to kill me. While running away from those knife-wielding people, I ended up here."

Pena gathered her food.

"Still, I like Melkidu. Since everyone suspects each other, I don't need to feel betrayed, and since everyone here is bad anyway, I feel like a normal person here too. Hehe!"

All Shirone could say was this.

"I'll come as quickly as possible."

"Right. You have to get out of Melkidu. Don't worry too much. I may not look it, but I'm good at dealing with people."

After leaving the restaurant, they faced each other at Vital's deserted entrance.

Curtis pulled out a card.

"You need to keep at least 50 million points. I'll send detailed schedules through Pena."

After the two left, Shirone said.

"Let's depart too. First, we enter the inner track and strengthen our dice."

"Good. We earned like dogs, so let's spend like dogs. Is it my turn this time?"

Nade, who had been rolling the Crime Dice on his palm, threw it forcefully into the air.

4 and 4 - doubles.

"Yes! Did you see that? My skill is amaziiiiing...!"

Their bodies moved at the speed of light.
