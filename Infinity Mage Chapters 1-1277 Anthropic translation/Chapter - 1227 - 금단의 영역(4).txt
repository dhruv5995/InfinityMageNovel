Forbidden Territory (4)

Uriel questioned back.

"Longing... you say?"

Asriker recalled the history of heaven.

"You could have ended the war. When Ikael took your side. Only you could have ended it. But you didn't annihilate Ikael. Even though angels are reborn from the sun as pure spiritual beings as long as their concept exists."

"You could destroy Ikael, but you couldn't destroy your longing for Ikael. That's why Kariel was so obsessed, and why you remained silent, isn't it?"

"What are you trying to say?"

"Archangel of Destruction who cannot destroy, you are more human than Kariel. And you can still end this war. Don't be played by God's providence."

"That might be so."

Uriel didn't deny it.

"But even if I fight God, what would change? Wouldn't that just be me being played by you?"

"You love Ikael."

Even within the abyss, Uriel's presence could be felt.

"That is love. That emotion you deny to the end, and still endlessly agonize over even now, is love. Different from Kariel's love, directed only toward her..."

As the Judicial Halo Ragnarok concentrated, the darkness scattered and Uriel revealed himself.

"Soul Dragon, do not mock me."

At this moment, he was the Archangel of Destruction who could end all wars in an instant.

"Or you could just say no."

Is that so?

Uriel had never thought that the Archangel of Destruction could love someone.

Because such a function shouldn't exist.

"I am—"

He wanted to say no, but Uriel ultimately couldn't utter those short words.

"Do you think Ikael doesn't know?"

Asriker said.

"Because you deny it yourself, others pretend not to know. Probably someone is watching for your vulnerability."

A woman came to mind.

'Miro.'

So that's why she, the Gwanyin of the Extremes, turned his insides upside down every time they clashed?

"The Mudeungpyeong said this: When Uriel can purely destroy, he will end the war. Just accept it already. That is your true battle."

The effects of Abyris's Breath, the shadow of the abyss, gradually faded and the landscape was revealed.

The forest swept by the Wrath of White Bones was withered as if exposed to radiation.

Uriel extinguished Ragnarok.

"I won't agonize."

Wings of light spread out.

"If God is trying to use me, I'll just destroy God and establish a new one. If longing holds me back, I'll destroy even that."

Leaving those words behind, he flew away as a flash of light, leaving only the majestic vibration's echo behind.

Asriker lowered his gaze and murmured.

"...How stubborn."

Well, it was because he was that stubborn that Ikael relied on him despite knowing everything.

"Now then."

Asriker stood up.

"Resume the war."

The 11 apostles waiting in the sky also confirmed that the shadow of the abyss was lifting.

A considerable number of fairies had aged and vanished, and the angels also had exhausted faces.

Light Dragon Phaethon said.

"We blew away the forest but it's effective. What do you want to do? Keep attacking with breath? Or..."

Poison Dragon Poine said.

"Don't reveal all our cards at once. It doesn't seem like this war will end like this. What are we missing?"

Qi Dragon Argan asked.

"Does there have to be something like that? It feels like we're assuming we can't win."

Blitz said.

"That's the kind of battle this is. The outcome of this war will be changed by the Messiah, not us. But there's no special variable yet. Just thinking we'll win by fighting well is dangerous."

The 12 apostles watched the forest in silence.

'What are we missing?'

As the shadow of the abyss lifted, elves and fairies were fighting again in the vast wasteland.

"Huff! Huff!"

One elf woman who escaped from the rotten swampland crawled on the ground with her filthy body.

"Please, save me!"

"Erin!"

One of the elves shooting arrows at the fairy troops recognized her.

"Cover me!"

The elf charged forward with his bow and grabbed Erin's arm, dragging her into the allied position.

"What happened? We thought you were dead!"

Erin shed tears.

"I was dragged to Crown's barracks. I should have died, but Grid for my sake... Ah, ahhh!"

The elf who knew their relationship didn't ask further and embraced Erin.

"It's okay. Calm down first. Let's report to Lord Enox."

As Erin was helped into the forest by the elves, her expression momentarily turned cold.

'Hmph, finally meeting him?'

The 12 apostles looking down at that scene from the sky merely turned their gaze away indifferently.

'What's happening in this forest?'

No one knew.

Sein, as well as Shadow and Light, looked at the man who appeared through an unknown body.

"Argones?"

The origin of the first humanity Gaia, the dragons before that, and all life that existed before them.

Baal approached with cold eyes.

"Yeah, I've heard of him even in hell. But they say administrators move independently of human purposes."

Taeseong was also puzzled.

'Why?'

According to cosmic mechanics, the two were set as a married couple, but their ways of thinking were different.

'I'm a program that protects humanity. But he... already tried to make humans extinct once.'

Because they invaded God's domain.

'Perhaps... to protect humans?'

Taeseong shook her head.

'That can't be. For me, humans are a unique result, but he can create life in any realm.'

That was why Taeseong had maternal love for humanity.

'But...'

It was also Argones who gave the first human the name Gaia, and who forgave that Gaia at Taeseong's plea.

Baal said.

"Unlike Lethe, you two have a complementary relationship. Are you planning to protect Taeseong?"

"Yes."

"Huh?"

Taeseong blinked.

"If the planetary program goes wrong, it affects me too. Above all, I can't be defeated by mere creations. Especially not by someone like you who doesn't even recognize their parents."

"That's hard to accept."

Baal's brow furrowed.

"What you created are humans, not us. Well, demons came from human emotions, so they're about grandchildren level, but that doesn't make you superior to Lethe."

"Why did you come?"

Taeseong couldn't believe it straightforwardly.

"You said you wouldn't interfere in human affairs. Wasn't it decided to give them a chance?"

She was more afraid of the Cell Buster that Argones would cause than her own annihilation.

"It's not a human problem. Neither the Drimo Program nor the Shadow World Program can currently perform their normal duties. At this rate, the balance of the five systems will collapse."

Argones turned his head.

"I'll give you one last chance. Return to Lethe. We'll handle things here ourselves."

"Hehe."

Murderous intent gleamed in Baal's eyes.

"As if that would happen?"

As much as his chest throbbed from Argones' strike, he felt good.

Having reached an unprecedented level in demon history, he naturally wanted to test his abilities.

'The world's end. It seemed like it would end too easily, which was disappointing.'

Fortunately.

'I can swing properly now.'

The next moment, Baal and Argones charged simultaneously, and the outer wall of the ivory tower scattered like dust.

"Graaah!"

Everything except Taeseong and Sein's group, who were fixed by law, was being destroyed.

Sein thought.

This was probably the battle of the world's end.

"Administrators aren't much either."

Argones, whose upper body was diagonally severed by Gangui's sword, stood on his hands with his remaining arm.

Then that arm transformed into legs, and before long, up and down were reversed and he regained his original form.

Baal rested his sword on his shoulder.

"As expected, you can't be killed?"

Unlike Miro, Argones, who could infinitely multiply cells, was a true immortal.

"But I won. There's no point in continuing to face an unkillable enemy—it's just annoying."

That was also true.

Baal, who twisted his waist with all his might, gripped the sword handle with both hands and said.

"I am the pinnacle of demons."

It was a strike that could cut down not only Argones but also Taeseong and Sein's group all at once.

"Stop."

A familiar voice.

Taeseong and Sein's expressions changed, and blood vessels began to rise in Baal's pupils.

"Grrrr."

Even imitating a swordsman, he was ultimately a demon.

"Yahweh."

Baal's face, contorted toward the center with torn lips, was a demon itself.

Sein couldn't believe it.

"S-Sirone."

Covered in demon blood, this wasn't the Sirone he had seen recently.

"Hehe, so you came too? How frustrating. In the end, you couldn't protect anything. And that demon blood. After all, you're just a human..."

"Shut up."

Sirone said curtly.

"Don't talk to me."

Half of Baal's body was completely crushed.

When he returned to normal, he was already flying away at tremendous speed.

Baal drew out Gangui to brake.

"Graaah!"

But his body didn't stop, and instead, crushing pressure that seemed to destroy his body rushed in.

"Argh!"

Thus he became a star in the sky.

"...Ahhhhh!"

Shortly after, he returned at tremendous speed and cursed Sirone through his blood-spitting mouth.

"Abominable Yahweh!"

"No."

Probably Baal should have stayed calm.

"Even if I'm an abominable existence as you say, even if I'm just a hypocrite..."

Having his pride in reaching the pinnacle of demons broken would have been unpleasant.

"You have no right to say such things."

He shouldn't have returned without understanding how he took that first blow.

"Photon Cannon."

What was born was a single small photon.

And when he loaded it with mass and fired it at 99.9999 percent of light speed.

'What?'

He wouldn't feel anything.

"Argh!"

But all the atoms composing his existence would be twisted.

And such things.

"Infinity."

Spread out in countless numbers.

"Haaagh!"

It was more a feeling of shock than impact, a terror as if his soul was being pulled out.

Just as Baal's horribly crumpled front body was flying backward again.

"Come here."

When Sirone extended his hand, he flew forward again as if pushed by a current.

Taeseong realized.

'Wave of particles.'

It was the highest level that one human, not Yahweh, a mage of light, could reach.

"Argh! Argh!"

Baal, who collapsed on the ground, writhed his limbs as if melted by heat and screamed.

Sirone, with Baal between his legs, looked down at him and gently extended his fist.

"Photon Cannon."

Baal shook his head frantically.

"Argh! Argh!"

"...Infinity."

"Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!"

As he poured down countless light-speed particles, Baal convulsed his limbs.

It felt as if the birth and destruction of the universe was passing through only his brain.

"Does it hurt?"

Since there was no way to describe this experience, Baal could only writhe while shedding tears.

"This isn't revenge. Tormenting you won't bring back the dead. Do you know what this means? It can't be undone. You killed them, you committed those acts, but you, the perpetrator, can't take responsibility!"

"Huuuh! Huuuh!"

Looking down at Baal with sad eyes, Sirone said.

"I hate that so much."
