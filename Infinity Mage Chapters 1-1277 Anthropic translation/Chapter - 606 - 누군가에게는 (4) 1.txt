[606] To Someone (4)

Liz, who had stayed awake all night waiting for Oscar, buried her head on the table, leaving her cold coffee untouched.

"Sigh."

When she had taken extended leave to come to Creas, she never imagined her heart would become this troubled.

'He met another woman?'

It was something she couldn't have imagined until she heard it from Nade, but the fact remained that Oscar hadn't shown up without any word.

'Nade isn't someone who would lie.'

How did things end up this way?

She had simply wanted to meet him one last time before promising a lifetime with Oscar.

"Don't move!"

In alchemist Wiz's warehouse, Nade had instantly taken down six mages.

Just as he was about to finish off the remaining mage, the concentric circles of flames restraining Liz blazed up fiercely.

"Don't move a finger. Do anything stupid and this woman dies."

Advanced techniques like time manipulation were beyond guild-trained mages, and the only option left was to threaten Nade by taking Liz hostage.

"Tch."

As Nade calmed the lightning wrapped around his body, a smile finally appeared on Wiz's face.

"Good! Finish him off!"

The mage hesitated since he couldn't cast other magic while holding Liz captive.

But honestly admitting "This is all I can do" would have been foolish too.

'This is why street-trained ones are...'

Wiz, reading the mage's hesitant expression, frowned before finding a new solution.

'That's it!'

If he shot Nade with the Ultrix that discharged electrical energy, he would burn without a trace.

As Wiz activated the Ultrix, Liz's face went pale.

"Nade! Run!"

"Shut your mouth."

The mage threatening Liz warned Nade.

"Don't move if you want to save the woman."

Even as he said this, he wondered if this trade was worth it, but surprisingly, Nade took a completely disarmed stance.

"Do as you please."

"Nade, why...?"

Looking at Liz's uncomprehending expression, Nade lifted the corners of his mouth bitterly.

"Who knows why?"

Even to Nade, recalling that day, his decision at the time remained a mystery.

Perhaps he had wanted to end it all.

"Mr. Wiz! Quickly!"

The mage shouted, thinking they needed to finish Nade before he changed his mind.

Meanwhile, powerful electrical energy condensed at the Ultrix's muzzle, ready to incinerate whatever lay ahead.

"No!"

Seeing Nade exposed defenseless to the Ultrix, Liz made her only choice.

'I have to die.'

As she stepped outside the flame's concentric circle, fire shot up to the ceiling.

"Idiot!"

Nade shouted just as Wiz fired the Ultrix.

"Graaaah!"

The electricity shot out at light speed, striking Nade directly, and even the cruel Wiz squeezed his eyes shut, unable to watch.

"Graaahhh!"

Opening his eyes at Nade's continuing groans, even someone with 30 years of alchemical experience couldn't believe the scene unfolding.

"Wh-what is that?"

Tremendous lightning was wrapping around Nade's body.

"Immune to electricity?"

It was impossible for any human, or any living creature's flesh.

There was only one possibility.

"Could it be?"

At that moment, Nade's body vanished like lightning, cutting through the mage's flames.

Liz, now in Nade's arms, looked up.

"Nade?"

"Grrrrr!"

Nade's face was completely covered with blood vessels rising from his neck, and he was gritting his teeth as if desperately holding something back.

"This is impossible..."

As the flames lost their target and died out, the mage finally realized.

Spark - the ultimate movement technique of lightning magic.

But unlike photon-based teleportation, it burned the mage's own body, making it impossible to cast without special equipment.

"Run. I can't... hold on anymore."

Pushing Liz away, Nade turned around, overwhelmed by uncontrollable bloodlust.

"R-run for it!"

The moment Wiz and the mage scattered in different directions, Nade let out an inhuman cry and released his surging power.

The warehouse flashed with light as thousands of electric currents twisted sharp as wire, pushing everything forward.

"You... bastard."

Struck by Lightning Thunder, Nade doubled over, trembling, then raised his head with terrifying eyes.

The moment Oscar met those eyes, he felt his blood completely evaporate.

"How can you use electricity...!"

The reaction of people first encountering Nade's unusual phenomenon was always the same.

While those ignorant of magic were paralyzed with fear, anyone versed in magic would be shocked and think of one thing.

"Mana Synchronization?"

Also called Mana Unity.

A phenomenon where a mage's mind completely synchronized with magic - the Ice Queen exiled to the Les Mountains was a famous example.

However, this was a phenomenon that mages with normal thinking couldn't even approach.

Mages were fundamentally rational beings, while mana synchronization was the most irrational mental state - the mind unifying with natural phenomena.

Therefore, mages afflicted with mana synchronization brought disaster wherever they went, and their ends were always tragic.

'No, it's impossible.'

Nade had definitely been having a normal conversation with him just moments ago.

But Nade approaching while wreathed in electricity was definitely electricity itself.

"Die."

At Nade's declaration, Oscar hastily cast teleportation.

Lightning fell in a curve where he had been standing, creating tremendous thunder as it devastated a 20-meter radius.

"Aaaahhh!"

Oscar, rolling on the ground from the shockwave, let out an involuntary scream.

Not human thought, but electrical thought.

Like a spirit of electricity dwelling in Nade, the only emotion that arose was nature's desire to destroy everything.

"Graaaah!"

His face completely twisted, all blood vessels bulging, blue light shooting from his eyes.

'I'm going to die. Really die.'

Purposeless destructive instinct.

The sight of natural phenomena manifesting as a human walking toward him was exactly the same terror Frings had experienced, and Oscar trembled in all his limbs.

"S-someone help...!"

As Spark was cast, Oscar's body arrived at a location a full 100 meters away.

"Ugh!"

As Nade crashed into a tree trunk, a powerful impact struck the back of his head, and a strained voice was heard.

"Why... did you do that?"

Hearing that question, Oscar, like Frings, found a glimmer of hope.

'There's still some reason left.'

He didn't know how it was possible, but it was clear that he would die if he didn't answer the question.

"Wh-what did I do?"

"Why did you bring Liz? If advancement was so important, you shouldn't have brought her from the start! You should have just gone to that woman!"

"I told her not to come! I was conflicted too... For someone not from a prestigious family like me, that was the only way to enter the Association."

"That's not an answer."

"It's true! I loved Liz too!"

It was sincere, but packaged sincerity.

"Die."

Oscar's heart sank as he hit rock bottom.

"I did it just in case! In case things didn't work out well, and because I didn't want to lose Liz either, that's why I brought her!"

Faced with human weakness that couldn't simply be called evil, Nade's power grew even stronger.

"Please spare me. If you kill me, Liz will never know I cheated. She'll resent you!"

That didn't matter at all.

What Nade truly feared was the guilt of killing the man she loved.

"Graaaah!"

But the mana synchronization phenomenon he had desperately suppressed seemed to have reached the limit of his endurance, destroying Nade's mind.

"Go. Quickly, from here..."

As strength left Nade's hands and Oscar collapsed, the final limit snapped.

"Kyaaahhhhh!"

Oscar's screams as he crawled away flailing his limbs were buried in the noise of electricity exploding in all directions.

"S-someone help!"

Electricity struck down repeatedly behind him like a predator's fangs.

He was already out of his mind, not even realizing his pants were soaked wet.

Breathing like a beast, Oscar turned his head to see Nade, completely engulfed in electricity, charging at him with white light blazing from his eyes.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

Just as the most miserable scream of his life erupted, someone rushed in swift as wind.

"Nade!"

As Shirone blocked Oscar's front and cast Shining, Nade cast Spark and moved at a right angle.

Shirone was stunned by the abnormal reaction speed - Nade had dodged the moment the first curtain touched his skin.

"Iruki! Quickly!"

At Shirone's call, Iruki immediately landed and took Oscar away.

They had been waiting in the distance for Nade, who had been hanging around the Dolphin Inn, and when they brought Oscar and cast spatial movement, they heard the explosive sound and rushed here.

"Shirone! You run too!"

Now that mana synchronization had occurred, Nade wouldn't distinguish between friend and foe.

"Nade! It's me! Snap out of it!"

Shirone didn't give up and shouted, and simultaneously Nade's form disappeared.

A crackling sound erupted and Nade, who had approached in an instant, tore off half of Shirone's face with his hand.

The sound of his face exploding from powerful electricity - that was the next second's future.

'Buddha's Statue Explosion!'

Hastily jerking his face away, Shirone saw Nade's hand claw past.

Without time for other thoughts, he cast teleportation repeatedly, retreating 30 meters before stopping with his hand on the ground.

"Huff! Huff! Huff!"

His heart beat frantically and his whole body trembled as if electrocuted.

One of his legs supporting his weight gave out and buckled.

'That's why I said it wouldn't work.'

Iruki, already outside the radius, clicked his tongue.

The current Nade wasn't a mage but magic itself, not human but electricity.

Electricity twisted with murderous intent, at that.

'It's not fear. He's my friend.'

Anyone would feel absolute terror before Nade, but Shirone didn't give up and stood up.

"Nade! It's me, Shirone! Please snap out of it!"

"Shirone..."

One of Nade's blazing eyes dimmed and a human-like voice leaked out.

"Nade! Your mind is back...!"

"Kyaaahhh!"

But it was only momentary, and Nade cast Spark magic again, spreading plasma thickly on the ground.

Lightning flashed everywhere and temporal energy grotesquely distorted and mixed natural phenomena, making it seem like a scene from some distant corner of the universe.

"How can that be possible?"

Oscar muttered with an expression of disbelief as he watched the battle.

'A graduating student?'

Though his pride as a mage had risen considerably after obtaining certification, he had never even thought such overwhelming and nonsensical battles could exist.

'And yet they're friends?'

Even Iruki watched in stunned amazement this time.

The fact that Shirone could face Nade's transcendent murderous intent head-on proved that his mind had also reached a supreme realm beyond nature's terror.

'But Shirone, you know, don't you?'

Nevertheless, this fight needed to be stopped as quickly as possible.

"Mana synchronization has no limits."

"Aaaahhhhh!"

As Nade, unable to catch Shirone, let out an inhuman cry, electricity spread explosively, burning everything.

"We're going to die! We're all going to die!"

Oscar couldn't even think of avoiding the wave of electricity rolling toward him like a tsunami.

'I can't stop this!'

Facing the massive natural phenomenon, Shirone reached back with his arm.

'Right, Iruki. Seeing it directly, it's definitely different.'

He had no choice but to admit that to stop Nade, he too had to be prepared to die.

"Diamond Armed!"

The moment Shirone gripped Armand's handle and shouted, Nade charged forth with thunder.
