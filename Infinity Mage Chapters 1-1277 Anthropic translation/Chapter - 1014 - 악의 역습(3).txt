The Counterattack of Evil (3)

The Imperial Palace, Aganos.

The goblin's appearance stood in stark contrast to the corridor's scenery, which was adorned with gold and silver treasures.

The monster wearing a ragged cloak and carrying a crude spear on his back was named Kido.

He was virtually the only guard who could enter Uorin's room and deliver food to her directly.

"Halt."

A black gust of wind swept in, and a wind guard wearing an owl-like white mask blocked the path.

"What? You startled me."

The leader of the formation asked in a sinister voice.

"...Where are you going?"

"Can't you see this? That woman asked me to bring her some honey water."

The wind guard stared intently at the golden tray Kido had lifted, then revealed his killing intent.

"Don't get cocky just because the Empress favors you. You're nothing more than a pet after all."

Like most close retainers, for the wind guard too, Kasha's only master was Theraze.

Masters of the sword who embodied fluid dynamics with their bodies and protected Theraze at the closest distance.

But after Kido entered the imperial palace, that pride was shattered to pieces.

'A mere goblin...'

From what he had observed from afar, Uorin didn't particularly value Kido either.

She treated him like a servant, got angry at him, and sometimes even put a leash on him for walks.

"If I'm a pet, then are you all livestock? Move aside. If I'm late, that woman will throw another fit."

When the wind guard activated the group killing intent 'Bride,' it felt as if thousands of blades were piercing his skin.

"Watch your words. If you insult the Empress again, I'll report it directly. I'll say that stinking goblin left for a place from which he can never return."

The biggest reason for despising Kido was that he harbored romantic feelings for Uorin.

'A dog trying to look up at its master?'

If he hadn't possessed the special ability called 'Taste of Memory' from the beginning, Uorin wouldn't have kept him by her side.

"Move aside."

Kido had no intention of fighting.

"I have a good idea."

When the formation leader drew his sword, the remaining nine members performed the same motion like afterimages.

"Let's give you a neutering surgery. Then the Empress can play with you much more safely."

The wind guard was serious.

Kido's eyes grew cold, but his hands still gripped the tray.

The moment when subtle vibrations that appear before the body moves heightened the tension.

"Stop that."

A woman's voice was heard.

"Lady Yula."

As the wind guard sheathed his sword and bowed his head, Kido slowly turned around.

'When did she get behind us...'

Yula, the leader of the wind guards.

Though she wore the same owl mask, her atmosphere was different from the other wind guards.

"Wind guards follow only the Empress's orders. Remember that your arrogance could destroy the entire organization."

"I apologize."

Yula's chest rose and fell greatly.

'This is why newcomers are problematic. No matter how much you teach them with words, they don't understand until they experience it.'

Though his skills were outstanding enough to become a formation leader, if one was a wind guard, they must remember this.

'Theraze.'

The cruel madness contained in that name.

'Someone who could massacre all the wind guards simply because they're an eyesore.'

Yula bowed her head.

"I'm sorry. Please overlook my subordinate's rudeness. The Empress is waiting, so hurry along."

When Kido turned around, the corridor was empty.

Since Yula wouldn't be there anyway, he moved forward without bothering to check behind him.

"...Not easy."

He knocked on Uorin's door, but there was no response.

"I'm coming in."

Kido held the tray with both hands and used his right foot to turn the door handle.

"What? You were here after all?"

Uorin, having finished grooming herself, was looking outside from a table by the window.

"Kido."

She turned her head with a smile, and her appearance shone brighter than the backlight from the window.

'She's really beautiful.'

Though goblins' aesthetic standards differ from humans', in his eyes Uorin was a perfect being.

'It might be because I've eaten many people. Human memories have seeped in.'

Though he tried to redirect his thoughts, he knew the truth.

'I love this woman.'

All the desires to laugh together, take walks, talk about books read yesterday, and become entangled like beasts.

If someone found those natural desires disgusting, there would be only one reason.

It would be because Kido was a goblin.

"Drink it. You said your stomach wasn't feeling well?"

Uorin looked at the teardrop-shaped teacup on the tray and puffed out her cheeks with a smile.

"Oops."

She hit the bottom of the tray with her hand, causing the teacup to fall over and spill all the honey water.

Pointing at Kido's face as he suppressed his anger, Uorin held her stomach and laughed.

"Hahahaha! Look at that expression."

"What are you doing right now?"

"Huh? I hit the tray and spilled the honey water. Oh, right. Could you bring me some honey water? My stomach isn't feeling well."

Kido threw down the tray and shouted.

"What do you take goblins for! Am I that ridiculous to you! Why is it always a joke when you see me!"

"Because you're disgusting."

As Kido's face turned pale with shock, Uorin smirked.

"It's a joke, a joke! You know how much I like you."

"Forget it."

Kido turned around.

"If you need a pet, find someone else. I'm quitting. I'm leaving Kasha."

"Why are you so sensitive today? Did something happen?"

Was it because he met the wind guards?

'No, this is my problem.'

He couldn't bear to see himself becoming more miserable the more he stayed by her side.

"Huh? Are you really going to leave? Kido, Kido!"

Before Uorin could finish speaking, Kido threw open the door and rushed into the corridor.

After the slamming sound disappeared, there was no sign of life in the room, just like before.

"Hmph, so that's all he amounted to."

He didn't know if he could really leave Kasha, but he needed time to think at least.

Around the time Kido left the imperial palace.

Uorin's eyes, sitting at the table looking out the window, had grown coldly indifferent.

"Be careful, Kido."

In the landscape she viewed with dry detachment, corpses bleeding profusely were appearing one after another.

Havitz's face, having arrived in Kasha's capital, was covered in blood, making him look like a demon.

"Thrilling."

He entered the construction site where repairs were being made for damage caused by the demon tree, but no one noticed him.

"More, be more terrified."

Every time he heard Uorin's inner voice, his eyelids trembled.

"Hey, bricks from the material warehouse..."

When Havitz swung his arm, the neck of a worker passing by snapped with a crack.

"Now, now! Let's start quickly!"

People were still busy, and Havitz, alone and lonely, began his sword dance.

"Die."

One life with each sword strike.

"Die."

Even while absorbed in that tedious work, the city was moving rapidly.

The teachers who had expected a terrible collision had expressions of bewilderment the moment they opened their eyes.

"My goodness..."

Wizard was crying.

"I was wrong. I won't do it again."

Once the floodgates opened, Wizard's emotions poured out like a waterfall.

"That's right. Only brave people can admit their mistakes. It's something even adults find difficult to do."

Wizard, who had stopped crying, sniffled.

"Winning and hurting others are completely different things. You mustn't do that anymore."

"Yes."

Looking at Wizard nodding his head, Shirone suddenly had this thought.

'A genius of the age, a magician stronger than adults, intoxicated by all kinds of flowery words, but...'

In fact, the child was anxious about everything.

'His own emotions, others' emotions, even the nameless insects crawling around at his feet...'

Everything was frightening.

'No one could teach this child about the world. Thanks to that, his purity was maintained, but...'

That's what made it difficult.

'Am I really going to send this child to Satan? Can I tell him to kill Havitz?'

Organizing his complicated feelings, Shirone took Wizard's hand and left the training ground.

Meanwhile, Wizard, who had been lost in thought alone, looked up at the teachers and said.

"Teacher, I was wrong. I'm sorry."

The dedicated teacher made a tearful expression and gently stroked her cheek.

"No. Wizard did really well. You're admirable. Teacher is so proud of you."

Rampa, who had been warmly watching this scene, turned his head and brought up the main point.

"Then shall we... set up the negotiation table now?"

Though he didn't show it outwardly, a thousand fires were burning in the administrator's heart.

'Damn! This is the worst situation.'

Who could have known that Wizard, whom no one could tame, would become a gentle lamb?

"Haha! Yes. Shall we return to the school then? Wizard's parents are waiting."

Leaving the teachers behind and entering the school, the principal approached with Wizard's parents.

"Welcome. I'm Nikolai, a certified 4th-class magician. It's an honor to meet the star of the Ivory Tower."

To magicians, Shirone was a living legend.

His hand trembled as he offered a handshake.

"Yes, nice to meet you. I've heard of your reputation."

Through Omega.

"You flatter me. Oh, and these are Wizard's parents. Please introduce yourselves."

A man and woman in their mid-40s bowed their heads.

"Hello. I'm Wizard's father. If my daughter was rude, please forgive..."

The fact that words came out without even looking suggested what Wizard's usual behavior was like.

"Not at all. We're actually the ones receiving help. Thank you for raising your daughter so well."

It was a statement representing humanity.

Shirone turned to the mother and asked.

"I'd like to hear the story. How Wizard was born and what phenomena occurred."

The mother answered awkwardly.

"We're just farmers, so we don't know much. That, what do you call it, magic or Sprit Zone..."

The father corrected.

"Spirit Zone."

"Ah, yes, that. We just want Wizard to be safe. Oh my, in a world where demons are rampant..."

The mother wiped away tears.

"I see."

He couldn't bring himself to say that your daughter will fight the leader of those demons.

"Mom! Dad!"

Just then, Wizard, who had belatedly washed up and arrived, waved her hand and ran to the entrance.

"Wizard!"

Rushing into her parents' arms, she was unmistakably a seven-year-old child, which made his heart even heavier.

'Even if all conditions are met, it's useless if Wizard won't do it.'

Wizard pointed at Shirone and said.

"This big brother, you know, he's really strong? Much, much stronger than me."

"Huh?"

Since Wizard had never acknowledged anyone before, her parents were dumbfounded.

"I like this big brother. I want to keep playing with him. Is that okay? Huh? Huh?"

The parents looked at Shirone again.

"This is the first time our daughter has acted like this. If it's not too presumptuous, may we ask your name?"

Thinking that what was bound to come had come, Shirone answered.

"I'm called Shirone."

"Ah..."

Though they had never heard of the Ivory Tower, the name Shirone was famous even among farmers.

A practitioner of love who killed countless demons and fought for humanity's peace.

"Thank you. Thanks to you, Mr. Shirone, we were able to escape safely."

"No. I don't deserve to hear such words. And I'll deserve them even less in the future."

Leaving the parents who couldn't understand, Shirone got down to Wizard's eye level.

"Wizard, is magic still fun now?"

"Yes, it's fun. It's more fun playing with big brother. I'm going to keep doing magic. Foreeeever!"

Wizard puckered her lips like a fish, pointed her index finger, and drew a long line to the side.

"You might die."

At Shirone's words, the parents' eyes widened greatly.

"You might get hurt somewhere, or be in a lot of pain. Even so... do you still want to continue with magic?"

"E-excuse me! What do you mean by that?"

When the parents tried to intervene, Rampa put his index finger to his lips and shook his head.

Wizard repeated Shirone's words.

"I might die..."

After being lost in thought for a long while, she suddenly lifted her head as if realizing something.

Then, looking up at Shirone, she answered with the brightest smile a seven-year-old could make.

"Yes! I want to!"
