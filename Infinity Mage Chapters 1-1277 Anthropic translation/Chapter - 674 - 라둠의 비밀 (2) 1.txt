[674] Radum's Secret (2)

The time it takes to fall is roughly 4 seconds.

While mages could cast fly magic, the swordsmen had to make quick decisions.

"Aaaah! Save me!"

Baikon lost his composure and flailed about.

Even schema users who could fight agilely while wearing heavy armor found falling from great heights to be a separate problem entirely.

As Sirone spread his light wings, Lupist shouted.

"No! Advance toward the Creature!"

Ignoring his words, Sirone rushed toward Baikon, but the electric net was faster.

"Damn it...!"

At that moment, Jane, who was nearby, cast teleportation and snatched Baikon like a hawk before descending to the ground.

'Tch, what a coward.'

As the other members followed her down, Lupist had no choice but to change direction and arrive on the ground.

Once they came down, tall buildings blocked them on all sides, naturally bringing a sense of suffocation.

After confirming that Baikon was safe, Sirone gave instructions.

"Head count first."

"Seventeen. No stragglers."

Jane looked around at the Creature and said.

"It's collecting photons again. Being attacked on the ground will be on a completely different level."

Lupist's eyes widened menacingly.

"That's why I said we should advance! Are you disobeying the Guild Master's orders?"

"...I'm sorry."

Seeing Jane bow her head, Sirone questioned with a displeased expression.

"Since we're in the same boat, isn't it natural to fight together?"

Of course it was the right thing to say, but from Lupist's perspective, it was no different from the chatter of civilian groups.

"Listen carefully, kid. The mercenary group might be everything to you, but I have a duty to balance the equity for all citizens of the capital, and furthermore, all people of the kingdom. The equity of having an equal chance of unlucky death. The kingdom will not tolerate other citizens being exposed to higher risks just to maintain your single opinion."

Baikon approached and bowed his head.

"I'm sorry. Please give me one more chance. This won't happen again."

Lupist didn't even bother to reply and turned away.

It's difficult to rebuild a broken spirit, and if someone could do that, they wouldn't have wavered in the first place.

"Jane, prepare for disciplinary action when this is over. I'm only keeping you alive because you're still useful."

More than the cold words, the fact that she had disappointed the Guild Master cast a shadow over Jane's face.

'Just a spare part...'

To Lupist, all humans in the kingdom were nothing more than spare parts to keep the system running.

"I'm sorry. Because of me..."

As Baikon blushed and apologized, Jane shook her head and forced a smile.

"So what do we do now?"

At Jordyk's question, Sirone looked up at the iron tower rising tall beyond the buildings.

"What are the chances they'll attack us even while destroying Radum?"

"One hundred percent. They know this battle is the last one too. They'll do everything they can to stop us."

"How about we strike first?"

With Angel's Punishment, they could at least destroy the Creature's batteries.

"On whose authority? That's clearly kingdom property. We need to preserve the system until we retrieve the Creature's seed."

Meiley, who had been eavesdropping on Ra's thoughts through the divine frequency, pointed to the main road.

"Enemies are coming."

Ra's voice was always in past tense.

Therefore, the enemies had already arrived, and numerous sub-humans flickered beyond the veil of concealment devices.

"Our position has been discovered. Interception will begin."

"How annoying."

Lupist looked at Sirone and said.

"We approach the Creature as quickly as possible. Can you do it?"

Understanding the Guild Master's true intention, Sirone took a deep breath and nodded.

"Yes. I can do it."

"Advance at maximum speed. Quan, focus on VIP protection. The rest, watch the flanks and rear."

As Quan stuck close to Arias, eerie low tones from the Garda tribe could be heard from inside the concealment facility.

"All forces attack!"

The enemies began revealing themselves one by one.

They were members of Spectrum's subordinate organizations: Black Revolutionary Group, Fanatics, Speed Killers, and others.

"Kill the humans! Complete the great revolutionary cause!"

As their numbers gradually increased and completely filled the street, Lupist frowned and opened his Spirit Zone.

'Iron Wave!'

As steel magic was cast, a 10-meter-high iron wall wave surged forward.

"What, what is that?"

While the members were stunned by the speed of expansion comparable to wind, Lupist launched himself.

"Follow me. Stragglers will be abandoned."

As hundreds of sub-humans were pushed by the iron wall and screamed, Sirone raised the Avatar of Light Angel high in the sky.

'Angel's Punishment!'

As a spear of light crashed down beyond the iron wall with a thud, the area was devastated and the sub-humans' bodies flew into the air.

Boom boom boom! Boom boom boom!

After confirming that friendly forces wouldn't be harmed, Sirone cast Angel's Punishment repeatedly.

Hearing the hellish screams from beyond the iron wall, the members felt chills and gritted their teeth.

'Monster-like bastards.'

It was hard to tell who wasn't human.

"Block it! I said block it!"

"You crazy goblin, how do we block that!"

If the collision of the strongest spear and strongest shield is called a paradox, then when those two combine, the situation becomes a disaster.

'Is that an Ivory Tower candidate?'

While the Guild Master was one thing, Sirone's prowess in running equally with a certified First-Class Grand Mage was eerie.

'Just a little further.'

As the remaining distance to the Creature narrowed to within 1 kilometer, Quan's tension peaked.

'Am I finally going to see the upper class?'

As far as Quan knew, all sub-humans residing in the concealment facility area were middle class or below.

Of course, they were also powerful forces, but the upper class waiting at the Creature's spire was on a different level from the sub-humans currently being cut down by the iron wall.

'I heard there are rumors of pureblooded vampires...'

As they advanced listening to the sound of clashing swords, Meiley, who was eavesdropping on Ra Enemy's voice, shouted.

"Interception orders have been given!"

The moment the words fell, Lupist, who had stopped charging, lowered his center and pressed his arms together.

'Golden Jade!'

An incredibly thick iron wall was refined into a hemispherical shape covering all the mercenary members.

Meiley began counting.

'1 second. 2 seconds. 3 seconds.'

At the 4-second mark, the energy beam fired from the Creature struck the Golden Jade with a direct hit.

"Aaaaaaah!"

The noise alone inside was hell.

The situation was so chaotic that even screams were buried in the roar, but Meiley raised her head with clear eyes.

'It was fired 4 seconds later. No doubt about it.'

Ra Enemy's event was currently staying with the Creature.

"Damn it! Do something!"

As the Creature's energy beam heated the Golden Jade, the internal temperature rose rapidly.

They understood how a chicken in a steamer felt.

"We're going to get cooked at this rate!"

Jordyk blew cold air from his Ice Globe.

While it felt cool momentarily, it ultimately couldn't lower the temperature even one-tenth and just evaporated into steam.

'If we break the Golden Jade, we'll die anyway. Then it's better to gather heat to the limit and...'

Lupist, who had calmly calculated the time, caused cracks in the Golden Jade when he could no longer withstand the high temperature.

"Gather at the Creature!"

The compressed heat exploded, scattering the members in all directions along with iron fragments.

"Aaaaaaah!"

The difference between those who could withstand the explosion and those who couldn't was starkly divided.

While most lost control and were blown away, Quan embraced Arias's waist and quickly flew his body outside the radius.

At the moment the energy beam that destroyed the Golden Jade rushed in, Sirone cast the magic he had prepared.

'Ataraxia!'

The occurrence was instantaneous, and as the photon cannon passed through the magic circle, a massive flash erupted.

The light mass wave pushed back the energy beam for a moment, but it was too large to handle even with Ataraxia's amplification power.

'It's really incredible!'

Nevertheless, the momentary time Sirone bought provided everyone with a chance to escape outside the radius.

Only Lian remained in place, running through the strong wind to block between Sirone and Ataraxia.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

The moment he struck his great sword into the ground, the energy beam engulfed them.

'Endure it! Endure it!'

Lian's Divine Transcendence was always powerful, but the moment of protecting Sirone was unparalleled.

"Grrrrrr!"

Since it wasn't energy a living being could withstand, just the vibration transmitted through the handle crushed his finger bones.

'I'll protect it! The Kingdom of Conviction...!'

The fractures that started from the back of his hand spread throughout his body.

Smile. Smile.

Following the hallucination heard again, his calf and thigh muscles burst with popping sounds, his left eyeball was crushed, and his cheekbone flew off.

Finally, the energy beam dissipated.

"Hrrrrr..."

A ghostly groan escaped from Lian's mouth after taking the Creature's interception head-on.

The fact that the energy beam split from his position, creating two vast pathways in the city, gave a sense of the magnitude of force he had to endure.

"Li, Lian..."

Sirone's voice trembled.

While he had heard briefly from Miro about Lian's level, the idea that he could block an ancient weapon with his bare body and survive felt like a delusion.

"Lian! You can't die!"

Lian's voice was heard.

"Right. I can't die."

Gripping the great sword's handle firmly and standing up, he slowly turned and said.

"Until I die, you absolutely cannot die."

Lian's face, smiling with one eye closed, rapidly recovered.

Smile. Smile.

Ignoring the persistent hallucination, Lian checked the condition of his great sword Idea.

'Really impressive.'

Though it was a sword that had cut many enemies, this was the first time it was exposed to such overwhelming power.

But true to an indestructible object, not even a scratch appeared on the blade.

'I don't know how long the hallucinations will last, but...'

It didn't matter anyway.

If it was to protect Sirone, he would have jumped in without hesitation even if this was the last time.

'Thank you, Grandfather.'

As he recalled Klump's face and sheathed the great sword on his back, Sirone asked with a dazed expression.

"Lian? Are you really recovered?"

"As you can see, no problem."

The moment Lian gave a thumbs up, a fist struck his solar plexus.

Of course, there was no impact as it was blocked by his muscle barrier, but that made Sirone even more annoyed.

"You idiot! How could you do something so reckless? Don't you know what that was? It's an ancient weapon!"

"Weren't you the one trying to do something about that ancient weapon?"

"Huh?"

Sirone blinked.

"I saw you preparing a counterattack. You never intended to dodge from the beginning, right? If you hadn't bought time, everyone caught in the explosion would have died."

While Lupist would call it foolish, Sirone had a point he couldn't compromise on.

"Right. The mission is important, but this is the mercenary group I formed..."

Lian shook his head.

"It's okay. Whatever decision you make, I just need to follow as your sword. What I really want to say is that nothing is more shameful for a knight than failing to protect."

When Lian said something was what he really wanted to say, it meant he would see it through in any situation.

That was a knight's conviction.

Perhaps Lian had become a much greater person than Sirone realized.

'Sorry, Lian.'

As if reading Sirone's thoughts, Lian smiled and pointed to Radum's core.

"Let's go. We need to continue our journey."
