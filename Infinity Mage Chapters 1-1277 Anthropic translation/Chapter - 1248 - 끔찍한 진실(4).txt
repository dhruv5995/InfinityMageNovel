The Terrible Truth (4)

Anchial spoke.

"Your Majesty the Emperor, transmission of the Parma Light Castle's power will be complete in 10 minutes."

His tone was more reverent than usual because Zin-gang was facing death.

"Cough!"

Zin-gang spat blood.

"Hehe."

Half-mad lunatic.

Though he acknowledged it himself, he was actually enjoying this feeling.

'Seong-eum.'

It seemed he wouldn't get a chance to see his daughter's face.

'Should I dare wish for such a luxury?'

"Your Majesty the Emperor, please give your command. Once transmitted, the information cannot be retrieved. This is the only chance to turn back."

Even though these words would add to his mental burden, Zin-gang looked at Anchial with gentle eyes.

"Thank you."

He hoped there would be no regrets whatsoever.

"Your Majesty."

Anchial struggled to hold back tears welling in his one eye as he sent a resolute gaze.

"Please give your command."

Zin-gang's face transformed like a demon.

"Kill them."

All of them.

Ryan ran and ran some more.

"Get out of the way!"

Though Sirone's body was as light as a feather, the weight of that life was greater than Ryan's.

"Yaaaaah!"

The sword of the yaksha protecting his lord split the dark monks.

'There's no end.'

Beyond his wide-open field of vision, even more black monks were swarming in.

'The remaining distance is... roughly 40 kilometers.'

If he ran with determination, it was a distance he could reach in an instant, but breaking through the dark monks was the problem.

'No, even arriving would be a problem. While purifying Zin Seong-eum's chains, Sirone would be defenseless.'

Ryan decided.

"I'll protect him."

Since the sword doesn't judge, Sirone's life was the top priority in any situation.

The black monks flew at them again.

*Foolish sinner, why do you refuse purification and disturb the laws of hell?*

A swarm too numerous to count rotated like a whirlwind, concentrating their power.

"Huuuuu!"

Ryan gripped his great sword in reverse and charged.

'Don't worry, Sirone.'

The moment he gritted his teeth, the world shook and tremendous force rushed into his right arm.

"Yaaaaah!"

As he turned his shoulder, the muscles in his forearm evaporated, and the swarm of black monks exploded with a bang.

*Ooooooo...*

Hearing the faint screams, Ryan examined his right arm, which was now just bone.

*Smile. Smile*

Ogent's bloodline began repairing his body, but the speed was definitely slower.

'Not much left.'

Even with the Idea of Divine Transcendence, there were limits to a living being's recovery ability.

"I'm fine."

Ryan, who had barely recovered his right arm and channeled strength into it, gripped his great sword and walked again.

'Even if I break... the Idea won't be destroyed.'

Having escaped the Pyramid of Truth, Sirone stood before the giant hole pierced in the sky.

The all-seeing eye was watching him.

"What are you thinking?"

Sirone asked, but the pupil showed no reaction as before.

"Do you think you're defining me?"

It wasn't fear.

He simply wanted to do everything he could here before departing for an unknown world.

"Is Guffin there?"

What had been that reaction shown at theMica ruins? The all-seeing eye didn't move.

"Answer me..."

A photon cannon appeared in Sirone's hand.

"I said answer!"

As a streak of light headed toward the hole in the sky, an identical beam flew from the other side.

It was like throwing a ball at a mirror.

"Good."

Apparently, gods didn't like making gentlemanly compromises from their respective worlds.

"If that's what you want, I'll go in."

After taking a deep breath, Sirone wrapped himself in Miracle Stream and flew toward the hole.

As his head passed the boundary where the beams had collided, the all-seeing eye disappeared and a black space appeared.

'Yania Idum-eo.'

If the absence of light was everything, there was no way he could see his own hand.

Nothingness, or such a concept.

'Reversal of thought.'

Having already experienced this in High Gear, Sirone quickly regained his thinking.

"Is something different?"

While High Gear was a lower stage of reality, the outer world itself wasn't particularly special.

'Just...'

The space changed.

"This is a unique concentration method called the sequence technique."

Ethela said.

"Among you, please raise your hand if you've ever counted from 1 to 100, whether in your mind or out loud."

While students at Alpheas Magic School raised their hands, Sirone had an indifferent look.

'Everything is just a grand illusion.'

Just by recalling it, he returned to the integrated class time of Class Five at his alma mater.

Ethela continued.

"Good. Then, has anyone counted from 1 to 1,000?"

While the students looked around at each other, Sirone also carefully observed the familiar faces.

There was Nade, who would still be awkward, and Iruki, who had clashed with him from their first meeting.

'Haha! You guys were really young.'

Of course, so was I.

A slight smile formed, but soon he turned away from them with sad eyes.

'This isn't my world.'

It was just one of countless universes endlessly multiplying like bubbles.

"The sequence technique is literally the skill of arranging numbers. Unlike language, numbers are..."

Ethela stopped speaking.

"Sirone?"

When Sirone made eye contact, Ethela fell into serious thought with a grave expression.

"You..."

She asked.

"Who are you?"

All the advanced class students looked at Sirone, but there wasn't much to say.

"No, who are you? You're not Sirone."

Ethela was certain.

The look in his eyes, which had been sparkling with interest just a second ago, was completely different.

'He's not a student. No, even such comparison is meaningless - eyes that have reached the end of the world.'

Her instinct spoke out.

"...God?"

The students murmured.

"What are you talking about? Why is the teacher suddenly acting like this?"

A commotion seemed about to break out, and thinking it would be a nuisance to this world, Sirone stood up.

"Teacher Ethela."

The person he respected most.

"Thank you."

Sensing farewell, Ethela reached out her hand.

"Wait, wait...!"

It was the dark space again.

"Phew."

What might be happening right now in that universe he had just mistaken?

'A meaningless hypothesis.'

Literally, because there are infinitely many such universes.

'I can't return from here.'

Based on his High Gear experience, Sirone could find the place where his heart resided, but...

"God of the outer world."

Now it was time to settle things.

'Nade must have come here too.'

What had he realized, and where was he now?

'Could it be?'

Sirone stopped walking.

If this was a space where only illusions existed, there would be only one way to meet God.

'The only illusion.'

When he turned his head, his own reflection appeared as if in a mirror.

'But there's no mirror.'

As Sirone slowly approached, the other version of himself also closed the distance with the same posture.

His hand slowly extended.

Ymir's Black Hole.

Sirone, who regained consciousness in a tremendous sense of integration, arrived in the dark space.

After testing the world of illusions, when thoughts of Nade arose, his steps suddenly stopped.

'The only illusion.'

Since God is the result and is unique, whatever illusion it might be, there's only one place that can be reached.

Sirone turned his head.

'But there's no mirror.'

The two simultaneous Sirones approached with perfectly identical steps and touched hands.

After savoring the moment briefly, when Sirone lowered his hand, the mirror phenomenon returned to nothingness.

Which Sirone was he?

He was both the Sirone who received Yorahan's Transcendent Dream and the Sirone who didn't receive it.

'There's no contradiction.'

Sirone realized why his self in Ymir's dream had been cut off from reality.

'I was blocked by the barrier of logic.'

Here, there are no contradictions.

Infinite freedom where everything turns out right no matter what you do - that was the true identity of the Ultima System.

'You must have been sad, Nade.'

In the vast emptiness that couldn't even bear the extreme of nothingness, did he cry out?

'I should meet him too.'

Extracting Ultima was the priority.

However, the fact that there's only one God in infinite illusions means causality cannot be reversed.

'I can't return through reversal of thought. Even if I obtain Ultima, if I can't bring it back to reality...'

Having finished his resolve, Sirone recalled.

"God."

Though countless humans would imagine their own gods, whatever is conceived, God is one.

That one illusion finally moved Sirone to where God resided.

Too smooth to call stone, too soft to call metal - the material defied description.

It was an entirely white space.

'Is this the highest level universe that humanity can reach?'

No, that's not right.

'It's just holding onto results using imaginary time. Human potential doesn't end here.'

If the chain of causality created by God could be severed, humanity would stretch toward a more distant future.

Perhaps that was the message Guffin left...

'Beyond infinity.'

Calmly taking his first step, Sirone walked through a corridor where no individuality could be found.

Something different appeared in his sight for the first time.

"Hihihi! Hihihihihi!"

Arius, crouched like a dog, was spinning around.

"Uhihihihi! Woof! Woof! Hihihihihi!"

Sirone reversed his thought again and called out.

"Mr. Arius."

Suddenly stopping his movements, he turned his head and crawled toward Sirone.

"Uh, uh? Hahaha! You came! You finally came! Sirone!"

"What happened?"

Arius kept bowing.

"Oh! Our God! Save humanity! Take this pitiful body! Puhahaha!"

He was half-mad.

"Just how many universes have you wandered through?"

Everything is an instant - wandering through so many illusions would drive anyone to this state.

"Huh, huuuuu!"

Arius shed tears.

"It's all meaningless. You can go anywhere, become anything. A dog, an insect, air. God is infinitely vast and infinitely expansive... No one can endure it. We couldn't even become trivial beings to begin with!"

That's infinity.

"Uaaaah! I'm nothing! Just kill me! This damn space where even death becomes an illusion...!"

"Mr. Arius!"

At Sirone's sharp call, Arius closed his mouth.

"Get a grip. That's just God's characteristic. You know this. With Ultima, humans gain the power to fight too. Can you extract it? You said Miro had a plan."

"Miro."

My master.

"Extraction is simple."

Arius spread both arms.

"Here, this is Ultima. Take it. Whether you carve out the walls or suck in the air. Every concept that makes up this place is Ultima. It's the complete opposite of reality. Here, integration is a natural phenomenon. There are no contradictions. If you just produce such a result, the causes arrange themselves."

His hands covered his face.

"Hah, the problem is we can't return. We're trapped here. We shouldn't have come."

Having grasped the situation, Sirone stood up.

"Where is God?"

Arius's body trembled.

"You met him?"

"I don't want to go. That silence, that stillness, that vibration - it'll drive you mad."

"Then we need to find a way back. I have an idea. Where is God?"

"Where?"

Arius chuckled.

"Obviously, where God is."

Suddenly, electricity seemed to flow through their bodies, and a boundless white space unfolded.

Three meters above their line of sight, there was only a human head-sized glass sphere floating.

Actually, that's not accurate.

They could only assume based on seeing various spectrums of electricity spreading in spherical form as if trapped in a membrane.

"Are you the one?"

The glass sphere answered with silence, but Sirone intuited that the pattern of electricity had changed.

'That is...'

The ultra-high intelligence computing device, God.
