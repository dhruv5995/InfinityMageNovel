Memory (2)

Miro couldn't believe it.

'He's really going to kill me?'

But the look in Gaold's eyes as he stared down at her was more intense than any villain she had ever encountered.

'He's lying, right?'

She had believed that even if the whole world abandoned her, at least Gaold would never abandon her.

Though she couldn't reciprocate his love, that one fact had been such a great comfort to her...

"It's a lie!"

Only when Gaold had cut the woman named Miro from his heart did she feel it clearly.

"Diiiie!"

The moment he grasped her throat and applied air pressure, Miro could no longer remain still.

"Urgh!"

The incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara struck Gaold at invisible speed.

Gaold's body, shaking at a speed close to vibration, flew to the left and rolled across the ground.

Miro gritted her teeth and stood up.

'I blocked it.'

She felt through her mind a defensive barrier so solid that it didn't feel like she had hit a person.

"Miro..."

Had he come to his senses?

For a moment, a gentle light flickered in Gaold's eyes as he raised his head with his limbs pressed to the ground.

"Gaold?"

Before the words could finish, his face contorted again and he began charging at tremendous speed.

"You have to stop them!"

Kang Nan shouted to Zulu.

"Stop them?"

This was a scene where someone who had reached nirvana in a human body was fighting against the ultimate good of the era.

"How?"

The moment Kang Nan realized the reality and turned her head, a massive light exploded in her vision.

Boooooom!

Another crater formed within the crater, and two shadows moved like ink.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Every time the dozens-of-meters-wide palm struck, pressure was applied to Gaold's body.

But his Vacuum Pressure was also one of the strongest defensive magic in the world.

"Aaaaah!"

If he screamed in proportion to his anger, the entire surrounding area would explode, but Kang Nan and Zulu would die too.

Conversely, that was why they still hadn't left their positions and continued watching the battle.

"You idiot!"

Miro, who never let her emotions waver under any circumstances, shouted with all her heart.

"Snap out of it!"

Because it was Gaold.

The ground split with a thunderous roar, and Gaold bent at the waist where Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara's strike had landed.

Vacuum Pressure was still intact, but she could confirm by his reaction that the impact had gotten through.

His hair had bleached white, and his cursed nerves transmitted unimaginable pain throughout his body.

Seeing this, Miro's heart weakened again, but now she roughly understood the situation.

"Cut it out. Just because I said 'okay, okay,' you think I actually like it? You think you can treat me like this?"

"It's because of you... If it weren't for you..."

He wouldn't have had to suffer this pain.

"Who pushed me to like you? In the end, it was you! You're the one who liked me on your own...!"

The palm strikes of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara, moved by Miro's anger, pounded Gaold like a downpour.

"So!"

The strongest single blow was delivered.

"You just have to keep liking me!"

Kuuuuuuu!

The over 100 million consecutive strikes collapsed the ground with power approaching a natural disaster.

"That crazy woman!" Kang Nan tried to run over, but suddenly a tremendous gale pushed her back.

"Kraaaah!"

Gaold screamed in agony, shedding tears of blood, and Miro rushed through the wind.

"I never needed someone like you from the beginning."

As she brought her index and middle finger together, the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara floating in the sky formed the same hand seal.

She intended to pierce through Gaold's throat.

"Fighting for me?"

Such a thought suddenly occurred to her.

'Why am I getting angry? This is a good thing.'

Gaold's nirvana was important to Miro, and if he didn't even make those tickling advances, it would be an even better opportunity.

'Better than some weakling.'

Knowing this fact, Gaold must have chosen this result without regret.

"Annoying."

She couldn't control her anger.

"Just die!"

Kang Nan screamed.

"No!"

The united middle and index finger rushed toward Gaold's throat like a single sword.

But in the end, it couldn't pierce through and stopped abruptly, and the incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara froze.

Kraaaaaaang!

The thunderous roar created by that mental stop made it feel as if the sky was splitting.

"Bad boy..."

Miro gently grasped Gaold's throat, lowered her head, and trembled her shoulders.

"What is this?"

Tears were flowing from her eyes as she looked at Gaold again.

"You said you'd protect me forever."

The reason Miro couldn't become a Buddha.

It was probably just a thread-like crack that Gaold had carved in her heart...

"You said you loved me."

Miro felt an emptiness as if her heart had been pierced through.

Zulu said.

"You must have relied on him without knowing it. Even while fighting the world, even while carrying out justice, you must have thought Gaold was there."

Gaold's body trembled violently.

"Uaaaah!"

The moment she felt the rampaging Spirit Zone, Miro's heart sank, but...

"Cough!"

In the end, he vomited a bowlful of blood, rolled his eyes back, and collapsed.

"Gaold!"

While Kang Nan rushed over to check his condition, Miro stared at Gaold in a daze.

Night had fallen, and a bonfire was lit on the beach.

With the unconscious Gaold collapsed in the center, the three people silently stared at the flames.

"You were lucky."

Zulu said.

"He was quite exhausted from fighting the demons. If Gaold had been normal, Miro, you would have died."

It was an undoubtable battle.

Miro, who had been reviewing the life-and-death struggle, frowned and raised her head.

"I understand it's to maintain nirvana. But how can he be so blind? Self-hypnosis or something like that?"

She hoped that was the case.

"No. Gaold did nothing to himself. As I said before, he simply..."

Zulu looked back at the sleeping Gaold.

"Stopped loving you. Love and hate are separated by a hair's breadth. Rather, Gaold is remarkable for maintaining his feelings for you while experiencing that pain."

Kang Nan said.

"I tried to stop him too, but it was useless. How can you stop a person's heart? Anyway, nothing good will come of you being here. Just leave."

"Leave?"

If Gaold could fight more with the power of hatred, it would be better to follow Kang Nan's words.

'Gaold... doesn't love me.'

While she was lost in thought with complicated feelings, Gaold's voice was heard.

"Miro."

When she turned her head, Gaold was looking up at the sky with a calm expression.

Shirone, with his wings of light spread, quickly traversed the vast plains of the southern continent.

'There it is.'

Beyond the grasslands where wild animals roamed freely, a desert-colored city stood.

The place Shirone found after casting spatial movement to leave Tormia was the kingdom of Kesia on the southern continent.

Since the demons' reach hadn't extended there yet, there was the advantage of being able to use spatial movement terminals, but more than that, it was because of what Nade had said before leaving.

"You received investment from Fermi?"

The night before, Nade had pulled Shirone out in front of the bar's bathroom and informed him of the situation.

"Yeah. But there was a condition. He asked me to let him meet you, and told me about a weapon shop in Kesia."

Nade hastily added.

"Of course I refused. No matter how important investment is, I wouldn't sell out a friend. But..."

"But?"

"He said it was okay. He said to forget about the condition and make a contract. There was no request to tell you this either."

Shirone rested his chin on his hand.

"Hmm, that's definitely like Fermi."

"Right. In the end, he knew I would tell you this story anyway. Anyway, sharing information doesn't hurt."

His skill at doing business by digging into human psychology seemed the same as ever.

"Got it. I'll go check it out."

"Huh? Really?"

"I have to use the terminal to get to the Ivory Tower anyway. I'll stop by on the way. I'm also curious why he's looking for me."

Arriving at Kesia's capital, Shirone looked around at the scenery that was different from his expectations.

'What is this...'

The demons hadn't entered yet, but it was such a lawless zone that they didn't need to.

"Bwahahaha! Die! Die!"

Bandits riding in carriages were indiscriminately shooting arrows at the residents.

Their eyes weren't normal - they were clearly either insane or drugged.

"Please spare me!"

Most residents had evacuated to their homes, but a barefoot girl had nowhere to hide.

"Got one!"

Shirone caught the arrow flying toward the crouching girl's back with his hand.

"Huh? Hehe, did I see wrong?"

Even faced with an obviously magical phenomenon, the bandits just thought it was a drug-induced hallucination.

"What the hell are you doing right now?"

"Wow! It's prey, prey."

As they drooled and aimed their arrows again, Shirone cast Photon Cannon.

Bang! The carriage exploded and bodies rolled on the ground, but the bandits didn't even flinch.

"The world is spinning, spinning."

Shirone ignored them and checked on the girl.

"Are you okay? What happened to the city?"

"I, I didn't do anything wrong."

Watching her trembling back, Shirone noticed injection marks remaining on the girl's arm.

"Don't tell me you..."

"I'll explain."

At the voice from behind, he turned his head to see a man in a neat suit standing there.

The man politely bowed and greeted him.

"You're Aryan Shirone, aren't you? I've been waiting. I'll guide you from now on."

Since his first impression of the city wasn't good, Shirone followed without even greeting him.

'This is ridiculous.'

The city's actual condition that he observed while following the man was far more miserable than expected.

Everyone was drugged, and property damage was commonplace.

"Did you take over the entire city? With drugs?"

"We merely provided what they wanted. The fear of war, the pain of poverty - it all originates in the brain. If we can provide pleasure, what's wrong with that?"

"No. This is unforgivable."

"You would think so. He said you would. You'd better speak directly to Lord Fermi."

Where the man stopped was a massive building with the symbol of the Golden Wheel attached to its spire.

As if entering another world, the interior was clean, and not a single drug addict was visible.

'What the hell is he thinking?'

Just like in school days, Fermi's thoughts were always unpredictable.

Taking the elevator to the 17th floor, they arrived at a corridor covered with red carpet.

Opening the door at the end of the corridor, they entered a huge office decorated with floor-to-ceiling windows.

Though he had frequented the royal palace as one of the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower, it wasn't more luxurious than this.

"You came, Shirone."

Even when the man sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed spoke, Shirone didn't recognize him.

"Fermi?"

With his hair dyed in brilliant colors and a bushy beard, he looked exactly like a drug lord.

"Sit down. You look good. We don't need pleasantries between us. Oh, bring some tea."

"Yes."

After the man closed the door and left, Shirone strode toward Fermi.

"What did you want to see me about?"

"You weren't such an impatient person, were you? Why, you didn't like this city?"

"Just answer my question."

Fermi smiled his usual smile and flicked a irregularly made chip with his thumb.

"Let's make a deal, Shirone."
