Truth and Lies (1)

Captured by Yula, the leader of the Wind Blade, I twisted my body with all my strength.

"Kuan! Kuan!"

"Don't try any tricks. It would be nothing for me to cut your throat right now."

Yula's words were probably true, but I also knew she couldn't kill me easily.

"That's enough! I'll follow you. So please don't attack Kuan."

Yula said nothing.

'I have to kill him.'

The reason she had taken Shiina hostage in the first place was to neutralize Kuan.

'What restraint could be stronger than death?'

Let this be the end.

As she flew with such thoughts, a terrible sound reached Yula's ears.

'What is that?'

When she turned around, blood and flesh were spinning as if being ground by machinery.

"Stop."

The formation of 40 men halted, and the color drained from Shiina's face.

"Kuan..."

Just how many humans would need to be ground up to create what was now visible before their eyes?

"Shiina!"

As Kuan appeared, breaking through the Wind Blade's defensive barrier, Yula quickly confirmed the casualties.

"37 men."

A battle lasting perhaps 10 seconds, in which he had cut down more than half of the 60-man formation.

Cut them down.

"Graaah!"

Landing on the ground with a spinning motion, Kuan performed a solitary sword dance as if to calm his blade's fury.

Limping on one leg and wielding his sword with one arm, the sight was somewhat comical at first glance.

"Shiina... I'll protect her."

Each time he limped, the world shook, and each time his sword spun, nausea washed over the onlookers.

Yula realized.

"I can't predict what comes next. The logical flow from one movement to another has been completely destroyed."

This was the realm of the mindless sword.

This was why Kuan seemed to disappear and reappear from moment to moment in her sight.

The Wind Blade survivors returned to headquarters.

"We're sorry."

It was not something to be blamed for.

'Yes, this is a world where mistakes cannot be tolerated. The Wind Blade is the world's greatest swordsmanship organization.'

Implementing fluid dynamics with the human body was a realm that could not be reached through effort alone.

'Although we suffered many losses during the Great Purification, the newcomers filled the gaps with their genius.'

Even in formation combat rehearsals, their skills were so perfect they were barely different from veterans.

'But against Kuan, that man...'

Did even those minor gaps appear to him like enormous openings that divided life and death?

'37 men died that way.'

Lost in thought, Yula slowly lowered her sword and removed her owl mask.

'Parca Kuan.'

He was walking toward them limping on one leg, but whether he would continue doing so in the next moment was uncertain.

Cold sweat beaded on her forehead.

'It's murderously bizarre.'

She didn't know what would happen in the next moment, but Kuan would certainly execute it.

'In other words, that man is...'

An existence that had become equal to Yula at the summit, her counterpart.

"Stop."

The moment her sword aimed at Kuan's forehead, his steps halted for the first time.

As the landscape vibrated, the Wind Blade members gritted their teeth.

"Kugh!"

In terms of realm, Yula's accuracy in aiming her sword was probably at the atomic level.

'I can't catch him.'

This would be impossible unless Kuan also moved his body with comparable precision.

'He appears to have stopped, but he's actually still moving. Of course, humans could never observe this.'

Therefore, what had changed was the feeling.

"Kuan, I truly send you congratulatory applause. Today you have reached the pinnacle of technique."

"Therefore, I make this proposal again. This is the first time in my history. Become a member of the Wind Blade."

Resolve appeared in her eyes.

"I will give you the authority to lead the First Formation."

She was the leader of the Wind Blade.

"Captain."

Yula ignored her subordinate's words.

"You asked me before whether I wasn't ashamed to call collective swordsmanship the strongest. You lost a leg in return, but now you have the right to say such things. Lead the Wind Blade. This position is proof of the world's strongest swordsmanship."

Having never bent her convictions in her lifetime, everything she said was sincere.

Kuan looked up at the sky and answered.

"I'll... protect Shiina."

His somewhat slow speech made both the Wind Blade members and Shiina herself think eerie thoughts.

'No. That can't be.'

It was just some kind of realm.

'Right now I'm in danger, so he's forced to do something. So...'

It must be something that could be undone.

Unlike Shiina, who clung blindly to this hope, Yula finally understood everything.

"Is that so?"

That it had to be this way.

'How regrettable.'

To hide the emotion showing on her face, she put her owl mask back on.

"Kill him."

All the Wind Blade members except Yula scattered explosively and flew toward Kuan.

In the garden of Delta headquarters, Shirone and Kido were directing killing intent at each other.

"Shirone."

Kido moved only his lips.

"I don't want to fight you."

"Same here."

Though they were enemies, they knew each other's reasons for fighting all too well.

"I want to go to Uorin. That's all."

Not only Tormia but military forces from various Holy War nations would be desperate to kill the Empress.

"Why did you come?"

Shirone asked.

"Like you said, protecting Uorin is everything. Couldn't you have stopped her? Why did you join her?"

"Uorin..."

Sadness appeared in Kido's eyes.

"She doesn't like me."

"This is all I can do. If I don't give her what she wants, she'll leave my side."

'That's not true.'

Uorin wouldn't abandon Kido, but Shirone could understand Kido's heartbreaking feelings.

Shirone said.

"I'm worried about Teacher Shiina. And Mr. Kuan too."

Since Tormia had abandoned Shiina, Shirone was the only one who could rescue them.

'I've delayed here too long. Mr. Kuan won't be able to hold out much longer.'

Through Omega, he knew the combat strength of the 100 Wind Blade members.

'Especially Yula...'

As Shirone withdrew his hostility and turned his body, Kashan's royal guards moved slowly.

Though it was a ceasefire based on mutual necessity, as Kido passed Shirone, he said:

"I'm in your debt."

Shirone's eyes grew hot.

"Kido."

The two who had passed each other turned around, and Shirone asked with a smile.

"We're friends, right?"

Kido kicked off the ground and said:

"Of course."

Though none of the Wind Blade members screamed, Shiina wanted to cover her ears.

The sound of flesh being cut, bones breaking, air escaping from organs.

It was as if their bodies were screaming.

"Stop it now...!"

From the whirlpool of blood that had formed before her eyes, she couldn't tell what portion belonged to Kuan.

"Shiina!"

Kuan burst forth screaming like a demon, with rain of blood and flesh pouring down around him.

Now the Wind Blade numbered 24.

Having cut down 75 men alone, the Wind Blade's annihilation was already decided.

Yula muttered.

"Magnificent."

The Wind Blade is the wind.

The reason the Wind Blade was strongest was also because no one could avoid the wind, but...

"He's not being touched."

Kuan was avoiding the wind.

Lame, one-armed, one-eyed, one-eared, and now even his thoughts were probably not intact.

'No, there's no need to think.'

Watching the sword demon's blade dance, Yula shuddered at memories rushing from distant nostalgia.

'Was that it?'

She couldn't draw ideal swordsmanship in her head, but there was a feeling that transcended the five senses.

'The swordsmanship the girl dreamed of.'

A killing technique that could cut down ten thousand people while completely ignoring all strength-based elements.

'I wanted to become the strongest swordsman.'

She had become the leader of the Wind Blade, able to command 99 swordsmanship geniuses like her own limbs.

And now, the genius she had ruined was destroying all that meaning.

"Shiina..."

Each time he limped and drew his sword, the Wind Blade's black curtain was stained with red blood.

'I cut him.'

She had severed his Achilles tendon.

The path of the sword should have ended there, but ultimately Kuan had taken a long detour to arrive here.

'Was it to protect this woman?'

If the sword existed to kill someone, then Yula was certainly the world's strongest swordsman.

'Kuan's sword is...'

A sword to protect someone.

"Let's settle this."

Setting Shiina down on the ground, Yula walked toward Kuan, who had cut down 99 men.

'His back is open.'

The moment Shiina tried to enter Spirit Zone, Yula spoke first.

"Don't make a mistake."

How sensitive was she? Shiina wondered.

'I know a swordsman's sensitivity. It doesn't seem particularly different from other swordsmen's reactions. But clearly...'

The thought, or perhaps illusion, that she was much faster?

If the realm that humans cannot measure is feeling, then Yula's feeling was truly monstrous.

"If you want to fight, go ahead. But think carefully whether your actions will benefit or harm that man."

Shiina couldn't interfere.

'I don't even know how to help.'

Yula began walking again.

'I can reach him.'

Though the Wind Blade embodied fluid dynamics with their bodies, her realm was much deeper than that.

'My senses are in stillness.'

Even a calm water surface is actually countless atoms moving chaotically.

"The ultimate state of stillness within motion."

To Yula's eyes, Kuan seemed to flicker, but her sword aimed precisely at his heart.

"Here I come."

Kuan and Yula moved simultaneously.

The speed was pathetically slow compared to their capabilities, so Shiina was puzzled.

But what happened in the moment of collision, she could never know.

Wind blew, and the two who had quietly crossed paths maintained silence with their backs to each other.

The owl mask split in two, revealing Yula's pale, smiling face.

A stream of fresh blood ran down her forehead, past her nose bridge and lips to reach her chin.

"Ha... ha."

With not an inch of error in depth, it had split her chest and bisected her abdominal muscles while passing through her centerline.

Blood poured like a fountain from the linear gap, and the force of it made Yula's body fall backward.

"Kuan!"

Shiina ran to Kuan, who had collapsed to his knees with a thud.

"Kuan! Are you okay? Kuan!"

"Didn't reach."

At Yula's voice, Shiina turned with wary eyes.

"Almost reached... but didn't reach."

What was the reason?

'Ah.'

Yula's confused gaze settled calmly.

'Something to protect?'

To Yula, Uorin was merely a target to be eliminated for the sake of her beliefs.

"How nice for you."

Yula had the expression of someone who was ready.

"You've become the most noble person in this world. More than Kashan's Empress."

There was no breath left to exhale.

'I'm sorry, Your Majesty.'

Hoping that someday you would meet someone who would truly die for you, she breathed her last.

"Kuan, Kuan."

Shiina shook Kuan again.

"Shiina."

"Kuan! Are you conscious?"

Color returned to her face, but seeing Kuan's condition, she turned pale again.

"...I'll protect her."

She shook her head.

"No. It's all over now. You won. So you can come back now."

"Shiina... I..."

"No!"

Shiina couldn't accept it.

"How can this be! Without even telling me! You said you'd stay by my side! Never again, never again...!"

You said you wouldn't leave.

Finally realizing the contradiction in those words, she buried her face in Kuan's chest.

"Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!"

Seeing the flesh scattered everywhere, Yula's corpse, and Kuan muttering the same words over and over, Shirone realized.

"Teacher..."

Before Shiina's sobbing figure, he couldn't think of any words of comfort.
