[532] Under Coder (3)

Rian, Fermi, Marsha followed behind Miro as they crossed the curtain of sunset.

In the dark space like the night sky, blue-glowing lines raced vertically, and starlike twinkling lights descended along those lines.

"Don't you feel like we're falling?"

"To be precise, it's information being transmitted. Gravity has nothing to do with it."

Rian walked toward where Miro was.

"Is this the <Under Coder>?"

"You could call it the entrance. Since we've escaped from Drimo, our information is treated as minority conception. When the effects of Dream Star wear off, we'll be decomposed too."

"It's not dangerous, is it?"

"No. Since our avatars aren't damaged. Because there's no chance of combining with other information, we'll descend in perfect condition."

"What about Arius?"

Come to think of it, the blue-furred dog was nowhere to be seen.

"He's not an avatar. He's an illusion that appeared through our mental channel. It seems our minds can't reach this far."

Miro brushed it off casually.

"It doesn't matter. He'll find a way to contact us on his own. If not, then there's nothing we can do."

As the effects of Dream Star wore off, the four people's bodies began decomposing into sparkling particles.

The decomposition that started from their limbs passed through their lower and upper bodies, and when only their faces remained, Fermi spoke.

"See you in the intermediate layer."

"What does that mean..."

Before Marsha could finish speaking, everyone's bodies decomposed into particles of light and descended along the <Under Coder>.

"Ow, my head."

As Miro frowned and came to her senses, Rian, Fermi, and Marsha were making similar expressions.

"What do you mean by intermediate layer?"

Fermi looked around as he spoke.

"This place right here."

In a square room of about 100 pyeong, hundreds of mirrors were mounted.

"This is the midpoint of <Under Coder>, a virtual space created by humans. They recycle discarded junk information from Drimo to create small worlds. If humans with intact avatars enter, they all pass through filters and arrive here."

Standing before human footprints imprinted in <Under Coder>, Marsha realized anew just how exploration-obsessed a species humans were.

"Then what are these mirrors?"

"They're passages connecting virtual worlds created by designers. They're called links. The mirrors are communication protocols they established."

"Hmm, so they're connected to different virtual worlds? What kinds of worlds are there?"

Fermi cast Depreciation Transaction.

A chip with a drawing of horizontal and vertical lines of light interwoven like a honeycomb went down his throat.

"Information magic Information. It decodes the intermediate layer's protocols into real-world information."

When he deployed Spirit Zone, the names of virtual worlds and designers' code names appeared on the mirror surfaces in real-world language.

"Here at the entrance to the intermediate layer, links to the currently most popular virtual worlds are installed. I'll read off a few, so pick a world that appeals to you."

Fermi listed the world names and designers' code names.

The Taste of Humans

A Love Story Between Dogs and Humans  
ID: Animal Lover

It's Fine Even Without Limbs
ID: Only Head Remains

"Stop!"

Marsha held out her hand as if it wasn't worth reading any more.

Though they seemed trivial, when you thought carefully about the world names, they conjured things that could never be tolerated in reality.

'Worlds where you eat human flesh, engage in bestiality, or perform bodily mutilation.'

Even more outrageous were the code names connected to the world names, clearly showing not an ounce of guilt.

"It's a festival of all kinds of minority conceptions. You mean if you enter those worlds, you can actually try those things?"

"Some people just watch, and some actually play. The ratio is about 50-50."

"It's obviously not free, right?"

At Marsha's words, Fermi chuckled.

The very thought that they would have created such worlds expecting compensation showed that Marsha was a normal person.

"Unfortunately, 80 percent of the content is free. Most of the designers are just crazy bastards with no attachment to the real world. If you use paid content, you can pay with Dream Star. All they need is Dream Star, and it can be exchanged for currency in reality too."

Miro said.

"I get the gist. So where do we go?"

"Whatever link you take, the information will keep falling. No matter what you choose, the final destination is The Abyss."

"Then let's go there."

When Miro pointed to a large mirror, Fermi used Information magic to examine what kind of world it was.

The Dead Tell No Tales
ID: Squishy Corpse

It was a world where people played around with corpses, and Fermi judged this was appropriate for beginners.

"Taking a link is simple. It's the principle of the reverse world. You just put your palm against the mirror like this..."

Fermi's figure disappeared.

"Hmm, it's certainly simple."

Next, when Miro put her palm against it, the reality of herself and her reflection in the mirror reversed, and the scenery changed completely.

With the feeling that the reflection in the mirror had been her true self from the beginning, Miro realized what the principle of the reverse world was.

"Convenient. With this, you could transmit information wholesale."

Fermi, who had been waiting, shrugged his shoulders.

"That's right."

After Rian and Marsha arrived as well, the group began descending through the worlds of the intermediate layer in earnest.

The virtual worlds built by humans varied in size, and each had unique compositions and environments, but they all shared the common trait of horrific acts being committed that were hard to watch with open eyes.

Terrible screams, disgusting acts, the expressions of people driven mad by pleasure or pain - they were already a different species from human.

By the time they reached the fortieth world via links, even Marsha, an irregular eater, was mentally exhausted.

While Miro with her Unfeeling Heart could endure indefinitely, it was unexpected that Fermi was even humming and enjoying himself.

Miro, who had been glancing at Fermi, asked.

"You seem quite familiar with places like this. How often have you used <Under Coder>?"

"I don't come these days. Around age twelve I was completely addicted to living here, but lately I haven't found it interesting."

'Twelve years old...'

Though it was her nephew she was meeting after 20 years, Miro could be certain that Fermi was definitely not a normal human.

Unbothered by the terrible screams, Fermi continued.

"I was once a designer here too. The world's name was Vengeance Is Mine. It was a virtual world where you could implement targets of hatred and take revenge to your heart's content. Aunt, you suffered quite a lot of torment from me there."

Even if it was virtual, walking alongside the person who had implemented information identical to yourself and tortured it would be creepy.

But Miro actually burst into laughter.

"Hohoho! It must have been quite popular?"

"No. Initially it made it into the top 1,000 popularity rankings of the intermediate layer, but guests gradually decreased. Since it couldn't survive in the intermediate layer without new information updates, the world I created eventually sank to The Abyss."

"Hmm, that's unfortunate."

"I was hurt in my pride at the time. While worrying about how to gain popularity, I realized one thing. Was I having fun torturing and killing Aunt? When I thought about it, I wasn't. What do you think the reason was?"

Miro put her finger to her chin and pondered.

"Umm, well. Because it wasn't real?"

"No."

Fermi stopped walking and turned to look at Miro.

"Because I 'knew' it wasn't real."

Only what is trapped is real.

The moment the lid opens, all concepts burst out and transform into new meanings.

"The moment you think 'I can leave anytime,' all sensations become fake. I haven't come here since then. It's not a place suited for a realist like me."

'I can leave anytime.'

Miro savored Fermi's words.

Though it was a fact everyone knew in virtual worlds created by humans, truly no one in this reality, including herself, could sincerely think that way.

"We've arrived now. This is the last virtual world."

The place they arrived at via link was a virtual world where people cut off parts of their bodies and exchanged them with each other.

Though it was unclear why this was enjoyable, those with severed limbs were ecstatic, and humans with multiple arms attached had satisfied expressions as they fell into narcissistic rapture.

When they escaped from that, they finally came to a room with dark lighting and only one mirror installed.

Fermi cast Information magic to decode the information.

Warning. This is the exit of the intermediate layer. Those who do not wish to go to The Abyss should wake from their dreams.

"...is what it says."

"Waking from dreams - do we just wait?"

"There's a special method. Anyone who enjoys <Under Coder> knows it. But that's only possible because it's a world made by humans. The Abyss is an automatic aggregate of minority conceptions. No information will show us any consideration."

Fermi gave a final warning.

"I'm warning you, but once you enter The Abyss, even I don't know how to return. Perhaps there's no such method at all."

"No, there definitely is."

Miro said.

"Because my friend returned. So there must definitely be a way."

Of course, there was no need to mention that he had gone back there again.

Marsha asked.

"Before we go, I'd like to know - in what exact state does Shirone exist in The Abyss? If it's a completely different world, there's the matter of adaptation too. I doubt there's a magic school there."

"The combination patterns of information are unpredictable by humans. However, he'll be combined in the most suitable form for The Abyss world. If there's a magic school, he'll naturally be a student there."

"Hmm, so he exists in a state combined with the most familiar information."

"Yes. That's why we need you two."

The two people were none other than Marsha and Rian.

"You mean since we shared intense communion in reality, we'll have high information affinity with Shirone?"

"Yes. The more closely your information penetrates, the higher the probability of restoring Shirone's damaged information. In other words, we'll sever the information combined with The Abyss and inject your information."

"Good, I understand. Then let's go in."

The four people stood side by side, looking at the final mirror leading to The Abyss.

The method of return was still completely unknown, and that world would have the worst information accumulated, no less terrible than <Under Coder>'s intermediate layer.

'The destination of information. In other words, the end of this world.'

It was natural to be nervous since it was an unknown world that even Fermi, who had frequented <Under Coder> like eating meals, had never descended to.

Miro took a deep breath and pointed at the mirror.

"Well then, who should go first? Who will be the first tourist on this trip to hell?"

Without giving anyone else a chance to step forward, Rian spoke.

"I'll go down and wait."

As Rian extended his hand, two Rians pressed their right hands together with the mirror as the boundary.

The Rian in the mirror became real while the Rian who had been in reality disappeared as if he had been an illusion from the beginning.

"Wow, truly a man."

"Hmph, let's go. Surely there can't be anything worse than death?"

After Marsha took the link and escaped, Miro turned to Fermi with a sly grin.

"You have to go too, right? Don't you have money to earn? Or were you planning to send only me and escape?"

"Of course not."

Fermi smiled bitterly and put his hand against the mirror.

It wasn't that he hadn't considered it, but he didn't think he could get revenge on the infamous Miro just by dropping her into The Abyss.

'I'll take it step by step.'

As Fermi entered The Abyss, Miro looked at her reflection in the mirror and smiled.

"It's okay. Because you're there."

Leaving behind words others couldn't understand, Miro took her first step toward the endlessly falling hell.
