The End of Humanity (4)

In the 1.5th floor of Ymir's mind, Shirone dreamed.

A transcendental dream.

Time didn't matter in dreams, but the volume of data he was receiving was enormous.

Such a grand story.

The enlightenment that a man called the first Yorahan gained from terrible tragedy.

This was when humanity had finished tribal life and centralized systems were beginning to emerge.

"Phew, it's hot."

Tyrants overflowed, and the lives of the ruled were far more miserable than in Shirone's world.

It was an era when many philosophers and seekers questioned life and expounded their thoughts.

"Meeting people is so difficult."

The twenty-year-old seeker Yorahan was also wandering the world with the spirit of seeking in his heart.

He opened his water bottle and tilted his head back, but only a single drop of water fell.

"Smack, smack."

He was severely thirsty from climbing the mountain path, but couldn't find any place with water.

"At this rate... I might actually die." After saying that, he burst into laughter.

"Still, I've lived a decent life. There are countless lives suffering under tyranny."

War, and more war.

The ambitions of those in power were endless, and conflicts with other nations occurred almost daily.

'War must be stopped.'

Some say political systems must be changed, others say economic systems must be changed.

'There are limits to what can be sustained by the sacrifice of a few. If everyone showed just a little consideration, even wars would stop.'

He believed in the human heart.

"Alright! Let's go!"

After all, he needed to meet someone to spread his message, didn't he?

It was two days after his spirited mountain journey that he first felt an ominous sign.

"Huff. Huff."

Even though he had traveled to many remote places, this was the first time he'd encountered such a completely isolated region.

'Where... where am I?'

He couldn't even see the common animals, just trees and grass-like things.

Though he had studied herbalism to some extent, these were plants he'd never seen before, and yesterday he'd gotten diarrhea from eating the wrong thing.

'Dehydration is getting severe.'

Had he lost consciousness?

In his intermittently returning awareness, Yorahan seemed to spend about another day.

'Is this how it ends?'

It was regrettable to leave without spreading his beliefs, but it wasn't unjust.

'Someone else must have the same thoughts as me. Well, who am I anyway? I wasn't even popular.'

In that era, it was impossible to even guess how close to impossible Yorahan's dream was.

'I feel drowsy.'

Just as he was about to accept eternal sleep, he heard the sound of footsteps on grass, followed by someone calling out.

"What are you doing here?"

Yorahan's eyes snapped open, and beautiful adult faces - a man and woman - came into his view.

"Pe, people..."

His hoarse throat was frustrating.

"Save me."

The man and woman exchanged glances, shrugged their shoulders, then asked Yorahan again.

"How should we save you?"

"Water, some water. Something to drink... please... I beg you."

"Water? The water is in the village."

As Yorahan, who felt like he might die at any moment, fell into despair, the woman asked.

"Can't you wait?"

What would happen if he couldn't wait? he thought, but his head was already nodding.

"Alright. Wait just a moment."

The woman closed her eyes.

At first he thought she might be praying for his soul, but soon something amazing happened.

Trees all around began to shake, and countless water droplets started spraying from the leaves.

'What is this? A dream?'

Since it was an era when magic was the privilege of a few, he could only think that.

But as water droplets fell into his open mouth, his brain secreted powerful pleasure chemicals.

"Ahh. More, more..."

"Let's gather water and give it to him."

At the man's suggestion, the woman gathered leaves and stuck them together with mud to make a bowl.

"Here you go."

As she poured water for him, Yorahan's Adam's apple bobbed as if it might pop out.

"Ahh."

Could words describe the feeling of that moment?

'I'm alive.'

And so he fell asleep.

Yorahan slowly lifted his eyelids at the sound of laughter from outside.

Birds were chirping.

As he wondered how long it had been since he'd heard birdsong, he suddenly sat up.

"What, what?"

Looking around, it was a small hut, and he was lying on a bed woven from grass.

"It wasn't a dream?"

As he lowered his feet to the floor, the tent flap opened and two people entered.

A boy and girl who looked about seventeen, beautiful, but what stimulated Yorahan was his sense of smell.

'Flower scent.'

Humans whose bodies smelled like flowers.

They had come in carrying water for washing, and were startled to see the awakened Yorahan.

"Oh? You're awake? I should tell the chief."

"Wait, wait a moment."

He called out urgently and they stopped.

"Sorry, but where is this? What happened? Did you save me by any chance?"

"No. It was my brother and sister who saved you. I need to go tell the chief, may I go?"

The way they asked permission was suspicious, but Yorahan thought they were just gentle by nature.

"Yes. I'm being too shameless since you even saved my life, but could I possibly get some food?"

Now that his thirst was over, he was on the verge of starvation.

"Food..."

After thinking for a moment, she said.

"Ah! There's food that Sister Armang eats. Should I bring some of that?"

"Yes, thank you. I don't have money right now, but once I recover, I'll repay you somehow."

After they went outside, it wasn't long before a plate containing red flesh was brought in.

"Here, please eat."

Contrary to what he had imagined, the food was raw meat that had only been washed of blood with water.

"Well, there are cultural differences between regions, but this is unusual. It would taste better cooked over fire."

"Eek!"

They flinched.

"The Hwajok don't use fire. Fire destroys everything. Nature... and us too."

"Hwajok?"

It was a name he'd never heard.

In any case, he didn't sense hostility, so Yorahan bowed his head to them.

"Thank you. I'll eat well."

"Um... then can I go report to the chief now? They told me I must tell them."

"Huh?"

Yorahan blinked.

"Didn't you already go?"

"You asked for food, brother. So naturally I couldn't have gone and come back."

Finally, he felt something strange.

'Something feels subtly different. Is this a culture where consideration for others is the highest priority?'

If so...

'God has guided me to this place. This is an opportunity to test my ideas.'

Yorahan said while chewing the raw meat.

"Alright, go ahead."

After confirming the tent was closed, he swallowed the raw meat and put on his shoes.

"They say hunger is the best seasoning."

As he quietly slipped out of the hut, the Hwajok were smiling in the sunlight.

'Hmm, it doesn't feel hostile.'

The atmosphere was completely different from any village he had experienced, melting away his tension.

As he toured the village feeling the Hwajok's gazes, he heard a fierce woman's voice.

"Why did you bring in a human!"

Even common shouting from human society sounded severely out of place here.

'Human. She must be talking about me. Then...'

Are the Hwajok not human?

He walked toward the hut where the sound came from and peered inside through the windowless window.

'Wow.'

All Hwajok were beautiful, but the woman sitting in the chair had an even greater dignity about her.

'She smells nice. Lotus, perhaps?'

Chief Rutia said.

"Armang, don't get excited. The Hwajok must help humans. That is the will of our predecessors."

Yorahan looked at the woman named Armang.

'Scary.'

Her fierce eyes and rough hair reaching to her waist clearly distinguished her from other Hwajok.

"Humans?"

Armang stomped her foot down with a thud.

"You know how much those humans have oppressed us. The reason we have to hide and live deep in the mountains where people don't tread is because of that, isn't it?"

"I too know the danger of humans. But I cannot pretend not to see when I do see. If we understand and embrace them, someday they will cherish us."

"We'll die before that happens. We'll all die."

"Armang."

"What will you do when that human wakes up? Aren't you afraid of what he might demand of us? Will we run away again this time? Must we abandon the village we've cultivated for hundreds of years and flee?"

The extreme passivity of the Hwajok was as intense as humans' yearning for free will.

"One person should be fine. And we have you, Armang, don't we?"

An extremely rare carnivorous plant in nature.

To eat meat, one must hunt, which meant having active will.

"...It's frustrating. Lady Rutia doesn't understand. There are strong ones among humans too."

Armang, who had fought long to protect the Hwajok, never underestimated humans.

"I could block ordinary ones with the Small World Creation. But if that man is..."

As Armang pointed outside the village, she finally noticed Yorahan standing outside the window.

"You!"

Startled, Yorahan hid below the window, but Armang immediately rushed out.

"Sorry! I'm sorry!"

Armang grabbed the collar of the constantly apologizing Yorahan and dragged him into the hut.

"Agh!"

"Eavesdropping like a thief! I'll kill you!"

Armang grabbed the only metal kept on the chief's shelf - a longsword.

Though it could only be used for hunting and combat, this wasn't a situation to be picky.

'He heard everything about the Hwajok. If this man exploits our characteristics...'

It would lead to terrible consequences.

As the gleaming longsword shone above her head, Yorahan held out his hand.

"Wait! There's no need to kill me!"

"Shut up."

Just as she was about to swing the sword, she felt her nerves stiffening from her feet touching the ground.

"Armang."

Rutia spoke.

"To handle metal without my permission. Isn't it that humans aren't the only danger to the Hwajok?"

The reason the lotus bloodline was chief was because their Small World Creation power was the strongest.

Since they were connected to each other, it was perfect compromise and persuasion with neither activity nor passivity.

Armang lowered her sword sullenly.

"I'm sorry."

If humans were dangerous because of their potential for killing intent, Armang wasn't much different.

"Go outside now."

After Armang left the hut, having placed the sword back on the shelf, Rutia approached.

"I'm glad you're safe. Please sit down first."

"Ah, thank you."

Yorahan, who had already crossed death's threshold several times, sat in the chair in a daze.

"As chief, there's something I want to ask. How did you come here? This is a place where even animals rarely come, and many poisonous plants grow, so people don't come here."

It was a village cultivated that way.

"Ah, I'm a seeker. I'm someone who travels the world spreading ideas. But I'm definitely not unemployed! I know several academic fields..."

Rutia tilted her head.

"I don't understand well. Doesn't every human spread their thoughts?"

"Um, so these are special thoughts. The direction of humanity, how we should live, things like that."

"Ooh."

Rutia showed interest.

"What an unusual profession. Could you tell me your thoughts too?"

Since this had never happened before, Yorahan was flustered.

"Uh, so first, the foundation is love. Of course, material things change people's hearts..."

Even while he rambled on, Rutia listened without the slightest movement.

"...Well, that's the gist of it, haha! Actually I don't usually ramble like this, but I'm not in my right mind."

As Yorahan was making excuses, his expression became blank.

"Ex, excuse me?"

Rutia's shoulders, as she sat demurely, began to tremble, then tears flowed down.

"I see."

She smiled like a flower in full bloom.

"What a truly beautiful world that would be."
