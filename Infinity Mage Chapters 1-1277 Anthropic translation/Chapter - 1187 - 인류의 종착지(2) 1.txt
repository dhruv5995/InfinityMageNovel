The Destination of Humanity (2)

Chemical Corporation System Control Branch.

The assembly hall where the purgatory selection tournament had been held was completely devastated from the aftermath of battle.

Noise from outside poured in through the hole that Son Yu-jeong had escaped through with Morta Singer.

'Is it the blackìŠ¹?'

There must be a reason why they weren't entering the building, but the outside didn't seem safe either.

Lete spoke.

"Yahweh, break your stubbornness. This is the last time I'll treat you as our top client."

As the mana of reality amplified, the agents' power had become unimaginably strong.

Even the administrators were affected since their hidden codes were also based on mana.

"My mind hasn't changed. Six-brain, tell me how to purify the central processing unit."

It was a device made of aborted children that calculated the karma of the hidden world.

"It's impossible, I tell you..."

Lete, who had let out a sigh, glared with wide eyes.

"How many times must I say it!"

As purifying flames blazed from her body, Lee Sa-jin trembled in fear.

"Then there's no compromise."

"...Fine."

The assembly hall doors opened and an enormous number of demons completely sealed the entrance.

"From today, this place will become a demon sanctuary. Yahweh, your grave will be built here."

As time passed, the mana would grow stronger, and eventually become insurmountable.

'There must be a way.'

What was Lete... hiding?

Engine Room.

Ethella gazed at the brain made of fetuses clustered between city-sized cliffs.

'Poor children.'

Limbo carries no sin.

They were eliminated without being able to do anything, simply for the reason that they existed.

Yet the reason they were in hell was solely because of their attachment to life.

'They must want to live.'

But what would they do by living like this?

There was only one way to purify the six-brain - when they themselves gave up on life.

'Would it be possible?'

When they're struggling so desperately to live.

"Ugh..."

Ethella grimaced and bent over from the rising pain in her lower abdomen.

'It's afraid.'

Though still a life as small as a seed, it was desperately trying to prevent becoming limbo.

'I'm sorry.'

My baby.

'Mommy has to resolve those children's resentment. That's why mommy came here.'

Through her master Raphael's sacrifice for Chagall, Ethella had learned love.

'I can do it.'

Now that she too was a mother, and another life was growing in her womb...

'I can soothe limbo's resentment.'

If the hidden world was purified that way, human life would become much better than now.

Ethella took a step forward.

"Huuuu..."

The moment she saw the deep, flaming abyss, a groan escaped her involuntarily.

Death wasn't frightening.

Having entered this place bound by the Taegeuk chains, she was fated to be unable to die even if she wanted to.

'How much will those children, and the children who were there before them, resent me?'

To become the great mother of aborted children and embrace all their pain before disappearing.

'I can do it. No, it's what I must do.'

If there was a reason for everything in this world, then carrying Chagall's child must also be fate.

'Chagall.'

Though connected by Taegeuk chains, Chagall didn't respond to Ethella's emotions.

Rather, what she felt through the chains was Chagall's endless rage, half-mad.

'You're also a pitiful person.'

If he hadn't been manipulated by God's law, he probably would have been someone who could have become a good friend.

'Assumptions are meaningless.'

Because the law stamps reality as it is, like a print.

"But..."

She wanted to assume.

'Humans can assume. Casting one's heart into all uncertainty. That's what the heart is.'

Chagall could have been a good person.

'I'll go with that thought.'

The moment she took another step, tremendous pain was felt from her womb carrying the fetus.

"Huuk!"

The small life didn't want to die.

"I'm sorry."

Ethella shed tears.

Having realized love, how could she not feel pity for her own blood growing in her womb?

"I won't let you live in this place."

Annihilation.

A pain much greater than the abdominal pain tore her heart to shreds, but her will didn't break.

"Let's go."

It was something that couldn't be done otherwise.

Chagall screamed like a snake.

"Kiiiii!"

Killing everything in sight indiscriminately, he actually saw nothing.

"Kk. Kkkkkk."

Wasn't he blind anyway?

Lost time, a life that could have been happy, the resentment of killing his benefactor after being mocked by God.

"What did I do so wrong!"

Was this what happened when human emotions were trapped in a pressure cooker and injected with rage?

While continuing meaningless murders without purpose or meaning, the enemies' resistance grew fierce.

'They suddenly became stronger.'

One level?

No, they seemed to have transcended two levels, and gradually wounds accumulated on Chagall's body.

There was no pain in his excited state, but eventually his strength gave out and he collapsed.

When he came to his senses, his condition was so serious that there wasn't a single uninjured part of his body.

"Damn, this crazy bastard."

Agents passed through areas littered with their colleagues' corpses and approached him.

Chagall gritted his teeth.

'My body won't move.'

As if he had forgotten how to exert strength, no power was entering his muscles.

"Hey, hey."

When an agent lifted his foot and pushed, Chagall's body toppled over sideways.

"Do you know where this is? You can't die anyway, right? I'll teach you what hell is like."

"Kk, kkkk."

Chagall, sprawled spread-eagle, heaved his lungs with unbearable tickling sensations.

"Hehe, laughing? Yeah, laugh all you want. I'll cut off your face and bury it deep underground. After about 100 million years in darkness, you'll realize your mistakes."

"Yeah... that sounds good."

If buried underground for 100 million years, would the resentment lodged in his chest ease a little?

'Could I forget everything?'

Perhaps this would be for the best.

'I can't torment that woman anymore anyway.'

Since he had learned the past.

'Kk, that sounds nice. Getting away from trash like me. Yeah, I'll be buried in the ground forever...'

That's when it happened.

Chagall, finally regaining his reason, felt Ethella through the Taegeuk chains.

The moment he realized what she was trying to do, every cell in his body convulsed.

'What?'

Was this really true?

Even knowing that the Taegeuk chains couldn't lie, it was unbelievable.

'Don't.'

Chagall didn't know what emotions he held toward Ethella.

He had simply lived swept up in storm-like rough emotions, vaguely hating something.

"Don't do it."

He could never see her again.

That single thought cleared Chagall's mind, which had always been covered by dark clouds.

"Don't do that."

That he hadn't been in his right mind.

"Kkkk! Look at this bastard's expression. Completely terrified, right? Well, it must be scary."

Indeed, Chagall's face was bloodless and even his lips were trembling.

'The baby. My baby in her womb.'

Unlike their trash father, the child who would grow up happily under a truly good mother...

"Huuk! Huuuuk!"

Squeezing his eyes shut and crying profusely, Chagall heard the administrator's voice.

Remaining purification time: 87 years, 2,875 kyeong, 3,241 trillion, 631 billion, 220,000 hours.

Roughly minus 10 billion hours.

The agents watching Chagall wail pointed fingers and laughed.

"Too good to watch alone? Let's cut off his head and hang it on the wall first. When will he be buried... gak."

The agent with a rapid-fire sword lodged in his neck had dozens of holes appear in his body simultaneously.

"Get out of the way."

As Chagall, showing the whites of his eyes, charged forward, the remaining ones hastily assumed battle positions.

"This bastard, where does this strength come from...!"

Before the words could finish, rapid-fire swords pouring from all directions shredded their bodies like buckshot.

"Get awaaaay!"

Chagall's muscles began tearing as he rushed back toward where Ethella was.

'Please...'

Let him make it in time.

Ethella had finished her resolve.

"I'm sorry."

Though Chagall's emotions were transmitted through the chains, her heart didn't change.

The relationship between the two was like tangled thread that only became more knotted the more you tried to untangle it.

'This is the only way.'

The time they had known was reset, and the child in her womb wasn't the fruit of love.

"For good."

As tears flowed down Ethella's cheeks, her legs moved beyond the cliff.

Chagall grabbed the chains.

"Wait!"

He pulled the chains with all his might, but the Taegeuk bonds where no one could claim priority.

At that moment, Chagall's eyes widened.

"Ah, ahhh..."

His whole body trembled as if struck by lightning, and his weakened knees hit the ground with a thud.

"Uaaaah!"

Remaining purification time: 87 years, 2,875 kyeong, 3,241 trillion, 502.8 billion, 70,018 hours.

Nearly 130 billion hours had been purified.

"Why! Why! Why!"

Among the countless times he had tormented her, if there had been even a single moment of tenderness.

'You stupid fool!'

No, even just before parting, if he had stayed by her side instead of going mad.

"No! It's a lie!"

He could have avoided losing Ethella.

"Uaaaah!"

They could have been happy.

"The chains, the chains."

He fumbled for the chains, his only hope, but Ethella's emotions weren't transmitted.

"Why, whyyy?"

All programs were dead inside the main system that managed karma.

Chagall lifted his broken body and ran down the corridor with a terrified expression.

'I'm not late! I can't be late!'

Remaining purification time...

An emergency message sounded in the assembly hall.

Warning! Core data in the engine room is being disrupted! Handle immediately!

Lete raised her head.

"What?"

If something went wrong with the central processing unit, all karma of the hidden world would be completely reset.

"Impossible. Those with karma cannot access the six-brain. Even if you destroy the form, the law remains the same, so the core data won't be disrupted."

Romy Ethella. It's Limbo.

Lete was annoyed.

"Stop talking nonsense! That woman's karma is..."

She suddenly realized.

"Ah."

It's Limbo.

What sin could there be for a life sleeping unknowingly in the womb?

'Teacher Ethella.'

Hearing the message, Sirone found the answer to the puzzle he had been unable to solve.

'Chagall's child...'

The circumstances were sufficient.

'If the calculation system disappears, it becomes impossible to calculate karma. I can obtain the true voice.'

What remained was how to break through the situation where almost all forces of the building had gathered.

"Give up your lingering attachment, Yahweh. We're still getting stronger. You can't leave here."

"You knew from the beginning, didn't you? The method to annihilate the six-brain, the aborted fetuses."

"...I didn't lie. If I had known Ethella was pregnant, my words would have been different."

She would have killed her before even asking.

"Die."

Just as Lete ignited the flames of purification, a sharp wind sound was heard from the 13th floor.

"Huh?"

Lines were drawn across the landscape, and the demons' bodies caught by those lines began to burn.

"Ge, Gehenna...! Uaaaah!"

As the demons turned to fire were absorbed into the great sword, Lian standing outside the door became visible.

"Sorry, Sirone."

Rumble, rumble, rumble...

The sound of stones grinding was heard from the outer wall that had fitted back together while still cut.

"They all ran away, Purgatory."

"Haha."

Due to the collision between Havitz and the Wizard, variables had also arisen in the hidden world.

'This is really driving me crazy.'

Lete grimaced in every way.

'That thing remained.'

No matter how strong the demons had become, Gehenna's sword would absorb all the mana.
