The Cycling World (1)

Sirone stared at the enormous eye that appeared between the gates of the Maika ruins.

Though shrouded in a translucent veil, it definitely looked like an eye, and seemed alive.

"Who are you?"

There was no answer, but it occurred to him that they might not understand each other's language.

When he walked sideways using the gate as a reference point, surprisingly, the eye moved to follow Sirone.

'It's watching me.'

If this was a being from the outside world, then all the truths humanity had known until now would crumble.

"You know I'm here. Please show me some kind of evidence, anything."

Just because the gate of an ancient civilization had opened didn't prove it was the outside world.

'I need to hear it directly. No, even if it's not sound but something else, anything that could serve as evidence.'

It would be meaningless unless something more than a mechanical reaction came from inside the gate.

Then the eye blinked its eyelid.

It might or might not be a special signal, but Sirone asked with anticipation.

"Is that place the outside world? If there's a reason you can't speak, blink your eyelid twice."

There was no reaction.

No matter what words he used to persuade it, the eye seemed to be conducting activities separate from Sirone's existence.

Facing the final truth but unable to take even one step forward, Sirone became angry.

"Tell me. Why do we exist? Where did we come from, and where are we going?"

Looking at the indifferent eye, it seemed as if it had never been interested from the beginning.

'I can't give up.'

Sirone tried every method that came to mind one by one.

The result was a complete failure.

Unable to elicit any meaningful reaction, Sirone reached mental exhaustion.

"This is difficult."

Perhaps everything Sirone had tried might be just one simple thing to the eye.

'No matter what a bug does, to human eyes it just seems to be wriggling.'

Sitting down on the spot, Sirone looked around the Maika ruins with no trace of human presence.

'It's a lonely place.'

The feeling that there was truly nothing seemed like proof that god was indifferent.

'There was a god with a heart.'

Lost in memories for a moment, Sirone smiled bitterly and asked the eye.

"Is Guffin there?"

He was just missing him, not expecting anything.

"I mean Maclean Guffin. He's my father. I hope he's doing well. I miss him."

At that moment, the eye blinked twice for the first time.

"Huh?"

At the first groundbreaking change since arriving here, Sirone jumped to his feet.

"Did you just answer? If you know something...!"

Before he could finish speaking, the eye disappeared beyond the veil, and Sirone bit his lip.

'Come back. Come back, I said.'

It probably wasn't that Sirone's feelings got through, but the eye reappeared.

Kiii...!

A powerful high-frequency sound burst out, making Sirone frown and step back while bending at the waist.

"Ugh!"

It seemed like it was trying to convey something, but it was completely undecipherable even with the Ultima System.

'Let's not try to understand.'

Even the tiniest fragment of the signal the eye was transmitting would transcend Nane's sermon.

Emotions close to questioning were transmitted, then after a moment the high-frequency sound stabilized.

"Shindang."

Sirone's eyes flashed open.

'I can interpret it.'

Like with Giyorgi, it was information coming in reverse, but it was definitely this world's protocol.

"...prohibited silver finger in-ra-cle-mac."

The moment he heard that far, a tremendous roar erupted and knocked out Sirone's consciousness.

'No! I can't end it here...!'

He tried to endure somehow, but the entire Maika ruins were scattering into dust.

"Ugh!"

When Sirone returned to reality wrapped in a magnetic field, Poine rushed over.

"Messiah! Are you alright?"

"Huff! Huff!"

Not even recognizing that this was reality, Sirone reviewed the situation from moments before.

"I heard it."

"What? What do you mean..."

Though nothing was organized yet, the shock from that time remained vivid in his memory.

"It tried to convey something to me."

While Poine and Kaios couldn't understand, Kalt's voice was heard.

"...I see."

When Sirone looked up, Kalt was leaning against a chair with an ecstatic expression.

"What happened?"

Behind the chair where Kalt sat, brain matter and blood were scattered like buckshot.

Poine said.

"His head exploded. Right after that, you reappeared, Messiah."

When Sirone climbed the stairs and reached Kalt, the dying gaze slowly moved.

"Did that eye... speak to you?"

Since obtaining enlightenment through the Oparts, there had been a question that endlessly tormented him.

What is there?

"Kalt."

Sirone felt a sense of kinship.

Though he didn't know his philosophy or thoughts, the emotion felt through the electric field was one.

'Where did we come from?'

Perhaps from the moment he opened the Spirit Zone, he had been running solely to find that answer.

'It's frustrating.'

Living day by day, eating and sleeping, reproducing, yet not knowing who we are.

'Humans, humanity...'

That fact was so frustrating it was unbearable.

"Still, it's fortunate. To be able to confirm it before dying. No, even dying is ridiculous."

The life faded from Kalt's eyes.

"Did I... really live in this world?"

It was his last words.

Sirone temporarily set aside the fact that he was a pirate and closed Kalt's eyelids.

'It was a dangerous journey.'

The fact that Kalt's brain was blown away when forcibly cut off from the ancient civilization's information meant...

'What if it had been me?'

He wouldn't have been easily defeated, but facing the outside world, it wasn't something he could guarantee.

'I need to find it myself.'

He needed a way to safely connect without being dominated by the Oparts.

"Brother, brother."

Jakra, freed from confinement, approached Kalt with an incredulous expression.

"He's really dead?"

After going behind the chair to confirm even the blown-off head, he raised both hands.

"Uhahahaha! Brother is dead! It's over now! From today, I'm the king of Dionas!"

Other pirates joined in.

"Damn! I thought I'd die from frustration! Every day spouting nonsense!"

Watching this scene, Kaios asked.

"What should we do?"

"First, restrain them all... handle the rest as you see fit."

Hearing Sirone's words, Jakra pressed his temples hard and revealed killing intent.

"Haha! It's already too late! My ability is... huh?"

Other pirates repeated the same actions as Jakra, but spatial jumping didn't work.

"Only Kalt had the Oparts. With his consciousness gone, you're all just ordinary humans."

While the pirates stood frozen with blank expressions, Sirone said to Cairns.

"Let the refugees in. I'll handle all other diplomatic procedures. And Miss Langie..."

Quick-witted Cairns bowed his head.

"Nothing will happen. If she wants, we'll repatriate her to her home country immediately."

Was Langie the problem?

If they could exercise Dionas's general authority, it would be a tremendous opportunity for Arachne.

'Of course, it would become a debt to the Holy See, but...'

Politics was like that anyway.

Passing the pirates, when Sirone left the castle, Poine followed with quick steps.

"Messiah, what should we do?"

"For now... how about resting a bit?"

They had been protecting 20,000 refugees without a single comfortable day.

"That's a good decision. But what about after that?"

"We should do what we can."

Just because they discovered evidence of the outside world didn't change today's work.

"It would be a lie to say I'm not troubled. But someday we'll find the ultimate answer too. And..."

Sirone looked back at Poine.

"For that day to come, we must first live, mustn't we? Day by day, doing our best."

That's how they should continue living.

"I see."

Realizing that a heart of universal love still existed in the world, Poine smiled with relief.

Lunar Surface.

Nane looked down at the human planet.

'Looking down?'

On the moon floating alone in space, direction would be meaningless, but that's actually how it was.

"What is important?"

Observing from the moon, even the tragedies occurring on that blue planet seemed like someone else's business...

"Why must there be suffering?"

Nane's heart ached even more.

"Buddha."

Shura saw the sermon swords densely planted within a 100-meter radius trembling.

"It's gradually becoming dangerous."

Since it was a sermon that provided an environment for living beings to survive in space, it would be disastrous if destroyed.

A strange cry penetrated the invisible barrier.

"Kiaaa! Kiaaa!"

The space creature 'Destura,' made of mental substance, had been drawn by Nane's thoughts.

"Grrrrr! Bud... dha!"

When the scythe-like curved hand pierced the defensive wall, golden electricity spread like cracks.

"Does the universe reject me?"

Destura, which materialized through others' thoughts, was the main culprit blocking humanity's planetary escape.

Watching the monster gradually infiltrate the protective barrier, Shura swallowed.

'When specific thoughts perceive the universe, they inevitably swarm here. Truly a terrifying species.'

According to her investigation, even the dragons who attempted planetary escape 600 years ago were torn to pieces by Destura and crashed.

"Kraaa! Kraaa!"

When the giant monster thrust its upper body into the barrier, air escaped through the cracks.

"I'll block it."

Just as Shura crossed her hands to use Gestalt's ability, Nane spoke.

"A guest is coming."

Shura maintained her posture while looking toward the planet.

"What?"

Like a meteor piercing the atmosphere, something glowing red was coming toward the moon.

'Just escaping the planet's gravity would be difficult enough.'

Watching a bit longer, Shura realized the identity of the one wrapped in flames and sighed.

"Sigh, of all people..."

Son Yoo-jung, the avatar of the stone monkey, was coming by extending her staff planted in the ground infinitely.

Drawn by the moon's gravity and landing, she shortened her staff and spat savagely.

"Finally found you. Damn it."

Understanding by lip reading, Nane smiled.

"If it's the granddaughter of the Thunder Monkey, climbing to the moon wouldn't be strange, but..."

The Desturas that had been targeting Buddha began changing their target and approaching her.

"Do you know where this is?"

Glowing like heated metal, she examined the monsters then took out another staff.

Though Lian had split it in two before, since she could control the length, having two was the same.

Nane chuckled.

"Two-staff style?"

Son Yoo-jung, holding clubs in both hands, tilted her head crookedly and muttered.

"What trashy things..."

The moment an 8-meter tall Destura raised both arms from the lunar surface.

"Kiiiiii!"

Son Yoo-jung, emitting golden light from her eyes and baring the monkey's fangs, leaped out.

In the silence close to vacuum, the two staffs began frantically pounding the Destura.
