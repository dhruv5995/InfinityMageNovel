East Nation and West Nation (3)

Dawn broke over the wasteland.

"Shall we get going?"

As the three who had enjoyed their games all night got up and dusted themselves off, Shirone also stretched.

'That really was long.'

In the world of High Gear, you don't feel the urge to sleep.

Because you're already dreaming.

Perhaps the setting of replacing human bodies with machines was perfectly suited for Under Coders.

The Destruction God 707's group enjoying their games was, in some sense, just killing time.

Death Princess put on her helmet and asked.

"Yahweh2, are you okay? Weren't you bored? We would have been fine if you joined in partway through."

"No, I was just thinking about various things. But it's strange not sleeping."

With Yahweh's mental capacity, he could last a month in reality, but he felt no fatigue at all.

"Even dreams use the brain, so wouldn't you get tired if you play for too long?"

Strongest Codename said.

"Of course. That's why we sometimes disconnect and go out. But don't worry too much. High Gear operates on completely different time from reality."

"How much of a difference is there?"

It was natural that signals of simultaneous events weren't transmitted within High Gear.

It was like when Shirone dreamed, other versions of Shirone in different spaces couldn't see that dream.

"I haven't measured it precisely, but I heard from others that about 30 days here equals one day in reality."

"30 days..."

Shirone clicked his tongue.

'Then not even an hour has passed in reality yet. Is it because this is much deeper than Drimo?'

Contemplating the meaning of the artificial space humans had created, Shirone slung his rifle over his shoulder.

Destruction God 707 said.

"Let's go. Since we raised our levels somewhat yesterday, getting to Atogram should be quick now."

After walking for about 2 hours, they saw a 5-meter-high steel wall at the end of the wasteland.

"This is the final barrier of the Electronic Wasteland. If we get any closer, gun barrels will emerge from the wall and attack us."

"Right. To avoid that, we need this function—Reflex Response Correction."

Having hunted continuously on their way here, they had reached level 10.

Shirone examined the function through augmented reality.

Reflex Response Correction (On/Off)

A function activated at level 9 that analyzes external attacks and automatically evades them.

Death Princess explained.

"Reflex Response Correction is a function that counters auto-aim. Since they aim automatically, there's also a function to dodge automatically. But at the same level, auto-aim is much more efficient."

Shirone understood.

"Right, if Reflex Response Correction were superior, no one would be able to hit anything."

"Exactly. That's why experts sometimes turn off Reflex Response Correction. They trust their own abilities. Or sometimes they rapidly toggle it on and off to get only the necessary information. But at our low levels, it's essential. With level 10 output, we can't dodge bullets on our own. Ah..."

Death Princess realized.

"You could dodge them. Then you can keep it off. Your senses are still much better for now."

"No, I'll still try it. I need to get used to the system now so I can apply it later."

Having decided, Shirone's group began running toward the wall 500 meters away.

With level 10 output, they could clear 5 meters in height, but the problem was the bullets.

"Here they come!"

Hundreds of gun barrels emerged from the wall surface and opened fire on the group.

Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!

Dozens of trajectory lines appeared in augmented reality, each displaying hit probabilities.

As Reflex Response Correction—movement correction—was applied, Shirone's body moved rapidly.

"Huk! Huk!"

Since artificial intelligence was ultimately the user's brain within High Gear, it didn't feel foreign.

'This is really convenient. It's not accepting external thoughts, but rather thoughts are being triggered from within.'

Destruction God 707 shouted.

"We need to jump as far as possible! Once it drops below 50 percent, it gets difficult!"

The closer they got to the wall, the more heartbreakingly their evasion probability dropped.

Leaving the rain of bullets to the artificial intelligence, Shirone calculated the distance.

'Now.'

Increasing High Gear's output and kicking off the ground forcefully, all four people flew up simultaneously.

"Hyaaaah!"

Their battle cries traced parabolas, and finally all four cleared the wall and landed.

The gunfire ceased and silence returned.

"Phew, we made it."

As Shirone looked around, the artificial intelligence output spatial information.

Beginning of the Royal Road.

Beyond the wall was a dense forest of planted conifers with a path leading toward hills.

He looked up at bird sounds, but they were creatures—strong enemies at level 8 no less.

Death Princess said.

"The Beginning of the Royal Road is where users scattered throughout the Electronic Wasteland converge. No matter which wall you clear, you're designed to pass through this path."

Destruction God 707 added.

"Atogram is the first neutral zone you reach in High Gear. Even though it's mainly low-level users, it's surprisingly large in scale. It's where you decide between East Nation and West Nation. That's why rankers often come to hear about developments or sometimes scout."

It was the beginning of their real journey.

West Nation Guild Ranking #1, Ascension.

Powerful air burst from the user-customized capsule and the door popped open.

Inside the capsule stood a beautiful female form with curly blonde hair covering her eyes.

High Gear charging complete.

With a clicking sound, the machine shook and black flat shoes stepped onto the ground.

Height: 172 centimeters, weight: classified.

However, if it were a human body, it would be a slender figure not exceeding 55 kilograms.

User codename: Operator.

In High Gear, she was undoubtedly the strongest hardware and software combined.

"Mmm." Deliberately outputting her voice, she gracefully circled the room like a cat.

"Not bad."

The parts damaged in the previous raid had been repaired.

The building used entirely by the Ascension Guild was 23 stories high, and her room was on the 22nd floor.

Opening the door and stepping into the corridor, she found a small 130-centimeter girl standing by the elevator.

A codename appeared in Operator's vision: Little Witch.

Level 482, ranked 13th overall but 7th in the duel category—a skilled player.

'Troublesome.'

Not only had she become a ranker in record time, but she had a unique atmosphere that made her difficult to deal with.

Operator walked to the elevator and asked.

"What brings you to the 22nd floor?"

Since it was the guild leader's exclusive floor, guild members didn't come here without special business.

Little Witch turned around.

"Oh? You're online? I knocked but it was quiet."

A doll-like face, difficult to read expressions, and even her chin was exactly like a jointed doll's.

"I stepped out briefly for machine repairs. Were you looking for me? What's up?"

"Nothing really. Just... you've been strange lately."

This was exactly why Operator found Little Witch difficult to deal with.

"Do you happen to know someone called Yahweh?"

"Yahweh?"

Little Witch, who had been checking the elevator floor numbers, turned her head faster than usual.

But her emotions were unreadable.

"Hmm. If I know him, I know him; if I don't, I don't. But why Yahweh? Is this related to you becoming sentimental lately?"

"He's entered High Gear. I made a bet with him. If he beats me in a duel, I'll grant him what he wants."

"Oho."

Little Witch's face was still smiling, but Operator felt somehow unsettled.

The elevator door opened.

Little Witch entered first, then looked at Operator following her and asked.

"Why does that bother you?"

"I did some research, and he's far more impressive than I knew. That's fine up to that point. But that guy looked down on High Gear. He only thinks about using me for humans in the real world."

"Haha! Totally narrow-minded, isn't he?"

Though she seemed to be taking her side, there was somehow a sense that she was enjoying this.

That made Operator even more irritated.

"Of course, things won't go his way. He can't beat me anyway."

"Oops, the floor."

Little Witch pressed the first floor button and said.

"Of course, defeating the undefeated Operator is difficult. But it won't be easy. Actually, I know Yahweh somewhat, and that guy's no ordinary opponent either."

"I know."

That was why Operator was in such a foul mood.

"There was a lot of talk at yesterday's meeting too. He seems to have a special sense for time. He dodged rifle bullets while in bio state. That means he's already transcended humanity with his physical body."

"Wow, really? That's so cool."

At Little Witch's exaggerated acting, Operator slightly wrinkled her nose.

"The problem is that guy denied my world. I absolutely cannot lose to someone like that. Honestly, I'm pissed off. I'm going to smash him to pieces. Even if he still doesn't understand, I'll shock his real brain if I have to..."

"Operator."

At the changed tone of voice, she turned to see Little Witch looking at her with the same expression as always.

"I don't care what you do. I'll cheer you on too. But if you harm the real Yahweh..."

That's what made it even more unsettling.

"You die by my hand."

Machines couldn't swallow saliva, but in Operator's mind, she gulped.

"...Alright."

Even someone who turned away from reality knew how terrifying the outside world could be.

'Little Witch. Such a strange person.'

She considered asking the Tutorial Administrator, but breaking the rules was absolutely out of the question.

However, from observing her during guild life, there was one part she could guess.

'Probably... the former Empress of Kashan.'

According to her research, Kashan was currently ruled by an emperor named Gando.

'Unlimited financial resources. And incredibly knowledgeable. Above all... she knew top secrets of the Holy War.'

'Of course, I found out by hacking dreams.'

The most crucial evidence was that she couldn't access Little Witch's dreams by any method.

'There's also a chance she's not human.'

With the atmosphere having grown heavy, Operator finished her thoughts and continued.

"Don't worry. I'm not interested in outside affairs. Including your relationship with Yahweh, of course. I just need to smash Yahweh in High Gear and that's it."

"Hehe, I'll look forward to it."

As Little Witch's voice became gentle, Operator tilted her head slightly.

'So mysterious indeed.'

Why could she feel hundreds of emotions from a face that showed almost no expression changes?

"We're here."

The elevator arrived at the first floor.

"We're here."

At the final point of the Beginning of the Royal Road, Shirone took in the sight of the massive city in the distance.

Was this what the world looked like before the apocalyptic destruction?

"It's really incredible."

Countless high-rise buildings stretched up to the sky, with trains running between the buildings.

Destruction God 707 said.

"From now on, all that's left is getting seriously stronger. Of course, it might get seriously annoying too, but you'll be fine. We have the Son of Yolga with us."

Though Destruction God 707's group was on their second playthrough, their hearts were much more excited than their first time.

'We're going to enter the Golden Ring.'

Dreaming of a hopeful future, Shirone's group raced swiftly down the hill.

"Alright! Let's smash everything!"
