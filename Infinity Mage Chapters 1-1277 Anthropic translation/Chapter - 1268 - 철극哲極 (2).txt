Iron Extreme (2)

A shabby room in the underground facility.

Iruki was densely filling precious paper with numbers when Dorothy brought tea.

"Drink."

It was something other survivors couldn't even taste, but in reality it was just common grass boiled in water.

"Ugh..."

Iruki calmed his mind with the hot tea's steam, then sighed and put down his pen.

"It's a serious situation."

"Well. Even saying it's serious sounds like a joke."

Literally, humanity was annihilated.

He should feel relieved, but Iruki couldn't let his guard down.

"Isn't there a way to contact the surface forces?"

Jinseong-eum had done everything possible to evacuate everyone, but some had chosen to stay behind of their own will.

"You know that going up means death. They stayed knowing that risk."

Iruki looked down at the documents.

'Those who remained on the surface.'

The data was compiled from collected intelligence systems, but it wouldn't be completely accurate.

However, it was quite a large number, and Iruki quickly narrowed down the key figures among them.

'Ikael. Ashur. Wizard. Son Yu-jeong. Kira. Eden. And......'

Adrias Miro.

'A battle between good and evil. If Miro runs away, it ultimately means evil wins......'

Iruki asked.

"How is Gaold doing?"

"From what I hear, he's finally calmed down a bit. Of course, no one can approach him."

"I see."

Iruki buried his face in his hands and thought.

'Can they hold out?'

According to intelligence, the surface was no longer an environment where living beings could survive.

Buildings worldwide had crumbled to dust, creating dust storms that blocked visibility.

Havitz's Death Field was rapidly burning the earth, and demons would be roaming around looking for survivors.

"This place isn't safe either."

"Even though it's an underground facility, it's still underground in reality. If the surface is completely burned, passages will form here too."

Iruki nodded.

"Above all, Cell Burst."

According to what Sing had told them, the time for the Taegeuk's power to break was at most within 12 hours.

Dorothy asked.

"Can it be stopped? It's the most extreme code that can be executed in the outside world."

"We have to stop it."

Iruki stood up.

"We can't rely on Sirone. For the first time in his life, he'll be entering a battle for himself."

As his friend, he wanted to help somehow.

"What we can depend on is......"

The door opened.

"Guitarman."

Lobe Ranstin and Taira Lin were waiting.

In a place where survivors had gathered in a circle, the artists held a small concert.

Reina's piano melody beautifully harmonized with Maya and Elkiana's singing voices.

Raido, Kayden, and other soldiers could forget reality, at least for this moment.

When the performance ended, someone said.

"Bravo."

"Master Panier."

Even the once most famous musician in the world was now reduced to clapping along with everyone else.

Elkiana asked.

"Where have you been? I heard a famous artist came. Do you know them?"

"Of course I know. The guitarist I mentioned before is that guy. Lobe Ranstin."

Maya showed interest.

"The one who insisted on his own music to the end? But why isn't he coming here? I'd like to hear him play."

"He's not here to make music."

"Then?"

Panier pondered.

He'd heard roughly from Fermi, but it was still hard to believe.

'Magic Seven.'

As he sat down, the artists gathered around.

"Artists are sensitive to being called lazy. Actually, people like us - if we don't pretend to be doing something every day, we look no different from unemployed bums."

The survivors chuckled and listened attentively.

"From what I saw, that guy would always sit there blankly lost in thought, play a few measures, then fall back into thought again. It made me furious, so I pushed him pretty hard. I told him to write a song every day and bring it to me. I said if he didn't, there'd be no contract or support."

Elkiana asked.

"So did he write them?"

"Of course. And quite well too."

"I was pleased. My prediction was right. If I could make that lazy musician diligent, he could succeed. So I wielded the whip. More, more, more. Then one day, he suddenly stopped bringing songs. He didn't even show up in front of me. I wasn't disappointed. Honestly speaking......"

He felt sorry.

"It was a forced march. The moment I entered his studio, he threw hundreds of sheet music pages in my face and screamed. He was half-insane."

Panier looked around at the audience.

"I'm not trying to say artists can be lazy, or that you have to be diligent to succeed. What I want to say is that when our agreed-upon common sense is applied to an individual, it can be sadistic enough to wound the soul."

I should have respected him as he was.

"That guy must have fought alone. Against me, against the world, against people's gazes. To prove he was right, he did everything I demanded every day. Thinking about it now, why did it have to be that way? Couldn't I have given that one human being who simply loved guitar the freedom to fail? Couldn't I have let him at least protect his own soul?"

Panier confessed.

"And now, the Lobe Ranstin I spoke of is dead. What came here is Guitarman, a killer of the Magic Seven. He's committed crimes that make even that unfortunate past seem ridiculous. There's no room for sympathy. But......"

Did he really have to fight to this extent?

"That guy probably won't sympathize with this ruined world either......"

His voice trailed off.

"That's just... a little sad."

Sirone asked back.

"A fight for myself?"

"Yes."

Was there anything left to fight for when he had already lost everything?

Fermi said.

"When I first mined future information from Apocalypse, I just thought to use the information. You did well. Omega ended according to God's result after all."

Sirone remained silent.

"And so the world was destroyed. That's fine up to that point. But actually, we knew the world would be destroyed. We protected the future even while controlling information from you."

"Why?"

It was time to ask the question from the room again.

"Because that's how we can change it."

"I felt something was off. We mined the future's destruction from Apocalypse. That's something from the future that doesn't exist in the present - something that would definitely be born in the future. In other words, for any result to occur, all causes must necessarily support it. Then......"

Fermi raised his index finger.

"In the future world of the last Apocalypse you went to, who left the records stored in the core?"

"That would be......"

Sirone's eyes blinked.

"Right. It's not God. God is only the pure result itself. God can't record the past under his own initiative. Because someone recorded the past, there's a future containing that past."

"Who?"

Sirone asked.

"Who is the recorder?"

Someone who recorded all events up to Omega's termination exists in this world now.

"Freemason."

Fermi turned around.

"Let's go. It's someone you know well too."

Jinseong-eum, who had gotten down from the bed, was preparing to cast Ether Wave again.

Seriel said.

"Go ahead. Check Seong-eum's condition carefully. I'll be preparing here."

Seeing her precarious state, Sirone said.

"Can't we go to the surface? With my magic......"

"No. There's no way. The place we're going to is a completely sealed space with no exit or entrance."

"No door?"

What he couldn't readily understand was how anyone could survive there.

"You'll know when we get there."

After Fermi finished speaking, Seong-eum cast the magic.

When the Ether Wave pulled some space before their eyes, a wall of pitch-black darkness approached.

"Be careful. It looks straight from here, but it's actually a vertical structure."

Nade led the way.

As he instantly flew to the other side of the darkness, Sirone followed.

'Whoa.'

Falling with his limbs spread, he saw a small twinkling light far below.

'It's incredibly deep.'

He landed with Flight magic and looked around as Fermi and Jinseong-eum approached.

"This way."

As they walked following them, what he felt was an electromagnetic field stronger than air.

Wooooooong.

As they got closer to the light source, they gained visibility to see roughly a 20-meter radius.

"It's been... a long... time, Si... rone."

"Richard."

The face of Ainka Richard, who had been a member of the Golden Wheel during their school days, was floating in the air.

Sirone made a tearful expression.

There was nothing below his neck, only wires hanging and connecting in all directions.

"You, how did you become like this......"

Richard adjusted his voice device.

"It's okay. I chose this. Actually, this face is also a machine. Only my mind has been transmitted. You can think of my real self as already dead. Though... saying I'm dead when I'm here is a bit strange, isn't it?"

It felt like a prototype of the outside world.

"You're the one who recorded Omega?"

The reason the final records lacked humanity was because the recorder was also a machine.

"That's right. The final version you received was probably my data. But this is an old achievement."

Fermi explained.

"Richard's family, Ainka, operates the world's second-largest alchemy foundation. It's a foundation established by descendants of those called Freemasons. Their goal is to make humanity exist eternally through science [Scientology]."

The sum of those causes was the result of the outside world.

Richard said.

"Well. Maybe someday I'll become a god too and create a world for the Illuminati? I don't know. What's certain is that since you've met me, you still have a chance, Sirone."

"What do you mean......"

Someone walked out from the darkness at the periphery.

Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars, Miracle Minerva, and 4-star Sage Noe revealed themselves.

"Ms. Minerva."

He was relieved they were safe, but she looked at Sirone with apologetic eyes.

"It must be really hard."

"Well, yeah......"

Sage Noe, Adam, approached as a Gaian's illusion.

"Yahweh. Descendant of Guffin. All of this is my responsibility. Give me a chance to reverse it."

Again... humanity?

"We can save Amy."

At Minerva's words, Sirone turned his head.

"What?"

Richard repeated.

"We can save Amy, Sirone. If you'll fight again, we'll make it happen."

While his heart beat rapidly, his mind was filled with negative feelings.

"How is that possible?"

"By reversing history."

Fermi said.

"Using tachyons to create a cause where Amy doesn't die. Fighting for yourself."

"That's a contradiction."

Sirone's thinking accelerated.

"No matter what delusion you have, it's just a delusion. If I go to the past and save Amy, what happens to this place? Will Amy suddenly appear with a 'poof'? Will Nade be different from now?"

That's not how it works.

"The world where Amy survives would be a different universe from this one. Just one of many multiverses. Of course, if I give up my heart, I could live there. But if there's no heart to begin with, why does it have to be Amy? This is exactly the same thing God was trying to do to us."

Just producing results.

"It's different from protecting the heart with Ouroboros. This is asking me to change my heart for the law. I can't do that. I'll never be able to return here."

"What if you could return?"

At Richard's question, Sirone turned around.

"If you could return to this place where you threw away your heart, Sirone, would you fight again?"

"In infinite universes......"

In a multiverse where infinite patterns could be created with just one finger.

"How would I find this place?"

Richard said.

"Iron Extreme."
