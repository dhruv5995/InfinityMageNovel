Even If It's a Delusion (1)

The Art of Unification—a technique that uses Black Elixir to melt humans and merge them into giants.

Its original purpose was to dismantle the Ultima System that challenged divine authority.

Due to the nature of the technique, technological advancement depended on quantity rather than quality of experiments, and under Kariel's leadership, the number of Gaians dwindled over a very long period.

"Move faster! This is a sacred ritual! Wash away the sins of the law and be reborn as new life!"

The Maras urged them on, but those destined for the Art of Unification walked at neither a slow nor fast pace.

None of the Gaians had produced offspring, and now these were the last remaining 100.

After today, the Art of Unification would proceed through a new humanity called the Divine Citizens.

Truly a historic day.

Icael watched the Gaians walking toward the bronze giant statue from afar.

There seemed to be no resistance, no resentment.

She knew the reason.

The more they upheld Gerfin's will, the clearer it became who truly approached divinity.

'But it's all in vain.'

Icael's sacred light body emitted a dry radiance.

'I am the only being in this universe who knows about Angkela and Gerfin's conference.'

As long as she kept her mouth shut, no one could know, and if so, it was as if it didn't exist.

'Foolish humans, why don't you understand that this struggle is meaningless?'

From the center of the plaza, Satiel shouted.

"Stop the Art of Unification! You've done enough already! At least let the Gaian lineage continue!"

With the emergence of giants, faeries, and divine citizens, Heaven's hierarchy had become subdivided and the ranks of archangels reached sky-high, but no one paid attention to her words.

It wasn't that they ignored her—their ears had become so calloused that they automatically muted her voice.

'How pitiful. Do you still believe in humans?'

Icael had never once interfered during all the times the Art of Unification had been performed.

She thought today would be the same.

'It's just 100 humans disappearing and 5 giants being born.'

The giants who lost their selves would receive new laws in Jotunheim and return.

'With this, Gaian history will disappear forever.'

Forever.

As if the word "last" had some magical spell cast upon it, Icael's nerves stood on edge.

'Disappear?'

All Gaians who knew about Gerfin would vanish without a trace from Heaven.

The moment the thought struck her that she would never again be able to ask about or hear Gerfin's story—

"Aren't you afraid?"

Before she knew it, Icael was speaking to those destined for the Art of Unification.

"Archangel!"

The Maras were startled by something that had never happened once in Heaven's history.

They hastily cleared a path, but Icael didn't even turn her head as she approached the Gaians.

"You know what it means to become a giant, don't you? Your minds will be crushed and ground up until they disappear without a trace. Then new laws will be written on a blank slate."

Though her words were chilling, the Gaians didn't even show a change in emotion.

That fact made her even angrier.

"How about saying something? You're those great, final Gaians, aren't you? Aren't you truly afraid? Or are you resentful? What are you all..."

An old man interrupted Icael's words.

"Nice weather. On days like this, one should hang out the laundry."

At the absurd words coming from someone about to die, Icael's eyes grew sharp.

"What do you mean?"

"What do I mean, indeed."

The old man looked back at Icael.

"I merely answered meaningless chatter with chatter of my own."

Because she could understand what he meant, Icael's lips trembled.

"Are you talking about the heart? Fine, I'll tell you. That's a delusion and an error. Gerfin is a fraud. Shall I tell you where he is and what he's doing right now?"

The old man clicked his tongue.

"You're not in your right mind."

Murderous intent rose from Icael.

"What? How dare a mere human insult an archangel?"

But the old man, as if finding her troublesome to deal with, meekly apologized and quickened his pace.

"Never mind. I'm sorry."

"Wait!"

Icael grabbed his foot.

"This can't just be overlooked! Apart from the Art of Unification, you deserve punishment!"

"Sigh."

The old man who let out a sigh spoke.

"What exactly do you want to hear from me?"

Icael's eyes wavered and her mouth closed as she was about to continue her barrage of words.

"Are you curious about Gerfin? Fine, I'll tell you. As you said, Gerfin is a fraud. Are you satisfied now?"

Icael remained silent.

"Or shall I say this instead? Gerfin is not a fraud. He's absolutely not that kind of person. Would this make you feel better?"

She had no choice but to remain silent.

"Stop the pointless word games and do your own job properly. Get your act together, you archangel."

The human's rudeness no longer even registered in her mind.

"Gerfin is to me—"

"No, no."

The old man shook his finger with a pitying expression.

"That's wrong. You should say 'To me, Gerfin is...'"

"No."

Icael's voice trembled.

"He didn't say anything. Even though he was going to leave like this, he didn't say a single word to me."

The old man looked at Icael with deep eyes.

"Have you ever spoken to him?"

"That's—"

Just as Icael was about to hastily open her mouth, the old man continued first.

"Yes, there would be no end to explanations. You must have had your reasons. Because of complicated circumstances, or perhaps fear of not hearing the answer you wanted. Anyway, if it was difficult to speak because of such numerous reasons."

The old man, lost in thought for a moment, said:

"Wouldn't Gerfin have felt the same?"

Icael, shocked as if her soul had left her body, opened her mouth blankly.

"Why do you think only you had it hard? Why can't you think that others exist? The essence of the Ultima System is this."

The old man placed his palm on his chest.

"Others are beings with hearts just like mine. Therefore, what's difficult for you to do..."

The old man shook his head with a sad smile.

"Is also difficult for Gerfin."

Tremors ran through Icael's entire body, and she couldn't stop her upper body from shaking.

"That's why we use the expression 'throwing.' The heart is something you throw. Something might come back, or nothing might return at all. So as you said, it might be a delusion. But."

The old man spoke as he followed behind the procession.

"It feels refreshing inside, doesn't it?"

After mulling over his words for a long while, Icael came to her senses and reached out her hand.

"Ah, wait..."

"Don't interfere."

The old man said firmly.

"This is something I chose myself. Whatever Gerfin did, I judged and chose this myself."

The Gaians knew what was right.

"A fraud, he says."

The old man who had arrived before the bronze statue looked up and burst into loud laughter.

"Hahaha! I heard an incredible joke before leaving!"

He couldn't stop laughing until the Black Elixir liquid filled the glass sphere completely.

In Icael's eyes, it was a heart that chose death without a shred of doubt.

Like Icael's heart, the moon waxed and waned countless times.

Icael's shoulders shook as she curled up in her quarters, crying endlessly.

"Huuuu!"

Fear.

She imagined being caught between the two great laws that divided this world and being crushed.

"O God, what should I do?"

She had to throw her heart.

And the price might be losing everything, including Icael's own annihilation.

It feels refreshing inside, doesn't it?

The old man's words were truly comforting, but at the same time, there seemed to be no better expression than this.

It was maddening.

How much time had passed? Many archangels had come and gone to report on matters decided in the White Council.

But Icael, whose head was filled with the conflict of having to choose between two options, couldn't remember well.

"Gasp!"

Then one day, as if someone else had injected the thought, an impulsive conviction surged through her.

"Gerfin."

When she came to her senses after unconsciously muttering to herself, she was already flying toward the sanctuary of Arabot.

'Open the door!'

Her action of throwing open the sanctuary door in one motion was because fearing her will would break was more terrifying than annihilation.

"Icael, what is the matter?"

Angkela opened her giant eyes and looked, but Icael's gaze was directed at Gerfin floating in the air.

"Ah."

Tears welled up suddenly.

"Answer me, Icael. I don't believe I gave you permission to enter this place?"

The moment she exchanged even a word with Angkela, she felt her desired future would change.

Icael immediately flew over and severed Angkela's nerve connected to Gerfin.

Blood vessels bulged in Angkela's eyes.

"You...!"

A result not found in the laws.

The first physical shock inflicted upon an absolute being made even Icael's mind hazy.

"Icael!"

"Ugh!"

Gritting her teeth to endure the sharp noise that shook the sanctuary, she escaped Arabot at maximum speed.

'Far away! Even farther!'

There was nowhere in the universe to hide from Angkela's eyes, but what she sought wasn't physical distance but a place where she could find peace of mind.

Discovering a mountain range reaching 6,000 meters above sea level, she immediately descended and entered a secluded cave.

Her sacred light body drove away the darkness, and when she laid Gerfin on the floor, focus gradually returned to his eyes.

"Gerfin!"

Icael's voice was as earnest as everything she had wagered to reclaim him, but Gerfin couldn't easily regain his senses.

It was natural, given he had been dominated by Angkela for an enormous span of time.

"Where... is this?"

At Gerfin's voice finally emerging, Icael hastily supported him.

"Are you coming to your senses? It's me, Icael. Do you recognize me?"

Gerfin's unfocused eyes partially traced Icael's face.

"...Icael?"

Icael barely held back tears that were about to burst forth.

"Yes."

"Why are you... me..."

Gerfin's words stuck in her heart like thorns.

She wanted to ask.

Why he hadn't told the truth, what his deal with Lucifer was, whether that kiss meant nothing.

"Gerfin..."

Icael gently caressed Gerfin's cheek.

"I love..."

As she slowly uttered the words, tears of light flowed down her cheeks like a waterfall.

"I love you."

Throwing her heart.

"I don't care what you were thinking when you did that. I love you, so it doesn't matter. I want to be connected with you. It has to be you."

It might not come back.

Icael lowered her head and closed her eyes as if she had already given up everything.

"Hmm."

When she lifted her head again, Gerfin was smiling faintly.

"Out of 100 points..."

Even while his mind wasn't entirely sound, Gerfin spoke with clear pronunciation.

"100 points."

Color returned to Icael's face, but she soon restrained herself and smiled bitterly.

"Is that your answer?"

Gerfin slowly shook his head.

"No. That wouldn't be proper."

Then, struggling to sit up, he brought his face close to Icael's ear and whispered.

"I love you too."

Electricity flashed in Icael's eyes.

"I can't say since when, but I also wanted to be connected with you. Really, desperately so."

Icael, who had been on the verge of tears, finally couldn't contain her emotions and burst into sobs.

'Ah. Ahhh.'

What it means for heart to connect with heart.

'How wondrous it is.'

Angkela, O God.

'I'm sorry.'

Even if the heart disrupts the laws, even if all of this is a delusion.

'I love this delusion...'

A smile pure as light bloomed on Icael's face as she embraced Gerfin tightly.

'So very much.'
