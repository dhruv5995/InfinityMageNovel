All That Struggle (4)

To the east of the Gallon Kingdom's border lies the Across Kingdom, stretching long along the coastline.

"Home isn't far now."

From South Across into the Kazura Kingdom, it would be quick to reach Tormia.

The 3-meter-tall metal monster Salsu stopped in front of a sheer cliff.

Sirone and Lian dismounted from Salsu and watched the countless plumes of smoke rising beyond the horizon.

"The central continent doesn't look like it's in good shape either."

The two had rescued far more survivors than expected while crossing the desert from Gustav to reach this place.

But from now on, this was the world's largest battlefield, actually occupied by the demon race.

"Amy..."

Somewhere out there, Amy would be fighting too.

"She'll be fine," Lian said.

"Tess too."

After dismantling Salsu and tucking the Armand into his embrace, Sirone descended the cliff with Lian.

Anyway, to reach Tormia, they would have to break through the encirclement of 200 million demons.

No matter which path they chose, battle was inevitable, and that time came sooner than expected.

"Graaaah!"

What they thought was ground suddenly rose up, and a massive creature made of mud lifted its upper body.

Its face was rectangular and square, with both arms still merged with the earth.

"Kueeeeeh!"

From the gaping hole of its mouth, countless demons poured out like vomit.

"What the hell, all of a sudden...?"

Demons with skin cracked like wasteland scratched their large jaws and looked around.

Then they spotted Sirone and Lian and their eyes widened.

"Damn, humans..."

Lian drew his great sword and stepped forward.

"Rear guard, I suppose."

It was a moment that showed Vulcan's thoroughness, though even this wasn't a trap specifically set for the two of them.

"Let's go, Sirone."

Lian kicked off the ground, and Sirone cast teleportation, flying toward the enemy line faster than him.

"Am-ambush...!"

Before the words were finished, a roar erupted, and all demons within range were torn apart by the shockwave.

"They're coming! They're coming!"

The 1st Battalion of the Magic Corps under the 2nd Legion had been busy cleaning around the barracks since morning.

Cleaning in a warzone usually meant maintaining minimal hygiene, but today was different.

"Hey, Corporal! Hurry up and get the guys to pull weeds. Fix the fence too! I won't tolerate a single mistake!"

"Yes sir! Sergeant! Leave it to us!"

Amy clicked her tongue as she watched the soldiers unite in purpose from afar.

"Honestly, they're only fired up at times like this."

Tess, sitting beside her, laughed.

"Still, having entertainment shows like this makes fighting worthwhile. Honestly, it's a war where we don't gain anything, right?"

War was human greed sublimated into madness, but now they were fighting solely for survival.

"By the way, do you know that singer Maya? I heard she's from Tormia Magic School."

Amy's eyes narrowed.

"I know her."

While it was welcome for a successful alumna to come perform, she had some uncomfortable history with her personally.

"Hmm, your reaction seems lukewarm. Don't tell me there was a love triangle at school?"

Amy remained silent, and Tess, having hit the mark, was startled and shouted.

"Really? Then with Sirone..."

If it was Amy's love triangle, who else could it be but Sirone?

"Forget it, it's all in the past. And it wasn't a love triangle! Maya had a one-sided crush on Sirone."

"Hmm."

Tess rested her chin on her hand, lost in thought.

Taken literally, it was clear enough, but there seemed to be a reason Amy was emphasizing it.

'Must have been serious.'

Berik, who had finished cleaning the barracks, came running over.

He was the corporal who had previously written harassment about Amy in a petition and got thoroughly beaten for it, but had since been promoted to squad leader.

"Battalion Commander! Salute! 4th Squad cleaning complete!"

Amy returned the salute.

"Good, well done. Rest for about an hour, then detail some troops to help set up the performance stage."

"Yes! Understood!"

Tess shrugged her shoulders.

"Hey, try cleaning like this when the commander visits. He'd be so impressed by your enthusiasm he'd promote you."

Berik scratched his head.

"Hehe, you know too, Staff Sergeant. Getting an entertainment show all the way to the front lines like this is something we couldn't even dream of."

Since they were in direct confrontation with demons, Maya's decision was certainly remarkable.

"But don't worry! I'll never betray you. There's only the Battalion Commander in my heart."

Amy chuckled.

"Alright. Go."

She took it as her subordinate's silly joke, but Berik's heart swelled just from the fact that Amy didn't deny it.

"Yes! Salute!"

Watching Berik run off excitedly, Tess turned her head playfully.

"Amy takes the first point."

Though she couldn't help but laugh, Amy's expression soon turned serious.

"Setting everything else aside, I'm worried about the demons. It's suspicious how quiet they've been these past few days."

The hell army that Amy's 1st Battalion was currently facing off against was a 30,000-strong detached force.

It was large for a detached unit, but headquarters had ordered them to keep those forces tied down.

Tess looked across the enemy lines.

"The early warning system is solid. Since we're not engaging in full-scale battle, we should be able to respond even if they attack during the performance."

"I suppose so."

The problem was Maya.

'I hope nothing happens.'

Around noon, the makeshift stage was completed, and three hours later, Maya's performance team arrived.

"They're here! They're here!"

In normal society, security guards would be needed, but in the military where military law was strict, all they could do was applaud and cheer.

When Maya stepped down in front of the assembled battalion, the applause briefly stopped.

"Wow..."

Her delicate appearance, full of civilian nostalgia, captivated the men's attention.

"Hello everyone."

When Maya waved cheerfully, sincere applause immediately followed.

"She's pretty."

That was Tess's honest impression.

Meanwhile, Amy showed no particular emotion as she greeted Palmers.

"I'm Palmers, representative of Elvor Entertainment. It's an honor to be invited."

As a Valkyrie of the Holy War and a battalion commander of the magic corps, she held a position that carried weight even in civilian society.

"This is a battlefield. We'll make full preparations, but please follow military command well."

"Of course. All lives are precious, but Maya is the face of our agency. I'm counting on you, Battalion Commander."

Only then did Amy look at Maya.

Her heart was moved seeing her friend's face on the battlefield, but she couldn't show her emotions.

"Nice to meet you, Ms. Maya. First, about your accommodations..."

"Amy!"

Before she could finish speaking, Maya threw herself forward and hugged Amy, tears streaming down her face.

"I missed you! It was hard, wasn't it? Do you know how long I've waited for this day?"

'She hasn't changed at all.'

As if time had rewound, memories from magic school flashed by like a panorama.

Amy smiled warmly and hugged Maya back.

"Yeah, welcome."

Seeing Amy's true nature rather than her military persona, the watching soldiers' eyes widened.

'Is that really our Battalion Commander?'

"Maya! Maya!"

With dozens of illumination spells lit in the sky, Maya's performance continued enthusiastically.

When she took off her coat while singing "Light Rain," even the mages nearly lost their composure.

"Good song."

In an open area far from the stage, Amy and Tess stood side by side watching the performance.

"Yeah. She really sings well."

Unlike others, Amy could feel Maya's sincerity by listening to the lyrics of "Light Rain."

Her eyes suddenly reddened.

"Amy, are you crying?"

"Huh? No, I'm not..."

As she wiped away tears and tried to make excuses, an alarm sounded across the sky.

"Alert! Alert! All forces assume defensive positions!"

Amy's head instantly cleared as she turned around, her eyes blazing.

"What's happening!"

"It's the demon detached force! They're currently breaking through Dewdrop Valley at maximum speed!"

"What? What about the traps?"

Countless traps had been laid on the routes to prevent them from taking the shortest path.

"They're pushing through with suicide tactics."

"That's impossible. A mere 30,000 troops can't get through Dewdrop Valley."

"It might not be an attack," Tess said.

"It's the typical pattern of those being chased. Another unit might have secretly attacked their rear."

It wasn't an impossible scenario.

"Alright! All forces establish positions! Hold the defense line!"

Maya watched blankly from the stage as soldiers moved in perfect coordination.

"Maya! It's an attack! Quick, let's get to the bunker!"

Palmers tried to pull her along after putting a coat over her exposed body, but Maya didn't move.

"Light Rain..."

From the horizon, a shower of light was approaching, lifting the curtain of night.

"Maya! The performance is canceled! Don't be stubborn and hurry..."

Just as Palmers was urging her, an explosion-like roar came from the direction of the defense line.

"Could it be...?"

Maya jumped down from the stage and ran toward the battlefield, leaving Palmers' shouts behind.

"They're coming! Respond with Group Magic A-3!"

The cavalry blocked the entrance while mages on the high ground to the left and right equipped magic in both hands.

Illumination magic far more massive than during the performance lit the night like day.

"Graaaah!"

The moment Amy confirmed the number of demons flooding in from the end of the passage, her brow furrowed.

"What's going on?"

There were so many demons approaching that it was hard to believe they had passed through Dewdrop Valley.

"Amy! We'll strike first!"

Just as Tess was about to deploy the cavalry to secure the mages' range...

"Wait! Stand by!"

Amy gave the order.

'Tess is right. That's not an attack.'

The faces of demons magnified by compressed air clearly showed fear.

"Graaaah! R-run away!"

As demons poured in like rapids after crossing the third barrier, an eerie sound of a sword cutting through air was heard.

"Huh?"

As if the scenery had been cut, the demons' bodies separated, and through the curtain of flesh, a swordsman's silhouette was briefly revealed.

"That's...?"

Tess's heart pounded.

"Battalion Commander! What should we do?"

As the leading demons were annihilated and soldiers fell into confusion, Amy raised her hand.

"...Hold fire."

Light bombardment poured from the rear.

As far as she knew, there was only one mage in the world who could manipulate light with physical force.

"Detestable humans! You... you...!"

Before the demons' roar could finish, light barriers exploded from all sides, collapsing the cliff.

Rumble!

The ground shook briefly then fell silent, and Lian emerged from the rising smoke.

"Cough! Cough! Ugh, fine dust."

All the troops stared blankly at the swordsman bent over coughing.

Suddenly a strong wind blew, dust flew backward, and Sirone approached Lian.

"That's what happens when you go too fast."

"Who was it that urged me to hurry? If it wasn't for my strategy, we'd still be halfway... hm?"

Feeling stares from all directions, Lian stopped talking and looked around.

"Sirone, looks like we broke through."

It was definitely a human force.

"Oh? You're right. Hello there. Sorry, but where exactly is this? We're trying to get to Tormia."

"...You're asking where this is?"

Tess, shoulders trembling, shouted.

"You came here without even knowing that! You idiots!"
