[659] Mercenary Recruitment (3)

As massive flames burst out of the Silverling headquarters building, people passing by on the street threw themselves flat on the ground.

"Damn it! What's happening?"

People hit by brick fragments grimaced and threw themselves aside.

If such an explosion had occurred elsewhere, it would have been chaos, but since this was the guild district, the commotion was less than expected.

Violent clashes between factions weren't unheard of, so people quickly took shelter but didn't think to take any special measures.

In contrast, the inside of the guild was a complete mess.

As the smell of burning wood and stone filled the air, guild members emerged one by one from under tables to check the results.

"Oh my...!"

Hellfire's tremendous firepower had pushed all objects within a 10-meter radius outward, and Lian had already thrown himself into a corner.

In the path where the flames had passed, only Shirone stood completely unharmed.

Since no one had witnessed the moment of explosion, it was impossible to tell whether he had dodged or blocked it.

'Did he use the principles of light?'

Arkman recalled the information he had reviewed to meet Shirone.

Though he couldn't even guess how it was possible, rumors circulated that during graduation exams, Shirone had deceived even Lee Cheon-beon with his ability to manipulate time.

'A gift from God?'

As an unofficial 4th-grade mage, he was confident he wouldn't easily fall to anyone, but the resentment of being compared lifelong to the talents of certified mages remained unwashed.

"That was dangerous. Did you really have to go that far?"

Judging by Hellfire's power, it had been cast with lethal intent.

"That's rookie thinking. This isn't school. All verification conducted in guilds is real combat."

"Why are you the one testing me?"

Arkman no longer hid his true feelings.

"Because I can't accept it. The other guild members probably feel the same way."

Arkman pulled out a red crystal orb containing trapped flames from his pocket.

"You're not giving up, which means you need something from the guild too, right? If you're going to refuse both certification and the master position, prove your skills. Then I'll give you what you want."

Shirone's eyes finally became serious.

As dozens of Arkman's offensive Spirit Zones thrust in like spears, Shirone cast teleportation.

Moving around the complex interior structures of the building by teleportation was extremely dangerous, but at their level, it was already a constraint not worth worrying about.

'Not bad.'

Shirone's movement was certainly excellent, but Arkman's experience couldn't be ignored either.

"Shall we begin in earnest?"

As Arkman lifted off the ground and retreated as if luring Shirone, the back door's bolt fell away and the door swung wide open.

When Shirone arrived at the clearing prepared behind the building, Arkman was waiting in battle stance.

"Robe of Flames and Prison of Fire."

Arkman held out the crystal orb while explaining his magical equipment.

"The Robe of Flames amplifies fire-based magical power by 200 percent. And this crystal orb..."

A whirlwind of flames swirled around Arkman, forming a 4-meter-long serpent made of 1,000-degree Celsius fire that flicked its flame tongue while looking down at Shirone.

"Traps the spirit of fire in form."

Arkman's Fire Snake rushed at Shirone while expanding its body.

The flames, grown more than four times larger, engulfed Shirone as second and third waves of fire surrounded and pressed in on his location like coils.

By the time twelve serpents were chasing Shirone through the crystal orb's function, all guild members had arrived at the clearing to watch the battle.

Though not particularly complex tactics, the firepower of Fire Strike unleashed through an unofficial 4th-grade's mental strength was terrifying, and even with magical equipment's aid, the ability to freely manipulate twelve flames was certainly exceptional.

'This is the skill of an unofficial 4th-grade.'

In terms of numerical ability alone, it surpassed Flu of similar combat style.

Moreover, in terms of experience, there were definitely aspects where he overwhelmed Shirone.

'The function itself is simple. But it's fast and accurate.'

With firepower and speed backing it, there could be no more effective magic for burning someone.

As it became clear that Shirone was being pushed into defense, guild members cheered as if they'd been waiting.

"As expected of Master! Acting all high and mighty about being an Ivory Tower candidate, but look at him struggling!"

"Bandit subjugation? That's something Master could easily do too!"

Like Arkman, the guild members seemed to have their own inferiority complex, but since it wasn't entirely wrong, Lian simply maintained silence.

'A mage focused on one technique. If he can't find a special solution, bandits of that level won't be manageable.'

Kon shouted at Lian as if he had won.

"Hey! How about stopping this now? Your friend might end up roasted at this rate."

Lian snorted.

While he acknowledged Arkman as an excellent mage, thinking of Shirone's prowess he'd witnessed during graduation exams, there was something else that concerned him.

"It's certainly different from school. This will be difficult, Shirone."

Not understanding Lian's true meaning, Kon burst into laughter.

"You're just realizing that now? Even now..."

"Because it's not Lee Cheon-beon."

"Huh?"

Lian looked back at Kon.

"He's looking for a way to win without killing."

Though it sounded absurd to the listener, Arkman was feeling Lian's words with his skin.

'Why isn't he attacking?'

Though five minutes had passed since the battle began, Shirone hadn't cast any attack magic.

'This is troublesome.'

Though Shirone had devised numerous strategies, none of the magic he possessed could avoid causing fatal injuries.

But he also wasn't an opponent who could be subdued with auxiliary magic like Shining Impact or Shining Chain.

'He won't tire from just this much.'

If dragging out time was meaningless, ultimately he had no choice but to push through with firepower.

'I've decided!'

Though he didn't show his thoughts outwardly, Arkman's experiential intuition detected Shirone's change.

'Is it starting? Come on then.'

Just before the twelve serpents completely blocked his escape route, Shirone burst through the flames.

'That technique again.'

Time Reversal expanded one second of past and future into reality, but it wasn't a perfect evasion method since it couldn't control events faster than the past second or beyond one second in the future.

'I must end it here.'

Erasing extraneous thoughts, Shirone leaped into the sky and cast Photon Cannon.

The power could be felt just from how the spot where Arkman dodged became concavely indented.

'It doesn't matter if it doesn't hit.'

Manipulating Fire Snake while dodging opponent's attacks with excellent evasion skills.

Single-shot attacks didn't work on Arkman, who had won countless victories with this tactic.

"Then..."

Shirone gritted his teeth and fired Photon Cannon in rapid succession.

'Can he dodge this too?'

As flashes rushed like beams of light, Arkman moved flexibly like an eel, making a wide circuit around the clearing.

Meanwhile, Fire Strike continued to fly skyward, endlessly tormenting Shirone.

'Was this all there was?'

The fact that he was no different from other mages he'd faced restored Arkman's pride.

'No, he's definitely good material. That's why...'

The institution called Ivory Tower was just empty prestige.

'I am the strong one!'

Arkman's eyes flashed as twelve serpents simultaneously struck at Shirone.

Quantum Superposition.

300 overlaps.

And the number of pouring flashes increased beyond what could be counted even with Spirit Zone's synesthesia.

"What...!"

People squeezed their eyes shut at the earth-shaking roar, and vibrations like an earthquake traveled through the ground.

Only Lian watched with one eye closed against the flashing beams of light.

'As expected, the solution is a show of force.'

Though he had certainly controlled his power, the number of Photon Cannons poured out by 300 Shirones was frightening just to watch.

"M-Master..."

In stark reality, dust raised by Photon Cannons hammering the ground covered Arkman's figure.

'Can he dodge even this?'

Though unleashing magic without restraint, Elision was precisely tracking Arkman's location.

Since physical impact meant instant death, not a single Photon Cannon touched Arkman's body.

'Kill his mind!'

As the barrage of explosions, which he thought couldn't get any faster, accelerated further, even the guild members' screams were drowned out.

In a situation where approach was impossible, those who could only stamp their feet in frustration noticed the change when the number of Fire Snakes began decreasing.

Seven. Six.

The fact that flame serpents wandering through the air as if blind were disappearing one by one meant Arkman's mind was being consumed by fear.

"Graaaah!"

In the dust where he couldn't see an inch ahead, Arkman could only crouch and endure.

The roar from close range felt like it would burst his eardrums, and the ground's vibrations traveled directly through his bones.

His nerves were so tangled he couldn't even distinguish whether he was being buried underground or if his body was already shattered.

It felt like being a bug trapped in a barrel that someone was shaking madly.

"They're decreasing."

Lian counted the Fire Snakes.

Three. Two. Finally, even the last remaining serpent faintly disappeared.

His Spirit Zone had shattered from mental shock.

Though Shirone stopped the bombardment, it was much later before the guild members, suffering from tinnitus, realized this fact.

As massive dust clouds pushed by wind fell like rain while floating like clouds to cover other buildings.

"What... is this?"

Everyone trembled at the shocking sight.

In the center of the clearing was a pit so deep its bottom couldn't be seen, and Arkman crouched on a narrow piece of land like a single pillar.

Shirone, who had landed 20 meters away, caught his breath.

'Quite tiring.'

Angel's Punishment would have created this scene in an instant, but this time he had no choice but to fight while imposing constraints on himself.

"Master! Are you alright?"

Manager Michela shouted, but Arkman, with paralyzed hearing, still showed no movement.

However, befitting an unofficial 4th-grade mage, his mental recovery was quite fast, and when he finally felt no more vibrations, he slowly raised his head.

Arkman's face, which had been staring blankly at the eerie scene, gradually filled with sorrow.

'I see. A star is...'

It's not about competing for some superiority at the human level.

'There's no basis for comparison at all.'

It wasn't a matter of who's faster or stronger, but a dimensional difference like having three arms, five eyes, or wings.

"I lost."

The one suited to be an Ivory Tower candidate was not himself, but Shirone.

"You said you wanted something from the guild. I'll cooperate unconditionally."

Still maintaining some dignity, Arkman cast flight magic despite his trembling legs and leaped over the pit.

"There's one thing I'd like to request from the guild."

Since he hadn't even begun Rufist's instructions yet, he was about to get to the main point when applause came from the building's direction.

"Ho ho ho! What a wonderful match. It feels like ten years of frustration just melted away."

The guild members who looked toward the back entrance immediately scowled.

"What are those annoying bastards doing here?"

The masters of War Chariot and Blood Rose, two of the kingdom's three great magic guilds, stood there with mocking smiles.
