[751] Holy War (2)

Holy War.

The sight of the 12 leaders who ruled the world gathered in one place was rather eerie.

The world would shake at their every word, and any agenda agreed upon in this place would cause massive upheaval.

Though President Basari of the Cortria Republic, the host nation of the Holy War, sat in the chairman's seat, the overall dynamic had the Two Military Kings playing the role of mediator while the Seven Kings watched the Three Emperors' reactions.

Wuorin, leader of the Valkyries, closed her file folder.

"Then let's decide the magic bullet supply ratio like this..."

She paused briefly, but naturally continued while pretending to catch her breath.

"Shall we take about a 10-minute break?"

No one showed it, but the talks had already been going on for 7 hours.

'And that's exactly the problem.'

There was only one reason Wuorin stopped speaking - because of Gustav Habitz XVII sitting across the huge round table.

'How long is he going to keep staring?'

Since the Holy War began, Habitz hadn't opened his mouth even once, and had been staring only at Wuorin without even turning his gaze away.

It was the same now that she'd declared a break, and his posture of sitting crookedly while rocking his chair was no different from the beginning.

'Provocation. No, it's not that.'

He was analyzing.

When faced with a gaze that tried to capture every strand of hair, she didn't even want to think about what kind of fantasies he might be having.

"Haha, come to think of it... my congratulations are late. I congratulate you on becoming the new master of the Empire."

King Meyer of Zaib, representing the central continent, offered a handshake to Habitz.

"..."

But Habitz didn't even turn his head, only continuing to rock his chair.

"Ahem, ahem."

Meyer's embarrassment was beyond words, and the soldiers of Zaib's royal guard 'Shinjang' lined up behind him all placed their hands on the hilts of swords mounted on their left sides.

"Haha, now stop that. In a place like this..."

Who would dare humiliate the King of Zaib? But this place, the Holy War, was overflowing with such people.

'Arrogant brat. Just recently he held the same position.'

Before Habitz XVI's death, Habitz XVII was also just a king ruling part of the Empire.

"By the way, what kind of person was Nanae?"

When Munryong, ruler of the Moon Kingdom, asked, Emperor Jingang of Jincheon also showed interest.

"He graduated from the Zaib Kingdom."

Meyer put on a troubled expression.

"There's nothing much to say about him. He was just an exchange student, and now he's become humanity's enemy."

At his attitude of seemingly blocking information in advance, the expressions of the Seven Kings' leaders turned unpleasant.

Just this alone made the atmosphere turn cold, so Wuorin made eye contact with Habitz for the first time.

"I'd like to ask one thing."

Habitz, who seemed like he wouldn't react as usual, suddenly opened his mouth.

"How long has it been?"

Behind Habitz, four figures sat on the floor in different postures.

"7 hours and 48 minutes?"

The woman who asked back was kneeling, and her appearance was ridiculous enough to be called a clown.

She wore a cumbersomely ornate dress, her face was painted white with powder, and her eyes always looked large because her eyelids had been cut off.

She had drawn large black eyelashes - three lines below and three lines above.

Gustav's Four Arts, battle doll Natasha.

Another spectacle of the Holy War was the distinctive military bearing of the royal guards protecting each nation's king.

But Habitz didn't bring a royal guard, entering the Holy War with only four generals.

'Those are the ones we've only heard rumors about...'

The gazes of many people who didn't show it but were paying attention finally moved to behind Habitz.

'The four arts led by the King of Desire.'

Though Habitz wasn't normal, among those drawn by the world's greatest charisma were many skilled individuals.

The Four Arts were carefully selected talents even among them - those who had reached the pinnacle in one field.

"7 hours and 48 minutes..."

Habitz, who muttered quietly, finally straightened his chair and rested his chin on the table.

"Mitochondrial Eve, huh? Surprisingly impatient, that girl called the Empress of Kashan."

Just the trembling of a hundred wind generals' bodies sent strong winds through the Holy War hall.

"Stop."

The air vibrations ceased instantly.

"It's not really worth enduring anyway. It feels bad when you stare like that."

Wuorin responded by the book.

"I hear you live by receiving a man's genes?"

It was a fact known to all representatives of the Holy War, but an unwritten rule that could never be spoken.

"How about receiving mine?"

Lightning struck in Gando's eyes, but Wuorin wasn't shaken by something of this level.

"The previous generation made such a proposal before."

It was a secret file no one knew about.

"But I refused because it didn't meet the standard. Let alone you, who falls short of the previous generation..."

Habitz yawned.

"It would be interesting. I'm curious what kind of guy would be born. What would happen if my daughter gives birth to my daughter again?"

'He's not listening. Does he have no trauma?'

She had deliberately mentioned his father to provoke an inferiority complex, but couldn't feel any such thing.

'Confidence bordering on madness. The extreme of narcissism.'

The previous generation, Habitz XVI, was immersed in desire but was someone who could distinguish right from wrong.

'A monster created by the times.'

Wuorin, who had lived through human history, knew how evil and cruel humans could be.

But the Habitz before her now felt like all of them combined.

"Hmm, so have 3 daughters, and those 3 have 3 more... No, use sons to make the daughters..."

Ignoring Habitz's continuous muttering, Wuorin proceeded with the meeting.

"Then let's move on to the main agenda. Budget allocation from each nation for Valkyrie operations and altar defense."

Even in the Holy War, pursuing one's national interests was an iron rule.

Therefore, sensitive issues like this were standardly brought up when everyone's fatigue had accumulated.

'The real fight starts now.'

Just as the representatives were putting strength in their eyes to gain even a little advantage, Habitz shouted.

"That's exactly it!"

The serious atmosphere shattered completely.

"Farm them! Hang them up in clusters and make them give birth to one per day!"

"You bastard!"

Gando shot up at the same time Emperor Jingang of Jincheon slammed the table.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

As the heavy marble table shook violently, the faces of the five great generals representing the Jincheon Empire, the Five Dragon Generals, hardened.

'Father.'

Seongeum had also entered the Holy War as a great general of the Blue Dragon Corps, recognized for his merit in fighting against Nanae.

"I don't particularly want to nag the ruler of the world, but..."

Just the fact that Habitz looked at someone other than Wuorin showed the atmosphere in the hall.

"How about keeping that rotten mouth of yours shut? Or come back after getting rid of that shit smell from your mouth."

It seemed like something big was about to happen.

"You mean... you want me to shit in your mouth?"

As Yeodal, leader of the Five Dragon Generals, leaned his heavy body forward, members of the Yellow Dragon Corps advanced with their armor clanking.

Jingang didn't tell Yeodal to stop, as restraining him would mean losing momentum.

"Immature king, this is the last time I'll humor your fatherless whining. From now on, you'd better choose your words carefully."

"What if I don't choose them?"

"I'll give one seat of the Three Emperors to a dog raised by our people."

Habitz averted his gaze and sniffled.

"A dog? A dog?"

Then he pointed at Jingang again.

"You?"

Natasha raised her head and laughed.

"Ahahaha!"

Yeodal put strength into his body, and Seongeum cast an ether wave faster than him to block his movement.

'Miss, why?'

Yeodal saw Seongeum biting her lips.

'It's a fight between Habitz and Wuorin. If arrows get aimed at Jincheon for no reason, we'll take all the blame.'

It was obvious that among the three pillars called the Three Emperors, whichever moved first would be ganged up on.

"Representative of Jincheon, thank you for saying what I couldn't bear to say with a woman's mouth."

Wuorin showed respect to Jingang while forming an alliance structure and began provoking Habitz in earnest.

"I think the same. This is an important place deciding the world's future. If you're not up to the level to participate, how about going to the bathroom to wipe your bottom?"

"How dare you!"

A middle-aged old man sitting behind Habitz jumped onto the table and tore his shirt wide open.

"Gustav~!"

His dark nipples and gaunt ribs were all exposed.

"Habitz!"

Bending his body as if having convulsions, he glared at Wuorin with his eyes rolled upward.

Gustav's Four Arts, Interior King Smodo.

"I was watching this pathetic display, but you dare speak to the Emperor of the Gustav Empire like that? Want to fight? Huh? Should I sweep you away right now?"

'What kind of ruffian behavior is this?'

Officials from each nation clicked their tongues, but the faces of the leaders at the round table were all equally serious.

'Interior King Smodo. The only person who can assist Habitz. Therefore, what Habitz desires is...'

War.

'Is that really so? But if he's planning to wage war against the world, from the beginning...'

Unable to read anything from Habitz's expression, Wuorin quickly revised her thinking.

'It's not at that level.'

The reason Habitz was called an unknown entity.

The reason no one could analyze him.

Was because he had no thoughts at all.

'Now I understand.'

Through three resets, Wuorin had been able to observe Habitz XVII's life three times.

Like other people's lives, Habitz had always become king by killing his 781 brothers.

'But the problem is...'

In killing 781 brothers three times, he never killed them the same way twice.

'Chaos.'

A human with no structured thoughts in his head, only emotions mixed up in complete disorder.

In this age of chaos, it was natural for Habitz, the extreme of chaos, to stand out.

"What? Getting mad? Then come at me! I'll kill all the Kashan bastards! I'll kill them until their bloodline completely dries up from this land, kill, kill, and kill again!"

"..."

The reason silence flowed through the Holy War was because responding here would really trigger a world war.

Only Jingang was resolute.

"Do you really think you can win? Against Kashan, Jincheon, and the Seven Kings, Dragon Clan, and Fairy Clan here?"

Habitz had no thoughts.

"Yeah. I think I can win?"

He was just filled with baseless confidence.

'Well, in some sense, that's everything.'

If you truly believe you can accomplish something, doesn't it actually tend to lean that way according to natural law?

"I'm going to win. So let's do it - war."

In the tension where even the representatives of the Seven Kings swallowed their saliva, Wuorin's head remained cold.

'Is this an unstoppable flow? Then a reversal at the next flag? No, that goes too far.'

From the Great Purification onwards, there were no underlying events, so even Wuorin couldn't make accurate predictions.

That's why it was chaos.

'Just where the hell are you and what are you doing?'

She could only hope that Sirone had properly received the message.
