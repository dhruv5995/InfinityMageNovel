Even If It's a Misunderstanding (3)

Sobbing echoed through the cave where Hexa had activated his power to escape Angela's pursuit.

"*Sniff sniff*"

It was Gorphin's voice, mimicking Icael.

"*Sob sob*"

Icael turned around with flushed cheeks.

"Stop it! How long are you going to tease me?"

Gorphin leaned against the cave wall and chuckled.

"It's just fascinating. Who would've thought the archangel Icael would bawl like a little kid? Really too good to keep to myself."

"I wasn't bawling..."

Icael stopped mid-sentence and looked away, recalling the earlier situation.

It had been such overwhelming emotion.

"Hmph."

She turned away as if sulking, then after a moment of thought, approached Gorphin with a serious expression.

"Gorphin, I've made up my mind."

"About what?"

Kneeling in front of him, she smiled slightly and said:

"I want to make love with you."

Gorphin, who had been tense at her serious expression, chuckled and leaned forward.

"Alright."

"No. Not kissing, I mean."

When Icael gently pushed him back with her hand, Gorphin leaned back against the wall, his expression finally hardening.

"So you mean..."

"Yes, love. That love you humans do. Now that our hearts are connected, I'm not afraid anymore."

When Gorphin gaped in bewilderment, Icael quickly asked with an anxious expression:

"What's wrong? Do you not want to make love with me..."

"No, no. Absolutely not."

Gorphin shook his head rapidly, tension finally creeping into his face.

Perhaps even determination.

"I'm just surprised by such an unexpected suggestion. But... are you really sure you'll be okay?"

Icael spoke with resolute eyes.

"Don't worry. I'm the leader of angels who has never found anything impossible. I'll be able to handle this well too."

"No, it's not that grand. The problem is..."

"Didn't I say it's fine? Put away the explanations and let's start right away. I'll show you I can do it perfectly."

"Right away?"

After thinking for a moment, Gorphin nodded and said:

"Y-yes. That's fine too. That's a good idea."

Watching Gorphin adjust his posture, Icael smiled confidently.

Time passed like that.

"Um, are you going to keep doing that?"

"Huh?"

When Icael raised her eyebrows and asked back with an innocent expression, Gorphin flailed his hands.

"No, if you're going to do it, you need to take some kind of preparatory position, right? I mean, to make love..."

Icael, who had been listening blankly, suddenly seemed to realize something and slowly stood up.

"Oh, right. Sorry."

Then she looked around and sat on a flat rock on the ground, crossing her legs.

She placed both hands neatly on her knees and slightly tilted her head to show her profile.

"How about this?"

It was truly a heavenly pose, but Gorphin watching her was simply dumbfounded.

"...What are you doing right now?"

"Huh? Why? Don't I look beautiful? Then how about this?"

Only after seeing Icael strike another elegant pose did he realize for certain.

"Be honest. You don't know what it is, do you?"

"Fine, I don't know! How would I know? Did you expect me, an archangel, to spy on humans making love?"

Gorphin sighed and said:

"That's not it. Come here. I'll explain it to you."

When Icael came over and put her ear close, Gorphin covered his mouth and spoke in a small voice:

"The position is..."

Icael's eyes widened as she heard Gorphin's words, then her expression turned to disgust.

"H-how could I do such a thing!"

"Or there's this."

Gorphin leaned his face forward and whispered again.

*Whisper whisper.*

Even though she leaned in to listen, Icael's face turned pale and her body trembled.

"Cancel that. I need to reconsider."

When Icael turned away sharply, Gorphin grabbed her wrist.

"Why? What's wrong with it?"

Icael shook off Gorphin's wrist and spoke with a horrified expression:

"I am a noble archangel! That's not human love! It's bestial! Animal!"

"Humans are animals too."

Icael's mouth closed.

"Rational animals, of course. But when making love, that doesn't matter."

"Because hearts are connected."

Gorphin smiled contentedly.

"Right. When making love, humans become animals. But I have no intention of forcing you. If you don't want to, even now..."

"No. I'll do it."

Icael finally understood.

"It's about becoming one with you."

A different kind of heat from before surged in both their eyes, and Icael gently sat beside Gorphin.

Their lips softly met as Gorphin embraced Icael and lay her down on the ground.

"Ahhh..."

Through Icael's trembling lips escaped breath where fear and excitement coexisted.

'Becoming an animal.'

The feeling of falling to the very bottom where life originated was indescribably shameful, yet...

'What will become of me now?'

On the other hand, she wanted to see how far this base emotion could be amplified.

"Icael."

Gorphin said.

"I love you."

The moment she felt electricity course through her entire body, Icael's holy light body flew away.

"Ahhh..."

What it means for hearts to connect.

For the first time, Icael learned that mere human body heat could feel this hot.

'I see.'

A cold world.

When she realized how far removed this world was from the heart.

'So that's how it was, Gorphin.'

She felt chilling goosebumps.

"Enemy advance in 20 minutes!"

At the messenger's report, tension spread through the Tormia allied forces holding their positions.

Two kilometers away, in the 'Flower Garden,' the Fire Tribe and Fairy Folk were waiting for orders.

The sight of 300 Fire Tribe members and 600 elves together was like viewing a natural landscape.

Rian and Tess, who had arrived at the flower garden, walked toward Enox, the defense unit commander.

Tess grumbled:

"Why are we in the rear? I can fight well too."

"It's a strategic decision. Winning isn't what's important. We need to defend the flower garden to lure the demon army."

"Who doesn't know that? Why us specifically? The plants will do all the fighting anyway!"

She was frustrated at having to watch their comrades die from just 2 kilometers away.

"Do you really think so?"

At Rian's pointed question, Tess looked back.

"Natasha?"

Gustav Unit 4, combat doll Natasha.

She was a formidable opponent who had fought Rian in earnest combat before without a decisive outcome.

'Actually, to be honest... Rian was slightly pushed back.'

"I won't be caught off guard like last time, but even accounting for that, she's a tough enemy. If we can't stop Natasha, the real hell might be here."

"You mean Natasha's combat power exceeds the 'Flower Garden'?"

This time Rian held back his words.

"It's just about compatibility. If the 'Flower Garden' is firepower, Natasha is speed."

There was no need to spread fear before the war, and their conversation ended as they reached their destination.

"Good day."

As Rian approached with a greeting, Protea and Enox, who had been standing side by side at the front, turned around simultaneously.

"Oh my? A famous person has arrived."

While Enox's eyes were full of welcome, Protea shrank back.

'What's with this human?'

Among the Fire Tribe's direct lineage, the Lotus bloodline could be said to have the weakest passivity, except for the carnivorous Armand.

But the moment she met Rian's gaze, that faint passivity felt amplified to the extreme.

"Orzent Rian."

Enox pointed his index finger and poked Rian's chest.

"The strongest among humans, the world's greatest swordsman. The Knight of Mach. Right?"

Rian briefly wondered what reaction Kuan would show if he heard this, but quickly dismissed the thought.

"Thank you for recognizing me. Of course, I respect you as the defense unit commander, Enox-nim. However, I..."

"I know. Special mission. There's supposed to be a really strong human in the other camp too, right?"

Enox glanced toward the front for a moment, then turned his head back and shrugged.

"What's the big deal? It's just a human after all. They're no match for Rian-nim who has an Idea. Plus, I'm here - the greatest swordsman of the Fairy Folk."

When Enox stretched his back, the three swords at his waist made a clear clinking sound.

He was the same type as Tess, but his martial prowess was probably enough to claim one of the positions among the Two Army Kings.

'Definitely strong. But I haven't heard much about fairy folk combat.'

In any case, he'd find out soon enough, so Rian bowed his head and turned away.

"Well then. I wish you good luck in battle."

"Yes, you too, Rian-nim."

When the two returned to their positions, Protea, who had been holding her breath, spoke up:

"Enox, fairy of the wind."

Like the fairies of heaven, elves are also born with unique natural attributes.

However, these aren't products of nature, but Norse genes passed down from long ago.

"Why are you kind to humans? They are the ones who trample flowers and destroy forests."

While the Fire Tribe couldn't defeat humans due to the limitations of their passive desires, fairies were different.

Their bodies were stronger than humans, and their concentration arising from pure, clear minds was unparalleled.

"Haha, I like humans. And that human from before - strictly speaking, he's not human."

"What?"

"One who possesses a divine perspective."

When Protea looked confused, Enox brought up elven lore:

"Long, long ago, in an era when gods and humans coexisted, there lived races called Fairies and Norse. They seemed to be enemies, but sometimes that wasn't the case. The Norse were a race that developed mental civilization like fairies. They also knew many things that made fairies' eyes sparkle with interest. But most importantly, they were of divine bloodline."

"Divine bloodline? Then their ancestors created nature? As far as I know, Angela..."

"Nature doesn't exist."

Protea closed her mouth.

"No forests, no seas, no rivers. This world consists only of divine perspective. That's called an Idea."

Ideas appear in Fire Tribe lore as well.

"Rian possesses an Idea. He's a human who overturns the world's laws with divine perspective. How wonderful is that?"

Ecstasy filled Enox's eyes.

"Perhaps my current feelings are the same as our ancestral fairies? They tried to obtain Ideas from the Norse. The Norse also tried to become stronger life forms through the fairies. According to legend, it was called the User War. What was created from that is our race - the elves."

"Then why couldn't they obtain Ideas?"

"There was a serious obstacle. The fairies were too small."

When Protea tilted her head, Enox smiled brightly:

"If a fairy gave birth to a Norse child, her belly would burst."

"You're also part of the natural world, so you'd understand. Interspecies unions always cause harm. Without one side making sacrifices, success is impossible. Even if successful... only pain remains."

Protea, having imagined something terrible, shuddered, then suddenly realized:

"But then how were elves born?"

"One day, someone with divine perspective appeared and solved everything. Though no records remain, given that they had an Idea, they were naturally human. That's how fairies split into Fairies who serve Angela and Elves who follow humans."

Elven lore was tumultuous unlike that of the Fire Tribe, but Protea thought their roots might be the same.

Protea's voice trembled:

"What exactly did they do to allow life to be born between completely different species?"

"Heart."

Two pale, slender hands covered her heart.

"Conveying with all one's heart through light. A signal of life that no law can violate. According to legend, the one who created us called that light..."

Enox's eyes twinkled like stars.

"Agape."
