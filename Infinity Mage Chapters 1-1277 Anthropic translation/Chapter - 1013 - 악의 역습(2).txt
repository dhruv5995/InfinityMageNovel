The Counterattack of Evil (2)

Imperial Capital Aganos.

Emperor Gando of Kashan never forgot to pay his morning respects to Wu Orin.

"Mother, I'm coming in."

When he opened the door, Wu Orin was lying on a bed large enough to roll around on ten times over.

She wasn't asleep.

'Is she still at it?' It seemed she had spent another dawn in <Under Coder> as usual.

She had been obsessed with virtual reality before, but after stepping down from the throne of Empress, it had gotten severe.

"Mother."

"Mm... hah."

Slowly opening her eyelids, she gazed hazily at the ceiling patterns before sitting up.

"Ugh, my head. What time is it? Tell Kido to bring me some honey water, will you?"

"It's morning. Are you really alright? Just where are you logging into every dawn?"

If she were simply experiencing Under Coder at a basic level, she wouldn't have headaches upon waking.

"Yeah, it's fun. Just... a 'deep place,' you could say. Call Kido, will you? My head is spinning."

Gando could no longer hold back.

"You need to take care of your health. The holy war will be reorganized soon. Kashan isn't as strong as it used to be."

The demon beast Argantis had been devastating.

"Other countries are in similar situations anyway. The kingdom I built isn't so easily shaken."

"I'm not doubting Mother's abilities. The problem is that Heaven's army is too quiet. Some rumors say there are countries that have joined hands with them. If we continue like this..."

"Ah, shut up. My head is killing me and you're nagging. You've gotten really arrogant since becoming emperor."

Gando exploded in frustration.

"You're the emperor, Mother! Terase is Kashan itself! There are limits to what I can lead."

'Well, at least he knows his place.' That was why Gando's head was still attached to his shoulders.

"Fine. I'll find a way, so go handle your work. But don't you ever meet women?"

"What will you do about the holy war?"

"Ugh, enough!"

Wu Orin, who had shouted angrily, sighed in the face of Gando's earnest gaze.

"I'm not just playing around either. I go into <Under Coder> every day to gather information."

Gando couldn't even snort in derision.

"It's a place crawling with social misfits. What kind of information could you possibly gather there?"

Wu Orin chuckled.

"A boring person like you wouldn't understand. But Gando, the world you know isn't everything."

"That may be so, but could you please solve the problems in reality first? Yahweh is appearing all over the world performing miracles. Most countries have benefited, but Kashan is the exception."

"Sirone..."

Wu Orin's eyes darkened.

"Aside from Tormia, Kashan Empire was the country that supported Sirone the most. Yet he's completely ignoring us. We need to respond somehow."

"Sirone won't come."

"Why not?"

"Because he won't want to meet me."

If Sirone had figured out the Adam and Eve incident, it was natural for him to keep Wu Orin at a distance.

"It's a very old story. But we'll meet eventually. Right now there's a more important problem."

Sitting at her vanity, she spoke while brushing her hair.

"Open the inner castle gates. Tell them to have the guards patrol as little as possible. Preserving our strength is the top priority."

Gando frowned.

"I don't understand the order. If we're preserving our strength, why open the inner castle gates?"

"How frustrating."

Wu Orin, combing down her white hair, looked at Gando's reflection in the mirror and said:

"The fact that Yahweh doesn't exist in Kashan..."

Through the chain reaction of law.

"Means Satan is coming."

The instructor who heard the Wizard's words examined Sirone's condition and realized belatedly.

'Certainly... the feeling is different.'

Blades, fire, wild beasts, a lake covered with thin ice - things that had threatened human life since ancient times.

He couldn't pinpoint the exact reason, but his heart was racing as if facing such dangers.

"Good."

As the Wizard walked to the training ground, the uneven ground instantly became level.

"Hmm."

Lampa let out a contemplative sound.

'He's grown again. In a mere 3-minute battle, he makes a leap that contains a lifetime's worth of an ordinary person's growth.'

Walking the path the Wizard had cleared, Sirone felt relieved.

'Thank goodness.'

That he's a strong child.

The enemy the Wizard would have to face was Havitz, the ultimate evil that no one in the world could touch.

'His skills are more than sufficient. But if he can't control his heart, he'll just be devoured by Satan.'

It was time for firm, overwhelming education.

"Let's begin."

The golden haze surrounding Sirone's body ascended to a height of 20 meters.

"Wow."

Unlike everyone else's admiration, the Wizard flinched and stepped back.

"Huh? The Wizard is..."

At this unprecedented situation, students and teachers who knew her wore blank expressions.

"She's a kid who hates losing more than death..."

Only Amy and Lampa knew that the Wizard's judgment was excellent.

Bartok asked.

"The Five Great Stars technique you just deployed - what kind of ability is it?"

It was natural to be curious since the Wizard who had leisurely subdued him was now on guard.

"Quantum superposition."

Lampa said.

"If the mind changes the law, then Yahweh's current mind exists only as probability. He may seem to just be standing there, but all possible actions are superimposed."

"...Is that possible for a human?"

"Isn't he right before your eyes? Anyway, the Five Great Stars are serious too. They plan to crush his spirit from the very beginning."

Bartok turned his gaze to the Wizard.

"Does she know what that ability is?"

"She probably does. Even if she can't understand it, she's feeling it intuitively. That's exactly what ultra-logic is."

"She's not moving. Does that mean we can interpret it as her not finding an answer?"

"That interpretation is also limited by common sense. The Wizard's creativity transcends the logic of reality. If we were to reveal the form of her thoughts, wouldn't it be similar to Drimo?"

Bartok gulped.

"That's why I'm truly curious. In that genius's mind after encountering Yahweh's ultimate..."

Lampa's eyes narrowed.

"Just what is emerging?"

All the magicians who heard the explanation felt eerie chills as they focused on the Wizard.

At that moment, the Wizard opened her mouth.

"Wow."

An image she had never once thought of in her seven years of life was filling her mind.

"What's that, big brother?"

It was also unusual for the Wizard, who feels before understanding, to ask a question.

"Hexa."

As Sirone extended his hand, an adult-sized Hand of God emerged and aimed at her.

"It's a technique that handles the heart. It's kind to good people but punishes bad people. So perhaps... it might hurt you."

"Why should I be punished?"

"You know why."

The life drained from the Wizard's eyes once again.

"It doesn't matter. I'm going to win." 

The moment she finished speaking, the Wizard retreated an enormous distance and cast magic.

'Excellent judgment. But... even ingenious ideas couldn't destroy all the possibilities Sirone possessed.'

"Aha! Now I get it!"

Had she realized something anyway? The Wizard's magic became even more bizarre.

Sirone's smile trembled.

"That's dangerous."

As the Hand of God charged at tremendous speed, the Wizard's eyes flashed with sharpness.

"Huh? That's nothing special?"

Seeing her dodge and counterattack simultaneously, Sirone grasped the core of her thinking.

'I see.'

If human logic was a complex maze, the Wizard's logic was an infinite courtyard without walls.

"La la la. La la la."

In that space of reasoning, seven-year-old Wizard hummed while freely wandering around.

'I'll block the infinite first.'

As the Hand of God deployed, a massive barrier crashed down on the Wizard's courtyard.

"What a surprise!"

She stared at the barrier for a moment.

Even Iruki, the pinnacle of Servant, could only have maze-like thought patterns, but...

"It's okay. I can just go around."

She could move in all directions.

"I need to plant it here."

When she stopped wherever she pleased and sprinkled seeds on the ground, they sprouted instantly.

"Grow, grow."

The specific form of those sprouts presented new possibilities, growing into a massive world tree.

Kururururung!

"Yahoo! I knocked it down."

At the point when the world tree toppled the barrier, the real Sirone faced his first crisis.

'Truly tremendous talent.'

Even while dodging the Hand of God's pursuit, her magic was evolving in real time.

"Sirone, isn't the Five Great Stars being pushed back?"

At Bartok's words, not only the teachers but even the members of the Ten Wizards stirred.

Though there were no barriers of reasoning in actual combat, they could feel the advantage or disadvantage through momentum alone.

"The Five Great Stars is a defensive-oriented magician."

Lampa said.

"You can't say whether offense or defense is advantageous, but their combat styles are different. An attacker focuses on the target, but a defender must read the entire situation."

Amy subtly raised the corner of her mouth.

"The problem is that it's too vast."

Toward the endlessly growing world tree, the Wizard spread both arms and bounced around.

"I knocked them all down!"

The trees she had planted had completely destroyed all the barriers Sirone had erected.

"I won! Stupid big brother!"

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

At the stubbornly simple attacks, the Wizard endlessly retreated.

"No matter how many walls you build, this place is... huh?"

How far had she moved from where she started? Something touched her back.

Turning around, a black barrier stood there.

"Why is this here? This isn't even the dueling area..."

As she casually rummaged through seeds, she suddenly realized and turned her head.


The black barriers Sirone had erected were endlessly built beyond the horizon.

The Wizard's expression hardened for the first time.

"Why here..."

He had surrounded an immeasurably distant radius with barriers that her vision couldn't reach.

Though it was still a vast space.

"It's not infinite."

Lampa couldn't contain his bursting laughter.

"While the Wizard was focusing on the target, the Five Great Stars was looking at places her reasoning couldn't reach. And from there, he developed his strategy, gradually narrowing the radius."

Bartok muttered.

"If the creativity that could expand endlessly is trapped by barriers, from now on it's the realm of logic."

"That's right. That's it."

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

The Wizard's face turned pale as she looked at the barriers closing in from all directions.

"Hmph! Th-there are still plenty of places to escape!"

But Sirone remained cold, only driving her into a perfect situation.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thu—

"Why? Why?"

As paths formed and situations arose where she had no choice but to change direction, anxiety struck.

"I don't know where this is!"

No matter how many countless forks she wandered through, she could only see black barriers, let alone an exit.

At a fork at the end of a deep passage, the Wizard instinctively turned right.

"...It's blocked."

Placing both hands on the barrier and looking up, she ran in the opposite direction again.

How naive was her heart, thinking the remaining path would be a way out.

"Huuk..."

But all that awaited her was a black barrier emanating cold air.

Kukukukukukuku!

The ground shook, and looking back down the single path, the Hand of God was approaching with tremendous force.

Lampa muttered with cold eyes.

"Checkmate."

Sirone's eyes flashed with killing intent as he charged toward the Wizard at Movement Zero.

"I don't want to. I don't want to lose."

The Hand of God expanded to enormous size in the tearful Wizard's pupils.

"I'm sor..."

Her eyes squeezed shut.

"I'm sorry."

Kwarrrrrrrrrung!

The barriers of reasoning collapsed, and those watching the duel stood with their mouths agape.

"That's right."

A gentle voice.

Feeling the hand stroking her head, the Wizard opened her eyes to see Sirone's face.

"You're a good child."

Wena Wizard, age 7.

For the first time in her life, she met an adult.
