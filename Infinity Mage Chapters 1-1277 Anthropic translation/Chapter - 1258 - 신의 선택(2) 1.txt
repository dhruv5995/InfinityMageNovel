God's Choice (2)

The prosecutors from each nation focused their minds to escape from Ymir's characteristic mental derangement.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

While many soldiers were retching from motion sickness, they were still carefully selected elites.

The time it took for them to emerge from their confused state averaged less than a minute.

"Phew."

And all of them realized that some of the scenes they had witnessed during their mental derangement were not hallucinations.

"Ymir is..."

The king of giants groaned with a contorted face.

"Grrrr..."

Having experienced Ymir's power indirectly, the shock was even greater.

Naturally, everyone's gaze focused on the blue-haired swordsman with magnificent wings.

"Everyone."

Rian twisted his waist and smiled warmly.

"It's been a while."

Seeing his grandson returned from hell, Clump desperately held back tears that threatened to flow.

'I must be getting old.'

If he weren't a commander leading a nation's forces, he might have truly made a mistake.

"Yes. So you've finally come? You seem to have gotten quite strong..."

Before Clump could finish speaking, Tess dismounted her horse and rushed toward Rian.

"Whoa."

The moment Rian raised his hand, she dove into his embrace.

"Whew."

Seeing them whistle even in this situation showed how thick-skinned they were.

Rian smiled and asked.

"Have you been well?"

"Idiot."

Tess looked up with moist eyes.

"If you were coming, you should have said you were coming, shouldn't you?"

"Sorry."

He knew it was an odd thing to say, but truthfully, Rian felt sorry to Tess about many things.

Ymir spoke up.

"Sorry to interrupt, but can I say something too? I'm the one who's most glad to see you here."

Rian's strike from earlier was the sole reason Ymir had crossed the universe.

Tess snapped back.

"I don't want to hear about being glad from someone like you who tramples on lives like ants."

"Hey."

Power entered Ymir's eyes, and his mental force was imprinted on Tess's heart like a brand.

'Ugh!'

Though it was mental force, the next moment an attack would follow, and even if not, it was at a level that could be fatal.

"The strong one is that guy, not you. Those without qualification shouldn't interfere."

"Stop."

As Asura's energy spread from Rian, the oppressive feeling tormenting Tess disappeared.

The attack did not come.

"Hah! Hah!"

Though Tess breathed heavily, Ymir paid no attention to even that.

'To easily dispel mental force...'

He was simply curious about the vicious Asura energy rippling over Rian's shoulders.

'Has he reached the realm of the martial god?'

Asura Balvalta (Buddha of the Battlefield).

'The feeling from earlier was...'

It refers to the most perfect strike delivered after mastering all the battles in the world.

'It's neither talent nor trickery.'

Maximum experience accumulated purely through effort.

'Just how many has he cut down?'

He was itching to fight soon.

"You've grown. Is it a mental realm this time? Good. This time, you and I will truly..."

"Why fight?"

At Rian's question, Ymir closed his mouth.

"Ymir, you are strong. The modifier 'strongest' has always followed your history. But you do nothing. Your battles have no justification, no purpose."

"...So?"

"If you're not trying to gain something by defeating me, if what you want is merely victory, I'll give it to you as much as you want. So won't you stop fighting now?"

In the silence, Clump thought.

'That immature fellow...'

Now he can even speak quite impressively.

'No, honestly he's better than me. It means he went through such hardships in hell.'

"What nonsense are you talking?"

Ymir's expression twisted frighteningly.

"Did seeing too much blood make you think you've really become a Buddha? No, you're a demon. A demon that follows the scent of blood. Your realm is most ideal for cutting someone down."

"That's probably true."

Rian did not deny it.

"But I don't want to win anymore. That's all. If you want victory, take as much as you want."

"Stupid fool."

Just victory, of all things.

"No, never mind."

Ymir coldly raised the corner of his mouth.

"I'll create one for you - a justification."

At the endlessly growing killing intent, everyone in the area turned away with pale faces.

"Take cover!"

The speed of escape differed between masters and novices, but in Ymir's eyes, they were all just insects.

"Too late."

When his full-powered strike hit the air, compressed steel-like air shot out.

"All of you die."

It was a scheme to make Rian lose his temper, but once again space distorted.

"Huh?"

Ether waves.

Beyond the level of distortion, space bent almost in a linear form and headed toward Ymir.

Bang!

Ymir's head snapped back 90 degrees as he received his own steel air attack back.

"...What are you?"

Jin Seong-eum revealed herself from the cracks in space.

"The Emperor of Jincheon."

As those who had saved their lives scattered in all directions, she spoke to Rian.

"From now on, I will travel around the world gathering personnel. I cannot help with combat."

Her mission was transportation, after all.

She had realized when fighting Ymir's molars that ether waves were not effective against such an opponent.

"Alright. I'm counting on you."

Since the giant's army was coming anyway, humanity also needed to gather its full strength.

After Jin Seong-eum disappeared, Ymir grumbled.

"The place is full of gnat-like guys. Should I just blow this entire area away?"

"There's no need for that."

The moment Rian drew his great sword, thousands of blade-like killing intents surged forth.

"I'll be your opponent."

"Kekeke."

See, there's no helping it.

'Guys like us...'

Ymir, who had been leaning as if about to fall, kicked off the ground and disappeared the next moment.

"Can't live without this!"

Rian's body, charging at the same speed, bloomed with hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of afterimages.

"Grrrr!"

Different battlefields, battles, and situations filled the background like a single painting of hell.

'Asura...'

An enlightenment that transcended all those experiences.

'Balvalta!'

The most perfect strike penetrated Ymir's senses and dug into his side.

'Oh no!'

Ymir, realizing too late, lowered his elbow to block the great sword's blade, but...

'Damn it...!'

KWAAAAAAANG!

The flash had already crossed the world in a great arc.

In the underground temple of the Kergo ruins, Shirone's group was confronting the reborn Nameless.

"Where is he?"

Though it was a question without context, there was only one strongest memory for the dead.

'Quan.'

The swordsman who had cut down Nameless.

As Shirone kept his mouth shut, Nameless approached.

"It doesn't matter. If he's number one in this world, I'll eventually meet him if I kill just a few people."

"A few people?"

Nameless tilted his head.

"Why? I don't need to kill them all. If I kill one, everyone at a similar level to that one becomes below me. If I kill the next level, that many more fall below... "

It was the mechanism by which battlefield hierarchy was determined.

"What remains in the end are only the few at the very top. Since I've killed about 20 people here, at least 300 million should be beneath me, don't you think?"

Shirone looked at the corpses of the Kergo tribespeople.

'Mr. Mahatu.'

If they hadn't risked their lives to guard the room, they would have been annihilated by a hair's breadth.

'Nameless is probably an antivirus program.'

In other words, an administrator.

'Whether he lost his memory due to missing links being applied, or whether he knows but is deceiving us, I don't know.'

There was nothing to gain from fighting.

"Keke, everyone thinks that way at first."

Gaold stepped forward.

"What's this about being number one? A rookie who hasn't even lost his baby feathers talks big. Come at me. I, ranked 5 trillion 5 thousand, will be your opponent."

"Don't."

Shirone reached out to stop him.

"Nameless instantly masters all abilities. There's no need to show him our power."

Gaold knew that much too.

"So what? If we eliminate him here, that's the end of it, right? He's someone we'll have to clash with eventually."

"It's different from heaven. We can't just think about ourselves now. If by any chance our power gets absorbed by Nameless, it will disrupt all our future plans."

"Hmm."

"The reason God chose that guy as a hitman is because he's designed with laws that allow him to reach the strongest level fastest in a closed world."

It was a combination of the Angel of Achievement and Garas.

"Let's eliminate the bad variables first. Until Nameless reaches me, I want to buy as much time as possible."

Gaold asked.

"Why does it sound like you're saying you're number one?"

Honestly, that's right, isn't it?

"That's not what's important right now. We need to gather at the temple first. The situation there doesn't look good."

"Even so..."

Just as Kang Nan was about to speak, space on the wall side distorted, revealing the corridor of Delta headquarters.

"Shirone."

Jin Seong-eum came out to meet them.

"Oho."

The group finally grasped Shirone's strategy and entered toward the temple corridor.

Miro glanced at Seong-eum.

'Perfect timing. Does space also mean time? I understand why Shirone wanted to save her.'

Of course, the biggest reason for liking Seong-eum would be her strong will that doesn't fear even hell.

Shirone, who had been guarding the entrance until the group moved locations, spoke while keeping Nameless in check.

"I'll cancel the simultaneous event. Seong-eum, please bring Mr. Zulu from the Pyramid of Truth."

"Alright. Be careful."

After Gaold's group disappeared and the temple scenery changed to walls, Shirone's expression changed.

"Nameless."

The anger of the Kergo people he had to sacrifice for humanity was contained in his voice.

"You can never surpass Mr. Quan."

A world where one could become the best just by being excellent was merely God's theory.

After Shirone, who had eliminated the simultaneous event, disappeared, Nameless was left alone in thought.

'How to cut down Quan.'

The way to suppress movement that transcended common sense was to dominate space.

As Nameless closed his eyes, the air trembled and the scenery began to crumple.

Ether waves.

The moment Nameless's body disappeared, a bang sound erupted from the opposite wall.

Having collided head-on with the wall, he stood upright before sitting down as he was.

What was the problem?

"Aha."

Insight no less than God's intelligence began correcting the error instantly.

'It was much more difficult than I thought.'

Deciding to do it properly, he sat cross-legged and fell into deep meditation.

Time remaining until master.

38 minutes 27 seconds.

The Pyramid of Truth.

Since Shirone had left for the outside world, Zulu's group was still staying at the top.

They had no choice but to wait, but before long, change came to this place too.

"Glen!"

As Shirone deployed Ouroboros, change came to Glen, who had lost his mind.

"I want to live."

Ares saw hope, but Glen's condition as seen by Arin of the Super Senses was different.

"Nothing has changed yet."

As God's and Shirone's tachyons collided, Ren's state was also suspended between half-material and half-human.

"Gl-Glen..."

Rukia reached out and grasped Glen's hand.

Though she had fallen into exhaustion from the shock of God's right hand and the devil's left hand entering her.

'Yahweh.'

That experience had changed her definition of God.

'Give Glen courage.'

The fact that when we save ourselves, God dwells in each of our hearts.
