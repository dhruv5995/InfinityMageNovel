Clan of Darkness (2)

The mansion looked no different than it had moments before.

'Have my eyes gone strange?'

But when Rian's sword was swung, the wall split open to reveal the night scenery beyond.

And finally, even that scenery cracked apart as a single flash of light filled his entire field of vision.

"Graaah... Why?" The vampire's eyes shook with shock. A half-physical, half-spiritual body that could penetrate anything it could destroy. But Rian's object had the property of being indestructible, making it a natural enemy to vampires.

"Stand back."

Rian pointed his sword forward.

"It's not over yet."

Blood oozed stickily between the vampire's upper and lower body, then rejoined them.

'Powerful regeneration.'

It was one of the abilities of purebloods - rapidly healing the body using blood.

Driving a stake through the heart would make regeneration impossible, but vampires were a race that could come back to life once the stake was removed.

"You... you're not human."

Rian is human.

"My sword will kill you. Surrender quietly."

"Nonsense."

History had proven what happened to vampires captured by humans.

The vampire briefly looked around and spotted the knights remaining behind him.

"Hehe, I'll kill at least one more." The vampire's legs began to split apart, transforming into countless bats that flew toward the knights.

"Aaaah! What is this!"

Rian kicked off the ground and dove into the swarm of bats, revealing the terrified knights.

"Get out quickly!"

He swung his great sword to scatter the bats, but the knights couldn't even lift their heads.

"S-save us...!"

He grabbed a knight by the collar and threw him outside. The body floated up with a whoosh and rolled on the ground.

"Tonight you'll be my sacrifice!" The vampire, his lower body dissolved like smoke, charged at a clean-looking knight.

'Damn! I have no choice!'

Just as Rian pushed the knight away with all his strength, the vampire's palm came flying.

"Soul Strike!"

The vampire's technique of delivering impact in soul form struck Rian's chest with full force.

"Guh!"

Rian's heart stopped as he crashed into the wall with a loud bang, and Aileen's face went pale.

"Mister!"

Crash!

A nimble figure broke through the third-floor window and landed in the first-floor hall.

"Stand back!"

It was a woman's voice, and she had silver hair.

She quickly ran up the stairs with rapid footsteps and swung a sharp thin sword.

The blade sliced across the vampire's neck.

"Gack! This is!"

He used transformation magic to change to a half-soul state, but surprisingly, the sword accurately inflicted a wound.

"Vampire Hunter!"

The moment he saw the gleaming sword the woman held, doubt became certainty.

In any case, since he had killed Rian, his escape route was now open.

"Damn! I'll remember this!" The vampire fled by phasing through the wall, and the woman quickly changed direction.

"Where do you think you're going!"

"Mister! Mister!"

The woman, who had been about to give chase, flinched at Aileen's sobbing voice and turned around.

Rian was leaning against the wall with his head tilted.

"It's already too late. An Almas-class Soul Strike doesn't just stop the heart - it makes it explode."

Since there was no point in attempting emergency resuscitation, the woman launched herself out through the broken window and disappeared.

Aileen didn't give up and shook Rian.

"Don't die! What am I supposed to do if you die, mister! Hurry up and wake up!"

"Ugh, so noisy."

Rian slowly opened his eyes.

"Oh my god!"

Though Aileen had been pleading for him to come back to life, she was startled like she'd seen a ghost when he actually got up.

"Wh-what? That woman said your heart..."

"Yeah, it stopped."

The yaksha's durability had preserved his form, so recovery didn't take very long.

'Still regenerating?'

Smile's hallucination echoed in his ears.

"Don't worry. This much won't kill me." He had heard that his heart stopped.

"...Then how much would it take to kill you?"

"I don't know either."

Thinking that perhaps he wasn't so different from vampires, Rian looked up at the third-floor window.

"Who was that?"

Even amid the life-and-death chaos, Aileen had remembered the crucial information.

"It was a silver-haired woman, and the vampire called her a Hunter."

"Ah."

Not all Hunters were strong, but as far as Rian knew, they used every method that vampires hated.

'No wonder it ran away.' If it was a force specialized in vampire combat, even an Almas-class would find it difficult to handle.

"Can't be helped. We'll have to wait for next time."

It had been an unavoidable choice to save the knight, but having his heart stop once was better than increasing the death toll.

"What's happening? Don't tell me..."

Belatedly, the mansion's lights came on and Aileen's mother came running with soldiers.

"Mom!"

She embraced Aileen and looked back at Rian with a frightened expression.

Normally she would have been working late, but due to the warning letter incident, she had returned home two hours early.

"What happened?"

"A vampire was targeting your daughter. It escaped. It probably won't attack again tonight."

"You let it escape? Even with all these troops?"

Rian didn't want to explain what position the Almas class held in vampire society.

"Mom, Rian mister - I mean, big brother - protected me."

Since Aileen only called older people "big brother" in limited cases, her mother's expression softened too.

"Oh, I'm sorry. I got sensitive without realizing it."

"It's fine. You must be worried about your daughter."

"Yes. If you need anything, please let me know. I'll spare no support in helping you."

Rian looked around the corridor.

"Then first, dismiss all the troops."

"Pardon?"

It was an absurd suggestion, but if the opponent was an Almas, such a ragtag bunch would only become hostages.

"It's easier for me to guard alone. I'll explain in detail when the security captain comes tomorrow morning."

"Mom, do what big brother says."

Aileen's voice had a tone suggesting there was something only the two of them could understand.

"A-alright. Then."

While the butlers cleaned up the bodies and organized the house at her instruction, Aileen came running up.

"Big brother, what should I do then?"

Rian was firm.

"You go inside and sleep quickly."

The next morning, Security Captain Benoff, who had already received word the night before, visited the Barca family.

"Had a fight, did you?"

"Yes. The culprit does seem to be a vampire. And an Almas class at that."

At the mention of a pureblood - of which there were only dozens in the world - Benoff scratched his head.

"Damn! A big shot has entered the scene."

"There were casualties. I'm sorry."

"I heard the story. It's not your fault. If you hadn't sacrificed yourself, there would have been more deaths."

"What about security?"

"We'll bring the entire family to the royal castle. You can join our mobile unit. You're not thinking of backing out, are you?"

Though he didn't have the same universal love as Shirone, Rian was a swordsman who had sworn to take responsibility for all deaths.

"Of course not. Are there any results?"

"Just confirming that it's a vampire can be called a result. From now on, we'll press hard."

"Where?"

"There's a place we couldn't access because clear guidelines weren't established. The Rodenin Blood Bank. The royal castle will delegate access authorization soon."

If the culprit who had stolen large amounts of blood was a vampire, investigating the blood bank was essential.

"Isn't it too late?"

"The blood bank is an institution under the royal castle. Other departments can't examine the books until a warrant is issued."

"I see."

"We'll deploy the royal guard unit 'Shinjang.' Then even a pureblood vampire would be helplessly caught."

That would be true for one Almas-class.

'Something's strange.'

The amount of blood being stolen was too much for what one vampire would need.

'Did they form an organization centered around an Almas?'

Especially if it was a royal institution, the possibility of internal spies couldn't be ruled out.

"Could you give me some time?"

"Why? The mobile unit hasn't been formed yet..."

"There's something I want to investigate separately."

So the Barca family entered the royal castle, and Rian wandered the city alone.

'Here it is. The Rodenin Blood Bank.' He examined the seven-story building occupying a triangular corner, then entered an alley.

When night fell, as expected, several groups wandered the maze-like alleys.

'There's no way to confirm.'

One of the reasons vampires were difficult to eliminate was that they were indistinguishable from humans.

'They have the weakness of being vulnerable to sunlight, but...'

That was only fatal to mixed-bloods, not purebloods, and purebloods were said to endure using powerful regeneration.

"Hey, you guys."

When Rian called out, a group of five stopped walking and turned their heads.

"What are you?"

The leader, a medium-height man, pulled out a knife first.

"I have something to ask. Have you ever seen people entering or leaving this blood bank at this hour?"

The leader's eyes visibly wavered.

"Who are you? Security?"

"A prosecutor."

"A prosecutor?"

The leader approached, spinning his knife.

"How does my blade taste?"

The fact that he could stab at the stomach with just a knife without revealing killing intent was proof of his experience.

"Huh?"

Rian quickly twisted his upper body and punched the leader in the abdomen, lifting both his feet off the ground.

"Gahhhhh..."

As the leader knelt and vomited gastric fluid, the group behind him charged forward.

"This bastard wants to fight!" There was no need to draw his great sword.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

He lightly tapped them with jabs learned from Benoff, and their necks snapped as they collapsed to the ground.

"S-spare us! We don't know anything!"

'They're not vampires.'

But they didn't seem to know absolutely nothing.

"Confess honestly. As I said, I'm not security. If you misjudge..."

When Rian drew his great sword, the leader's face went pale.

"We really don't know! We just transported things! We didn't do anything wrong!"

"Transported? What?"

"B-bags! If we wait here in front of the blood bank, someone comes out at dawn and gives us bags and money. When we deliver the bags, the money becomes ours."

"Who gave you the bags?"

"It was dark, so we couldn't see clearly." Rian pressed his great sword to the man's neck.

"He wore glasses! Sharp features, about a span taller than me. Pale face and slender build."

'Not the one who entered the Barca family.'

Rian asked.

"Where did you transport the bags?"

"The destination changes every time. Sometimes the 13th block, sometimes the 47th block."

They wouldn't have revealed their hideout.

"Are there others besides you doing this work?"

"Everyone seems to be doing it these days. The factions take turns by date to transport. Honestly, it feels fishy, but they pay too much money. We're also risking our lives for this work."

Rian checked the time.

"Go back. And don't come near this place again." When the leader looked confused as if he didn't understand, Rian glared with fierce eyes and threatened him.

"Would you rather die here?"

"N-no!"

The leader, who couldn't even pick up his dropped knife, ran deep into the alley followed by his group.

'A broker going in and out of the blood bank. Then the security team must already be under surveillance.'

That's why Rian had to step in.

After waiting two hours in the spot where he'd sent the thugs away, the area became completely deserted.

In the pitch-black night with even the crystal lamps extinguished, a man wearing a bowler hat appeared in front of the blood bank.

'He's here.'

After the man looked around and headed to the back door, Rian finally came out to the street and began his surveillance.
