[558] The Steel Door Again (3)

That evening.

After the orientation ended, Iruki and Nade headed straight to the research society.

When they opened the door and entered, Shirone was sitting on the sofa with a pale, ashen face.

"What's wrong? Why do you look like that?"

Iruki spoke, and Nade rolled up his sleeves as he approached.

"Why else? He's probably drying up with fear imagining the massacre that's about to unfold. Come here. Let's beat everything except your mouth."

"Guys..."

Shirone turned his head with a terrified expression.

"Something's strange here."

"Yeah, it would be strange. It's going to be where your corpse gets buried."

"Listen to me! I'm serious!"

"Shut up! A traitor with nothing but a big mouth!"

With Nade's sincere and rough wrestling, Shirone felt the world spinning around him.

"Ahhh! Save me!"

This time, even Iruki didn't stop him.

"It's fine. You won't die. You just won't be able to function as a man."

"Aha! That's a good idea!"

Shirone's eyes widened.

"Wait! Uhahaha! That tickles!"

"We're nowhere near done!"

Under Nade's persistent torment, Shirone thrashed about.

"Uhahaha! Ah! Stop! It really hurts!"

Only after a shrill scream erupted did Nade release Shirone and dust off his hands.

"Hmph, if you betray us again, you know what happens, right?"

"I get it, I get it."

Iruki patted the sofa and said,

"Sit down for now. Let's at least hear you out. If it was serious enough for you to write a will before leaving, it must have been something major, right?"

While this wasn't nearly enough to fully calm their anger, their desire to hear Shirone's reasons was stronger.

Shirone, who had been wrung dry of tears, also temporarily set aside thoughts of his portrait and sat down.

"So what happened was..."

The story continued for a full two hours, and even that was compressed.

After blinking for a long while, Nade suddenly asked,

"Have you been writing novels lately?"

"I'm telling you it's true!"

They knew Shirone wasn't the type to lie, but it was a story too difficult to digest and accept immediately.

"Anyway, I understand. Hmm, so that's why you refused the evaluation. It's definitely the right decision. If you can't stand out with scores, it's important to make an impact in the graduation exam."

At Iruki's words, Nade beat his chest.

"Good! Don't worry, Shirone. I'll give you all the information about the graduating class."

Iruki scoffed.

"What information could you give? You're dead last in the graduating class."

Shirone's eyes widened.

"What? Dead last? Nade, are you really in last place?"

"Ahaha, somehow it ended up that way."

It was an unexpected result since Nade, even if not enthusiastic about magic, had always maintained average grades.

"It's because of me."

While Nade had indeed fallen into the deepest despair when the leader of their trio disappeared, he wasn't weak enough to burden his friend with that responsibility.

"No. That's absolutely not it. Actually, I took the graduating class too lightly. I learned you can't just coast along like in the advanced class."

Iruki agreed with that point.

'Anyway, now that Shirone's back, that guy Nade will probably get his act together too.'

Having all his friends graduate while he stayed behind alone would be the most terrible outcome.

"But if Nade is in last place, that means with me, Maya, and Aider gone, he's 27th. Iruki, what rank are you?"

Iruki answered briefly.

"8th."

"Wow, Class One? That's amazing."

"Well... one guy lost his mind, so I had to maintain the balance."

Nade pouted with an annoyed expression.

"Besides, I'm not that amazing. Amy is 5th."

'5th place!'

Shirone's fists clenched involuntarily.

Since she had also taken the final evaluation in 5th place last year, it wasn't a bad pace for the middle of the term.

Nade said,

"After you left, three people were newly promoted to Class One. Amy, Iruki, and Dante."

"What rank is Dante?"

"4th."

"..."

Though Shirone had resolved that from now on it would be about politics rather than ability, hearing about his friends' advancement made anxiety wash over him.

"So three of the existing Class One members dropped to Class Two. There have been considerable upheavals beyond that too."

"It really was intense."

Nade trembled his fists in frustration.

"Tch, hearing Shirone's story, now I understand. That bastard Fermi, I wondered how he kept staying in 1st place, but he was buying other people's magic."

"That's also an ability. And Shirone, you don't need to worry too much either. You said you received special training from the great Miro."

Only then did Shirone recall his supernatural intuition again.

"Right, listen to my story."

When Shirone explained the abilities of the Four Symbols Unity, Nade gaped with his mouth open.

"What are you talking about? What does it mean to perceive time differently?"

"I'll show you directly."

Standing up, Shirone entered the state of unity between self and object, and the Avatar of Light manifested.

"This is... an Avatar?"

"Yeah. It's the law that destroys time. Like this..."

Trailing golden afterimages as he moved, when Shirone stopped, his body moved to where he had been one second before.

"..."

After a long silence, Iruki spoke.

"I see. You're not transcending time, but perceiving time itself differently, right?"

"Exactly. Moreover, future events too..."

At that moment, banging sounds from the ceiling were heard again, and Shirone's eyes widened as he shouted,

"This is it! Do you hear it? You're listening, right?"

His friends looked around.

"What do you hear? I only hear you making noise."

Shirone turned his head following the screaming sound that erupted from outside the door.

"Look! Don't you hear the fighting sounds from the corridor either?"

Iruki, who checked the corridor, shook his head.

"There's no one there."

Shirone deactivated the Four Symbols Unity with a deflated expression.

"Sigh, why is this really happening?"

"What exactly is going on?"

When Shirone explained step by step, even Iruki showed a puzzled expression.

"Isn't it a side effect of your ability? While perceiving time differently..."

"That's not it. There were no problems anywhere else. It only happens in Estas."

"Hmm, Estas..."

Shirone looked at Nade, who wore a thoughtful expression.

"Do you have any ideas? You uncovered the secret of my supernatural intuition before."

"No, it's not that, I just remembered something a senior told me before. As you know, the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society was a place where great seniors belonged. Because of that, numerous underground research societies have been eyeing this place for a long time, trying to take it over."

Iruki interjected.

"You mean the upper floor rumors? But listening to Shirone's story, that was just Miro's space-time, wasn't it?"

"I thought so too. But how do you explain the supernatural intuition Shirone felt now? More than anything, the story I heard from my direct senior keeps bothering me."

"What story did you hear?"

Nade spoke immediately, as if he didn't need to remember.

"In the upper floors of Estas, everything that cannot exist in this world exists. That's why so many research societies try to take over this place."

Shirone pondered Nade's words.

"What do you mean by things that cannot exist in this world?"

"I don't know either. The senior didn't know. It's something passed down from the senior's senior, and that senior's senior. It might just be a rumor. Honestly, I thought the secret of Estas was completely solved after hearing your story. But now..."

"There's something more."

Iruki showed interest and propped his chin.

"It's worth investigating. Something hidden at specific coordinates of the building, like Miro's space-time?"

Nade's eyes lit up as he shouted,

"Right! Let's try changing the building's structure! Now that we know it's a puzzle involving space-time, Iruki should be able to calculate it too."

While Shirone didn't think Iruki was inferior to Sein in brain function, he was worried in a different sense.

"Let's not go too deep. We're graduating class students. Even studying desperately every day isn't enough."

Iruki wagged his finger.

"No. We should do it because we're graduating class students. Once we graduate, when will we come here again? We can't let others steal this fun."

"Exactly! Let's write new history. Let's uncover the secret of Estas!"

At Nade's excitement, Iruki threw in a jab.

"You just don't want to attend classes."

"That's not true. I'll work hard now. Since Shirone's back too."

Watching his friends who had strange momentum, he sighed, but as the person involved in the incident, he had nothing to say.

"Fine. Should we start right now then?"

Shirone raised his hand to stop them.

"No, that won't work. I have somewhere to go today."

"Huh? Where are you going at this hour?"

"I think I should tell Amy. She'd be hurt if she found out she heard it later than you guys."

Also, Shirone didn't really want his friends to get too absorbed in this matter.

"Well, if you're going to get beaten anyway, it's better to get beaten early. The beating will double with each passing day."

"Haha! Right. And let's solve the Estas problem on weekends if possible. We have 15 weeks until the graduation exam, so there's plenty of time."

Iruki nodded.

"Then let's disperse for now. Even if we can't enter the evaluation hall, we can see each other in the dining hall anyway."

The three people who had reached a conclusion left Estas's storage room, and by the time they arrived at the dormitory, it was already late at night.

'Isn't it too late?'

Returning to his room, Shirone hesitated for a moment but somehow felt certain that she wouldn't be sleeping.

"Right, I should go."

Having made his decision, Shirone put on his coat and turned the door handle.

And the next moment, he froze in place.

Amy stood there with a face just as surprised as Shirone's.

"..."

It was a strange coincidence to meet face-to-face with just a door between them, but Amy's eyes had already become calm.

"You were in your room. Were you going somewhere?"

"Huh? No, actually... I was going to see you."

"I see."

When Shirone couldn't speak due to the unexpected reaction, Amy pointed to the room.

"May I come in for a moment?"

"Of course."

After giving Amy the chair and sitting on the bed himself, Shirone waited for the right timing to speak in the awkward atmosphere.

"Um..."

Both spoke simultaneously, and Amy took the lead.

"You go first."

"Yeah. I wanted to explain. Why I had no choice but to leave. So I..."

"Wait. Let me speak first."

At the unexpected situation, Shirone gulped.

"Let me do that. I want to make it clear before my heart becomes weak."

Before her heart becomes weak.

Though Amy hadn't revealed anything yet, just hearing those words made Shirone's heart pound.

"Shirone, no matter what explanation you give, I have no intention of forgiving you."

"Amy..."

"I know you won't misunderstand, but I'll make it clear. It's not that I won't see you anymore or end our friendship. It's just that I..."

Amy, who had been hesitating, raised her head again.

"When you disappeared like that, I had no choice. Whether I should keep waiting for you like this, or just forget you."

"I understand. I'm sorry."

Even with ten mouths, he had nothing to say.

While life and death matters can't be calculated by probability, it had been a journey he embarked on assuming he might not return.

Amy spoke with a forced smile.

"So, that's just how it is. If you're expecting something from me, or if you think we can return to the time before you left, there's no need to explain. You're still a good friend. What I mean is..."

Amy, who suddenly stopped speaking, looked dazed.

She had run countless simulations in her head before entering the room, but this was a situation she hadn't anticipated.
