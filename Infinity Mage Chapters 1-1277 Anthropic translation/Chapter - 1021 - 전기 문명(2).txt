Electric Civilization (2)

The refugees aboard the three hundred ships looked around with bewildered expressions.

"Are we alive?"

When the bird dragons came flying, no one had expected to survive, but a strange phenomenon occurred.

The spatial barrier rippled, and before they knew it, thousands of bombs had all exploded.

Shirone felt secretly relieved.

'It's incredibly tricky to actually pull off.' Sleight of Hand wasn't magic, but rather a technique closer to a trick.

It only appeared to ignore the laws because the trick occurred at the quantum level.

Poine's eyes turned sharp.

'Such a method...'

If a magician deceives the eyes, Shirone deceives perception.

'The moment the entire audience becomes certain of the future, the mind becomes something predictable - in other words, a law.'

And if it's a law, Shirone can twist the events they perceive.

'The reason it's still a trick is... when people's perception returns, the event itself regains logical probability.'

"Hehe."

If someone had suspected a different future, the three hundred ships would never have disappeared.

"Magic that gambled with twenty thousand lives." It was a momentary art that occurred when everyone's perception was focused on a blind spot.

"Definitely not sane."

That aside.

"What will you do? Will you die by my hand now, or wait until the Messiah arrives?"

When Poine looked back at the pirate ship, Jakra's face, standing on the deck, crumpled.

"Hmm."

"Captain, what should we do?"

He thought it was only human courtesy to at least pretend to consider if the opponent was a first-class dragon.

"Is there any need to wait?"

Electricity flowed in Jakra's eyes, and a powerful magnetic field surrounded him in a sphere.

"Let's go, boys!"

When the crew members activated the machinery after realizing his sincerity, the pirate ship began to turn transparent.

"Stealth? How pathetic." Though it was high-level technology, it wasn't something a dragon couldn't handle.

"Kraaaang!"

Poine folded her wings and plummeted toward the pirate ship that remained only as a blurry outline.

But what her teeth touched wasn't the pirate ship, but salty seawater.

"Pfft!"

As Poine, submerged in the sea, shook off the water and looked around, a horn sounded from far away.

"Kahaha! Over here, over here!"

Jakra's pirate ship, which had somehow moved six kilometers away, revealed itself.

"Come at me, lizard."

Jakra, standing on the deck, wiggled his hand provocatively and then raised his middle finger.

Probably some kind of electric energy.

"Grrrrr..."

Technology that handled energy at a level that existing humanity had never created...

"Kraaaang!"

Poine, whose eyes had already rolled back, flew up recklessly and deployed magic circles in all directions.

"Dissolve."

From the magic circles created with the power of dragon speech, highly toxic acid sprayed out with tremendous pressure.

Jakra burst into laughter.

"Puhaha! Do you see that, the lizard's lost her mind?"

The pirate ship, which moved through space using electrical power, was agile regardless of size and mass.

"Captain! Over there..."

"Enough! Blast her! I authorize maximum output for the energy cannon! Today's a lizard party!"

"No, that's not it!"

The crew members shouted while covering their noses.

"The ship is melting!" When Jakra narrowed his eyes and looked around, the nearby sea was turning completely green.

Hundreds of thousands of fish floated up, reminiscent of land covered with corpses.

The vice-captain approached.

"How about we retreat now? We've saved enough face."

"...Rangi?"

Jakra turned his head toward the Arachne sailing ship and pressed his temple, causing the scenery to zoom in.

The battle between the knights and pirates was in full swing.

"Kahaha! Too easy?"

Pirates equipped with stealth weapons cut the knights' throats from invisible positions.

"Damn it! How can we fight what we can't see!"

The knights, who had retreated repeatedly on deck, were pushed back to the entrance of the inner chambers guarded by Cairns.

"You idiots! And you call yourselves knights of Arachne!"

Once the enemies entered the inner chambers, it would be a matter of time before they plundered the gold and silver treasures inside.

'No, more than that, Rangi...'

Recalling the only tribute that Calt, King of Dionas, desired, he suddenly realized.

'Where did she go?'

Rangi, who had been on deck until she was on Shirone's sailing ship, was nowhere to be seen.

"Huff! Huff!"

Running through the corridor lined with countless rooms in the inner chambers, Rangi looked back.

"Eek!"

Confirming that something ghostlike and shimmering was still following her, her knees went weak.

'Not a room. That's a dead end.' But even if she ran along the path, it was just a sailing ship trapped in the vast ocean.

"Kyah!"

Rangi turned her head and felt a dull impact on her face before collapsing on the spot.

"Are you Rangi?"

When she looked up in surprise, Jakra appeared, having disabled stealth mode.

"My brother would like you."

"Please, spare me."

Though Rangi had dealt with quite a few villains, Jakra's eyes looking at her weren't normal.

"Why are you even begging... Just come along nicely and nothing will happen. Got it?"

Rangi nodded.

"Hmm."

Jakra, who had been watching her desperate expression, grabbed her wrist and opened a door.

"This won't do. Let's have a little chat first."

"Kyaah!"

Rangi struggled, but she couldn't overcome Jakra's powerful strength.

'Shirone.'

One person came to mind.

"Hehe, what a windfall today..."

Before Jakra's eyes as he opened the door, particles of light began gathering rapidly.

'Photon Cannon.'

When Shirone, who had arrived via quantum transmission, cast magic, Jakra's body flew backward.

As soon as her wrist was freed, Rangi sat down clutching her head and looked behind her.

The traces of a person flying through and continuing to pierce the walls of the inner chambers spread before her eyes.

"Miss Rangi, are you alright?"

At the voice from in front, she turned her head to see Shirone worriedly extending his hand.

"H-how?"

There was no way Shirone could appear in a sealed room.

"Get up first. I'll take you to a safe place."

As Rangi took his hand and stood up, Jakra's shouting could be heard through the hole in the wall.

"You damn..."

The voice continued from close by.

"Bastard!"

When Jakra appeared before their eyes and swung his fist, Shirone retreated with Rangi.

'Spatial jump ability.' It was close to a combination of Flicker and Spark, but the problem was that it wasn't magic.

"A relic of Maika?"

Jakra raised one eyebrow.

"Hehe, what, want to know? If you want to know, hand over that woman."

There was no fool who would negotiate with pirates.

"Don't want to? You really don't want to, right? Then..."

Jakra pressed his temple and his body became transparent before disappearing instantly.

"Sh-Shirone."

As Rangi hugged Shirone's arm, voices echoed from all directions.

"How's that? Can't tell where I am, right? Should I cut your throat? Or the woman's wrist?"

Shirone stared sharply ahead.

"How about sinking the ship? If I pile up treasures at the bottom of the sea, it might draw some attention."

The voice was bait; Jakra kept his mouth firmly shut as he raised a blade behind Shirone.

'Die.'

At that moment, Jakra's eyes widened.

'What the hell?'

In the vision connected to his brain, Shirone's figure appeared to vibrate, showing multiple images.

Random numbers counted rapidly, and indecipherable ancient characters flickered.

Materialization level, electronic grade.

'Like I care.'

Just as the blade fell toward the crown of his head, Shirone twisted his waist.

'He dodged?'

More precisely, it was probability.

Shirone, who had conjured a Photon Cannon in his hand, drove it into his abdomen with the same rotational momentum.

"Ugh!"

A magnetic barrier unfolded, and incomprehensible characters appeared again.

Defense impossible. Electromagnetic field tolerance limit exceeded.

'Damn it! What the hell...!'

Jakra, who found himself flying through the opposite wall again, let out an irritated cry.

"What the hell are you babbling aboutttt!"

With a thud, as he broke through the final wall, cold seawater swallowed his body.

As the cool sound of water like a squall rushed in, Shirone took Rangi's hand and led her.

"Let's get out. The outer wall has been breached."

"What about the treasures if the ship sinks? There's over 20 tons of treasure loaded here."

"It's not even ours. What, do you feel sorry for it?"

"...Yes."

Shirone let out a hollow laugh.

"If we handle it quickly, we can prevent capsizing. First priority is catching Jakra."

A relic of Maika.

'It's a civilization that uses electricity. There's plenty of possibility it's connected to the outside world.'

Taking Rangi's hand and coming out to the deck, most of the knights were already dead.

Cairns showed relief.

"Stars above! Please save us..."

Before he could finish speaking, Shirone cast Rage, blowing the pirates off the ship.

"Where's Jakra?"

He could see Poine sinking most of the pirate ship in the distance.

'His way back is gone. And it's the vast ocean.'

If it were spatial jumps capable of crossing the sea, Rangi wouldn't be here anymore.

As if answering his question, screams came from the direction of the sailing ship where Shirone resided.

"Please save me! Please save me!"

Wet Jakra was staggering with a blade to a middle-aged woman's throat.

'Ugh, annoying. Damn machine.'

He had tried spatial jumping, but only sparks went off in his head with no response.

Shirone flew up into the sky.

"Give up. If you surrender quietly, I'll ensure you receive a fair trial according to proper procedures."

"Bullshit."

Jakra, dragging the woman to the edge of the deck, looked down toward the sea.

'There's no poison here.'

If he utilized his specialty diving ability, he could sufficiently escape the crisis.

"Nobody move. The moment anyone follows, I'll cut this woman's throat. Got it?" Jakra smiled triumphantly.

'Hehe, way too easy? Human lives are like fly lives. Just how many hostages are there here?' Stealthily climbing the railing, he jumped into the sea while embracing the woman.

"Bye-bye!"

Even as he stuck out his tongue and fell with a splash, Shirone didn't take action.

"Glug! Glub!"

The woman submerged in the sea struggled, but Jakra calmly performed underwater swimming.

'Diving record: 23 minutes.'

The reason lung capacity beyond human limits was possible was because he was a schema mimicry ability user.

'Ordinary people can't last even 3 minutes. This woman's the same. But during those 3 minutes...'

He could escape from Shirone.

'If I hide in the deep sea, what can that guy do? Please hold out for a long time. Let me live.'

"Glub! Glub!"

The sound of bubbles spurting from the woman's throat sounded delightful to Jakra.

"Huff! Huff!"

The woman took a deep breath and shouted.

"Please save me!"

"Haha! Idiot! This is underwater..." Finally realizing something was strange, when Jakra looked around, walls of water were spread out.

"Huh? Huhhh?"

Only a water surface 200 meters in diameter endlessly descended until they finally reached the deep sea floor.

The sea barrier bulged out, forming the shape of a transparent hand and approaching.

Hand of God.

Elemental Hand.

The liquid hand, with deep-sea fish swimming like in an aquarium, lifted the woman to the surface.

Shirone descended with his hands behind his back.

"Any last words?"

"Uh, well, so..."

Jakra, still unable to escape his bewildered state, raised both hands and said.

"Surrender?"

Massive volumes of water poured down, slamming him to the bottom.
