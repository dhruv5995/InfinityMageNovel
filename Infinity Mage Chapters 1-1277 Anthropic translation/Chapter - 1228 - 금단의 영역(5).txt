Forbidden Territory (5)

The atmosphere became solemn.

This wasn't about dividing into sides of good and evil to judge someone.

"What would change by doing this?"

The truth was, he didn't want to curse the sinner, advocate for good, or punish the wicked...

"I just want to solve the problem."

He simply disliked that pinnacle of chaos - willingly committing acts while knowing they couldn't take responsibility.

Hearing Sirone's words, Baal realized.

'He's not Yahweh.'

If Miracle Stream was harmful to demons, then Photon Cannon Infinity was harmful to all things.

'Atomic destruction ability.'

Yahweh, who had completely removed all inner demons through purification, should no longer be able to feel anger, but...

'It's similar.'

To Baal's perception, Photon Cannon Infinity definitely possessed the characteristics of purification.

It was merely the difference between quantum and particles - the method of one-to-one correspondence and destruction was the same.

That's what made it even more infuriating.

'I lost to a mage?'

Even after reaching the finalå¢ƒ of chaos, he could only be trampled by the pinnacle of intelligence.

'Don't be ridiculous! It's not over yet.'

The methodology of evil.

Neither the pride of the 1st Corps Commander nor the self-respect of being the strongest demon mattered anymore.

"Y-Yahweh."

With his whole body twisted, he rolled over and propped himself up on his elbow, lying flat.

"I will repent."

Intelligence had won.

But watching this scene, not only Argones but even Taesung had serious expressions.

'Sirone.'

Good and evil may be at the extremes of the world, but in terms of purpose, they were rather stable.

'Now he's the strongest even among humans. He can choose anything. If he harbors ill intentions...'

Humanity's future could head toward destruction.

"Alright."

Sirone lowered his fist and stepped back.

"That won't bring back the dead, but please do repent. Sincerely mourn for them."

If no one repents, the day when evil disappears from this world will never come.

Seeing Sirone give another chance, Taesung's eyes welled up with tears.

'Right, that's how it was.'

Since he could never harbor ill intentions, wasn't that why he chose the path of Yahweh?

"Thank you."

While Baal spoke with his forehead pressed to the ground, his eyes looking upward were cold.

'This is the end, Yahweh.'

The 1st Corps Commander's Demon Realm Deadly Cross.

With his demon power strengthened as it was now, the time for the meteor to arrive would be greatly shortened.

'Naturally, the power would be beyond imagination too.'

The moment his body began emitting purple smoke, sparks flew from Singh's eyes.

"Sirone! That bastard..."

Baal raised his face.

As if he had become a different person entirely, his face with its transformed molecular structure was the pinnacle of grotesqueness.

"In the end, it's my victory, Yahweh."

"No!"

The moment Taesung shouted, Argones shot forward and cleanly severed Baal's neck.

"...Too late."

The Administrator realized first, and Sirone looked back across the vast universe.

'It's coming.'

Meteors of tremendous mass.

As Baal's body completely vanished, the demonic energy that had seeped into the atmosphere let out a murky voice.

"Kahahaha! Since I've become a demon, you can't kill me either. How about it? Can you solve this too? Even if you destroy the meteors, humanity will go extinct from the aftershocks alone! You failed to protect them! Did you really think I would repent?"

"No."

He had expected it.

"I merely hoped. Nothing will change. We'll continue to extend our hand. No matter how much you mock us, look down on us with pity, or trick us with your forked tongue like now..."

The answer was clear.

"Because we're right."

Nowhere in this universe is there a sanctuary for demons.

"Once every hour."

Smoke of light rose from Sirone's body.

"Eliquiah."

The Ultima System, reaching 7 million people, began negating the demon realm system.

"What are you doing?!"

Though it was only 0.3 percent of existing humanity, if human justice was everything...

'That is also.'

0.003 percent of the entire universe.

"No! This can't be! How could this...!"

"It's enough."

Annihilating meteors that were mere dust compared to the universe was an easy task.

As Sirone spread both arms, a cross-shaped radiance shot pillars of light toward the heavens.

"Yahweh! You will die in agony! Someday the humans you love will kill you...!"

Sensing annihilation, Baal rapidly spat out words, but in the end, screams adorned the finale.

"Ooooooh! Ooooooh!"

Following a sound like being sucked into an abyss, the flash disappeared and silence arrived.

Everyone was looking toward Sirone.

"What... was that?"

For Singh, who dealt with laws, the flash from moments ago was the greatest shock of her life.

"Eliquiah. No..."

Sirone turned to her and said.

"Ultima System."

Singh's expression became blank, and Eumji and Yangji, who assisted her, furrowed their brows.

"Lady Singh."

Her power of enforcement was weakening.

'She's being persuaded.'

The one thing defined by 7 million people was overwhelming enough to break Singh's philosophy.

Argones, who had observed the Gaians from close by, was thinking the same thing.

'If it's truly Ultima, negating the demon realm would be simple.'

What about Cell Buster?

He couldn't make a judgment.

'With this level of power, it absolutely cannot be stopped. But it does seem like the Ultima System at least. If this becomes the catalyst for completing the real thing...'

Even God wouldn't know the result now.

'Should I deal with it now?'

Taesung spoke.

"Argones, you promised. Humanity hasn't invaded God's domain yet."

And he looked back at Sirone.

"Please release me. If the other world's system is destroyed, the underworld will open and reality and hell will overlap."

Demons would descend to the present world.

This was also why Sirone wanted to establish Tormia as the World Map Nation in preparation.

"Singh, perhaps we can never know others' truth. But we can be together. Not through logic, but through the heart. If you still have feelings for me..."

Sirone extended his hand.

"Let's fight together."

Singh still gave no answer, but fierce battle was raging in her mind.

'Sirone. More, just a little more... please persuade me.'

Uorin was exhausted.

"Huff! Huff!"

From the headaches of Future Poetry, the attacks of assassins from various countries, the terror of crossing between life and death.

Kido looked back at her.

'She's at her limit.'

Both physically and mentally.

'She's enduring in the extreme realm, but if even a slight shock is added here, she'll collapse.'

Though she was Mitochondrial Eve who had lived through human history, the current Uorin was different.

If she could think that any experience was given to her new self, she could endure, but...

'She has no daughter. Right now, she is unique.'

It was to bear Sirone's child, and because these were years endured solely for that purpose.

'As much as she waited tens of thousands of years, her current life is precious. But she's crossed the line between life and death dozens of times.'

Should she rest?

Thinking this and turning around, Uorin suddenly showed a surprised expression and sat down abruptly.

"Huff!"

Kido rushed over urgently.

"What's wrong? What happened!"

Looking up at the ceiling with a dazed expression, she trembled and said.

"Eliquiah, Eliquiah is..."

"Huh?"

She turned her head and said.

"It didn't activate."

It was the light that always enveloped the entire temple at the same time, searching for Havitz's location.

"Another, another place used it. Sirone isn't protecting me. I'm no longer..."

Kido witnessed in real-time through Uorin's eyes the process of her mind collapsing.

"Uorin, calm down! Hey!"

Covering her face, Uorin screamed.

"Ah! Ahhh!"

I'm dying, dying, dying, dying.

Tens of thousands of years becoming meaningless.

"Get a grip! Hey!"

Kido grabbed her shoulders and shook her, but once broken, will wasn't easily restored.

Uorin grabbed Kido and shouted.

"What do I do? Havitz will come. Havitz will kill me and steal my ability! It's all over!"

Overwhelmed by unbearable despair, she screamed again.

"Ahhhhh!"

"Please get it together!"

When Kido slapped her cheek hard, Uorin's eyes momentarily returned to normal.

"Havitz isn't coming! You're remembering Havitz right now! You haven't activated Vanishing!"

"That's why Sirone didn't use Eliquiah either! Nothing's over yet. We...!"

At that moment, Kido's senses detected a presence.

"Who's there!"

When something emerged from around the corner at the end of the corridor, Kido opened his mouth in bewilderment.

A brain was floating toward them.

"A brain?"

Hearing those words, Uorin turned her head, then frowned, even forgetting her fear.

"You..."

Kido turned his head.

"What's wrong? Do you know what that is?"

"Adam."

An illusion unfolded around the brain, transforming into a man with metallic hair.

"Is he human? Something seems strange."

"He's a Gaian. And... also my husband."

"Huh?"

While Kido blinked, Adam, who had calmly walked down the corridor, opened his mouth.

"It's been a while, Uorin. No... her real name is..."

"Lilith."

It was her name before becoming Eve.

Neid looked around.

"This is Melkidoo's core?"

Cain said.

"Right. More precisely, it's the path to the Hall of Evil. Let me tell you one thing - this isn't Under Coder but a forest that exists in reality. So time flows exactly the same as reality."

Sirone realized why Cain had aged.

'Even if he stops time through Void, to bring users to the core, he has no choice but to come to reality. But it would only be a few hours every five years at most.'

If he had still become middle-aged, one could imagine how long human history had been.

Pushing through the forest, a massive altar made of gold stood towering before their eyes.

Cain pointed to the Hall of Evil.

"As you might guess, I didn't create this place. The original Melkidoo was a term referring to the Hall of Evil. But I entered this forest and..."

"Created a strange system."

At Iruki's words, Cain laughed pleasantly.

"Haha! Wasn't it quite fun? Anyway, come in. All evil is recorded here. And if you erase it, it gets deleted from reality too."

Shadows fell across Curtis's face.

Entering through the entrance, stairs leading underground appeared, and a brightly lit passage continued endlessly.

Eden asked with a serious expression.

"How far is it?"

"Well, as long as human history? Actually, I don't know where it ends since I've never been to the very end. If you explored a place like this, you'd die of old age. Besides..."

Cain entered the first hall among the entrances lining the corridor.

"My favorite place is here."

The group looked up at the massive portrait hanging on the wall, following Cain's gaze.

"Wow..."

Not only was it impressive in size, but it was an artwork that evoked an eerie feeling, regardless of who painted it.

"Not every person gets special treatment, but this person is special. Yahweh would know, right?"

Sirone said.

"Mitochondrial Eve."

Hearing this, the group examined the portrait closely.

"Uorin?"

Though beautiful, it looked completely different from her current appearance, and above all, her expression was closer to evil.

"This is her original form before reverse evolution. She's the one who planted the concepts of good and evil in humanity."

Neid was dumbfounded.

"What on earth did she do to bring forth good and evil?"

"She..."

Sirone looked back at the group with a bitter expression.

"Touched the forbidden fruit."
