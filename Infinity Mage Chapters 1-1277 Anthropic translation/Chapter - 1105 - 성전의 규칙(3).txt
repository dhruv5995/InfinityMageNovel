Laws of the Holy War (3)

Having fled from the pursuit of the holy knights, Shirone and his group caught their breath for a moment in a secluded area of the Vatican.

It was a place lined with prayer rooms, currently empty and giving off an eerie atmosphere.

Shirone spoke.

"They wouldn't be conducting business in a public place. Let's head underground."

"But they'll be guarding it, won't they? If they know we haven't left the Vatican, they'll be able to read our thoughts too."

"Then we'll have no choice. A frontal assault..."

A crying sound echoed from the corridor.

"Huuuu. Huuuu."

Leaning against the wall and peering around the corner, they saw a woman holding a spear walking toward them while weeping sorrowfully.

"Oh God Cria, why is the world so turbulent? Please give me courage. Give me the power to make everyone submit at your feet..."

Nade said.

"What's wrong with her? Has she gone mad?"

"In a sense, yes."

Shirone guessed.

"She must be a holy knight from the Heresy Management Department. If my thinking is correct... the Weeping One."

"The Weeping One?"

"That's the title of those belonging to the Heresy Management Department. The Weeping One, the Laughing One, the Praying One, the Angry One. And the captain of the Heresy Management Department's holy knights is the Forgiving One."

"How extreme. To confine human emotions to a single tendency."

Shirone nodded.

"I heard it was abolished nowadays, but according to Omega's records, the holy knights of the Rami Church receive special training from birth. Mental and physical discipline. Among them, the training the Heresy Management Department receives..."

It was so horrific that Shirone hesitated to continue.

"Huuuu. Oh God, please punish me, this sinner."

When the woman's voice was heard close by, Nade snapped to attention.

"Let's subdue her first. We can't keep running with such a strange person on our tail, can we?"

Iruki said.

"Don't use too much force. Like earlier..."

"I know. It was just hard to control since it's been a while."

Creating electricity between his fingers, Nade suddenly rounded the corner and charged at the woman like an ambush.

"I'll knock you out in one shot."

"Huk, huuk. Oh Go-"

As Nade approached with spark magic and delivered an electric shock to the back of her neck, the woman's body trembled.

'Got her.'

The moment he thought that, the woman's body twisted and the spear tip flew toward his throat at a terrifying speed.

"Kugh!"

The blade passed in front of Nade's eyes as he arched his upper body back in mid-air, and the woman let out a scream-like cry.

"Oh God!"

'Incredible speed. But...'

Nade in his Thunder God Transformation state was so fast that even Shirone would have difficulty catching him.

After the spear passed, Nade, creating static electricity as he circled around, this time held a handful of electricity in his palm.

"Here goes."

With a thud, the clothes on her side burned away, and she dropped her spear and convulsed with her limbs spread out.

'Now's my chance.'

Shirone kicked off the ground and shot forward, pressing the light of Agape into her forehead just as he had done with Seina.

"Ah, ahh..."

The woman's tears seemed to stop for a moment...

"Go- God..."

Blood flowed down from beneath her eyes.

With her lips barely moving, her vocal cords writhed as a harsh voice emerged.

"You damn bastard."

'The purification isn't working. It's incredible brainwashing.'

"Dieeeee!"

Just before the woman charged with her fingernails extended, Nade struck her back with electric shocks from both hands.

With a bang, the woman's body flew over Shirone's head and crashed into the corridor wall.

"Hah. Hah."

Nade exhaled roughly, and this time even Iruki couldn't scold him.

"She's a fanatic. That was dangerous."

Iruki approached the fallen woman and checked her pulse.

"She's not dead. But..."

Where her clothes had burned away, her back was visible.

Even though they could only see a part of her body, there were traces of torture.

"Was she whipped? How does a human body end up like this?"

"Self-harm."

Shirone approached.

"The Heresy Management Department's mission is to seek out and torture heretics. But that's clearly an evil methodology. So the Rami Church's Heresy Management Department... before torturing someone, they must inflict equivalent pain upon themselves."

In the chilled atmosphere, Shirone continued.

"Otherwise, they can't manifest divine power. But this is truly dangerous. The experience of enduring horrific self-harm can be..."

Iruki said.

"Inflicted on others. Without any guilt, quite naturally."

"Yes. Anyway, this is troublesome. If it's brainwashing so severe that Agape can't purify it..."

"Hehehe. Hehehehe."

Laughter echoed from the opposite corridor.

"Oh God, I am so happy."

Upon discovering numerous shadows, the group fled around the corner without anyone taking the lead.

"This gives me goosebumps. What should we do? If purification doesn't work, we'll have no choice but to beat them up."

"If we try to catch and fix them one by one, there'll be no end. Let's find evidence. Find a way to the underground..."

Shirone stopped abruptly.

"Damn."

About ten holy knights were walking from the corridor direction with their hands clasped together.

"Oh God, please bestow blessings upon the world. We pray that all people may be happy."

The Praying Ones.

Their prayers gathered together in a murmur, and laughter could be heard from the opposite side.

"Do we have no choice but to fight?"

A prayer room door opened, revealing a familiar face.

"This way."

It was Seina.

Thinking she was more normal than the people flooding in from the corridor, the group entered the prayer room.

When Seina activated a device in the fireplace, the wall opened to reveal a secret passage.

"Follow me. Quickly. If they catch us, I'm finished too."

As they followed her into the secret passage, two hands suddenly grabbed Shirone by the collar.

"Hey! You bastard!"

Though Nade and Iruki approached due to the sudden situation, Shirone raised his hand to stop them.

"What did you do to me? What happened that my divine power is weakening?"

Shirone calmly accepted Seina's fierce gaze.

"Nothing. Your brainwashing was just undone."

"Brainwashing?"

The hands gripping his collar loosened momentarily, but then lifted Shirone with even greater force.

"What nonsense are you talking? I'm not brainwashed. I'm a paladin of the Oracle Management Department."

"You don't need to ask me - you already know it yourself, don't you?"

After a moment, Shirone's feet touched the ground.

"Hah. This is driving me crazy, really."

Shirone asked.

"There's something I want to hear. The harsh training of holy knights - is it still continuing?"

"...Officially it was abolished, but..." Seina opened her mouth with difficulty.

"Since the World War, there are signs of it reviving. The number of holy knights has decreased much more than before the war."

"What about the Heresy Management Department?"

"I don't know about there. Even though we're fellow holy knights, the Heresy Management Department only allows access up to the Vatican's 3rd rank."

"3rd rank. 1st is the Pope, and 2nd is?"

"...Heresy Management Department Captain Vanissa."

The Forgiving One.

"If 2nd rank is the source of the problem, then only 3rd rank remains."

"That's right, High Priest Maximus. But he's currently recuperating due to poor health. It seems he was injured when a woman named Lucia awakened demonic abilities."

Iruki asked.

"What kind of education do holy knights receive?"

"Everything to fight against evil. After pushing mind and body to their limits, they recite passages. We are loyal to God, we reject the words of those who deny God, things like that."

Seina shuddered.

"It's a difficult process, but honestly, at the time I didn't think it was unreasonable. I thought it was a natural process to fight evil. But now... I don't know."

Was it truly her own will?

Seina glared at Shirone accusingly.

"Even if I received baptism from you, my faith in God Cria hasn't changed! So why has my divine power weakened?"

"You'll be able to recover it," Shirone said.

"When the doubts in your heart clear. You need a process of believing in God yourself. So if you have doubts, confirm them now. Whichever you choose, be confident in yourself."

After biting her lip and falling into thought, Seina asked.

"What should I do?"

"Guide us to the Vatican's basement. Something must be happening there. Good can never be achieved through coercive methods."

"...That's the Heresy Management Department's territory. Because it's underground, we rarely encounter each other even within the Vatican."

Having made her decision, she turned around.

"Follow me. I don't know how much help I can be, but I'll try as much as I can."

"Kingdom of Paras! Entry!"

While the nations attending the holy war were resting in the main building, the Kingdom of Paras arrived.

'How fast.'

Even with spatial movement magic circles, it was a distance that couldn't be reached without top-level mobility.

In the golden carriage at the front of the procession sat a man with a giant serpent wrapped around his neck, resting his chin on his hand.

'Kitra. The new king of Paras.'

Currently the Middle East's ruler was Kashan, but everything about Kashan began with Paras.

'The beginning of civilization.'

It was a procession filled with pride in being the place where intelligence began.

"They don't look easy to deal with."

Lufist muttered, but Shirone didn't respond.

"What's wrong?"

"No, nothing."

Shirone was currently confronting the one called "Person" in the Pyramid of Truth.

"Emotional disease."

Shirone murmured.

"The King of Paras might have had his emotional disease cured."

The Paras procession reached the front of the main building.

Kitra made eye contact with Shirone standing inside the window and spoke.

"Have you received the baptism of Person?"

'As expected.'

Shirone was certain.

'The reason King Kitra approved exploring the Pyramid of Truth. He's already...'

His eyes flashed sharply.

'He's already been inside and come out.'

As if reading Shirone's thoughts, Kitra smiled coldly.

"Human karma."

The cause.

"Truly tragic, isn't it."

A robed man approached the king's side and whispered quietly.

"Your Majesty, it's time to change fate."

At that moment, Shirone didn't miss the madness swirling in King Kitra's eyes.

'An astrologer. They're the most dangerous ones.'

The Kingdom of Paras's think tank - the Zodiac Twelve.

"Glen! Where are you? Glen!"

Inside the pyramid where time was distorted, Lucia searched frantically for Glen.

'Please be safe.'

Her ability could subdue opponents, but Glen's specialty was only healing.

"Where did you go?"

The moment she took another step forward, like with the others, the scenery changed.

'Where is this?'

The priest training institute under the Vatican. It was where Lucia first met Glen.

"Over here, you fool!"

Seventeen-year-old Glen and Lucia were running around the empty chapel like a playground.

'Glen.'

A smile formed on Lucia's lips.

An age ignorant of worldly matters, when simply playing with a friend was enjoyable.

"Hey, being so slow..."

"You rascals!"

The supervising nun burst through the door and shouted.

"What are you doing in the sacred chapel! I told you to behave yourselves since today is an important day!"

"Hii eek!"

As Glen and Lucia froze, a middle-aged man walked up beside the nun.

"Hehe, don't scold them too harshly. All children are like that at that age. I was the same way."

The current 3rd rank of the Vatican, High Priest Maximus.
