God's Brain (4)

"We can't hold out like this!"

At the three-cornered Mara's report, the angel turned to look at Arabot's spire forty kilometers away.

In this place where neither heaven's barriers nor the seven skies existed yet, only Ankara's sanctuary revealed its majesty.

'This is the final line of defense.'

The angel felt chills upon confirming once again the countless processions approaching from the horizon's end.

Approximately one billion people were joining the ranks from all directions, approaching.

"If you're going to do it, do it. If not, don't." The Gaian representative Maishin at the front spoke with a pitying expression.

While the angel burned with anger, the Maras watched nervously and clenched their fists, asking:

"What should we do?"

The biggest problem was that the source concepts of angels were defined at will by the Gaians.

"Elysion."

The mind of the Gaians - one and all.

"Shall we end this?" As Maishin raised his hand, fire lit in the eyes of one billion Gaians as they linked to the Idea.

A massive hole opened in the sky, and clouds flowed backward like a waterfall, being sucked out.

"Th-that is..."

The moment the angel saw the giant hand of light emerging from the black tunnel, his sacred light body trembled.

"It's not like we were just playing around."

Having once faced extinction due to Code Argoneth, they had aggressively honed their Ultima.

"Hand of God." As the fingers of light swayed gracefully, the rivers flowing on earth began to evaporate.

"Block it! Block it!"

At the size of the hand that could crush Arabot in one grip, the angels launched a full assault.

Though it wasn't a dazzling firepower battle, powerful concepts that supported the universe's beginning struck the Hand of God.

"How absurd."

Why is it called the Hand of God?

"It is omnipotent."

It was the hand that created the universe and all things.

The Hand of God, having destroyed the source concepts as it entered, grasped the angel between its index finger and thumb.

"Kyaaaaaaah!"

After briefly letting out death throes from the pressure crushing his existence, the angel glared and shouted:

"How dare you impersonate God's name... Gack!"

Between the thumb and index finger, the angel's body burst with a pop like dust.

"Feel free to come at us as much as you want."

The Hand of God flipped over to show its back as it sequentially bent its fingers as if caressing the air.

As the terrified angels watched, the five fingers opened wide like a blooming lotus.

The surface of the Hand of God shimmered with all five colors as if containing all phenomena of nature.

Shortly after, a sphere of light rose from the center of the palm.

"Graaah!"

As heaven and earth vibrated simultaneously, the angels felt motion sickness for the first time.

"Photon Cannon."

It was a strike that God delivers to the world, created by the Idea of all Gaians.

"It's over."

As the Hand of God moved and the Photon Cannon stretched into a flash of light, the angels shouted:

"Stay calm! We can block it!"

The phenomenon itself is nothing special.

'I can do it! It's just some mass flying incredibly fast!'

With a roar, the flash flew in.

"Ah..."

Everything turned pale.

Even without experiencing it, they could instinctively feel it had the power to blow away half a planet's hemisphere.

KRRRRRRRR!

In an instant, lightning struck toward Arabot.

Judgment Halo.

'Ragnarok!'

Uriel, who had concentrated the concept of destruction, charged toward the Photon Cannon at tremendous speed.

Though it was an event occurring at near-light speed, the angels with temporal perception saw it clearly.

Uriel's body entering the center of the Photon Cannon began to peel away.

'Even Lord Uriel...'

Just as feelings of resignation settled in, the Photon Cannon exploded, spreading mass waves.

"Graaaah!"

The angels who had flown to Arabot's spire grimaced as they surveyed the front.

'It's intact.'

Though terrain features had spread outward from the explosion's center, the scale was much smaller than expected.

Maishin smiled bitterly as he looked to the side.

"...What a pointless act."

Breathing roughly, Taesung was clasping both hands together while shedding tears of blood.

"Do you really intend to see this through to the end?"

Gaia has the ability to convert shock signals inflicted on the planet into avatars.

Also, the fact that she shed tears of blood meant the Photon Cannon's power was equivalent to a meteor impact.

"Stay put. We'll handle this ourselves."

The planet doesn't matter.

But it felt unpleasant to see Gaia, who had long sided with humans, suffering.

'To have detonated a light-speed mass created by the Hand of God means...'

As Maishin examined Uriel with serious eyes, Leo approached from the side.

"It's not something one archangel could do."

Taking a deep drag of his cigarette, he squinted as he watched toward Arabot.

"Zoom in."

As the Hand of God curved its index and middle fingers, a light magnifying glass formed within them.

The distance of dozens of kilometers became as close as if right before their eyes, revealing Ycael's form.

"Archangel Ycael."

And behind her, the faces of six archangels flying up were clearly visible.

Hope dawned in the angels' eyes.

"All the archangels have gathered."

If the Gaians define the world, then the eight archangels are the entirety of the objective world.

Ankara had essentially proposed a direct confrontation between the Akashic Records and the Ultima System.

"As expected, it won't go smoothly."

As Penny approached, supporting her neck with both hands, Leo extinguished his cigarette and snorted.

"Hmph, it was a mountain we'd have to climb anyway. We have the Hand of God. Mere archangels..."

The power of centerless Elysion concentrated into a specific form was far superior to the sum of one billion Gaian individuals.

As Uriel returned, the eight archangels flew swiftly to look down at the Gaians.

Ycael amplified her voice:

"You who would falsely claim to be God, why do you repeat this meaningless battle?"

Maishin replied:

"Weren't you the ones who picked this fight? We simply want to leave this world."

"This world is your sanctuary. Just gain joy here and enjoy eternal life."

"That's your opinion."

Maishin raised the corner of his mouth.

"There are no more unknowns in this world. Why? Because what we've defined is everything. We won't live trapped in a cave, staring only at shadows of the outside world."

"Do you truly wish to leave?"

"That's what I'm saying."

Ycael opened her mouth as if resolved:

"Leave it to Ankara. We will devise measures for you to safely leave the world."

"Our answer is..."

The Hand of God, connected to the outside world, flipped its fist and raised its middle finger.

"This."

It was God's middle finger.

Ycael's brow furrowed, and the seven archangels behind her simultaneously launched themselves.

"Fine! Come at us!"

Leo immediately took position and threw a straight punch.

'Divine Transcendence!'

As one billion Ideas activated, the Hand of God clenched its fist and flew forward.

"UAAAAAAAH!"

Seeing the fist of light crushing the world as it charged, Metatron activated his Judgment Halo.

'Exist.'

As concentric information swirled and concentrated in the halo, a spherical black hole opened.

KWAAAAAANG!

It was gravity that even absorbed light, but Gaia's will was far more powerful.

"Haha! With just that kind of power..." 

Ycael's voice rang out clearly.

"Ataraxia."

Her halo expanded to an unprecedented size, and Metatron, feeling tremendous amplification, increased his presence.

"Damn, it's bending! Grab it!"

The Hand of God quickly orbited around the gravity field before being sucked into the black sphere.

"Ragnarok."

Thunder crashed, and Uriel transformed into light, charging toward the Gaians.

"I refuse!"

As one billion Gaians covered their faces with both arms, a barrier of law that blocks everything was erected.

"How dare you?"

Ycael said:

"Refuse God?"

As the concept of destruction was amplified by Ataraxia, Uriel's mind was ready to explode.

"HYAAAAAAAH!"

The moment she unleashed her massive destructive instinct and collided with the Gaians' barrier:

CLANG!

The law barrier became visibly manifest as one billion Gaians simultaneously stepped back three paces.

"Grrk!"

They were all grimacing, but more problematic were the cracks that had formed in the barrier.

"Heavenly Galaxy Wheel."

The Paradise Staff, spinning as it sucked in air, struck the already cracked law barrier.

An explosion beyond biological hearing erupted, and blood flowed from Maishin's nose.

"Damn!"

Though Uriel had caused the destruction, the Gaians' attention was focused on Ycael.

'As expected, the Archangel is the problem.'

Even with Idea, the concept of amplification cannot be replicated.

'Because it's the only concept that straddles the boundary between the outside world and the inner world.'

A stepping stone for the state of nothingness to become the state of existence.

'How unfortunate.'

If they could implement the concept of Ataraxia, the war with Ankara would already be over.

"Are you done with your tricks?"

Having destroyed the law wall, Uriel swung the Paradise Staff again, building up energy.

"Here it comes!"

Though the Hand of God's Idea was recovering, Ragnarok's activation was faster.

Uriel, charging with thunderous sounds, sensed victory.

'I've won.'

Just passing through the crowd would kill at least tens of millions of Gaians.

'Huh?'

Wind blew.

'Wind?'

It wasn't a speed comparable to mere atmospheric movement, so Uriel, feeling puzzled, turned her head.

"...?"

And in the next moment, the atmosphere tore as a man's face came into view.

"BASHING!"

The fist swung with a ridiculous battle cry turned Uriel's face to the side.

KWAAAAAANG!

The angels' gazes followed Uriel's trajectory as she slid ten kilometers.

"Oh my, oh my."

Girfin, who had appeared while dusting off his fist, said:

"I can't be absent from such an interesting match."

"How are you..."

Not only the angels but even the Gaians couldn't hide their bewilderment at Girfin's appearance.

Maishin asked:

"What about the battlefield? You were supposed to withdraw from the Ultima System. Did you change your mind?"

"I did change my mind, but..."

Girfin looked up at the angels and said:

"I have no intention of joining the system."

"Then why..."

At that moment, Uriel flew in from the distance.

"UAAAAAAAH!"

The anger of being struck by a human was fully displayed in her Judgment Halo.

"Surprising. To think you'd get excited."

The Paradise Staff flew in a large arc.

"I'll destroy you!"

As Girfin extended his hand, light particles quickly gathered to form a hexahedral membrane.

"Graaaah!"

As the Paradise Staff's impact was absorbed without even making a sound, Uriel tilted her head.

'What kind of trick is this?'

Besides the Ultima System, did someone exist who could block Ragnarok's power?

"Girfin, that's...?"

To Maishin's question, Girfin smiled.

"Hexa."

The hexahedral membrane scattered like smoke, then pushed Uriel away with gentle force.

Amid the brilliant light enveloping his body, Girfin looked up at Ycael and said:

"Even after this, do you still need to stop us?"

Since Girfin had bad memories, Ycael's voice naturally became harsh.

"Of course. Punishing arrogant ones who deny God and consider themselves gods is natural. And anyway, it has nothing to do with you—"

"Want to come with us?"

Ycael, who had stopped speaking, asked after a long while:

"What?"

Girfin extended his hand and said:

"I can take everyone."

As the angels wore blank expressions, lost in thought, the Gaians looked at each other.
