The Ugly One (3)

Jincheon's elite army of 200,000 gazed upon the Gustav Empire across the massive boundary.

'To think this is actually possible.'

The two empires connected through Gwangcheon Castle's spatial distortion could be called the pinnacle of magic.

'Princess...'

A rumor spread through the Jincheon army.

Everyone knew that Sungeum had sacrificed herself to create this opportunity.

'Death holds no fear.'

The reason demons could fight without sparing their bodies was because they would be reborn again in hellfire.

But now that had been severed by Sungeum.

And her sacrifice beyond death had raised the Jincheon army's morale to demonic levels.

Ryan belonged to no unit and stayed by Shirone's side.

'This will be a battle that marks history.'

Because from now on, every demon killed would be fixed as objective military strength.

'But Shirone...'

Ryan observed Shirone, who was glaring at Gustav with murderous eyes.

'Will you really be okay?'

The person Ryan was looking at now wasn't Yahweh who would save the world, but one mage burning with vengeance.

Though his anger was cold like a mage's, it couldn't be said to be 100% rational.

"Let's go."

Before Grand General Oryongjang of Jincheon could give orders, Shirone crossed the boundary alone.

A single step that leaped over an entire massive sea.

Ryan followed behind Shirone, who stretched forward refreshingly while casting teleportation.

"Huff! Huff!"

The sight of him charging with Maha's law was at a speed comparable to flying through the sky.

Watching the two people disappear instantly, Oryongjang gave orders to his troops.

"All forces, advance!"

With tremendous battle cries, the 200,000-strong army invaded the Gustav Empire.

"Shirone! You're too fast!"

Ryan, who had caught up at a speed rivaling consecutive teleportations, shouted while looking back at Shirone.

"Damn it!"

He hadn't expected an answer, but the moment Ryan saw Shirone's expression, he was certain.

'That's not Shirone.'

To be precise, it seemed like two Shirones with different natures were overlapping.

Yahweh, who practiced love for all things.

What one human had to accept to contain that impossible realm was limitless anger.

'Split personality.'

It might not be a pathological symptom, but one mind couldn't lose Yahweh without splitting into two.

'I can see them.'

From 100 kilometers before Gustav's imperial castle Marsak, the demon army was spread out.

A demon scout who spotted Shirone and Ryan fell in an arc toward the troops.

And shortly after, the demon army began to scatter like massive ice boiling in one second.

"I..."

Another voice from within himself echoed in Shirone's head as he took in the enemies.

'Wanted to become a mage.'

I think I worked hard.

'It was something I loved, and I was happy.'

Of course, I also thought about succeeding as a mage to earn money and not make my family suffer anymore.

'I'm human too.'

But I knew what was really important.

'Purity.'

Magic itself.

Other than wanting to do my best at what I loved, I had no other desires.

'But when I came out into the world... just breathing and living turned out to be harder than being good at magic.'

Things to take responsibility for, things to bear.

Countless cards to choose from, but none that could be discarded.

'The only thing I could throw away was...'

Myself.

'No matter how hard it got.'

Really, among all the cards I held, I could only discard myself.

'I just had to endure.'

Responsibilities piled endlessly on my shoulders, and things to bear multiplied like mountains...

'When I came to my senses at some point,' I was carrying all of humanity on my back.

"Shirone! Get ready!"

When the demons reached 100 meters ahead, Ryan shouted, but Shirone didn't respond.

"Shirone!"

He just kept moving forward, casting teleportation.

'I wish no one had to suffer.' Of course, the world crawls with unpleasant people too, but I wish they could be happy as well.

I'm sincere.

'I don't know where this bomb-passing started.'

Why couldn't I beat Nine?

Honestly, I think deep in my heart, I was desperately hoping for it.

'If it's going to be like this, just end it all.' Let's blow it up.

'There's nothing to feel wronged about. When the world closes, that's it. If everyone disappears, there's no more suffering. Yeah, let's end it here.' End it.

"Shirone!"

The moment Ryan shouted, Shirone's face twisted terrifyingly.

"Uaaaah!"

The sphere of light floating in his right hand vibrated menacingly and emitted brilliant white light.

"Die! Human!"

Shirone couldn't see the face of the demon flying at him with a spear.

Just emotion, some feeling.

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

Something he wanted to destroy immediately, a terrible and hateful feeling.

'Purity?'

His initial pure intentions of universal love had disappeared somewhere.

'It's like being in the middle of the universe.'

The planet I left looks as small as a star, making me doubt if it was really my starting point.

'Having lost even direction.'

All that remains for me is the faint inertia of the first step I took from where I started.

'I can't do anything.'

I can only hope that inertia will safely carry me to my destination.

The moment a flash of light struck the demon, an explosion that blew away dozens of meters occurred.

"This is..."

Ryan, hit by the shockwave, stopped walking and hurriedly raised his arms to cover his face.

"An explosion?"

Photon Cannon wasn't a bomb.

'It's like falling into the middle of the ocean.'

If I can't push the water away, I'll drown, but there's no one to help me.

'You know what's really scary?' Being alone.

The fact that there's absolutely no one is so clear that I can't even make a sound asking to be saved.

'When you know there's no one... even your expression doesn't change.'

Terrified faces and screams have no meaning.

You just struggle quietly in silence.

Pupils dilated, face frozen solid, yet consciousness strangely clear.

'All that flailing around trying to do something...'

Was Yahweh.

As if space was melting, spheres of fire bloomed from all directions.

"Kraaaah!"

Hundreds of Photon Cannons per second.

The only difference from before was that the Photon Cannon flashes exploded before even reaching their targets.

'Light?'

There's no way for human eyes to distinguish the four types of light speed categorized in the magical world.

But Ryan's intuition told him that Shirone's Photon Cannon had gotten closer to light than before.

"Uaaaah!"

Every time a battle cry burst from the frail mage's body, demons were burning up.

Another Photon Cannon rose in Shirone's hand.

'Die!'

The speed of the flash with mass extended beyond sub-light speed to near-light speed.

'Die!'

Compared to the Photon Cannon's speed, atmospheric particles were practically stationary.

KWAAAAANG!

Not a single demon remained standing in the area melted down by the intense heat.

Ryan gritted his teeth, instinctively understanding how dangerous near-light speed Photon Cannon was.

'This isn't magic cast with a specific target in mind.'

If it was literally a method of striking entire spaces, even civilians in the imperial castle wouldn't be exceptions.

'Damn!'

Ryan left Shirone, who was massacring demons, and flew toward Gustav's imperial castle.

'Shirone, won't you really regret this?' If you're not going to live mad forever, shouldn't we avoid the worst civilian casualty situation?

'I won't regret it.'

Even while ruthlessly trampling the endlessly surging demon army, his heart didn't waver.

'I'll end this war.'

Everything has become a complete mess, and now I can't even guess my position with my five senses.

'But I can feel it.'

The emotion from when I took that first step still sparkles deep in my heart.

'I'll return.'

When this terrible war ends, I'll be able to return to that pure place from my innocent days.

"Ataraxia."

The Physical Realm.

Shirone's mental power, passing through the colorful magic circle, expanded as if about to explode.

Thinking of the number of demons annihilated per unit area, Shirone felt thrilling exhilaration.

'The demons are decreasing.'

Kill them and they die.

The fact that they're no longer being replenished was the core hope Sungeum had brought to this world.

"Huuuu..."

Shirone's face turned tearful as he thought of Sungeum.

"What is this?"

Will doing this bring Sungeum back?

"What is this supposed to beeeee!"

The moment the explosion that spread with his angry shout broke through 200 meters in diameter.

PEOOOOOONG!

An explosion spanning several kilometers in radius occurred.

Imperial Castle Marsak.

"Commander! Jincheon Empire's 200,000 troops are rushing toward the capital!"

"What?"

Gustav's 1st Commander and Ryan's older brother, Ozent Gai, furrowed his brow.

"What nonsense? How could they when hell's army is occupying Jincheon's sea..."

Gai stopped speaking and fell into thought.

'There's no point in questioning the cause of something that's already happened.'

Immediately changing his expression, he snatched the report the messenger brought and began reading.

"Space manipulation?"

But how exactly?

Though he wasn't deeply versed in magic, he'd never heard of a mage who could manipulate space enough to fold a sea.

'Jin Sungeum.'

If it were possible at all, it could only be her.

"How long until they reach the capital?"

"If we mobilize hell's entire army, we can hold them for at least 3 days."

Hell's army in Gustav's capital amounted to half their total forces.

Most importantly, having numerous legion commanders who could open the demon world was also a great strength.

"Good. I'll send a telegram to His Majesty. Deploy full-scale war until total military orders come down."

"Urgent news! Urgent news!"

A second messenger rushed in.

"Ahead of Jincheon's army, someone presumed to be a mage is approaching while annihilating demon units."

"A mage? How many?"

"Well... according to reports, one person."

Gai's eyes lit up.

'So that guy's here.'

Yahweh.

While he might not know about Jincheon Empire's army, since Yahweh had come, he'd need to coordinate with the legion commanders on countermeasures.

"Alright, now..."

Just as Gai was about to turn, a third messenger entered.

"Reporting! One swordsman is approaching the imperial castle, leaping over the demon army."

"A swordsman this time?"

"He hasn't inflicted major damage yet, but his approach speed is fastest. At this rate, he'll arrive within an hour."

Just the fact that he was leaping over hell's army showed he wasn't an ordinary expert.

"Oh? Who is it?"

"Well..."

The messenger looked at the report contents and hesitated momentarily.

"A Knight of Maha."

Gai's eyebrow twitched.

"Someone called Ozent Ryan." Even after the report ended, Gai's expression remained unchanged.

"Hmm."

After briefly contemplating while walking around the inner palace, he stopped and raised his head.

"You've come, my little brother."

A gentle emotion suddenly settled in Gai's eyes, which had been flickering with madness.
