The Approaching Calamity (2)

Parkma let out a wicked smile as he watched Berik charging toward him.

"Hehe, is that so?"

How terrible a tragedy it is to 'know' that we have life.

"Interesting."

And that tragedy was the greatest pleasure demons could derive from humans.

"You'll regret this."

The moment the large axe cut through the air, Berik's body accelerated swiftly like the wind.

'Haste!'

Moving quickly behind Parkma's back, he thrust out both hands crackling with blue electricity.

'Electric Shock!'

Parkma's face contorted from the sharp pain.

'This bastard...'

Though the power wasn't tremendous, the unexpected pain made him even angrier.

"Graaaah!"

Confirming that Parkma's eyes had rolled back, Berik cast a small blizzard and shouted.

"Go quickly!"

Even as their figures disappeared into the cold mist, Amy couldn't leave her spot.

'Berik...'

The army doesn't tolerate individuality.

What commanders want isn't one powerful mage, but the maximum firepower a group can produce.

'Yes, that's right.'

Magic becomes standardized and soldiers' specialties are ignored, but before joining the Valkyrie, Berik's nickname was...

'Jack-of-all-trades.'

That's what she had heard.

"Amy!"

Berik's shout erupted from the heart of the cold mist.

"Go!"

Simultaneously, a bolt of lightning crashed down from the pitch-black clouds floating in the air.

BOOOOOOM!

The thunderous sound scolded Amy, snapping her to her senses as she turned and cast teleportation.

'I can't let Berik's sacrifice become a meaningless death.'

Self-rationalization.

'I must survive.'

Countless rewards that could be obtained by maintaining life filled her mind.

Even just being able to breathe.

'Shirone.'

Tears flowed.

'I miss you.'

She had once thought that life was beautiful, that if you gave your best effort, you could paint your entire life like a flower garden.

"What is this..."

She had thought such things.

"What the hell is this!"

Now life had become so burdensome and heavy for her that she wished it had never existed in the first place.

"I'm sick of it!"

She was disgusted with her attachment to life.

Amy stopped teleporting and turned back toward where Berik was.

The life she could have shared with Shirone would eventually be swallowed by death anyway.

'Sorry, Shirone. I want to take responsibility.'

When Amy arrived at the battlefield, she saw Berik still alive.

"Oh, you're back already?"

Parkma held up Berik's face, who was half-dead, and twisted his lips into a grin.

"You, you bastard..."

Sparks flew from Amy's eyes.

"I was waiting while playing with this guy. I was planning to torture him until you came back."

Parkma grabbed Berik's shoulder.

"Aaaaah!"

The sound of bones crushing could be heard.

"Bwahahaha! Now, do you understand reality? No matter how cool you try to act, you're still just human."

Parkma put more force into his grip.

"Say you regret it. Then I'll let you go. Instead, beg me to kill that woman."

When Berik kept his mouth shut, Parkma grabbed his ankle and twisted his leg until it tore off.

"Aaaaah!"

"Speak quickly. I'm saying I'll spare you, aren't I? She came back anyway, right? If you just sell out that woman, you won't have to be in pain."

Amy's mind went blank.

"You..."

As rage obliterated her reason and her body instinctively tried to rush toward Parkmaâ€”

"Tch, how embarrassing."

Berik spoke in a hoarse voice.

"Amy."

"Oh, good, good. Speak. Beg me to spare you."

As Parkma extended his arm with a bulging smile, Berik smiled faintly and said:

"How about it? It's nothing special, right?"

Dying.

His face gradually grew pale, then was engulfed in a flash of light as he caused a powerful explosion.

BOOOOOOM!

'Self-destruction magic.'

Berik could have found peace easily.

'But for my sake...'

Probably his last trick, calculated even for the possibility that Amy might return.

'Thank you.'

He was a magnificent mage.

"What a surprise. Humans really are unlucky."

Hot smoke was rising from Parkma's body, blown back by the explosion.

"Unlucky?"

Amy was no longer angry.

"Don't make me laugh. For a mage, even death is within calculations. And with this..."

Flames of incarnation erupted from Amy's body.

"Your chances of survival have also become zero."

Even seeing the fire giant over 10 meters tall, Parkma burst into mocking laughter.

"Oh my, how scary. But what can you do? I already know your abilities. Something like that won't..."

The fire incarnation, Ifrit, grew more than twice its size.

'Penetration.'

Her concentration technique amplifies mental power by focusing again while already in a focused state.

'Penetration!'

And now, Amy was endlessly backing up her memories and pushing her mind into the void.

'Penetration!'

The moment her mind was penetrated for the tenth time, even the last trace of reason remaining in her disappeared.

'You're right, Berik.'

At life's end, she smiled.

'It was nothing special.'

The moment concentration touched death, the Ifrit that had soared to pierce the sky scattered into fragments of fire.

"What, what?"

Parkma, who had been secretly wary, looked around at the returning darkness and sneered.

"Hehe, that's right. This is humanity's limit."

He realized it when he took a step toward Amy.

"Huh?"

Fire erupted like spontaneous combustion from the hand gripping the large axe's handle.

"Grrrr!"

The fire instantly spread across Parkma's entire body, and then even the axe began melting from the heat.

"You, you..."

The temperature rose with Amy at the center, and her clothes and hair began burning away.

Fire realm.

Realizing that the entire landscape was burning, Parkma kicked the ground.

"I'll kill you!"

Though his voice was desperate, before he could even deliver a single blow, his body melted along with the axe.

"Graaaah!"

The temperature difference created convection, and as the oxygen concentration thickened, the fire grew even larger.

ROOOOOOAR!

Finally, a massive fire tornado 100 meters in diameter erupted through the clouds.

"Commander! Over there!"

The fire pillar, clearly visible even from 10 kilometers away, temporarily halted the plateau battle.

Garcia bit his lip.

'It's Amy.'

He couldn't be certain, but as the teacher who had trained her, he knew the potential of the Crimson Eyes better than anyone.

"Send troops immediately!"

Flying demons were already heading toward where the fire pillar had erupted.

'I need to recover at least the body.'

He considered the probability of survival nearly zero.

Though the demons were faster than humans, there was no way to approach while the fire pillar was still raging.

"You go in first!"

"Are you crazy? If we get even 100 meters closer, our wings will burn! Let's wait first!"

Even for residents of the demon world accustomed to heat, the current firepower was close to divine punishment.

"It's weakening!"

As the flames diminished as quickly as their violent birth, the demons approached closer.

The rapidly cooled earth had hardened in the form of rippling waves, and Amy lay collapsed there.

"There! Finish her quickly!"

Burn marks were visible on her naked body, and her hair had burned short.

"Isn't she already dead?"

"I don't know! The commander said to go check and kill her no matter what. Let's stab her with a spear first."

As the demons surrounding Amy raised their spears vertically, a voice was heard.

"Stop."

Shock filled the eyes of the demons who turned their heads.

"B-Buddha..."

On the undulating lava terrain, Nane was looking down at Amy alongside Shura.

"Is that the woman?"

The demons' shoulders trembled.

"Why is Buddha here?"

Nane, who had been surveying the battlefield to break through the final barrier of enlightenment, had rushed here upon seeing the fire pillar.

"Buddha is everywhere."

Nane extended his hand toward the demons.

"You would stab a woman with spears? Too harsh a treatment for one who burned her will to live. If you show mercy, I will not destroy you."

The demons looked at each other.

'What should we do?'

Buddha was frightening, but if they failed to complete their mission, what awaited them was the commander's blade.

The demons who had made their decision frowned.

"Nothing to fear. Buddha has disappeared. That's just an empty shell, not Buddha."

Nane smiled.

"Of course."

"Kill her!"

As half the demons flapped their wings and charged, Nane raised his index finger and spoke.

"Sermon, Destruction."

Dozens of red swords spread like a fan behind him and pierced through the demons.

"Gah!"

Not a single one missed.

A demon who had avoided instant death thanks to being behind Amy asked while bleeding:

"H-how..."

Nane walked down from the hill and said:

"Sometimes I become Buddha."

Such is enlightenment.

The demon closed his eyes with a resentful expression, and Shura ran to Amy to check her condition.

"She's breathing faintly. But more serious than the burns is her mind. She doesn't have much time left."

Nane agreed.

"Fire is the will of self-destruction. Opening the fire realm means she was that desperate."

Voices of Valkyrie soldiers could be heard in the distance.

"Faster! Run faster!"

Shura looked back at Nane.

"What will you do? Should we leave her to the humans?"

"Can they save her?"

"No. The burns maybe, but her mind is beyond repair. It would be better to at least let them recover the body..."

"I can do it."

One who had reached Buddha's enlightenment could restore even Amy's broken mind.

Shura spoke with a reluctant expression:

"But this woman is..."

"Yes."

She was the person most cherished in the heart of Shirone, that symbol of universal love, Yahweh.

"Our enemy, in a sense? Even if she awakens, I don't think she'll be favorable toward us."

"Before death, all humans are equal."

As Nane extended both hands, Amy's body floated up and flew to him.

"What did she think of at the end, having burned everything of herself - emptiness or love? I want to hear."

Shura was curious too.

"Captain! She's over there!"

The magic unit could be seen rapidly approaching, casting teleportation repeatedly.

"Let's go."

As Nane turned, Shura waved his hand and cast Gestalt magic.

Their figures disappeared, and less than 10 seconds later, the unit arrived at the location.

"There's nothing here? I was sure there was someone..."

The initial reporter felt like he was possessed by a ghost.

"Didn't you see wrong? Come to think of it, the ground distortion is incredible. How big must the fire have been to cause this?"

"But demons are lying dead here. Then who killed them?"

"Think later. First, we search. Everyone spread out and comb through the area!"

"Yes!"

As the mages conducted their search for about 10 minutes, the roar of spatial movement was heard from the horizon.

"Damn! Is it from over there?"

"Captain! Demons are coming!"

In the end, the Valkyrie members returned to their unit without recovering Amy's body.
