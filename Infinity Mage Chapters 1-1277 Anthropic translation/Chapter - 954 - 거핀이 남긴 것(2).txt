What Garfin Left Behind (2)

Leading heaven's army in pursuit of Shura, Ichael was reminiscing about events from long ago.

'Perhaps back then...'

Garfin was erased.

That was probably the reason Angkera decided to become human, even if it meant destroying his own dignity.

'I can't remember, but that incident was surely... a shock to every being in the universe.'

The moment Garfin was erased from the Akashic Records, Ichael felt as if her heart had been pierced through the center.

"Huk!"

A tremendous sense of loss washed over her—so vast she might not understand it even if eternity passed.

"Ah..."

And shortly after, tears of light rolled down her cheeks.

Her memories hadn't returned.

But now she realized what it was she couldn't recall.

"Garfin."

It wasn't that her thoughts couldn't reach him—her heart had been completely filled with Garfin all along.

"You've left."

It felt as if her heart had been torn out entirely, and the remaining emptiness was too vast even for the universe to fill.

"He had come to me."

Ichael curled up and wept.

"We were connected!"

Though there were no memories she could trace back to, her painfully aching heart was telling her.

"That person..."

This alone must be the truth.

"I loved him."

Even after her tears of light soaked the entire floor, her crying showed no signs of stopping.

How much time had passed?

'I want to know.'

Countless scenes shot up from her heart, tangled together in chaos with nothing connecting.

"Right now!"

Having decided to storm into Angkera, she sprang up and approached the door.

"...!"

But her hand ultimately couldn't open the door.

"No."

She didn't know why, but she felt that going to Angkera now would lead to another tragedy.

Even though it seemed there was nothing left to fall into, that feeling kept arising.

'I must wait.'

She sank to her knees powerlessly.

'Why is that? I have this feeling that this isn't the end.'

Since she wouldn't fail twice, Ichael steeled her resolve and raised her head.

"Garfin, don't worry. I will carry on."

Garfin's erasure created a gap in Ichael's heart that nothing could fill.

And 19 years later, Ichael would amplify the shape of that void to finally regain her complete memories.

Meanwhile, Ichael wasn't the only being shocked by Garfin's erasure.

Though to varying degrees, all who knew Garfin felt heart-bursting shockwaves.

The shock was stronger for purer spiritual beings, and even the archangels felt a sense of wrongness.

'What is this? Something has fractured in this world.'

Of course, the being who felt that fracture most clearly was Angkera, the incarnation of the Akashic Records.

"Kiiiii!"

In Arabot's sanctuary, Angkera's tentacles moved at unprecedented speed.

'A specific code has departed the photon system.'

This was clearly an error.

Even without knowing the code's true nature, no other being could accomplish what Angkera couldn't.

'Searching.'

Finding the erasure code was like searching for a needle in the universe's haystack.

"Kiiiiii!"

Angkera went into overdrive.

'Even if the system is destroyed, this matter must be found.'

The universe shook, and the world reached the brink of explosion from system overload.

'Found it.'

It was a human.

'McClain Garfin.'

How should this error be restored?

Even searching the entire Akashic Records revealed no method to solve the problem.

'Restore! Restore! Restore!'

Nevertheless, Angkera endlessly delved into only the problem of Garfin's erasure.

'Error found! Restore! Error found! Restore! Error found!'

Now it was impossible to tell whether Garfin was the error or Angkera was.

The Akashic Records heated endlessly, and just as the universe was about to shatter completely.

"Kuuuuuuu!"

Red light burst from Angkera's eyes, completely against his own will.

'Reset? Why?'

The universe was heading toward shutdown.

"Kiek! Kiek! Kiek!"

He mobilized every means to prevent the reset, but every command was denied.

'This is like...'

Angkera felt a physical force harder than the universe itself.

'Idea.'

Just as even the highest-performing machine cannot resist a single gesture that flips its switch.

'A force acting from outside the world.'

That light, simple force was destroying all of Angkera's commands as it entered.

'How can this be possible?'

Angkera lost the meaning of his existence.

"No! I am the universe! I am everything! No one but me can reset this place!"

Shame.

Not an emotion understood through information, but actually becoming that way himself.

It was emotion, and the first heart he had ever felt.

"Kiiiii!"

Dropping oil-black tears from beneath his eyes, Angkera let out a roar of fury.

"Garfiiiiin!"

The world went dark.

Feeling flashes of light converging from the infinite ends, he thought:

'Why can't I...'

become God?

'The demons' movement patterns haven't changed.'

Based on information steadily arriving at the command center, Iruki ran simulations.

He cheered when Lian defeated Natasha, and tears came when Amy returned.

"But."

Looking at the overall situation, it was only a matter of time before the flower garden collapsed.

'According to my analysis, the demons should have already turned toward Baschuka by now. Someone must be being stubborn...'

Was such a thing possible?

'That can't be. Meirei's divine frequency is a perfect ability. The only possibility would be...'

The incident where Son Yu-jeong destroyed the Abyss Cliff.

'Originally, the elemental bomb should have fallen there. Did they deduce the Holy War's intentions from that incident?'

Iruki shook his head.

'But is that possible? Hell's army doesn't even know the concept of elemental bombs.'

No existing weapon had the power to instantly annihilate Hell's army.

'Would they break through the flower garden at such cost based on just a vague expectation that something big would happen in Baschuka?'

If true, this Balkan character was one of two things:

'Either someone suffering from extreme paranoid delusions, or literally a monster of imagination.'

Probably both.

If true, the probability of Hell's army voluntarily heading to Baschuka was close to 0 percent.

There wouldn't even be a chance to detonate the elemental bomb.

'We lose.'

For the first time, the word "defeat" appeared clearly in Iruki's mind.

"The Bio-Tree has fallen!"

Even without the report, he could clearly see the massive structure toppling.

'It won't last much longer.'

Amy's joining allowed them to hold out 15 minutes longer than Rufist had predicted.

A short time.

But during that time, the number of demons the Bio-Tree annihilated was beyond imagination.

'But the reason I don't feel good is...'

No matter how many demons died in the flower garden, it was still like infinity to humans.

'We need to lure them to Baschuka. Without the elemental bomb, this was an unwinnable fight from the start.'

"The Bio-Tree has fallen!"

Someone's report came in, and wrinkles formed on Fire Tribe Chief Protea's brow.

"Huuk!"

The pain of the Bio-Tree's fire tribe members being caught and dragged by demons flowed through the Small World Genesis.

'Why?'

Bloody tears flowed from Protea's eyes.

'Why must we be treated like this?'

If she were human, she would have bitten her tongue and died.

"We can't even do that!"

Though they might wither from stress, plants weren't given the function to commit suicide.

"Protea!"

Enox came running from the front, looking back.

"Release the Small World Genesis! Pull the defense line back 400 meters and engage again!"

"Master of the Forest!"

At her cry mixed with various emotions, Enox noticed the bloody tears flowing down her cheeks.

"Let's go, Protea."

Enox gripped her shoulder painfully tight.

"I know how you feel. But trust the humans."

"Why should we?"

Protea shook her head.

"I don't care about gods or ideas. We just want to live happily. Without bothering anyone, quietly in the forest, receiving sunlight."

"That's why we're a failed species."

When Protea looked confused, Enox met her eyes directly.

"Protea, there's no way to be happy without fighting. That's where humans and we diverged."

History tells us.

"The reason humans came to dominate this world isn't just because they're strong. It's because they have a much longer history of oppression than us, a history of struggle where they never stopped fighting for even a moment."

Enox's hand pointed to the battlefield.

"Look. Look at how the humans fight. Do you think that's brave? Not at all. They're all terrified."

Protea took in the sight of the allied forces charging while screaming, half out of their minds.

"But humans still fight. The blood of ancestors who went through a history of struggle tells them. That happiness isn't given by others, but won through fighting for it yourself. They instinctively know that fighting is better than being paralyzed with fear."

"That is humanity..."

Enox grabbed the shoulder of Protea, who was staring blankly at the allied forces, and turned her around.

"Trust the humans. Not because they're gods. They know how to fight against the world. If humans can't do it, no species in this world can."

Protea, who had been looking directly into Enox's eyes, took a deep breath and nodded.

"Yes. I'll fight for the fire tribe."

As a gap formed in the allied forces, brigade-sized demon forces came rushing in.

"There they are! Catch the elf! That one's mine!"

"Hurry! Establish a defensive line!"

Just as Enox pushed Protea's back and drew his sword to charge at the demons.

"Huh?"

The demons who had stepped forward were suddenly sucked into magic circles carved into the ground.

Splurt! Splurt!

And they began spurting out as complete pulp from completely unrelated magic circles.

As the magic circuit's input and output kept changing, demon flesh sprayed from all directions.

"What?"

A gate magic circle was quickly carved beneath Rufist's feet as he looked back.

"Phew, I just arrived."

Led by Dante, exhausted from setting traps, the 3rd Division forces rose above ground.

Rufist examined the magic circles after grasping the situation, then turned his head again.

"Infinite circulation orbit?"

Dante gave a tired smile.

"It's lethal to large armies."

The principle was this:

Connect two spatial movement magic circles, then insert blades in the space between them.

That was trap enough.

"Unlike physical traps, the capacity is infinite. With this, we can kill demons endlessly."

Rufist nodded.

"It would also be useful for defending specific areas. You used your head. But durability is another matter, right?"

"Yes. With my skill, about 30 minutes is the limit."

"30 minutes?"

Rufist laughed helplessly.

"Do you really think we can survive until then?"

Though the allied forces had fought humanity's greatest battle, humans weren't that strong.

'Our stamina is depleted.'

On the other hand, the demons just joining the battlefield were full of energy.

'The only ones who can still hold out are... Garcia, Amy, and Lian.'

'Those three account for 25 percent of demon casualties. They're truly what humanity has produced...'

A dangerous thought crossed his mind.

"Wait."

Dante asked.

"What is it?"

"Isn't this strange?"

"What?"

"You just joined so you wouldn't know. Our generals are definitely the strongest fighters. But why..."

Rufist's gaze turned to Hell's army.

"Haven't any of the enemy's strongest fighters, the legion commanders, appeared even once?"

Dante's eyelids blinked.
