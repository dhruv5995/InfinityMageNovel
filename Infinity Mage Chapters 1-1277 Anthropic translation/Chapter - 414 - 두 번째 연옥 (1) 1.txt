[414] The Second Purgatory (1)

The Arun Mountain Range, located in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Tormia.

This place, filled with ominous energy since ancient times, contained Belkir's demon-sealing formation that had been sealed long ago.

Just as magic existed even when magic was unknown, it was the mages who dealt with the laws that had sealed the demon god.

However, now that thousands of years had passed, the will of good had faded, and Belkir's evil began to slowly seep through those gaps, starting to erode the laws.

This was the resurrection story of the demon god Belkir.

Belkir's imposing figure, which had broken through 20 meters of underground bedrock to reveal itself in the cavity within the mountain range, was overwhelming.

His massive body, standing 15 meters tall and weighing 32 tons, resembled an octopus, with skin as dark and rotten-looking as decay.

His two arms looked human at first glance, but upon closer inspection, they were combinations of colorful snakes.

His reptilian, vicious face had only red flames flickering in eyeless sockets.

Burning those flame-like dots, Belkir undulated his 24 octopus legs like waves.

I shall destroy the world! I will subjugate all living beings beneath my feet!

That was the single law that constituted Belkir.

However, the superstar of thousands of years ago had to feel the futility of time.

Humans who had built civilization were no longer vulnerable enough to perish from the appearance of a single demon god.

The mage sect, which had long identified the locations of demon gods based on ancient texts, sent a cooperation document to the kingdom's intelligence department.

With the king's approval, a Cage-class party was formed, and 21 mages entered the caves of the Arun Mountain Range.

Now, 8 hours and 37 minutes later.

Cage Team B, composed of certified 4th to 6th grade mages, had severed all of Belkir's legs and was launching a final offensive for complete annihilation.

"Kraaaaaaah!"

Belkir crawled through the cave, flailing his two arms entangled with snakes.

Though the demon god possessed all kinds of regenerative abilities, the power unleashed by 21 humans was beyond what he, who had been active thousands of years ago, could handle.

"Insignificant humans! How dare you lowly beings challenge me! Krraaaak!"

Belkir's body caved in with an X-shaped depression, flesh splitting open as viscous liquid spurted out.

A fat, bald man leaped into the wound and began swinging his two cleavers even faster.

"Is the X-shape just decoration? Huh? Decoration? Huh? Decoration? Huh? Decoration?"

The man currently had 28 types of ultra-powerful buffs applied to him.

His arms showed no sign of stopping, endlessly carving X-shaped gashes in the flesh as he dug toward where the heart would be.

The man's face lit up with joy when he discovered a pale purple muscle mass.

Then he bit into the demon god's heart.

"Uwaaaah! Delicious! So delicious!"

He pulled the heart with his teeth and chopped the connected parts with his cleavers, causing chunks of flesh to fall away.

The moment he swallowed it, the intense flavor of raw meat spread through him, and fireworks exploded in his head.

"Uwooooh! Uwoooooh!"

"Krrrrr...!"

Belkir held on until the very end.

Any ordinary creature would have died by now, if only out of courtesy.

This showed just how tenacious and obsessive the concepts from which demons are born truly are.

"I... I cannot perish like this..."

"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."

A pale-faced woman with white hair flowing down to her waist embraced Belkir while shedding tears.

Every time her hands caressed the demon god's body, the flesh that had been writhing as if to regenerate stopped its activity.

"How much must it hurt? How much agony must you feel? Ehehe! I'm sorry. I can't help it either... ihihihi!"

Uncontrollable laughter leaked through her sobbing voice.

The contrast between her large eyes dripping with tears and her grotesquely twisted mouth was chilling.

In the human world, being called a demon god would correspond to the rank of a 2-horned demon by heaven's standards, but now he was just a demon facing extinction at the hands of a mere 21 humans immediately upon his descent.

Belkir finally realized he had been trapped.

The mages' abilities had caged him like a prison, and after 8 hours of pounding, he had no strength left to endure.

As the demon god grew precarious, Rose, the leader of Cage Team B, looked for the main dealer.

As expected, he was in a corner smoking and slacking off without a care.

"Hey! Aren't you coming in? Do you know how much this party costs per hour? Does the association dig up money from the ground?"

"Ugh, that witch."

Tarvan flicked away his cigarette and examined Belkir.

He was definitely softened up and in perfect condition for annihilation.

'Just die already, you annoying bastard.'

As Tarvan charged at Belkir and spread both hands, eardrum-piercing high frequencies emanated from his palms.

Kaiser Blast.

All the mages who heard the technique's name scattered in all directions.

As Tarvan's hands stretched forward, Belkir's heavy body began to vibrate violently.

"Remember this, humans! I am...!"

Boooooom!

With the explosion, Belkir's form disappeared without a trace.

Chunks of flesh scattered in all directions, but even those melted away in the heat.

"Mission complete."

This was the result achieved exactly 8 hours and 49 minutes after Cage Team B had arrived at this location.

At that moment, the communication mage who had been dozing against the cave wall suddenly opened his eyes wide.

Information was being displayed in the crystal orb before him.

Approximately four hundred lines of code were needed to convey a single sentence.

"Team leader. Team leader."

When Rose turned around, the communication mage floated the crystal orb above his palm and spoke.

"It's a call from the association. All members of Cage Team B are to assemble."

The Magic Association.

The 18th floor corridor where the association president's office was located was bustling with mages.

The faces of Cage Team B members, scattered about waiting for their team leader, were full of dissatisfaction.

Basically, Cage Team B was formed by selecting only the best practitioners from each field.

Since they were arguably the busiest mages in the kingdom, being called after completing a mission was naturally unwelcome.

"What's this about, making us anxious? I need to get home quickly to watch my kid. They're not thinking of making us do something more here, are they?"

"Speaking of which, why isn't the team leader coming out? Do you know something, old man?"

Tarvan asked Horkin.

As the eldest member of Cage Team B and the one in charge of orders, he should know something, but he was just wearing an enigmatic smile.

When the association president's office door opened and Rose emerged, the mages swarmed toward her.

As expected, it wasn't good news, judging by her expression.

"Team leader, what did the association president say?"

The current association president was temporarily held by Rupist, but since they weren't association employees, they didn't care who held the position as long as the payments were properly settled.

"It's an emergency mission. It looks like you'll have to make one more run."

No one spoke, but the cold killing intent shooting from their gazes made the corridor uneasily ripple.

Saint Moriak asked.

"Why us? There's also Cage Team A."

The skill difference between Cage A and Cage B was minimal.

No matter how elite they were in their respective fields, Tormia's defense capabilities weren't so weak as to lack 40 such talents.

However, while Cage Team A had coordinated for a long time, Cage Team B was hastily assembled according to each situation.

Inferiority complexes inevitably crept into that small difference.

If the association had a mission to carry out, the target should be Cage Team A, not them.

"I suggested that too. But currently, Cage Team A is temporarily inoperable."

Horkin said.

"Because of Gaold."

"Right. Currently, there's someone presumed to be part of Gaold's personal guard on Cage Team A. Until the investigation is complete, we're the kingdom's only Cage-class party."

Tarvan said.

"Still, what's impossible is impossible. Wasn't it the team leader who brought up contracts in the first place? And Roche here has a daughter who can't even crawl yet. His wife will beat him to death."

"That's right, team leader. Please leave me out. I'd rather pay the penalty fee..."

Rose's eyes narrowed.

"Don't be mistaken. This isn't a guild. The payments are just courtesy from the association. Currently, a Kingdom First-Class Mobilization Order has been declared. If you disobey, not only will your Red Line qualification be revoked, but you'll be punished according to kingdom law. You know what the kingdom's atmosphere is like right now, right? You'd better behave yourselves."

The mages fell silent.

In any case, apart from the Red Line, their positions were unthinkable without it, so they had no choice but to comply when ordered from above.

Rose's expression softened slightly.

"As team leader, I'm sorry about this. But once this mission is over, the association has promised sufficient compensation. Triple the existing contract fee, plus reputation points equivalent to a special promotion."

Money aside, the mention of reputation points changed the mages' expressions.

From certified 6th grade onward, the points needed for promotion were enormous, so succeeding in this job would secure them a solid gain.

Horkin asked.

"So... what exactly do we have to do?"

Rose hesitated as if this was the problem.

Wasn't the difficulty too high, even for Cage-class?

"This time's target is... human."

"Human? Which human?"

Rose's eyes flashed sharply.

"We eliminate the former Tormia Magic Association President, Mikea Gaold."

Heaven's Outer Purgatory. The Forest of the Profane.

Emerging from the tunnel where light flowed like rapids, Sirone's eyes were met with a vast sky.

Beyond the waters, heaven's concentric circles were visible, and drones swarmed like swarms of gnats in certain sections.

Having experienced this before, Sirone took a deep breath and prepared for landing.

As expected, the direction sharply changed and he fell vertically.

The sea disappeared and forest rushed past him.

He kept his eyes wide open until the ground approached right in front of him, then twisted his body.

"Phew."

It was a much more stable landing than before, but no one offered congratulations to Sirone.

The nine who had passed through Guffin's door first were scattered in different states, looking in various directions while lost in thought.

Sein said.

"The Forest of the Profane. It's the habitat of unicorns."

"Unicorns, huh. A quiet place. Shall we go then?"

A quiet place.

Sirone recalled the situation when he had been caught in the unicorns' encirclement.

Thanks to that, he had met Kanya and Lena and was able to enter heaven, but it was by no means a safe place.

'Well, for these people, it might indeed be a quiet place...'

Sein explained as they walked.

Purgatory was broadly classified into three places: the habitat of heretics, the mainland, and the community outskirts.

Particularly, the community outskirts was a general term for regions inhabited by non-citizens, who were specifically called border people.

Sein's current destination was a place called the mainland, the only neutral zone where heretics and border people gathered, making it an essential stop for gathering information.

When they reached the middle of the forest, the ground suddenly began to rumble as if an earthquake had occurred.

The group took defensive positions and waited for new changes to appear, but as the sound gradually subsided, they exchanged glances and pushed through the forest.

"My goodness..."

In the plains at the foot of the mountain, hundreds of giants were marching in formation toward somewhere.

Giants created through Ilhwa's alcohol.

At the time, they had been too shocked by the mere existence of giants to think properly, but according to Sein's explanation, they were currently heading to Jotunheim, the land of giants.

There they would regain their identity and return to heaven to uphold the laws, but if they fell into corruption, they would be unable to return to heaven and would be exiled to Muspel, the land of fire.

"Giants are also a force that cannot be ignored. But they are merely monsters. It's better to ignore them and move on."

The faces of the ten people hidden in the bushes silently disappeared.
