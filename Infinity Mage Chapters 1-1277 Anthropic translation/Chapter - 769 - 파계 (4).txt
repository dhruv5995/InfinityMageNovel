[769] Breaking the Precepts (4)

Wigo's family estate was a massive temple built on the grasslands 14 kilometers from the capital, Gardan.

Excluding the Eastern Middle Heaven, the holy land of monks, it was the place where the world's greatest number of practitioners resided.

However, since most were currently participating in the Zion Project, the temple was quiet when Shirone arrived.

"Wigo?"

Wigo's cousins came rushing over after receiving word that the Chairman of the Magic Association had arrived.

"What brings you to the main house? And who are these people?"

When Terraforce's Grand Judge passed judgment on all of humanity, the number of good souls was less than 1 percent of the total population.

Not being able to enter Zion was proof that their cultivation had not yet reached supreme goodness.

Wigo made the introductions himself.

"These are stars of the Ivory Tower. This is Saint Ariane Shirone, and this is Saint Mirach Minerva."

"Ariane Shirone?"

For the Sky family relatives who had supported Wigo, Shirone was a painfully familiar name.

"What an extraordinary person has come. For one of the Five Great Saints at the pinnacle of the world to visit such a humble place..."

Before the atmosphere could become too heated, Garcia explained.

"Wigo has requested teachings. We wonder if you could lend us a place suitable for Avatar techniques."

The cousins' faces flushed with excitement.

'Finally, he's seized his chance. Well done, Wigo.'

Though Miro didn't consider Shirone her disciple, it was an undeniable fact that she had once taught her.

If he could overwhelm Shirone with Avatar techniques here, they could reclaim the title of the world's greatest cultivation family.

'It's not just Wigo's fault.'

Reading the hostility in his cousins' eyes, Shirone realized where Wigo's twisted resentment had begun.

'There's no master here.'

Family head Kasia couldn't have been unaware of his son's inner demons, yet he had taken everyone and departed for Zion.

To protect humanity from the demons.

'Thank you.'

Shirone's gaze changed.

'I'll set Wigo straight myself.'

The cousins stepped back with pale faces.

"Ugh! What, what is this?"

Though their cultivation was shallow, they were still of the Sky family - they couldn't fail to feel the bone-chilling cold that seemed to freeze their very hearts.

With Yahweh's warmth withdrawn, Shirone appeared as a perfect mage even to Garcia, a certified First-Class Grand Mage.

'Is this really a mage barely out of his teens?'

Like absolute zero, a mind without the slightest movement was the ultimate coldness.

"Hehe, how about that? Isn't it amazing?"

Minerva stood beside Garcia.

"A terribly pure, terribly cold Spirit Zone. The mental state every mage dreams of, right?"

"...I understand Wigo's inner demons now."

He wanted to experience it, even just once.

"What would it feel like to be unshaken by any stimulus...?"

"Give up - it's easier that way. A mage should indeed be like that. He's much more handsome than when he's Yahweh, don't you think?"

Garcia closed his mouth at the frivolous comment.

"Let's go. I want to finish this quickly."

When Shirone's voice resonated through the Spirit Zone, Wigo felt his heart freeze solid.

'Tch, what's this? Just trying to intimidate me.'

The infinite mage who had mastered all magic in the world.

In a clash of pure minds, he would be no match.

"I'll say it again - this is an Avatar duel. Using magic would be harmful to both of us..."

"I know. Lead me to the dueling ground."

Wigo turned toward the training ground.

"Follow me."

As he cast Fly magic, Shirone, Minerva, Garcia, and the cousins followed behind.

'Hmph! Your showing off ends here!'

The place Wigo arrived at was a vast open space spacious enough to focus on Avatar techniques without concern.

No walls were visible to the horizon - this too was a specially provided location from Namemond.

"Come on, come on! Now that we're here, let's start quickly!"

Minerva clapped her hands and pumped up the energy, then turned to Garcia and asked.

"You really won't make a bet? It's not that you can't bring yourself to bet against your homeland's promising talent, is it?"

"I don't gamble on others' pain."

Garcia spoke firmly.

"But if you're simply asking for my opinion, I'd have to favor Wigo."

"Hohoho! At least your pride is still alive."

"...I wonder about that."

While he didn't mean to disparage the Five Great Saints' abilities, Wigo had spent his entire life fighting an imaginary Miro.

'And the Avatar created through that process.'

The reason there are no eternal victors is that latecomers can analyze and absorb the best techniques.

Today was the day Wigo's efforts would bear fruit.

"Direct attacks on the body are forbidden. Victory will be decided solely through combat between Avatars."

While there was no need to worry at their level, the mental shock would be considerable.

"Got it."

As Shirone deployed his sequence formula, the Archangel Avatar rose up massively as if to pierce the sky.

Wigo's cousins widened their eyes.

"Wooooah."

The scenery writhed bizarrely under the influence of the time machine, almost causing motion sickness.

"Magnificent."

Now baring his teeth, Wigo displayed an openly mocking smile as he deployed his Avatar technique.

"Then let me show you my weapon too."

As he deployed his sequence formula, smoke as dense as white paint surged up over Wigo's shoulders.

"Heavenly Knight."

The smoke that rose to the Archangel's height transformed into a knight whose entire body was covered in white armor.

It had a sleek form focused on mobility, and the armor's surface was smooth as if coated.

With a slender build that could be mistaken for female, it held 9-meter-long thin swords in both hands.

'Not just the size, but it's so vivid. It would take considerable power to destroy that.'

For the Sky family, who studied enlightenment from birth, sequence formulas were their most confident field.

"How is it? It's an Avatar technique called Heavenly Knight. I think it's not shameful to face one of the Five Great Saints."

To facilitate the Avatar duel, Shirone moved more than 300 meters away from Wigo.

"...Let's begin."

At the continued dismissive attitude, Wigo wrinkled his nose and deployed his Avatar technique.

"You won't even be able to follow it with your eyes!"

Just the 20-meter Avatar approaching in an instant was enough to make one's mind reel.

'It's over!'

The moment the Heavenly Knight crossed its swords in an X to behead the Archangel, Shirone exhaled deeply.

"Whew!"

This all happened in one second.

The Archangel's surroundings warped rapidly, and before anyone knew it, it was floating higher than the Heavenly Knight.

'Angel's Punishment!'

Just as a beam of light rushed toward the Heavenly Knight's broad back, Wigo's eyes bulged.

'I already know that!'

The white-armored Avatar's front and back switched as it flew straight toward the Archangel.

'Dump!'

The Heavenly Knight's side bent in an impossible trajectory, avoiding Angel's Punishment.

While the powerful impact swept the ground, the two thin swords multiplied countless times and stabbed the Archangel.

"Ugh!"

Shirone's brow furrowed.

"This isn't the end!"

The white armor forming the Heavenly Knight writhed like liquid, taking every conceivable pose as it charged.

'This is...!'

Shirone finally realized.

"Can you avoid my Dump?"

Thin swords flew from every angle where no blind spot could be found, stabbing the Archangel Avatar.

Each was a killing blow, and massive shock waves crashed into Shirone's mind as he controlled his Avatar technique.

"Huuuuuu!"

Shirone's gaze remained clear.

'Still holding on despite this? Well, you wouldn't break easily.'

The corner of Wigo's mouth stretched into a bitter smile.

"Suffer for eternity."

The Heavenly Knight completely collapsed its physical form and attacked the Archangel in shapes beyond imagination.

"...Quite an impressive Avatar technique."

Minerva, watching with a snake-like cold expression, blew out a long stream of cigarette smoke.

"Form collapse is logic collapse. Meaning he can directly imprint thought itself?"

"It's a law called Dump."

Garcia explained.

"Wigo can output everything he thinks through the Heavenly Knight."

That was the nature of the law.

"Even if Ataraxia expands the present, reactions are merely results following causes. But Dump..."

"Outputs cause and effect simultaneously."

"Exactly."

It was possible with mind rather than physics, and the manifestation of that unique individuality was the Avatar.

"To surpass Miro?"

While Minerva had no interest in Wigo's psychology, this was the first thing that came to mind upon seeing the Heavenly Knight.

'The contemplative stance that accepts and understands all angles of the world - that's Miro's Thousand-Armed Guanyin.'

In contrast, the Heavenly Knight was the expressive stance of Wigo projecting himself toward the world.

"It's an Avatar that perfectly embodies the Sky family's temperament. In terms of enlightenment's depth, I don't think it falls behind the Stars."

"Hmph."

Minerva snorted, but it was the only response she could manage to Garcia's words.

'I'm winning! I'm going to win!'

The Heavenly Knight was vividly demonstrating what logic collapse - the complete output of thought - looked like.

It was by no means beautiful.

But precisely because it was completely removed from human aesthetic sense, it was the most functional form in the universe.

'Want me to tell you what's really scary?'

If it were just Dump, it might be laughable depending on the level.

"The Sky's reasoning fills the heavens."

The Heavenly Knight struck the Archangel in a form that blocked every trajectory where it existed, even cutting off temporal variables.

So many thin swords were embedded in the Archangel's body that there was nowhere left to stab.

"Grrrr...!"

A groan escaped Shirone's lips, and cold sweat beaded on his forehead.

"Is pride the reason you're enduring?"

The Heavenly Knight withdrew, pulling out its swords.

"How disappointing. If you knew you couldn't win, gracefully admitting it would be a beautiful sight."

"Yes. You really are strong."

Shirone slowly raised his gaze.

"If I acknowledge defeat here, will you be satisfied now?"

"Don't talk nonsense."

The Heavenly Knight extended countless thorns, directly expressing Wigo's rage.

"How dare you try to make excuses to escape?"

Watching the Unlocker's reasoning pour out in its entirety, Shirone gritted his teeth.

'He's far more twisted than I thought.'

He'd never intended to go easy from the start.

'I'm sorry, Kasia...'

From now on, even in an Avatar duel, he couldn't guarantee Wigo's life.

'This seems to be the only way.'

When he first realized this technique, he thought he'd never use it except against Nane.

'Angel's Punishment!'

The Archangel thrust down its spear.

"I told you it's useless!"

As Wigo's reasoning was output, the Heavenly Knight avoided the light spear in an extraordinary form.

'One second up to here.'

The Archangel, composed of time machines, rapidly changed form through the stages of striking, entering, and resonating.

'And this timeline...'

Shirone gritted his teeth and activated his Avatar technique.

'Bounces!'

Archangel Avatar Technique.

Time Vibration.

"What...!"

Even in the briefest moment that could be called time's minimum unit, Wigo's reasoning formed through the gaps.

'Why is it coming again?'

Therefore, the incomprehensible fact was that Angel's Punishment was flying at him again in this short moment.

'Dump...!'

Only when he desperately avoided the 3,000th spear did Wigo realize what this was.

'The same time is vibrating.'

The elapsed time was still the beginning of an instant.

'How long will this last...?'

At the point where one trillion repetitions reached 6,281 times, Wigo's reasoning finally reached its limit.

'I don't know anymore.'

The moment he released the tightly held string of cognition, time flowed according to the senses.

"Ahhhhhhh!"

It felt like his mind was being destroyed.

In that consciousness fading into the distance, the last reasoning Wigo grasped was the infinite repetition of one specific second.

It was the shock of time containing different events vibrating 100,000 times based on one second.
