Karma Chain (1)

The Other World.

This place called Hell is as vast as the real world and has formed a society as systematized as humanity's.

However, while human society is a product of reason, Hell's society is a product of emotion, making their systems fundamentally different.

The most representative difference is that while reality's base is water, Hell's base is fire.

The sky is mostly covered with clouds of fire, and instead of cold rain, hot flames fall from above.

The fire that falls to earth melts like lava and flows into massive rivers of flame.

Cities are formed along the tributaries of these rivers, and without exception, each has facilities called purification systems.

Lava dams that control the amount of fire, soul processing plants that regulate the quality of fire, fire pits where hellfire boils 24 hours a day, and so on.

And overseeing all these purification facilities is the Fire Resource Management Corporation, which boasts Hell's highest authority.

"Aaaaah!"

A piercing scream echoed from the president's office of the Fire Resource Management Corporation, commonly known as the Fire Corp.

Though it sounded painful, emotions of pleasure were woven between each syllable.

The door burst open urgently.

"President! What's wrong!"

The president, who had been sitting with both legs up on the table, hastily curled up and turned around.

"Kyah! What!"

Executive Secretary Monoras spoke nonchalantly.

"Well, I heard screaming so I came."

The Fire Corp's president, Lethe's eyes narrowed as she coldly swept over Monoras.

Reddish-brown skin with a pig's head - the worst, lowest demon race with no trace of intelligence to be found.

'Why is such a creature...'

Why is he working as Fire Corp's executive secretary?

"Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff."

As Monoras kept sniffing around as if searching for something, Lethe's face contorted.

"What are you doing?"

"Nothing really. Sniff, hah. Sniff, hah."

His stuffy, congested voice was already unbearable to listen to, but the most irritating thing was that he was the most shameless bastard in all of Hell.

"Monoras."

"Yes, President."

Lethe beckoned with her finger.

"Come over here for a moment."

"I need to get to work now. I'm busy."

When his dull body didn't budge an inch, she nodded quickly as if she'd expected this.

"Fine. Fine, just come here for a second."

Monoras blinked his eyes and walked toward the desk, showing his reluctance as obviously as possible.

"What? Is there food or some—"

Before he could finish speaking, she leaped over the desk and punched Monoras in the jaw.

"This bastard, really!"

The pig's body flew through the office wall and crashed dully into the corridor wall.

Lethe ran at full speed and kicked his stomach, then began stomping on him repeatedly.

"Didn't I tell you not to come in? I've told you over 300 million times! Are you ignoring me right now?"

Each time Lethe's attack landed, it made the exact same sound as kneading meat.

"Oink! Oink!"

Making pig-slaughtering sounds while rolling down the corridor, Monoras was followed by Lethe striding after him.

"How much more do you need to get beaten before you come to your senses? I'm the president! Got it? Answer me! Who's the president?"

"I, I'm the president!"

"Aaaaah! So annoying!"

She kicked Monoras in the stomach, sending his massive body crashing into the ceiling before plummeting straight down.

"Hah! Hah!"

Glaring at the pig's face as he clutched his stomach and shed tears, Lethe caught her breath.

"I'm the president! Me! So to you, it's not me but you who...!"

"President."

A voice came from the end of the corridor.

A refreshing voice that didn't suit Hell at all.

But this was precisely their profession.

Informator.

A woman with horns growing from her head like a goat approached cat-like, clutching a file folder to her chest.

"You two are getting along as well as ever."

Lethe, who had been gasping for breath, looked at Monoras with unfocused eyes before raising her head.

"What's the matter?"

"Ah, yes. Two Living Bodies have entered. In Baramaon District 7, at the Spine Graveyard. It's a different type from the Sacrifice of True Sound."

Remembering how the purification system had gotten twisted due to the spiritual realm's seal, Lethe sighed.

"What type?"

"Taegeuk."

"What!"

Lethe's eyes widened.

"That's a super-massive emotional entity! No way, no way! Right now purification facilities nationwide are almost completely paralyzed. We can't purify this."

The Informator shrugged.

"Even if you say that..."

From the Fire Resource Management Corporation's standpoint, this was a problem that had to be solved, setting aside all other business.

"Ah, damn! What kind of crazy human!"

Taegeuk refers to a phenomenon where two concepts that refer to each other merge into one.

Usually it's just a temporary, isolated phenomenon, but the fact that it had crossed over to Hell was itself the problem.

"With ordinary taboos, they couldn't even cross Hell's threshold. How the hell did they get here?"

"Um, the type of Karma Chain is lust. Through the amplification of good and evil, they reached the First Circle."

"Ugh."

Lethe made a disgusted expression.

"Complete disaster, these ones. Evil doing its thing is one thing, but what's with good accepting it?"

"It seems it was a method to prevent evil."

"Hmm."

While Lethe was thinking with her chin in her hand, vigorous snoring sounds came from the floor.

Monoras, who had fallen asleep at some point, was talking in his sleep.

"Hehehe, President, that tickles."

The color drained from Lethe's face as a few strands of her hair stood up like static electricity.

"Agh! Really!"

Before anyone could stop her, she kicked him and Monoras's face crashed into the wall with a bang.

"Mmnya, mmnya."

Lethe turned away with tears welling up.

"That thing is an executive secretary! Can't fire him, can't quit myself. Does God even exist?"

Just as Taesung manages reality's resources, Lethe is the being who manages the Other World's resources.

The difference is the extreme work stress from a company with no rest or retirement.

Baramaon District 7.

Remains abandoned with their spines extracted piled up here, earning it the name "Spine Graveyard."

There, uniformly deformed children wandered around the graves, sucking bone marrow.

A race called Limbo - weak in combat ability but unparalleled in cruelty.

Their emaciated legs bent as they sucked marrow, their eyes showing no sign of life.

"Uaaaah!"

At the explosion that burst from thin air, the Limbos threw down their bones and quickly scattered in all directions.

Space rippled and a man and woman with their bodies intertwined fell onto the graves.

"Kugh!"

As Etella groaned from being pierced by sharp bones, Shagal's expression also crumpled.

"Huu. Huu."

Coming to his senses and looking around, they had fallen somewhere completely different from reality.

"Where is this?"

"Probably... Hell."

Turning his head again, Etella, still lying below, spoke matter-of-factly.

"This is the only place for you to go, after all."

"Kik!"

Shagal's shoulders shook as he laughed.

"Kahahaha! So this was it? You talked about forgiveness and whatnot to bring me to Hell?"

"Are you disappointed?"

The laughter stopped abruptly.

"No."

Swift swords poured down like hail, and Shagal caught one of them.

"The disappointed one would be you. Falling to Hell because of someone like me. But what can we do? What you'll experience from now on isn't Hell, but me."

Shagal's tongue licked the blade.

"Since we're already dead, we can't die again, right? Or can we? Let's experiment once."

A swift sword pierced Etella's shoulder.

"Hgh!"

At the same time, Shagal felt the pain of a blade piercing his own shoulder and instinctively backed away.

"Damn! What!"

Etella sat up and examined her chest with a surprised expression.

"This is..."

A chain starting from where her heart was had pierced through Shagal's clothes and connected to his chest.

"Damn! Annoying."

When Shagal pulled the chain, Etella was overwhelmed by a soul-draining shock.

"Hgh!"

Etella crawled forward, and Shagal, receiving the same shock, collapsed in place.

Both thought the same thing.

"We're connected."

Thinking more information was needed, Shagal raised a swift sword and stabbed his own thigh.

"Kgh! What are you doing!"

Etella grabbed her knee angrily, but this made it certain.

"Hmm."

He needed to take control.

Shagal pulled the chain again, but this time Etella responded with the same method.

Clank!

The moment the chain was pulled taut, both trembled as if electrocuted.

"Kghhh!"

While waiting for the pain to subside while curled up, their thoughts became somewhat organized.

"Damn, we're trapped. Is this my punishment?"

Turning his head, Etella was also looking at Shagal with a dejected expression.

'It works! It works!'

The real world's scenery disappeared, and Rian saw everything in his vision turn red.

At that moment, the pain of burning in fire disappeared.

"Heoeogh!"

He felt the extreme emotion rapidly cooling, but returning to reality didn't happen.

In a sense... he had died.

"That aside."

Rian gripped the handle to check if 〈Idea〉 was intact while surveying his surroundings.

Hungry ghosts were everywhere, and unable to bear their hunger, they were frantically eating rocks.

"Kehk! Kehk!"

A hungry ghost with a rock stuck in its throat was coughing when it spotted Rian and held its breath.

Soon thousands of hungry ghosts that had caught the scent of living flesh were staring his way.

The sulfur smell was nauseating and the air was hot, but at least it wasn't like burning in fire.

"Shall I warm up a bit?"

Looking around at the hungry ghosts already closing distance, Rian drew his great sword.

"Kieeee! Meat! Meat!"

Spouting incomprehensible words, the hungry ghosts gathered from all directions like rising water.

The moment Rian confidently stepped forward and tried to swing his great sword horizontally.

"Kgh!"

His heart became burning hot as strength rapidly drained from his entire body.

'What?'

Rolling on the ground to avoid attacks, Rian held his great sword forward while examining his chest.

His body was pierced as if something had gone through it.

Instead of a heart, a red stone floated there with small iron chains endlessly wrapping around it.

'Is it because of this?'

When he exerted force in that state, the chains wrapped at tremendous speed and caught fire.

"Hghhh!"

As Rian grimaced from the burning pain, the hungry ghosts applauded.

"Gehenna! Gehenna!"

He didn't know the meaning but could roughly guess.

'I see. The fire didn't go out. Reality's fire is applied differently here.'

That was probably Gehenna.

"Doesn't matter."

Rian raised the corners of his mouth as he stood up.

"Come at me."

The hungry ghosts gathered again, and regardless of the pain, Rian swung his sword freely.

The weak hungry ghosts were no match, but the more he moved his body, the hotter the fire in his chest became.

Smoke rose from Rian's mouth.

"Hghhh!"

The hungry ghosts realized their opponent was strong but didn't give up and bought time.

Chains flowed down from Rian's chest and at some point became fixed to the ground.

Not noticing, Rian charged forward but his upper body was pulled back by the tugging force, making him kneel.

"Kgh!"

He couldn't put strength into it.

As if they'd expected this, the hungry ghosts burst into shrieks and simultaneously pounced on Rian.

"Meat! I'm going to eat it!"

The moment the hungry ghosts bared their sharp teeth, Rian gritted his teeth and forced his body up.

"Fire or whatever..."

The chains fixed to the ground were pulled taut and became red-hot as if heated.

"Gehenna! Gehen..."

The hungry ghosts that had stopped moving looked around.

The earth had turned to lava and was churning, while their comrades' bodies were flowing down like porridge.

"How can you use Gehenna...!"

Divine Transcendence.

As Rian advanced, the heated chains pulled free, burning the atmosphere.

"Hiek! H-hellfire!"

The hungry ghosts scattered, and pure magic flowed through the chains into his heart.

"Hghhh!"

At the same time, acrid smoke began spewing from Rian's mouth as if his lungs were on fire.
