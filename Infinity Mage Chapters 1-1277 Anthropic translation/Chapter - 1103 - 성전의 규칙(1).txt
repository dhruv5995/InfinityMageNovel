Rules of the Holy War (1)

Looking up at the gathering of angels filling the sky, the kings were stunned.

'I had my suspicions, but...'

They had heard reports that Heaven's army had vanished without a trace, starting from Jive.

'They brought in angels?'

Humans would make deals with even ghosts if they knew what they wanted, but the shock was considerable.

'Was there room for compromise left? With that scale, they could bombard an entire nation.'

Satiel quickly surveyed the processions from each country.

'Where is Ikael?'

She didn't seem to be next to the Nephilim.

'Did they already spirit her away? No, that can't be. As long as I'm here...'

Her eyes widened.

'Satan!'

Gustav Habitz.

Though his form was different from when they fought in Heaven, Satan's aura remained the same.

The mastermind behind Heaven's collapse, who had annihilated countless angels including Metiel, the Archangel of Unity.

"How dare you... where do you think this is..."

Sensing Satiel's surging rage, Habitz showed interest for the first time.

"Oh? An angel?"

He climbed up onto the saddle, turned around to sit, wrapped his arms around Uorin's waist, and shaded his eyes from the sunlight with his hand.

"Hmm, Satiel. A familiar feeling. Yes, I devoured those things."

Through memories rather than essence, Habitz had absorbed all of Satan's past.

"Oh my, how frightening."

Hearing the angels' murderous intent through God's frequency, Habitz nodded.

"Such firm resentment. That's their problem. They need everything to be clear-cut."

He could see Satiel glaring fiercely.

"Eh, ehhh."

Sticking out his tongue, he moved it up and down as if licking Satiel in the distance.

Satiel's light body trembled violently.

"You disgusting insect!"

"Hehehe. Eh, ehhh. Hehehehe."

Even while unable to contain his laughter, Habitz moved his tongue even more obscenely.

"I'll disintegrate you!"

Satiel's light body spread into a halo, and the angels in the sky took bombardment positions.

Gis said calmly.

"Please restrain yourself."

"Shut up. Don't tell me what to do, you mere human. Should I kill you first?"

"That's fine with me, but if you cause a disturbance here, Ikael would be pleased, wouldn't she?"

The ring of light returned to a sphere.

"Satan is also part of the plan. Trust me. Ikael will become more miserable than you."

'Ikael.'

Hearing Satiel grinding her teeth, Gis raised the corners of his mouth.

'The reason I can make deals with angels. It's because Satiel's motivation is extremely human.'

Though it was Ikael who started this fire in the first place.

'Emotion leads to desire. And any being with desire can be controlled.'

Just like the citizens of Jive.

Satiel turned toward headquarters and said.

"I won't wait long. Bring Ikael and make her shed tears of blood."

"...Understood."

As the common angels disappeared one by one, officials from other countries were grave.

'One mountain after another.'

Shirone said.

"The number of common angels Satiel has gathered exceeds 300. Adding Mara, it might be the highest-class firepower for a single nation."

This wasn't humanity of the past.

"A third of the world's population has decreased. Thirty countries have disappeared from the map. Key personnel are lacking, and there are no particularly strong nations anymore."

Lufist turned his head.

"The other countries' cards aren't to be taken lightly. Tormia is also a problem, but it seems difficult to carry out your beliefs as well."

Shirone's eyes sank coldly as he fell into thought.

"Total war."

"Argan. Frigi."

At a place where the Pyramid of Truth shimmered on the horizon, Shirone stopped walking.

"Yes, Messiah."

While the group looked on puzzled, the two apostles immediately knelt.

"Go to Jive. Right now."

"Pardon?"

They couldn't understand why he suddenly changed destinations with the Pyramid of Truth right before their eyes.

"Why..."

"I found where the angels went. All 12 apostles will be assembled. Follow my instructions there."

The apostles' eyes changed at the mention of angels.

"Understood."

The moment they finished speaking, the apostles who kicked off the ground and flew up transformed into dragons.

Seeing the fire dragon and ice dragon that soared high into the sky in an instant, Ares' group was reminded anew.

'Right, they were dragons.'

They were the ones who had restored the dried-up Nagnak Oasis with tremendous magic.

Glen was worried.

"Will it be okay without the dragons? The Pyramid of Truth is an unknown space with almost nothing known about it."

Since Rukia's emotional disease had been postponed, the next thing to consider was safety.

Canis snapped back.

"Go back if you're not confident. We've done fine among ourselves even without dragons."

Glen didn't back down either.

"I'm saying we should make full preparations. Personnel withdrawal is a major variable in any situation. I heard mages were smart, but looking at it now, I guess that's not all of them."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

The emotions that had clashed at Nagnak Oasis seemed about to escalate into a second round.

"You're one to talk, when your lover is sick..."

Canis stopped mid-sentence with a start.

"Tch, forget it."

He too had someone precious named Arin.

Sensing this fact, Glen's emotions also softened, but he needed to make things clear.

"It's true that Yahweh helped Rukia. I might repay it with my life. But my faith won't be broken. I still deny him."

"Who said anything? I get it."

Wasn't it petty to help while expecting something in return?

Of course, it wasn't something anyone could do, so Glen also came to acknowledge Canis belatedly.

'...Still a mage though.'

As Canis grumbled and returned to his spot, Arin smiled and took his hand.

You held back well. Please control your temper.

It was a mental channel.

What did I do?

You've been whining constantly. Though I understand it's not incomprehensible.

If Arin had been in such a situation, it would have been terrible.

"Hehe."

After watching Canis and laughing briefly, Arin kissed his cheek in front of everyone.

As Canis' face turned red as a beet, Shirone chuckled and looked away.

'They're still getting along like a house on fire.'

Even so, he didn't expect Canis to be flustered by just a kiss on the cheek.

'He's worse than me.'

Glen, who had been watching them enviously, glanced away, and Rukia raised one eyebrow.

"What?"

"Huh? Oh, no, I was just looking?"

"How sly."

Rukia pinched Glen's forearm hard.

"Ow! Sorry!"

Though there was no doubt about their love for each other, being priests made them awkward at expressing it.

Ares put his hand on Shirone's shoulder.

"There's this kind of love, and that kind of love."

"Ah, yes. That's right."

Silence flowed.

When the awkwardness reached its peak, Ares leaned in close and asked quietly.

"Our little sister is doing 'well,' right?"

"Pardon? Oh, that's..."

As Shirone fumbled, unable to grasp the standard for 'well,' Ares burst into laughter.

"I'm joking! Anyone can tell just by looking. Speaking as her brother, you'd better brace yourself. Once Karmis catches fire, she won't stop until she becomes the best."

Watching Ares walk toward the Pyramid of Truth, Shirone made a hollow expression.

'What kind of brother is like that?'

Then the couples Canis and Arin, Glen and Rukia walked hand in hand.

There's this kind of love and that kind of love, but.

'I hope everyone will be happy.'

Shirone followed them, while the taciturn Yuphra and Zulu moved from the rear.

"Wow, the Pyramid of Truth."

The structure so enormous that its end couldn't be seen overwhelmed humans with its size alone.

While Ares knelt and performed his own ritual, Arin said.

"Canis, this..."

Her voice was trembling.

"Yeah. How does it look?"

Though Arin perceived all things as if seeing them for the first time, this time was particularly severe.

"I don't know. What could this be? Enormous light. But black droplets are scattered like noise..."

It was a color where light and darkness were mixed, but didn't feel harmonious at all.

'Bizarre. Even looking at it is difficult. What is this form that supposedly cures emotional disease?'

Zulu said.

"The Pyramid of Truth has existed since before human civilization began. The ancient Faras Kingdom also modeled countless pyramids after this pyramid. They were kings' tombs."

Shirone said.

"Meaningful. Did the ancient kings know that the afterlife connected to the outside?"

Ultra-ancient civilizations erased their own records, so they didn't exist even in Omega.

"I don't know how much they understood the outside world. But considering that the Faras Kingdom was the origin of astrology, it can't be denied."

"Astrology."

The ability to transcend time.

"Ready."

Ares, who had finished his ritual, picked up his backpack.

"Let's go in. Whatever it is, investigating will reveal it. We might even meet God."

"Oh God."

As Glen and Rukia murmured, Shirone walked toward the Pyramid of Truth.

Though it would be smaller than a crack compared to the overall size, there was a gap large enough for people to enter.

Surprisingly, the interior wasn't dark.

"Strange."

When Ares turned off his lantern, it became somewhat darker, but there was still no problem with visibility.

"There's nowhere for light to enter from. How can we see?"

"It seems like electrons."

Shirone said.

"The electrons in the atmosphere are faintly emitting light. The feeling is quite unpleasant."

His skin tingled.

"Hmm, but for electrons to emit light, a certain amount of energy must be applied. ...Don't tell me?"

"Yes. It seems this pyramid itself is probably producing energy."

"Is that possible? This is a pre-historical artifact."

"It's probably the same principle as OOPArts. Everything from ultra-ancient civilizations generates electricity."

"Then it's infinite power?"

"At least from this world's perspective. More importantly, the electric field of OOPArts disrupts brain waves. It seems to even erase data from the Akashic Records. Be careful."

"I see. Come on, everyone! Let's be careful."

Though Ares threw out a pointed joke, it wasn't an atmosphere where anyone could laugh.

Following the maze-like complex paths and examining rooms, Canis made a serious expression.

'It's really huge.'

The overwhelming feeling from seeing it outside was nothing compared to experiencing it physically now.

'We'd never finish if we investigated everything. The problem is that none of the rooms show traces of civilization.'

It was a characteristic of ultra-ancient civilizations.

Ares, who had been memorizing the geography with his crimson eyes as he advanced, suddenly stopped in his tracks.

"These aren't rooms. I can't find any intention. I just think they needed many spaces of this form and size."

"Maybe they're controlling flow?"

Shirone said.

"Complex paths. Rooms of different sizes. Irregular arrangements. If this structure was designed to create special invisible flows..."

"That's why electricity is generated. Hmm."

As Ares fell into thought, Arin, who had been checking behind them, widened her eyes and said.

"Canis, look over there."

Blue glowing characters appeared on the corridor wall and began approaching them.
