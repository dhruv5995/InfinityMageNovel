The World We Live In (5)

The pyramids erected around the world stole people's hearts through magnetic fields.

They became People, and began moving in groups according to God's purpose.

Within the flow of humanity splitting like tributaries of a river, some streams headed toward the temple.

"Toward God's holy land."

But other streams were already moving toward places far from Jive, as if they knew what would happen where at the final moment.

"We go to Delta headquarters."

Countless People had also been born at the pyramid erected in the Jive Kingdom.

Among them was a holy knight from the Anti-Magic Division who had investigated the pyramid under Pope Constantine's orders.

"Kill Maya."

Those clad in heavy plate armor began heading toward Delta headquarters with clanking sounds.

The demonstration continued, and Albino turned away from the window as if the game was over.

"Everyone claims they're right. Because everyone claims they're right, the problem is that no one can say anyone is wrong."

Lupist followed behind.

"After the demon invasion, Jive adopted a democratic monarchy limited to the capital. That's also why Gis ascended to the throne. The citizens' pride in rebuilding from war damage must be tremendous."

"Who says otherwise? Democracy is a good system. But you shouldn't treat it like a sacred place. Ideology has no special value. The fundamental reason monarchism collapsed wasn't because it went against human nature, but because its efficiency became outdated. Bloody revolutions were just passing processes compared to the enormous wealth that regime change would bring."

"If I may say so, I sense a semi-contemptuous tone toward the current era."

"Heh, that's not it. Freedom is a good thing. But for me, the idea that freedom is something to be seized rather than given is deeply rooted. That's probably what makes me an old fogey."

"If I misspoke..."

"No, it's fine. It's the truth. I'm just living according to my age. I'm just worried about the reality where the concept of freedom seems to overwhelm all other concepts."

Albino said.

"They say it's a society that respects individual values, but in reality they just throw out a few choices and tell you to pick from them. I heard there was heated debate about legalizing homosexuality in Rodenin once. Fine by me. This side is heterosexuality, that side is homosexuality. But where is 'somewhat homosexual' or 'half homosexual'? In the end, it's this side or that side. The countless individualities that remain in between get crushed. That's not negotiation - that's a method used in war. The demonstrators won't be able to unite either way."

If it's about winning first and worrying later.

"I'm not advocating for monarchist restoration. Rodenin once had times when it was censored by the system too. After passing through such dark ages, now comes an era where individuals censor each other. Without anyone ordering it, they're all monitoring each other. Once friend-or-foe identification is complete, all that remains is thorough punishment."

"There might be no correct answer, but people seem to fall into the delusion that they can perfectly define something. Imagination about what kind of life others have lived has become a useless talent in society. Is this also a kind of evolution? If everyone is satisfied, they can just live that way... but still, an old fogey like me can't help but feel bitter."

"Someone with such thoughts isn't an old fogey."

"Haha! That's because you're becoming like me too. Young people these days call us 'ajae', right? Think about when we were young. We'd have fits if adults said anything. Even if they're a bit clumsy and disagreeable, shouldn't we follow along? Regardless of right and wrong, isn't that the natural order? After all, they're the owners of the future."

Perhaps because the temple's ugly politics would end by tomorrow morning, Albino was deeply reflective.

Opening the security room door revealed Dante smoking in a place thick with stale smoke.

"Ah, sorry."

Albino extended his hand.

"It's fine. Make yourself comfortable."

Dante, who had to predict the whereabouts of Rom, Garth, and Temica, was currently the busiest person.

"You're working hard. I should buy you a drink."

"It's fine. Please sit." Dante put out his cigarette and began briefing.

"Roughly 12 hours until the vote. It will vary depending on future alliance structures, but currently the most likely candidate for world leadership is Jive. A whopping 42 percent probability."

Since it was calculating vote directions, rough probabilities could be inferred.

"Well... they did quite well."

There had been so many incidents since the temple opened.

If Jive was qualified, it would be because they handled all those variables stably.

Dante continued his explanation.

"The next most likely world leadership candidate is Corona. However, their own country is currently unstable. The Ivory Tower is on the verge of collapse. The probability is 34 percent."

There was no disagreement.

"Well, it might not mean much, but shall we hear third place too?"

He probably wanted to hear Tormia's country name.

"From third place it's close. Kashan and Iron, showing 21 percent and 19 percent chances of victory respectively."

"Kashan, huh."

"Yes. Uorin's identity is currently unconfirmed, but if she survives until tomorrow morning, there should be a chance for a comeback. Higher probability than Iron."

Albino felt bitter.

"If a country whose empress fled without even changing her underwear is in third place, did Tormia never have hope from the start?"

Lupist said.

"Until things became like this, Kashan was the overwhelming first place. Just falling this far is an enormous event. And Tormia is..."

Unable to hold back, he asked outright.

"What place are we exactly?"

"Sixth place. Jive, Corona, Kashan, Iron, Jincheon, then Tormia. The probability is 16.4 percent."

Albino stroked his beard.

"Anyway, the fact that no country exceeded 50 percent means danger factors remain. Is there room for us to overtake within 12 hours?"

Dante turned the chart.

"Currently, people near the pyramids are coming into Rodenin in groups. If clashes occur with the demonstrators, who knows what will happen. There's also the possibility Gis could be impeached."

"Then Gis would lose voting rights. Even claiming regency, 12 hours is too tight to reverse things."

Also, though it would be quite a gamble, there was the method of using Flu as a last card.

Lupist said.

"So there's still room for recovery."

"Yes. Unpredictable situations can occur anytime. And this is my personal thought, but..."

When Dante trailed off, both men looked up.

"What is it?"

"Extracting meaningful information from a single event is actually easy. It's the realm of intuition and calculation."

"Something's bothering you?"

Dante pointed to the Kaesia Kingdom written on the chart.

"Fermi. This guy definitely knows something. Otherwise, these numbers couldn't come out."

"What's the ranking?"

"12th place. Lower than the southern tribal confederations. The probability of Kaesia becoming world leader is 0.1 percent."

Lupist touched his chin.

"Inhumanly low numbers."

"Yes. No alliances, no movements at all. Too quiet even though the former king was murdered. Either they've given up, or they're aiming for something big. One of the two."

"It'll be the latter."

Albino, who said that, asked again.

"Then what could it be? That big thing."

A knock sounded, then Lilia half-opened the door and peeked her face in.

"Um, do you have a moment?"

Having predicted the Kingdom of Moon's flesh, she was still remaining at the temple caring for Pony.

"What's wrong?"

"His Majesty has regained consciousness."

Dante was also worried about his old classmate's wellbeing, but couldn't spare time right now.

'Pony is no longer a variable.'

Now was the time to focus on the variable called Fermi.

"Got it. I'll come later..."

"Shirone is there too. In His Majesty's room."

Lilia added hurriedly.

Though expressed indirectly, it was clear Shirone had called everyone.

Albino stood up from his chair saying.

"Let's move locations. We'll hear more there. Who knows, maybe that 16.4 percent will move?"

Saying that, he left the room with Lupist, Dante, and Lilia following behind.

Lupist asked.

"You said 16.4 percent would move. Do you think Shirone will become our variable?"

"That kid must have felt something watching this demonstration too. But that's not why. The moment I heard that young lady speak, I suddenly thought this: Fermi has 0.1 percent lies, and Shirone has 99.9 percent truth. My feeling is..."

Albino's eyes intensified.

"Fermi's lies aren't unrelated to Shirone's truth. Those guys pulled something. By methods no one knows."

Perhaps even they themselves didn't know, he thought fleetingly.

'Otherwise...'

In Kaesia sector's secret room, Fermi had just received information that arrived from the mining team.

As High Gear administrators were coding experts, there should be no transmission problems.

'Whether they saw it is unknown... but actually that doesn't matter either.'

'As long as Shirone doesn't access this information. That's why I made a contract with Marsha.'

Not because she prioritized deals, but because she cared so much for Shirone.

With a slightly trembling heart, he unfolded the information to reveal records of things that hadn't happened yet.

Since the download stopped at 83 percent, broken parts existed throughout the records.

Most importantly, he couldn't confirm how Omega 999's end would conclude.

'But it's enough.'

Fermi quickly scanned through the information.

Then his gaze fixed on Amy's death incident that still couldn't be changed.

'As expected, this isn't easy. Amy's life and death is connected to this world's fate.'

After Fisho's funeral, when Shirone came to the Golden Ring, Fermi had told him the truth.

'It was absolute chaos then.'

Though they'd fought countless times since magic school, Fermi realized for the first time then.

That guy could also go crazy and rampage.

'Honestly, I'm not certain. But no matter how I think about it, this is the only way. I can't even calculate the odds. The only basis supporting my judgment is...'

That Shirone approved.

'That guy reached the same conclusion, so he accepted the deal. Someone who hates me so much...'

Said he trusts me.

"Whew."

Fermi returned to the beginning and carefully examined Omega 999's records.

And this time, his eyes lingered on records of someone Fermi loved, not Shirone.

'Seriel.'

It was something that would happen in one hour.
