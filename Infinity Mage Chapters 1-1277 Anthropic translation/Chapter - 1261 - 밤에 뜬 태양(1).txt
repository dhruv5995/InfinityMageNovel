The Sun That Rose at Night (1)

Mika spoke.

Solar change detected. Shirone Sphere completion is 0.3 seconds ahead of schedule.

Shirone's eyes blazed with intensity.

'Got it!'

He didn't know how Ikael had done it, but the end point had been pushed back ever so slightly.

'That's enough.'

Work progress: 99.99 percent.

An artificial structure dozens of times larger than the sun—the greatest in the universe—was about to be born.

"Haa."

It was magnificent.

"Satiel!"

Ikael cried out.

'I'm sorry...'

Those were words he should have said instead.

'I knew.'

Satiel's feelings for Guffin.

It wasn't that he had been particularly bothered by it, nor that he had acted first out of jealous blindness.

'It just...'

It just happened that way.

Fighting frantically, loving, fleeing from Ankera and bearing a child...

'No.'

Perhaps she had remained in a corner of his heart all along, and that's why he had fled all the way here?

Ikael shed tears.

"Satiel."

He should have said it long ago.

"I'm sorry."

I loved you too much as well.

Hehe.

Satiel smiled beautifully.

"Ahh..."

It was the face Ikael remembered—the most virtuous and righteous angel in the White Mirror.

At the end of her dissolution, he seemed to hear her voice.

Take care.

"Ahhhhh."

Leaving behind Ikael, who was pouring out emotions as pure as tears, Satiel departed on her long journey.

From existence to non-existence.

In the process of integrating with the entire universe, Satiel met Shirone.

A name.

It would have been nice to give you one.

Perhaps it was the apologetic gesture that Guffin and Ikael had extended for her sake.

Shirone. What a wonderful name.

Though her physical form had vanished, she embraced the boy fighting against God with her heart.

You can do it.

Shirone felt it.

A special power surging from the microscopic realm that humans cannot observe.

'Here I go!'

As the Shirone Sphere was completed, all information contained in the photons began to reverse.

'God.'

Behind Shirone, who glared at the existence beyond the universe, someone was extending their hand.

Kitra's face shook frantically.

"Beep! Beeeeeep!"

In the 50-50 balance that split the entire universe in half, God's domain was plummeting.

75 percent! 52 percent! 32 percent!

As Shirone's tachyon pushed back God's causality and applied it to reality, humanity regained their hearts.

'Impossible! Impossible! Impossible!'

And Kitra...

'Critical damage detected.'

With a bang as if exploding from within, he flew to the end of the corridor.

"Kek, kek, kek, kek..."

Smoke rose from his completely burned eyes, and strange sounds came from his throat.

He would be scrapped, but Kitra's damage was not God's damage.

Algorithm correction.

God attempted a second change—system modification through learning.

Learning complete.

Why did it fail?

Humans.

God reviewed all logs from the beginning to now where hearts had influenced events.

Cause analysis.

If quantum signals couldn't be processed properly, the system should be changed to quantum-based.

Apocalypse program restart.

Kitra's lips twitched briefly.

"Hu...mans."

The light in his eyes silently went out.

'Goodbye.'

Having bid farewell to Shirone in her heart, Satiel continued her journey toward the end of the universe.

There was no direction.

Just the process of endlessly scattering until existence disappeared.

'Will it feel like sleeping forever?'

No, there would be no subject sleeping that sleep, not even thoughts passing through dreams—perfect nothingness.

Satiel was not afraid.

'It's okay.'

She was moving away from the universe.

'Ah.'

The farther she went, the more clearly she understood things that adorned her final moments.

'In that distant universe... were there stars and moon?'

'Love.'

Does it fit in such an enormous heart?

Infinite nothingness.

Before perfect annihilation where even the concept of 'nothing' didn't exist, Satiel could smile.

'It's okay.'

In that place of nothingness.

'Because Guffin is there.'

Uorin clutched her head.

"Ahhhhh!"

Future poetry visible even with closed eyes was flickering at tremendous speed.

Survival, death, survival, death, survival, death.

'What? What's happening?'

She didn't know.

That Havitz and Kido were fighting with blades right beside her, that fountains of blood were erupting.

'Kill Uorin!'

Also, Havitz couldn't perceive Kido.

'Protect Uorin.'

Kido couldn't perceive Havitz.

The strange triangle created by their double vanishing was turning every second into disaster for them.

"Ugh!"

Kido's mind was confused.

He couldn't perceive the bleeding, but maintaining vanishing itself was hell.

'I feel like throwing up. Why am I doing this? Why do I keep slashing at empty air?'

He didn't know who it was, but probably someone using the same ability.

'I have no choice but to endure to the end.'

At that moment, Havitz charged.

'Kill Uorin! Kill her!'

His sword bounced off the defensive barrier of blades Kido had deployed.

'Why can't I kill her?'

If he couldn't kill Uorin by midnight, his chances of winning 'Truth and Lies' would become zero.

'On the other hand, Wizard still has a chance. Her proposition is either love me or hate me.'

The ways to prove it were to kiss Havitz or break his finger.

'She'll probably break it. The match will be decided in an instant. She must be watching for an opportunity somewhere.'

Considering Wizard's ability—the missing 1 frame—he couldn't let his guard down.

"How annoying."

He didn't know what specter was in front of him.

'Steal my ability?'

There was something that could never be stolen.

'Destiny.'

Havitz canceled his vanishing, closed his eyes, and began moving freely.

"Hihihihi!"

'Havitz!'

Kido's eyes flashed open, and his spear thrust forward at terrifying speed, when—

'Huh?'

Havitz avoided the attack with movements no master could execute and swung his sword.

Kido realized.

'He didn't dodge.'

He simply wasn't where the spear passed.

As Havitz's sword cut deep across Kido's chest, blood fountained out.

The vanishing was released, and Uorin screamed.

"Kido!"

Havitz charged forward, raising his upper body as if ascending, and lifted his long sword before Uorin.

"Keke! Got you!"

Kido ran toward them, but Havitz's sword was already touching Uorin's crown.

'Too late.'

The moment Kido's heart sank—

Dance of Death

Syncopated Concerto.

An afterimage flew in faster than Havitz's sword already cutting into Uorin's flesh.

Thwack!

Following a dull sound, Havitz was slammed into the wall with his neck completely turned around.

Kido was speechless.

"...Huh?"

Natasha of the Gustav 4th Division was somehow blocking Uorin's front.

"Get up."

At her words, he hurriedly turned his head to see Havitz looking this way over his own back.

"Hi... hihihi."

The laughter coming from his 180-degree turned neck gave even Uorin goosebumps.

"Sa, Satan."

The area around his neck was incredibly bulked up, skin torn to reveal raw muscle.

Havitz stood up with mad eyes.

"How did you do it?"

He wondered about Natasha, who had killed him despite his destiny of never dying.

"I saw it."

Vulcan's severed head.

And the special memory contained in those dead eyes—perhaps it was just his imagination.

"You know too, don't you, Havitz?"

He didn't know the name.

Probably erased by some effect, but the feeling that rose like perfume...

Havitz? Havitz? Nolza.

There had been four friends who always called him from in front of his house.

"So? What about it?"

Natasha stepped forward.

"We just wanted to have fun. Vulcan, Sumodo, Zetaro, and me too."

"Aren't you doing that already?"

What am I even saying?

As if there was another personality within his personality, the words to respond came naturally.

It was the same for Natasha.

"But I don't want to kill my friends. You broke the rules. Look at you now. You won't even die."

Havitz slowly turned around.

Then he grabbed his face with both hands and snapped it back into place with a crunching sound.

'My laws don't work on her.'

It was proof that Natasha was also connected.

"It's my choice. Whether I die or not. I'll do whatever I want. I'm sick of playing with you guys."

That was actually what made him angriest.

Natasha said.

"Dance of Death."

Requiem.

Exploding the air with a bang, Natasha charged and pummeled Havitz's body.

Every time bones broke and muscles burst throughout his body, Havitz grew larger.

"Kahahaha! More! Hit me more, you idiot!"

Shedding his human shell and transforming into Satan, he wrapped both arms around the air.

Like a fish caught in a net, Natasha's wrists were seized.

"I told you that won't work."

With a blood-red face showing his teeth, Havitz hurled Natasha.

"You die too!"

At that moment, Wizard rushed in at terrifying speed from an angle Havitz hadn't expected.

'She was aiming for this from the start?'

The Avatar of Musang rising from Wizard's body stuck out its long tongue and writhed.

'Damn it!'

Even knowing it was useless, Havitz put strength into his fingers.

Ultra Space

Infinite Creation.

One frame disappeared from this world.

"Keu..."

What Havitz braced for in the next frame was the feeling of his finger breaking.

Smooch.

What he actually realized was the feeling of Wizard's soft lips touching his mouth.

Even after Wizard landed gracefully, Havitz wore a dazed expression.

'Why?'

Wizard said.

"I won."

Clang. Clang. Clang.

The bell announcing midnight rang from the ground.

Sacred time: 11:52.

With 8 minutes remaining until midnight, Lian and Ymir's fighting spirit blazed completely.

"Good! Good!"

Each punch brought down buildings, each step shook the ground.

Rummmmmble! Rummmble!

The soldiers had already retreated hundreds of meters away, but even that didn't feel safe.

Clump said.

"We should back away a little more."

Though they were already ridiculously far away, no one objected.

'This isn't a battle of this world.'

Landscapes being severed, air expanding like gongs, terrain constantly changing shape...

'It's a battle of war gods.'

As explosions without flames pierced their eardrums, they began slowly widening their perimeter.

'There's nothing shameful or disgraceful about it.'

Meanwhile, in the brawl where neither had clear advantage, Ymir was trembling with excitement.

'Yes, this is it.'

An enemy that won't fall no matter how much you hit them.

Divine Transcendence

Asura Balbaltha.

"Ugh!"

And an enemy that returns far greater impact than what they receive.

"More."

Harder.

His full-power attack grazed Lian's cheek, and the great sword struck his side with a thud.

"Keu!"

Ymir's eyes moistened from the tremendous pain.

"...Hehe."

The feeling of every cell in his body awakening.

'I'm alive.'

I am alive.

Overcome with emotion he couldn't contain, he clenched both fists and opened his jaw to its limit.

"GYAAAAAAAHHHHH!"

The King of Giants was shedding tears.
