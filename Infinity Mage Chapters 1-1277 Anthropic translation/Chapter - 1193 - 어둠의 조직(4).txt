**Organization of Darkness (4)**

Since the vagrants were also being pursued by the three major gangs, they had nothing to hide.

"The largest force is the Desperado organization..."

After explaining the power structure for about ten minutes, he revealed everything from the number of members to the bosses' names.

Eden said, "The bosses are wanted in reality. But how do they keep from running out of food when they're fighting wars every day? The corpses of the dead wouldn't be enough to sustain them."

"I don't know that much. It seems like they get food supplies from somewhere."

The leader pointed toward the ocean.

"Everything around here is garbage, and pollution has spread so much that we can only catch rotten fish. The deep sea doesn't even exist. But strangely, sometimes large ships are anchored there. It seems like they get supplies from there. Actually... it's no exaggeration to say the gang wars are all about controlling this area."

"Ships?"

Since the outer tracks had separated spaces, transportation wasn't needed to go anywhere.

'Organization of Darkness. As expected... someone here is making contact with the administrators.'

The leader continued, "Actually, food is secondary - what they really supply are weapons. They call them machine guns."

"Machine guns?"

"Yeah. They're really strange - they make incredibly loud sounds. You just pull the trigger and..."

Watching him make "rat-tat-tat-tat" sounds with his mouth, Shirone thought of High Gear.

'Firearms.'

Objects that, while not matching the essence of magic, could kill people without any effort required.

They even reduced feelings of guilt.

'When objects change, the philosophy of the era changes too. They're perfect for Melkidu.'

Nade asked, "I get the general situation. But why do you guys keep betraying everyone?"

"I used to be doing well too. Before I lost everything at the gambling den. I snuck in to avoid the guards, but here, if you don't join a gang, you're just food. So I had no choice but to join. I did join, but..."

"But?"

"I ran away because I was too scared. Those guys aren't human. When things go wrong, they just pull the trigger. At first I joined Desperado, but it was too brutal so I went to Red Union. But that place was also full of lunatics. So I went to the Johan Cartel..."

The leader's face turned pale.

"It's just... hell. All three major gangs are hell. Do you understand? I didn't betray them - I escaped. When you switch to another organization, that organization protects you, but now I have nowhere left to go. That's why I'm living here."

"That's even more pathetic."

"Haha!"

Perhaps remembering his days of gang glory, he suddenly straightened his shoulders.

"You'll understand if you see them directly - why I had to run away. I'm warning you, those guys..."

The leader leaned his face toward Nade.

"They're really bad guys."

As if he himself were one of those bad guys, he put force into his eyes, so Nade slapped his cheek.

"Ow! Why did you hit me!"

"You're being ridiculous. What makes you any different? Just moments ago you were trying to rob us."

Nade stood up, brushing off his seat.

"What should we do? Should we start by taking down Desperado? Since they're the biggest gang."

Eden said, "That's good too, but we don't know where Ms. Pena is. Let's go in and assess the situation first."

"True."

Nade said to the vagrant, "You guys should get going. Don't do bad things anymore. Just roll the dice and get out."

"Um..."

The leader approached on his knees.

"I have a good idea - would you consider forming a gang? I'll serve you as my boss."

While machine guns were powerful, they couldn't compare to magic that controlled electricity.

'If I use these guys, taking control of all three major gangs would be nothing. Then I could also...'

Nade crushed his hopes.

"No thanks. We'll handle it ourselves."

"Don't be like that, listen to what I have to say. If you use my information about the three major gangs..."

"I'm warning you."

Nade cut him off.

"Don't let me see you again. We're on a tight schedule, so we're letting you go. Leave quickly."

Since he was destined to scavenge garbage anyway, the leader made his bet here.

"This isn't good. We're guys with nothing to lose too. Can you handle it? From now on, we'll use all kinds of schemes and strategies against you..."

"Why don't you get lost already?"

Electricity entered Nade's eyes.

"Aaaaah!"

The vagrants screamed and twisted their bodies simultaneously, then ran across the beach like they were crawling.

Nade, removing the force from his eyes, said, "These incompetent fools, learning only bad things. They should try blackmail on someone it would actually work on."

While Nade, Iruki, and Eden were also strong, Shirone was humanity's strongest magician.

"Enough. Let's go quickly. I'm hungry."

As Iruki led the way and they followed behind, Eden added one more thing.

"I won't eat meat."

Passing through the garbage heaps and entering the island's interior, the city's sinister landscape greeted them.

Every building bore bullet marks, and some buildings were left half-collapsed.

While armed forces controlled the main roads, vagrants huddled in the alleys.

"Each gang seems to have its own territory to manage. I see Red Union emblems everywhere."

"Right. Some guys have two or three emblems. There must be a lot of types like those vagrants earlier."

"How about over there?"

When they pointed to a sign with neon lights flashing even during the day, his friends agreed.

"Bars are like public facilities for gangs. I hope they sell food too."

"We can't use points here. We need to provide items or equivalent labor."

"Let's go check it out first. We should be able to trade with cheap items."

When they opened the bar's door, gang members with bare chests simultaneously turned their heads.

"What's that?"

The fact that they were new faces in Corcoras and looked young removed any wariness.

'It's my turn to step up.' A Red Union newcomer who had just joined recently pointed his machine gun at the group.

"Hey, what are you guys? What's your affiliation?"

"We have something to ask."

When Shirone spoke directly to the point, the newcomer wickedly curled his lips.

"Kekeke, then you came to the right place. Ask anything. But the price will be a bit high."

He looked at Eden.

"Good, the price I want is..."

"Phew."

Just as Nade was about to step forward, thinking dialogue wouldn't work, a voice came from the second floor.

"Stop."

Red Union's action captain was looking down at the hall with a displeased expression.

"Ah, boss. You're here."

The newcomer greeted respectfully, but murderous intent appeared in the action captain's eyes instead.

"Boss, why..."

"Never mind. Escort them this way. Please come up."

When Shirone's group went up the stairs and entered the room, the newcomer tilted his head in confusion as he returned.

"Why was the boss angry? Ack!" A senior who had been waiting struck the back of his head.

"Senior, why are you doing that?"

"Shut up and sit down and drink. You just used up the greatest luck of your life."

The newcomer asked while rubbing the back of his head, "Do you know them?"

"No. First time seeing their faces. But you should at least know enough not to mess with people who'll screw you over."

"They just seemed like gentle kids."

"Don't look at their faces, look at their eyes. Guys like us do anything to survive. Nothing disgusting or dirty bothers us. Do you know what we call those kind of eyes?"

"I don't know. Gang?"

"Beast eyes."

The senior downed strong liquor in one gulp.

"Murky but sad, cold but with a sense of despair - that's the kind of eyes we have. But those guys are different. Those are the eyes of people who protected something to the end. Not giving up because things are shitty, but guys who broke through and climbed up." The senior smiled bitterly.

"Strays like us need to be careful of eyes like that. Even if we're not afraid of anything in the world, we should fear the world itself, you bastard."

The newcomer turned his head.

"What does that mean?"

The senior kept his mouth firmly shut and only refilled his empty glass with alcohol.

"Please forgive the rudeness."

In the second-floor VIP room, Red Union's action captain poured drinks for Shirone's group.

"This is the finest liquor in the establishment."

"Did someone named Pena come here? Or rather, have you recruited any women recently?"

"Are you police?"

When Shirone's group remained silent, he continued.

"She didn't join Red Union. Also, according to my information network, none of the three major gangs have recruited any women recently. Unless she disguised her gender."

"Hmm, so she's not in the gangs." The action captain said.

"I'll prepare dinner. The boss will come, so please meet with him before you go. We'll host you properly."

They didn't have that kind of time.

"That's fine. There's one more thing I'd like to ask about. Regarding the purchase program."

The action captain smiled.

"I have nothing to tell you about that. Please discuss it with the boss."

That would also be a decent approach, but above all, he was worried about Pena's safety.

'If she's not in the gangs, that means she's on the streets. If she's been hiding for three days already...'

Shirone stood up.

"We'll go back today. We'll visit again."

The action captain, knowing there was no way to stop them, bowed.

"Please do visit. And if I may make one request - please don't think about joining hands with other organizations."

He raised his head.

"I know you're strong. But moths choose fire over life."

He meant they would fight to the death.

"We'll think about it."

Shirone's group, not even pretending to listen, left the uncomfortable drinks and exited the room.

The action captain sat up and lit a cigarette.

"Damn."

A religious message that had been passed down in Corcoras from long ago came to mind.

"Why now of all times?"

Shirone's group walked the streets.

"What happened to Ms. Pena anyway? Maybe she never came in the first place? Because she was scared."

The possibility wasn't entirely absent.

"It's not time to jump to conclusions. If she didn't join the gangs, we should search among the vagrants..."

"You guys!"

A hooded figure grabbed Shirone's arm.

"Eek! You scared me!"

While frowning at the terrible stench, Shirone looked at the face inside the hood.

"Ms. Pena?"

Pena's face turned into a tearful expression.

"Waaah, why were you so late? I thought I was going to die of fear."

"...Are you okay?"

Having been hiding in garbage heaps, she reeked terribly and was covered in grime from head to toe.

"Do I look okay! I couldn't eat anything for three days. I even relieved myself in my clothes."

Nade asked in bewilderment, "Why did you do that? You should have gone to the bathroom."

"What if I got caught? In situations like this, not doing anything is the best policy. If you guys didn't come, I'd die anyway. I didn't move anything except my fingers and toes." It was the survival method of nature's weakest, but being able to execute it was also a form of strength.

"You've been through a lot. Let's go quickly."

"I was so miserable. You have to buy me something delicious. I heard a lot of valuable information too. Right? I can order expensive things, can't I?"

Nade said, "Don't you need to wash up first? You're making even non-existent appetites run away."

"This guy has nothing he won't say to a lady."

When Pena threw off her outer garment, Nade, covered by the cloak, flailed about like a ghost.

"Aaaaah! Why won't this come off!"

"Bahahahaha!"

It was fortunate that Pena was safe.
