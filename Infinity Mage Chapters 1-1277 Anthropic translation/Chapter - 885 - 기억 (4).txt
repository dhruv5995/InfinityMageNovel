Memory (4)

"Emergency! Emergency!"

Past midnight, the demon army's special forces launched a surprise attack on the right flank of the Valkyrie camp.

"Quick! Move quickly!"

Unlike before when they had to cover the entire central continent, the Valkyries' defensive perimeter had narrowed considerably.

Thanks to this, more troops were concentrated than before, but even so, the battle situation was unfavorable.

"Tch! I knew this would happen!"

Tess, who had already prepared for everything, mounted her horse and led her subordinates.

"Tess."

Rian rode up alongside her.

"Don't die."

In a situation where he couldn't fight solely for Tess, that was all Rian could say.

"Don't worry and go. Sweep them away."

The moment Tess finished speaking, Rian changed direction and broke away from the cavalry.

"Hoooooo!"

His muscles twisted as he transformed into a yaksha's body, and stone fragments shot up each time he struck the ground.

"That's incredible."

A cavalry soldier who had been blankly watching the consecutive pillars of dust rising said.

"His stride must be over 20 meters, right?"

It wasn't just that his stride was wide - he was moving his legs as quickly as a horse.

"They say it was originally a giant's ability."

Tess looked at the demon army filling the horizon and drew her three swords.

"Rian will strike first, then we go in. Get ready."

"Yes!"

By the time the cavalry picked up speed, Rian had already approached right in front of the enemy army.

'The feeling is different.'

Though it was just a special forces unit, the momentum was on a completely different level from the armies he'd fought before.

'They're elite troops.'

What was Balkan thinking?

'Doesn't matter.'

Thinking was what strategists did, and the Valkyries also had brilliant minds watching this situation.

"Graaah!"

Rian's nose bridge contorted, and terrifying strength entered both hands gripping his great sword.

Grip strength that would crush the metal if it were an ordinary sword.

But <Idea> received all that power and transmitted an explosive sensation to its master's hand.

"Hyaaaah!"

The demons were torn apart like wool fabric by the shockwave of the great sword falling in a massive arc.

The moon hung in the fan-shaped landscape that opened up.

"Hup!"

From his striking stance, Rian took a step forward and pulled the sword, swinging it horizontally.

Once again the world split apart, and the bodies of the demons in the path of the flash separated.

At that moment, Tess's cavalry arrived.

"Go in! Annihilate them from within!"

Encouraged by Rian's opening attack, the cavalry thrust their spears forward with terrifying force.

"Die! You filthy demons!"

KWAAAAAANG!

The moment dozens of horses flew through the air, the cavalry finally realized.

"N-no way...!"

It was just that Rian was too strong - the level of strength was different from the demons they'd fought until now.

'We'll be isolated at this rate.'

Most of the demons had already pushed the Valkyrie forces back dozens of meters.

"Tess!"

As he cut down demons one by one to clear a path, he could see the cavalry surrounded by enemies.

"Let's retreat for now! At this rate...!"

Sensing killing intent, Rian stopped walking and turned his head toward where Tess was glaring.

"What are you dreaming of, insignificant vermin?"

Standing there was a gray demon with its upper body raised like a mantis and insect legs.

On the left were three thin, sharp arms, and on the right was one abnormally thick arm.

"It's an officer. Everyone be careful."

At Tess's instruction, the cavalry reorganized their formation.

"I am Yun-goe."

He was a brigade commander of the 1st Corps, rated as the strongest in hell's army.

"And I am Dae-seok-sang."

The ground rumbled with heavy footsteps, but the source of the voice was hidden in darkness.

Shortly after, a demon appeared whose rock-like, long face took up half of his body.

Looking at the humans with his large, bulging eyes, he smiled, tearing the corners of his mouth to their limit.

"I'll eat you deliciously."

Simultaneously, Yun-goe moved like wind, infiltrating the cavalry's formation.

"You first."

A massive hand flew toward Tess's face.

"Where are you?"

Natasha's pupils moved to the left.

"Aaaaah!"

Dozens of soldiers standing in her path collapsed with broken necks.

"I asked where?"

The Valkyrie company commander gave orders.

"Catch her! Surround and attack!"

But honestly speaking, he didn't know what was taking down his own troops either.

"It's impossible! We can't locate her position... Gaaak!"

Before the report could finish, a hole appeared in the soldier's chest as if something had pierced through.

"Da-damn it...!"

How can you fight what you can't see?

"C-company commander! Aaaah!"

As if there were multiple enemies, soldiers were collapsing in completely different locations.

"Retreat! Retreat!"

The company commander heard the sound of wind by his ear.

"Grrk!"

The scenery flipped, and when he came to his senses, his body was floating upside down.

'How...?'

One thing was certain: the enemy hadn't killed him, which was why he could think like this.

A woman's voice was heard.

"Where?"

In Natasha's outstretched hand was the back of the upside-down company commander's neck.

When she loosened her grip, he fell head-first and hurriedly flipped over to look up.

"Grrk!"

A woman without eyelids was staring forward.

'That's Natasha.'

As if the battlefield situation didn't matter to her at all, she asked without turning her gaze.

"The strongest person here - where are they right now?"

The company commander realized.

'Assassination mission.'

The Knight of Maha was currently the unit's greatest asset, and regardless of skill level, his location was classified.

"I don't know. How would I know something like that?"

Natasha turned around.

"If you tell me, I'll let you live."

Life was precious to everyone.

"You promise?"

"Yeah. It's so wide that it's hard to find."

"Fine. I'll tell you where the strongest person in this unit is. Right here."

The company commander pointed to himself.

"I'm the strongest soldier! So fight me! You stupid woman! Bwahahaha!"

"...Don't you want to live?"

"Cut the crap! The subordinates you killed are watching from hell! Come at me! Try to kill me!"

Natasha looked around.

"Were they close friends?"

"Dieeeee!"

Just as the company commander raised his sword and charged, Natasha raised her eyebrows and said.

"Sorry."

The moment the sword cut through the air, Natasha's body became hazy and instantly vanished.

"What?"

It seemed faster than the speed of thought, and the company commander's thought processes activated belatedly.

'Combat doll Natasha.'

He had heard rumors that she was the strongest combat weapon, without blood or tears.

'How much do we know about the enemy?'

Perhaps that was the key.

Just before being caught by Yun-goe's hand, Tess twisted her body, took a step, and thrust her three swords.

'The heart!'

The attack hit precisely, but Yun-goe's face remained wickedly smiling.

"Hehe, actually my heart is...!"

Before he could finish speaking, Yun-goe's body swayed and separated in half at the waist.

Through the split flesh, Rian stood there.

"What about your heart?"

"Graaaah!"

At the scream, he turned to see Dae-seok-sang lifting and chewing a soldier along with his horse.

Crunch, crunch.

Biting off small pieces with his front teeth and swallowing, he held the soldier's lower half in his mouth and grinned.

"Delicious."

The soldier's lower body, still with living nerves, could be seen writhing on its own.

Just as Rian and Tess, feeling rage, were about to charge together, Dae-seok-sang's body swelled up.

"Huh?"

PWOOOONG!

"Gaah!"

Dae-seok-sang's torso was pierced, and a strong wind blew through the gap as an afterimage flickered.

"Oops."

Natasha, who had hastily reduced her speed, stuck out her tongue while maintaining her punching stance.

"It was too dark to see."

Taking out a brigade commander in one hit wasn't surprising compared to the speed she'd shown before.

"Rian, that woman..."

Just as Tess was about to convey something, Natasha, who had made eye contact with Rian, raised her hand high.

"Hi there!"

A skeletal apparition in a black robe emerged from her body, and together they vanished.

'Damn it!'

Faced with extreme speed, Rian gave up thinking and blocked with his great sword.

In a split second, Natasha spun seven and a half times and struck the flat side of the sword with her foot.

Before the recognition could reach his brain, Rian's arms bent and struck his chest...

"Gaaah!"

By the moment he felt the breath-stopping impact, he had already been knocked back dozens of meters.

"Huh?"

Tess, who had been staring forward obliviously, belatedly turned her head.

Natasha stood where Rian had been.

'What just happened?'

It was clear she wasn't at a level Tess could handle, but Natasha wasn't interested.

"You blocked it."

Whether he knew and blocked it or blocked it by instinct, the fact was he had reacted to her speed.

"Ho, I see."

Havitz's face suddenly appeared from behind Natasha's shoulder.

"This should be interesting, shouldn't it, Natasha?"

Havitz's voice was actually resonating, and his body truly existed in this space.

It was just that no one could perceive it.

"Shall we check one more time?"

Unaware that Havitz was beside her, Natasha kicked off the ground and charged at Rian.

"Rian!"

As Natasha disappeared before her eyes, Tess bit her lip and prepared to give chase.

"You can't go. That human needs to play with Natasha."

Havitz blocked Tess's path and pressed her solar plexus.

"Wait just a little. I'll go."

Unable to advance even one step, Tess felt no sense of wrongness.

Because for her, this was a non-event.

"Pretty face. Is she your lover?"

Havitz's face came right up to Tess's nose, but nothing entered her brain.

"Captain! We need to retreat!"

The cavalry soldiers saw Tess walking in place as if blocked by something.

But no one thought it strange.

"We've already been pushed back! We need to leave now!"

When her aide grabbed her shoulder, Tess gave up chasing Rian and clicked her tongue as she turned around.

"Fine! Follow me!"

Havitz watched this scene briefly, then drew his sword and approached the aide.

"That won't do."

Grabbing the aide's head and pulling it down, he bent the man's waist and placed the sword against the back of his neck.

"Scritch, scratch, scritch, scratch."

Even as he slowly scraped up and down to cut the neck, the aide continued conversing normally.

"We need to break through at least 300 meters. First, let's gather our forces..."

"Scritch, scratch, scritch, scratch."

Finally the blade broke through and the aide's head fell.

"Stea! Stea!"

Killing intent appeared in Tess's eyes at her subordinate's death, but there was no target for her rage.

"You bastards!"

Cause and effect were merely delusions of the brain.

After all, in dreams, didn't the human brain fail to resolve any contradictions in causality normally?

"What pleasant dreams you're having."

Havitz leisurely walked around Tess, killing soldiers as he saw them.

Even as limbs were severed, their brains accepted the current situation as normal...

"Hmm."

Growing bored with the slaughter, Havitz wiped his sword on a corpse and looked toward Rian.

"I should finish this quickly."

Tess bumped into his back.
