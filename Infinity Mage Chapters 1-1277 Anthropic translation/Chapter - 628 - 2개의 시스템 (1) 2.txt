[628] Two Systems (1)

Iruki calculated the detonation equation while aiming at the Fire Strike that was rapidly increasing in size.

'Nuclear Fusion!'

Fire Strike's body swelled like a balloon before a powerful explosion erupted.

"Urgh!"

The shock of anti-magic rushed into the minds of all participants who had already taken cover.

'We avoided it, but...'

The power was so immense that the 2000th system registered an attack judgment across the entire colosseum.

"You want to see this through to the end, is that it?"

A chaotic melee erupted from the massive explosion, with everyone attacking each other, yet Fermi remained as relaxed as ever throughout it all.

'This is boringly leisurely.'

Having deliberately held himself back at the final hurdle of graduation every year, releasing his limits now actually felt more comfortable.

'Wait, if I just take out 16 people, I graduate, right?'

Why were the other students making such a fuss about something so easy?

Blue lightning flickered before Fermi's eyes as Licon approached with spark magic and swung his hand.

Fermi created distance with remarkable reflexes, blowing on his singed bangs as he spoke.

"Isn't this too early? If you fight me, graduation will be out of reach."

Sona's Hersy approached from Fermi's side.

"That's your strategy."

It was natural for participants to avoid direct confrontation with Fermi, who had dominated graduation exams until now.

"But your era is over. If we pressure you, everyone will attack you."

'How annoying.'

Hersy's analysis was accurate, and Fermi, struck at his weak point, smiled with fake warmth.

"Cut me some slack. We have history, don't we?"

"Nonsense. Do such emotions even exist in you?"

As Hersy activated Sona and Licon pulled rubber tights over his entire face, Fermi's shoulders trembled.

"Hehe. Hehehehe."

"Stop putting on airs. All that's left for you is a miserable end."

The laughter stopped abruptly.

"Pathetic fools."

Fermi's face, drained of emotion, was so cold it could hardly be called human.

"Kill him!"

Hersy shouted with chills running down his spine, and Licon charged at Fermi while drawing up electricity.

'Magma Stream.'

The ground where Fermi pointed his palm rapidly melted, and an enormous amount of magma erupted.

"That's advanced fusion magic."

Combining atmospheric and flame elements required veteran-level skill beyond just magical ability.

"An irregular. Buying experience with money."

The massive amount of magma clumped together in the sky before pouring down toward where Hersy and Licon stood.

"Dodge!"

As the lava that crashed into the ground spread rapidly and engulfed the entire colosseum, everyone flew up into the sky.

Between Shirone and Fermi—the two systems controlling the graduation exam situation—the participants' minds grew complicated.

'Which side should I join?'

Canis didn't hesitate.

"We attack Shirone."

Harvest spread his giant palm.

"Hehe, we have to get revenge for Arcane, don't we?"

Arin thought it was dangerous.

"Canis, fighting Shirone right now..."

"I know what you want to say. I'm stubborn and don't have good judgment."

"That's not what I meant. Why do you keep putting yourself down?"

This side of Canis hurt her heart the most.

"That's exactly why I'm fighting. If I back down here... I feel like I won't be satisfied with anything I do going forward."

Looking at Canis's swamp with stagnant water rippling, Arin ultimately had no choice but to yield.

"Alright, let's go. This is our fight."

As always, Harvest took the role of vanguard.

"Kahaha! We're here, Shirone!"

Tension flashed in Shirone's eyes as he confirmed Canis.

'As expected of Canis.'

A magician who had honed magic solely for combat, and a practitioner whose mental fortitude rivaled the top of the graduating class.

"This is a revenge match, Shirone."

"Bring it on."

Photon Cannon and the authority of darkness clashed head-on.

As neither side yielded and the contrast of black and white became clear, the scouts muttered in surprise.

"How is that possible?"

Most magic was overpowered against dark magic, but the single weakness of being vulnerable to light covered all its advantages.

'My darkness defeats light.'

The Reversal of Light and Dark Avatars.

As Heaven's Omniscience, which had once led Arcane to become an Archmage long ago, was equipped, the forces of darkness began to push back the light.

"Kahaha! Yes, this is it!"

Harvest's body twisted like a pretzel as he roared with arms spread, then transformed into a sharp spear and charged.

Pierce through, Harvest!

Countless Shirones existing simultaneously all cast Photon Cannon at once, but the shadow spear didn't even budge.

"It's devouring the light. That number 12 has tremendous mental fortitude."

Elizabeth searched Canis's records.

"He's a disciple of Viltor Arcane. He also displayed exceptional mental fortitude. He was just as stubborn too."

If mental fortitude was the power that gained advantage in compatibility, there would be no one like Arcane, who had reached Archmage with dark magic.

"Certainly, battles of compatibility are separate from raw power. It's a fight of who can enforce their will."

"This time I win, Shirone!"

The more Canis concentrated, the faster Harvest moved as a shadow spear.

"No, Canis."

Shirone's movement stopped, and the countless Shirones overlapping in Force Dimension evaporated and disappeared.

"I will not lose to anyone."

Lowering his center of gravity and extending his right hand backward, dozens of Shirones began overlapping while showing trembling afterimages.

'Focus all events on one coordinate.'

Shirone's body trembled as if an earthquake had occurred, and a Photon Cannon formed beyond his palm.

"That's exactly it."

Miro pointed to the sky with her index finger.

"Extremes meet at the summit."

The ability to carve time into space had something in common with the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara's avatar technique.

The difference was that Shirone's Quantum Superposition overlapped entire events, and the magic concentrated at one coordinate expanded into a massive sphere.

Quantum Superposition—128-fold overlap.

Power equivalent to 128 Shirones simultaneously throwing Photon Cannons was manifested as a 2-meter diameter flash of light that extended toward Harvest.

"Take it, Harvest!"

"Kieeeee!"

The shadow spear extended sharp thorns backward while rotating, and the massive flash completely engulfed it.

Countless gazes watched the collision of light and darkness.

Ringing.

"Huh?"

A beeping sound seemed to connect both eardrums.

Vision was lost, and a moment later came the realization that sensation had disappeared from the entire body.

"...Canis!"

Arin's voice came from high in the sky.

'What? Why is the sound coming from above?'

Trying to trace his memory, but from the moment Harvest collided with the Photon Cannon, his thoughts had been paralyzed as if his brain had fallen out of his body.

'Where am I right now?'

He tried shaking his face, but wasn't certain if his body was actually responding.

Fortunately, his vision slowly returned after a while.

It was only after more time had passed that he was certain he had collapsed in the middle of the lava field created from cooled magma.

'I crashed? Me? Why?'

"Canis! Get away!"

The moment Arin's voice rang clearly, a flash of light crashed down from the sky.

"Urgh!"

Canis bolted upright, and Harvest appeared in front of him to block the Photon Cannon with his body.

"Uaaaah!"

As all his nerves awakened, realistic pain flooded in.

'This can't be.'

Conversely, this meant the shock he'd received before losing consciousness hadn't been realistic at all.

Canis, are you okay?

Harvest's signal came through the mental channel.

What happened?

I couldn't pierce through. I was overwhelmed in mental fortitude. I couldn't move because you lost consciousness.

"I was... overwhelmed?"

Even after offsetting the elemental compatibility by decoding the Scripture of Light and Darkness, he had been completely defeated.

"Now's our chance! Attack Shirone!"

The participants who had been waiting for an opportunity since Canis made his move all rushed in simultaneously.

Even as Screamer, Konger, and Frings coordinated their attacks and Arin's mental assault was added, Shirone's eyes only became clearer.

"A magician capable of responding to all variables?"

Though they each took pride in their specialties, Shirone faced them all one-on-one without being pushed back.

Elizabeth spoke in a trembling voice.

"His mental power is recovering. It's already passed 30 percent. It's a runner's high."

Light flashed in Shirone's eyes.

'Immortal Function!'

Mental power rushing in from the infinite realm further enhanced his concentration, and Force Dimension's efficiency soared.

"36 percent! 40 percent! It keeps recovering!"

Ataraxia, Elysion, Sibulsangpokmaek, Immortal Function—everything that comprised Shirone was circulating.

"...A perfect system?"

Even while caught up in enemy attacks, Shirone's mind was becoming clearer.

'This is strange.'

Though he couldn't analyze it logically, all the movements of his opponents felt as if they were unrelated to his own situation.

'I don't feel like I'll lose. I don't think it's dangerous.'

"His head has completely opened up."

Albino stroked his chin and muttered, while Miro's eyes lit up as if she'd discovered a gem.

"He's started hearing his heartbeat."

Foltar looked back as if seeking explanation, but Miro's eyes saw only Shirone's fluid movements.

'Time perceived by the brain is divided by the heart. That is the true nature of rhythm.'

Therefore, one who can hear their heartbeat...

"Can divide all time into their own rhythm."

'Damn it! I just need one good hit to land...!'

Screamer pressed Shirone with all his might, but even using every technique at his disposal, he couldn't touch a single hair.

He had been trapped in Shirone's rhythm.

"Please just get hit!"

As Screamer's body created afterimages while charging fiercely, Shirone's rhythm divided even more precisely.

'I dodge here.'

The fist grazed past with perfect timing, and the syncopation that divided the middle of that beat became a new downbeat, further subdividing time.

"Uoooooh!"

No matter how fast Screamer's movements became, he was just a puppet already trapped in Shirone's rhythm.

"Not a chance."

Baikal said.

"Even a one-hit-kill technique is useless if it doesn't connect."

The feeling of a lifetime of martial arts training being neutralized was the worst humiliation in Screamer's life.

"This can't be! How can not a single hit land...!"

The other participants were also pressing Shirone with violent magic, but all that time came to Shirone as individual events divided separately.

'Ah, I see. I am...'

Shirone's movements in his trance-like state were like dancing, and being art rather than technique, there could be no waste.

"To dance this brief, single moment..."

Albino realized what kind of life Shirone had lived.

"Most of his lifetime had to be filled with experiences of pain."

Miro let out.

"...A privilege only he can enjoy."

"I am exactly...!"

The light of conviction exploded in Shirone's mind.

"The strongest!"

Quantum Superposition—240-fold overlap.

Ddddddddd!

Following Shirone as he twisted his body, 239 other Shirones concentrated Photon Cannons at one coordinate.

In that state, he swung his arm and a massive flash extended out, striking Screamer's abdomen.

"Guhk!"

With a shock like an explosion in his brain, Screamer's eyes bulged as if they would pop out, his consciousness already gone.

Participant number 10 has been eliminated from the 2000th system.

The participants turned their heads with pale faces, feeling chills at Screamer's sprawled form.

"The strongest?"

Though it was hard to believe such words came from his humble personality, the momentum of dozens of Shirones charging was unstoppable.

"Yes. This is your festival, Shirone."

Miro saw that he had earned that right.

"Run wild like a crazy colt."
