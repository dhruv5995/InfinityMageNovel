What Guffin Left Behind (4)

Signals transmitted in real-time from around the world were sucked toward the Holy War's command headquarters.

"General! The signals keep comingâ€”"

"Shh."

The commander put his hand to his lips, crossing two fingers to indicate there was no need to report on this matter.

"Ah...?"

When the messenger looked around the command control room, a massive golden panel was spread out before Iruki.

Goldbird continued infiltrating the panel, updating countless records.

'Arnold Lampa.'

True to his reputation as the world's greatest information mage, he was showing planetary-level activity range.

'According to this information...'

Demons that appeared to be upper legion commander-level were being discovered around the world.

In other words, the demon elite were not in the central continent.

'Is it possible to be this cautious? If they've seen through the Holy War's operation... no, that can't be.'

Therefore, this wasn't normal judgment.

'Something is happening within hell's army. Internal strife, or the emergence of a rival.'

That's when humans become stubborn.

'Anyway, the demon elite are not in the central continent. What they've withdrawn are probably the upper legion commanders and their subordinate units.'

Iruki's expression grew serious.

'Even if we detonate the elemental bomb, the demon elite won't take damage. Instead, we'll lose Bashka and millions of people will die.'

The commander who checked the panel information asked.

"General, what should we do?"

"Proceed as planned."

The decision was so quick that the commander hesitated, unable to answer.

"We're going ahead?"

Iruki rested his chin on his hand.

'Withdrawing the elite cannot be a strategy to gain victory. Therefore, this is psychological warfare.'

Literal shaking.

'In other words, currently Balkan, whether by choice or force, is not in a state where he can make decisions himself. That's why he's passed the choice to me. I can feel his intention to somehow create new variables to overcome his situation within the army.'

Iruki, having organized his thoughts, spoke again.

"We proceed as planned."

Balkan's strategy actually resulted in strengthening Iruki's psychology.

'This is actually better. The probability of demons voluntarily changing their movement routes has disappeared.'

It was clear.

'The remaining variable is...'

Light flashed in Iruki's eyes as he examined the map.

Even after fully accepting the last record Guffin left behind, Shirone kept his eyes closed.

Since he felt it through his 11 senses, there was no confusion, but he still wanted to savor the afterglow a little longer.

'Guffin. Ikael. Gaians.'

He was not alone.

"So... that's how it was connected."

A god with a heart.

What Guffin, who denied the cold world, left in this world when he departed from the photon system...

"Messiah."

Shirone finally understood the reason for his existence.

"Do you feel a sense of mission?"

Karatorsa asked.

"No. I'm still Shirone. Nothing should change, and nothing must change."

"Then what did you feel?"

"Love."

Shirone looked up at the ceiling.

"The movement of all atoms that began from the beginning. The countless hearts born within that created the current me. I want to continue that great love."

'In the end, what he chose was love.'

The corners of Karatorsa's mouth curved up slightly.

'Rest assured, Guffin. Your child has grown up splendidly.'

Karatorsa, having laid down all burdens, felt his life extinguishing and took a comfortable position.

"Go. From now on, the 12 Apostles will help you."

The log of the Akashic Records.

For Karatorsa, who had literally shouldered the entire universe, extinction was the greatest rest.

This time, even Shirone paid his respects.

"Thank you for all your hard work."

After Guffin reset the world, Ankera tried to change history by every possible means.

The dragons shared the log of their core, Karatorsa, and fought against angels for eons.

'So many dragons have disappeared.'

Excluding the 12 Apostles, there were hardly any dragons left in this world.

'No, the dragons that remained became the 12 Apostles.'

What they protected was a pure world not swayed by any specific being's will.

"Until now, the dragon race has shared thoughts through the core called Mudeungryongmi. The dragon network. But now that I'm disappearing, that network will also be severed."

Karatorsa chuckled.

"They're all eccentric fellows, so I'm worried, but with you as Ultima, there should be no problem. Lead them well."

"I have nothing to teach."

The 12 Apostles now waiting for Shirone were the strongest dragons who hadn't yielded even to the archangels' force.

"You don't need to teach. They will learn. Following your footsteps like that..."

As Karatorsa slowly closed his eyes, the age of dragons flashed through his mind.

"Can we also be connected?"

The Mudeungryong's body rapidly lost vitality, then disappeared emitting bright light.

Shirone bowed his head in mourning.

"Thank you."

Time was short.

It wouldn't be proper to feel sadness for one who had completed the most difficult life and departed.

"Whew!"

As Shirone took a deep breath, Miracle Stream began to thickly settle around him.

The deep mountain scenery was decomposed into signals, and with one step he leaped over massive mountain ranges.

The 12 Apostles were waiting at his destination.

"We greet the Messiah."

As Blitz knelt, the 11 other apostles performed the same action.

Though the core called Mudeungryongmi had disappeared, no one showed sad emotions.

'The strongest dragons.'

Shirone had already felt everything about the 12 Apostles through his 11 senses via Omega.

But when he observed them with his five senses, especially sight alone, he felt something different.

"Karatorsa has entered eternal sleep."

"We know."

Now that the network's database had disappeared, the 12 Apostles had to rely on individual judgment.

"That's why the Messiah must lead us. We will follow you."

It was a realm of faith, not information.

"Alright."

As Shirone examined the faces of the 12 Apostles, they all raised their heads with burning will.

They all hoped to be called upon.

'Ugh...'

He knew about the competitive spirit that had operated among the 12 Apostles even when Mudeungryong existed.

In a state of shared thoughts, the way to prove individual worth was to be chosen by the core.

'Who should I call first?'

The pointless worry Karatorsa used to have was now Shirone's burden.

'First, Phaethon the Light Dragon.'

Though a boy with delicate features, he was known to be the most violent among the 12 Apostles.

'Infercus the Fire Dragon.'

Though he had been a simulation model for graduation exams, Shirone subtly avoided his gaze.

'Scary.'

With half his head shaved and lip piercings, it was difficult to approach him.

'Honestly, the apostle I'm most curious about is... Asriker the White Dragon.'

The moment he saw her sitting demurely in the red skirt worn by Eastern shrine maidens.

'Huh? Huh?'

Shirone was entranced.

Asriker, who wielded soul information among dragons, had an appearance that overwhelmed all forms in the world.

'The most beautiful signal in the universe.'

It wasn't a concept of perfection.

It was extreme attraction transcending individuality, a charm that satisfied everyone's ideals.

Feeling Shirone's gaze, Asriker gently raised her head and smiled.

Feelings of goodwill.

Just the fact that she smiled sent tremendous ripples through Shirone's heart.

'This is dangerous. Really dangerous.'

At the most pleasurable signal perceivable by sight, his heart raced and his mind grew hazy.

Receiving attention from the Messiah, Asriker sent an even gentler gaze.

'Ugh!'

With red alerts going off in his head, Shirone immediately activated the Ultima System.

The extreme attraction information composing Asriker was decomposed into minimal units, stopping the emotional turbulence.

"Phew."

Blitz's eyes lit up.

'To suppress the White Dragon's trait so quickly. As expected of the Messiah, the strongest mind in the universe?'

The 12 Apostles wore satisfied expressions.

'Hmph, where does she get off with beauty tactics?'

Asriker nodded slightly in acknowledgment, suppressing her desire to be called upon.

Shirone looked for another apostle.

'Ah, that man is...'

Chaos the Water Dragon.

The scene of him rising with thousands of tons of water on Galliant Island was vivid in his mind.

A dragon who had managed world time by moving across three oceans over ten years.

Shirone made his decision.

"Come to think of it, we've met before."

That explanation was sufficient, and Chaos jumped up, leaving the apostles' formation.

'Tch! This can't be helped.'

Chaos, with his calm impression, had blue hair flowing to his ankles and unusually moved with his eyes closed.

'Closed eyes and open eyes.'

In Ultima's history, Chaos appears as a dragon with two personalities.

When his eyes are closed, he has a calm personality like a windless zone, but once he opens his eyes...

Chaos bowed his head.

"Yes. I was quite rude back then. Karatorsa had issued an approach prohibition order."

It was to protect time.

"No. Thanks to that, I could make wonderful memories. It was truly a beautiful sight."

He missed Jis, Canis, Arin, and his friends.

"Ahem."

As Poine the Poison Dragon cleared her throat and stood up, the other apostles' eyes narrowed.

'The Messiah hasn't even given orders yet. Always so arrogant...'

Regardless, she walked forward with her staff and politely greeted him.

"I greet the Messiah. I am Poine the Poison Dragon."

"Yes, nice to meet you."

When Shirone bowed back, Poine's eyes lit up with interest.

'Oh?'

Someone who had lived through all of Omega's history had no reason to revere anyone.

Indeed, Shirone also didn't feel the awe that ordinary humans would have toward Poine.

'Still, she's like a grandmother.'

However, no matter how much he had realized, he resolved not to forget what was important to humans.

Perhaps that was what it meant to be a god with a heart.

"Hoho, as expected, my prediction wasn't wrong. You'll have many things to do ahead. Use us like hands and feet, and if you need anything, command me."

Fire entered the eyes of the 11 apostles.

'Has she gone senile!'

There was nothing decided yet about leadership after Karatorsa's disappearance.

'Where does she get off trying to take shortcuts!'

Though she had thrown down the gauntlet with her elderly woman image, Shirone wasn't easy either.

'Really can't let my guard down.'

Karatorsa had utilized the competitive structure of the 12 Apostles, and now it was Shirone's turn.

"Yes, I'll gradually assign work. I'll need to think about a representative for the 12 Apostles too."

Poine was rather pleased.

"Naturally, we'll only follow the Messiah's will. That's our reason for existence."

"About that."

Shirone looked around at everyone.

"We don't have much time, so I'd like to hear the situation first. I haven't obtained current logs. Could you tell me how the battlefield situation is developing?"

The apostles who hadn't been called yet simultaneously raised their hands and shouted.

"I'll tell you!"

"...Haha."

Meeting their gazes burning with passion, Shirone let out an awkward laugh.
