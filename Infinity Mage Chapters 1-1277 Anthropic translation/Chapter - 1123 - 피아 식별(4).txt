Friend or Foe Identification (4)

After finishing his meal with Iron and the Arachne royalty, Gis received his report in his room.

"The angels left Delta?"

"Yes. Satiel ignored even the duty clause promised with Jive and departed leading his forces."

"Hmm, that prideful angel?"

For demons it might be different, but for angels, contracts are far more powerful than humans think.

"Yes. And..."

The aide hesitated before speaking.

"It appears Sirone followed after them as well. Also, seismic waves were detected at the Jive border."

The situation roughly came into focus.

"Ikael must have found something. Let it slide appropriately. If we nitpick everything, there won't be anyone left to work with."

"Other countries might talk about this."

"It didn't happen at the temple, so spin it that way. You're being stupid."

"Understood. And..."

The aide pulled out a newspaper.

It was a daily newspaper distributed throughout Jive, with significant domestic influence.

"A follow-up article came out. Information about last night's banquet seems to have leaked."

"What?"

Gis, who was changing into fresh clothes, stopped buttoning his shirt and snatched the newspaper.

Under the title "Exposing the Temple's Corruption," he saw the byline of a reporter named Meikle.

"This guy again?"

"He's a genius who graduated from the Royal Political Academy. He's been writing articles critical of the royalty for some time."

"This has become troublesome in many ways. Those Arachne bastards, were they this sloppy? This is why you shouldn't mess around with cheap goods."

"What should we do?"

"Try bribing him with money, and if that doesn't work, bribe him with even more money. What was it, didn't his son have some illness?"

"He's hospitalized with congenital heart defects. He's been receiving treatment at the hospital for two years now."

"His condition?"

"I heard he's been improving considerably."

Gis, who had been buttoning his last button, suddenly stopped and turned his head.

"Hey, aide."

"Yes, Your Highness."

"Do you have children?"

Since he was asking something he obviously already knew, the aide answered with a puzzled expression.

"Yes. My eldest daughter will be starting school soon. My second child turned four this year."

"If, hypothetically, your child had such an illness, how do you think you'd feel?"

"I'd feel terrible. I imagine it would feel like my heart was being torn apart."

Gis's eyes filled with intensity, then he swung his arm with all his might and slapped the aide's cheek.

The aide tumbled sideways, and Gis's foot flew into his abdomen.

"You know that and you handle work like this?"

"I'm sorry!"

"When a child is sick, does the parent's heart tear apart or not? It tears apart, right? So what should you do?"

Gis's foot repeatedly flew into the crouched aide's ribs.

"You should torment the child more! Beat him half to death! Whether you bribe the doctors or strangle him, you need to make him gasp for breath!"

Gis picked up the nameplate from Havitz's desk and struck the aide with it.

"Is your head filled with nothing but shit? Doesn't your brain work that way? Go right now and turn everything upside down!"

"Please forgive me!"

Even while being beaten until he bled, the aide couldn't bring himself to say he would do it.

'How can a person do such a thing?'

Living as a politician, he had committed countless corruptions, but there were lines that couldn't be crossed.

'A child suffering from high fever every day, a child who can't even breathe without medicineâ€”'

When the aide stubbornly endured, Gis lowered the nameplate and panted.

'Look at this bastard?'

It seemed like he planned to just take a few beatings and be done with it.

"Hey, get up."

"Yes, yes!"

Even in his dazed state, the aide jumped to his feet and brushed the dust off his clothes.

"You think you can do politics like that? Are you going to spend your whole life just cleaning up after me? Is that all you amount to as a man?"

"No."

"I donate to foundations too. Do you know how many patients I've saved? Do you think your pathetic conscience helps this society?"

The aide bit his lips.

"The state takes care of children for times like this. You're smart, aren't you? Why do you keep projecting your life onto other people's children?"

Gis placed his hand on the aide's shoulder.

"Or what? Do you need your own child to get that sick before you understand what reality is?"

The aide's eyes shook with shock.

"Hng."

Soon his expression turned tearful, and he prostrated himself on the floor, clinging to Gis's legs.

"I'm sorry! I really can't do it! Your Highness! Please spare me just this once!"

His hands trembled with fear.

'He's a monster. This man is a monster.'

In a world where everyone desires higher positions, what does it mean to reach the top?

Gis dropped the nameplate.

"This is really driving me crazy."

He wanted to beat him to death right now, but utility took priority over emotion.

"Fine. Get up. You pathetic fool."

"I'm sorry. Thank you. I will serve with complete loyalty. Thank you, Your Highness!"

Gis patted his back.

"I was just speaking hypothetically. You seem to have misunderstood, but you don't necessarily have to get your own hands bloody."

"Yes?"

Seeing the aide blinking with a nosebleed, Gis felt his anger rise.

"If you can't do it, get someone else to. What do you think thugs are for? Find some stupid bastard and roast him nice and golden with money. You know what I mean? You know how to do it."

"Ah... yes."

Gis gestured with his chin.

"What are you standing around for? If you understand, go handle it quickly! Do I have to spoon-feed you everything?"

"No! I'll do it right away!"

After the aide rushed out, Gis changed out of his blood-stained clothes into fresh ones.

"Always getting full bellies and nothing else. We need to work in sync to get anything done. So annoying."

As he put on his tie and went to the mirror, Havitz appeared reflected behind him.

"Isn't there anyone smart around? Other kingdoms are full of sharp people. I have to do everything myself."

Havitz yawned lazily.

"How boring."

Wherever he went in the human world, whatever mind he read, it was all nauseating now.

"Still, I got a hint."

Even as Havitz opened the door and left, Gis couldn't perceive Satan.

"By the way..."

His expression became serious.

'Which kid snitched? Is it a trap? No, Arachne doesn't have that kind of guts.'

Thinking he'd have to restrain his indulgences for a while.

"Damn it..."

A curse naturally slipped out.

Tormia District.

Upon learning that Sirone had left Delta, Rufist assembled the leadership.

With Albino and Pony included, Rufist threw a newspaper onto the table.

"Today's daily newspaper. Published in the Kingdom of Jive. The reason it wasn't in the morning edition was probably to avoid censorship."

Flu spread out the newspaper.

"I saw it before coming here too. It's still just suspicion, but Jive is the host country for the temple. Won't this damage Gis's position?"

"There won't be much impact. With Gis's level of power and money, crippling one person is nothing."

Albino stroked his beard.

"Still, it will restrict his actions. He'll be cautious about attending banquets too. Who's the informant?"

"We don't know yet. It's probably not a trap. Arachne's honey traps aren't that crude."

Flu asked.

"Then why did they inform?"

"It's human affairs, so something must have happened that night. Once people lose their minds, they'll do anything."

"So? Why did you call us?"

Rufist spoke up.

"I'd like to use this incident. Personally, it seems like a hint."

"You want to bury it politically. That's more peaceful than assassination. But how?"

"As a result, Arachne's honey trap failed. But Gis is a beast-like character. Since he can't attend banquets, he must be seething inside. Maybe we can exploit that gap."

Albino said.

"Are you saying that now Tormia could also use a honey trap?"

"Yes. Gis will be extremely cautious. But if someone capable of breaking through that wariness approaches him? Then it becomes interesting."

Flu asked.

"Who is this person?"

When Rufist and Albino silently turned their heads, she pointed to herself.

"Me?"

"If you don't want to, just say so."

"No. I acknowledge it's a good strategy. But I've never been trained in honey traps. Plus, I'm not particularly beautiful."

"Don't underestimate yourself. You're more than adequate. I made this decision considering your situational judgment and response abilities."

Albino said.

"Most importantly, the reason this would be effective is that Gis is in a quite anxious state. Safety first. A secret meeting with Tormia Magic Association's secretary-general would be sweet bait, wouldn't it?"

"Won't he avoid it entirely?"

"Testosterone is powerful. Apart from scientific theory, history proves it. Of course, it depends on how much trust you can build with Gis, but there's definitely a chance of success."

"Hmm."

As Flu ran simulations, Albino looked back at Rufist.

"...So why now?"

"Sirone would oppose this. It would go as far as breaking the alliance. But we still need Yahweh. This agenda must proceed secretly."

Rufist asked again.

"Your answer?"

Flu's eyes settled calmly.

Havitz strolled through downtown Jive.

"Lots of people."

Being the temple's host country seemed to be a source of pride, with events being held daily.

'Well, finding her is no trouble at all.'

Gis's daughter, addicted to luxury and gambling. Her mental voice was outstanding even in the crowd.

Entering the casino, she was shouting.

"Good! Bet! 200,000 gold!"

Holding a drugged drink, she was clearly not in her right mind even without the divine frequency.

Havitz drew his sword.

"Gis's daughter."

If he destroyed the child of someone who drove others to kill other people's children, what reaction would he show?

'I'm curious about that sound.'

It wouldn't be enough to drive him crazy, but it would provide some amusement during the boring temple period.

'This is why I need History Search.'

Simply killing and tormenting couldn't collect the most extreme sounds.

No one noticed him approaching the casino table with his long sword.

'Vanishing.'

The moment he stabbed Rebecca, each nation at the temple would point to Havitz, but...

"This isn't the temple."

Repaying Gis with his own logic was also part of his amusement.

"Good, good! This time 300,000! I'm really going to eat well!"

Havitz approached from behind Rebecca, glanced sideways for a moment, then raised his long sword.

'Should I cut the arm first?'

At that moment, realizing something from the scene before him, he widened his eyes and turned around.

A seven-year-old child was standing there.

"Are you Gustav Havitz, the ultimate evil of this era?"

Havitz, mouth agape in bewilderment, looked left and right alternately, then pointed to himself.

"You can see me?"

"I will kill you now."

He eavesdropped on the child's mind with the divine frequency, but felt no murderous intent.

Only one piece of information.

"Wena... Wizard?"

Only her name pulsed.
