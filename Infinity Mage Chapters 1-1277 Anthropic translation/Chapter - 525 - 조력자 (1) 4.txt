[525] The Helper (1)

A family ranked within the top 20 of the Tormia Kingdom's business hierarchy could be said to possess a trading company recognized even across the continent.

For example, Dante's Airhan family had established Airhan Shipping, a massive trading company ranked 14th in the business hierarchy that built a transportation network connecting not only the continent but also the south and Middle East, handling 7 percent of the world's cargo volume.

This was likely the result of the Tormia Kingdom's military and political efforts to maintain its position as a diplomatically neutral nation for a long time, but among such families, there was one that had grown in a particularly unique way.

That was the Ardino family, where Miro was currently heading.

Unlike other families who built splendid mansions in the city, the fact that their main house was located deep in the Jijeo Mountains that surrounded the capital Bashka to the north was enough to sense their secretive nature.

"It's quite deep in the mountains."

Arius, who was carrying Sirone on his back and following behind Miro, stuck out his tongue as he spoke.

Since Armin and Quan were each performing different missions utilizing their specialties, Arius was the only one accompanying Miro.

"Originally, they weren't a merchant family."

The closer they got to the main house, the worse Miro's expression became, unlike before.

Miro was human too, so how could she not have feelings, but this wasn't the kind of emotional change commonly seen in someone who had achieved Mujeongsim's Panya.

"Are you concerned? That's somewhat unexpected."

"The Ardino family has a different nature from other merchant families."

"I frequently encountered the seal of Ardino Publishing while studying magic. Still, reaching 20th place in the business hierarchy through book sales alone is quite remarkable."

"They don't just publish. Being able to translate, proofread, and revise private books excluding the Association's official publications means they possess vast magical knowledge."

"That's fortunate for Sirone."

Miro walked the mountain path again.

"Yes. But what I meant by different nature isn't about that."

Arius raised his distant eyes.

"The Ardino family is a branch family that split from the Adrias family long ago."

"Adrias, you mean..."

"My family."

The Adrias family, which boasted a long history, had been famous for their asceticism for generations.

Though nobles, they didn't accumulate even a penny of wealth, and the family members settled in the mountains, living on only the minimum water and food.

It wasn't strange that a genius like Miro emerged from such an environment.

What they pursued was ultimate stability that transcended desire and worldly troubles.

Their insights penetrated the principles of the world and provided teachings without discrimination, transcending borders and races.

That's why the kingdom went so far as to grant titles to the Adrias family, who provided no help to national activities whatsoever, firmly establishing them as belonging to their nation.

"Then one day, someone from a previous generation began to have doubts about the ascetic life."

Arius, who had enjoyed worldly pleasures to the fullest as one of the Seven Magicians, understood completely.

"That makes sense. I don't think I could live like that."

"Naturally, the family unanimously opposed it. So that ancestor left the family, created a new name, and infiltrated society. That became the current Ardino family. They accumulated wealth using the unique knowledge and insight of Adrias, and now they've become a massive trading company ranked 20th in the business hierarchy. But in reality, most of their main income comes through dark routes."

"Dark routes, you mean...?"

"Magic. It's currently the most profitable business in the world and a domain that not just anyone can enter. In the end, the publishing business is just a facade."

Arius realized why Miro's expression had been poor.

"So to speak, such a family is your relatives. After all, the same blood flows through you."

"It's not that we had a bad relationship. Of course, public criticism poured onto the Ardino family, but there wasn't any particular friction between us. Worldly philosophy is also necessary for the world, and at that time, the Ardino family wasn't drawing in dark funds either."

"Are you saying it's different now?"

Miro squinted one eye and clicked her tongue with a "tsk."

"I learned this recently, but everything started going wrong after I entered Estas and created the dimensional wall. When talking about the Judgment of Twenty, most people focus on me, but outside of that attention, even more things were happening."

"That makes sense. It was an event that determined the fate of humanity."

It was simply that they didn't want to look back because it wasn't as important as Miro, but the ripples that spread throughout the world after the Judgment of Twenty was decided must have been enormous.

"When the premise that 'the Adrias family saved humanity' was established, the Ardino family relatively received a bombardment of criticism. Naturally there was gossip from busybodies, and there must have been severe business and political friction too. Money-grubbing misers who sold their souls. Traitors who betrayed humanity. Well, they must have been very stressed by all sorts of talk like that. Eventually, they started getting their hands on dark funds."

"Do you think they resent you?"

"Who knows. I'm meeting them for the first time in almost 20 years too. Anyway, we'll know when we get there."

After continuing their mountain trek for about 30 minutes, the two arrived at the Ardino family estate.

The building harmonized with nature was the only remaining evidence of the Adrias temperament from before the branch split.

The iron gate was unmanaged, with wooden vines tangled all over it, and they hadn't even put a lock on it.

Miro walked to the gloomy building and knocked hard on the iron handle of the wooden door.

Before long, the door opened and a middle-aged man with a receding hairline opened it.

"What? Today's reservation guest is..."

The man's face turned pale as if he'd seen a ghost when he discovered Miro smiling.

"You... you..."

"It's been a while, Brother Enrique."

Ardino Enrique.

The current head of the Ardino family and a cousin who had often played with Miro when they were young.

"Miro, is it really you, Miro?"

Enrique's eyes, which had been unable to hide his surprise, suddenly calmed down.

"As expected, I thought this might happen someday. Was it faster than I expected?"

"Don't lie. You're someone with no insight whatsoever."

Enrique smacked his lips.

"Right, I actually thought you were dead. But you haven't aged at all."

"Brother's gotten a bigger belly though. Ugh, look at all this flab jiggling. What are you going to do about this?"

"Th-this...!"

For a moment, the appearance of his younger days overlapped on Enrique's face as he blushed while his belly fat was grabbed.

But time was still time, and after their brief reunion ended, a sense of distance clearly showed in his eyes.

"Why did you come here?"

"How disappointing. Is that what you say to someone who's returned after 20 years?"

"It's because you've returned after 20 years."

Despite the silent pressure suggesting she should leave, Miro held her ground to the point where the other party felt embarrassed.

Enrique, who had been looking at her eyes, finally clicked his tongue and turned toward the house.

"Come in. At least eat a meal before you go."

Entering the mansion, Miro let out a hollow laugh at the scenery that hadn't changed from 20 years ago.

"What's all this? I heard you were tremendously wealthy."

"It's not easy. Not only the trading company, but now the kingdom is watching us too. Since Adrias disappeared, now it's Ardino's turn."

Sadness briefly lingered on Miro's face before departing.

Enrique sank his fat body into the old leather sofa and took out a cigarette, while a maid brought tea.

"I came because I have business."

"Miro."

Enrique anxiously put out the cigarette he'd only taken one puff from and leaned his upper body forward.

"Can't you just eat a meal and leave? It's because it's me that I'm even talking to you like this. Everyone in the family hates you. Please, I'm begging you, just go."

"But you're the family head, aren't you? If the family head says so, who would object?"

"Hah."

Enrique buried his body in the backrest as if exhausted.

"Right, you've always been selfish. No matter how much I tried to stop you, you never listened."

"But it was fun because of me, wasn't it?"

Enrique, who had been lost in thought while looking up at the ceiling, let out a hollow laugh.

"Fine, what exactly is your business?"

"Where's 'Geumdong'? It's vacation period now, right?"

Enrique raised his eyebrows.

"Our son? Why are you suddenly looking for that kid? He's a worthless guy who hasn't even graduated yet."

"I heard. So his aunt thought she'd give him some advice."

While Enrique made a "hmm" sound and fell into thought, Miro wore a meaningful smile.

No matter what, he was the head of the Ardino family.

A person with tremendous financial power and connections couldn't possibly be unaware that Miro had returned from heaven.

"I don't know what it's about, but the boy is in a room on the second floor. He hasn't come down at all for the past few days."

"I'll go meet him."

Having grasped the atmosphere of the Ardino family, she thought there would be nothing good about dragging out time.

As Miro headed toward the stairs with Arius, the sound of lighting a cigarette came from the sofa.

"...What are you planning to do now?"

With the stairs in front of her, Miro turned around.

Though invisible to her eyes, Enrique's expression as he exhaled cigarette smoke was more serious than ever.

"Miro, you know now too, don't you? No matter how strong you are, you'll only end up being used by the world."

After hesitating briefly, Enrique continued.

"Change your surname. Come into Ardino. Then I'll take responsibility and protect you."

Miro turned around as if it wasn't worth listening to.

"It's what I chose."

"Are you still rationalizing it like that!"

Enrique shot up.

"Honestly, I was shocked when you came to find me! I wasn't shocked that you returned! You must have investigated! All the Adrias family members were purged! For breaking the only promise you had made!"

"That too was what the family chose."

Enrique beat his chest as if frustrated.

"How can you be so cruel? Don't you really have any desire for revenge, any resentment toward the world? Since you saved humanity, our family has also been under pressure! Do you know why? The world fears us! They only used us to survive, but on the other hand, they fear that a second or third Miro might emerge! That's why the Adrias family disappeared, and why our family went underground!"

Enrique walked around the sofa and approached Miro.

"You shouldn't expect much from humans. When they need you, they'll say all sorts of sweet words, but when they don't need you anymore, they become crueler than any creature. Don't you feel it's a waste of the time you sacrificed for such people?"

"I don't feel it's a waste."

Miro slowly raised her head and looked back at Enrique with a smile.

"Because that's what Adrias is."

Enrique felt completely deflated.

Though they were originally of the same blood, how could they be so different?

"...Tell them to bake a meat pie. Come down when it's ready."

It was Miro's favorite food.

After Enrique changed the subject and disappeared into the living room, Miro climbed the stairs and entered a corridor that turned at a right angle.

The corridor with wooden planks on the floor smelled of antiques.

Recalling old memories, Miro arrived at the fourth room and was about to knock but stopped and smiled mischievously.

"Geumdong! What are you doing?"

When she burst open the door and entered, a handsome young man was washing experimental equipment at a makeshift laboratory table.

Though he calmly turned his head despite the uninvited guest's appearance, his pupils shook the moment he saw Miro.

Seeing how tall he'd grown, Miro truly felt the gap of the 20 years she hadn't existed for the first time.

"Wow, you've really grown a lot? Do you remember me?"

"Well... I wondered who it was."

The man who had been tapping a triangular flask clean in the sink held it out like making a toast and smiled beautifully.

"It's been a while, Aunt."

It was Ardino Fermi, ranked first at Alpheas Magic School.
