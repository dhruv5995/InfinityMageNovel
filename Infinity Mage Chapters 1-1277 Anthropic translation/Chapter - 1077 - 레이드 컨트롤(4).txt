Raid Control (4)

When Sirone arrived at Democracy, he heard shocking news from the Mafia group.

"What? You can only challenge one type of mythic-grade hunting ground per day?"

Sona said.

"That's right. It resets at 24:00 system time. You can challenge the same hunting ground multiple times, but the 'Moon's Conception' event is only possible after midnight."

Without this restriction, most users would flock to mythic-grade hunting grounds.

"Usually you form a party and try to clear one place, then if it doesn't work out, you give up and go to regular hunting grounds. That's the standard approach."

Mafia said.

"Anyway, if we want to go to Moon's Conception, we have to wait until midnight. We might as well contact Geumhwaryun now and..."

"See you then."

Cutting off his words, Sirone entered the Mid Gear charging station.

'I'll have to pass time until midnight.'

There was no point staying outside with them anyway - it would just lead to pointless arguments.

"I'd like to charge up."

After paying with his credit card and entering the Mid Gear, the power lines connected.

'It'll start the moment I open my eyes.'

It would be just an instant for Sirone, but time would still flow outside.

The Mafia group remaining in front of the charging station were each unable to contain their anger.

"Damn it! We keep getting dragged around by that guy. Are we really going to continue like this? What if he changes his mind later?"

Mafia said.

"Let's post it on the forum for now. With the title 'Legendary Grade Item Acquisition.' Since it's the top-ranked guild in Dongguk, he can't pull a scam. It's minimal insurance."

Sona said.

"Then I'll post it. I have the recorded video."

As she was uploading the video, Dexgamseong turned to Mafia and said.

"I didn't expect him to equip legendary grade gear without even looking back. He's probably someone the guild is seriously backing, so we can't make mistakes in Moon's Conception."

"You think another legendary grade item will drop? It's better to just party with him for about a day, then formally propose to Geumhwaryun."

"Something feels off about this. Don't you think? His luck is too good, even for good luck. I searched the forums on the way here, and there are rumors that he uses some kind of bug. Of course, the management meeting found no evidence of wrongdoing, so there's nothing more to say."

"Hmm."

Mafia thought for a long time.

"Then let's do this."

The rest of the conversation was conducted through private communication, and the group's attitude changed after hearing it.

Then Sona spoke up.

"Wow, guys. Check out the forum."

Her video had recorded over 1,300 views just 5 minutes after uploading.

'Good.'

If by any chance Yahweh2 tried to scam them, at least public opinion would be on their side.

Clank, clank.

In a massive factory installed 500 meters underground, engines ran ceaselessly.

The sky was pure darkness, and despite sparks flying everywhere, no background was visible.

Boss Creature Manufacturing Plant.

This was an area not updated to High Gear, the main activity base of administrator Number Seven.

"Phew! This really never ends."

He turned off his torch and stood up from welding on an unfinished mechanical monster.

It was a body specialized for factory work, with "NO.7" written on his angular shoulder guards.

"His tastes are really unique, I tell you."

When he pulled up documents in augmented reality, the portfolio provided by the Operator unfolded.

"How am I supposed to meet the new update deadline with this? While he's playing around every day."

Bodies completed here go through the test server before being officially updated.

The test server mainly corrects errors - mind-numbingly boring repetitive work.

Yet the reason he stayed up all night was...

"Am I a pervert?"

Because the Operator facing the bodies he created was more immersed than ever before.

'How did I get tangled up with someone like this?'

At first it was interest, then he became fascinated by the Operator's outstanding design abilities.

'That's why it's even more annoying.'

Because he could see himself being swayed by an adolescent girl's fantasies overlapping with reality.

'She ran away.'

Number Seven was an Under Coder addict.

Having difficulty dealing with people (especially women), he couldn't even remember when he had started living here.

"Ah, damn it. I don't know. I'll quit after this time. I should go out and get my own room too."

Heat News.

A message appeared in Number Seven's augmented reality.

"What now, when I'm busy?"

Since it was also an administrator's duty, he turned off his torch again and opened the forum.

"Wow, over 10,000 views?"

He casually opened it and didn't move a muscle until the video ended.

The video ended.

"What the hell?"

The management meeting had revealed that Yahweh2 had special senses regarding time and space.

But even taking that into account, this case was hard to understand.

'Acquired Michelan in a single attempt?'

Of course, it was possible.

The problem was that the person in question was Yahweh2, who had been surrounded by controversy until now.

'Log search.'

Countless signals in Under Coder language flashed across his retina.

'It's not a bug. No traces of illegal programs either. It's clearly a probabilistic result. But...'

The parade of signals suddenly stopped.

'This section. Couldn't he have dealt with Ergos faster? The delay is microscopically longer than the average user's reaction. As if he was aiming for something.'

Number Seven suddenly looked up and muttered.

"Is that even possible?"

Probability is probability.

Even if you know the random number algorithm at the designer's level, you're still leaving it to chance.

'Even if I tried, I couldn't hit it. How could you know the timing when a specific result value appears?'

He muttered again.

"Pattern."

Creating perfect randomness is nearly impossible.

'If you roll dice infinitely, symmetry breaks down and individuality emerges. What we call the designer's intent. Something in the unconscious, deeper than that.'

His expression became serious.

'But to reach that point, the amount of information to process would rival the universe. This can't be calculated. Unless you have something like a quantum calculator in your head... Huh?'

His thoughts stopped for a moment.

'...What form would that calculator take? Probably not logical operations. More like... yes, conviction! A kind of feeling about specific result values.'

Number Seven checked the logs again.

'As expected, the firewall wasn't breached. So it's not Avatar Arts. But also...'

It is Avatar Arts.

'Damn, it was wordplay all along. If realizing something in reality is Avatar Arts, then the same could apply here. This guy is adapting to High Gear at an incredible speed.'

Moreover, if this hypothesis was true, the real world couldn't be free from simulation either.

What is a perfect world?

Recalling the original purpose, Number Seven downloaded all logs related to Yahweh2.

'Just who are you?'

It wasn't administrator authority.

Ascension Guild.

The ones most outraged after the Mafia group posted the video on the forum were the Ascension Guild members.

Code name Taedaecheon bit down hard on his electronic cigarette.

"Ergos's Sacred Ground? That's a place controlled by Ascension's 3rd Division! How did Yahweh2 enter a place that requires a Seoguk travel permit?"

Code name Yagwi said.

"There's another problem. The Michelan issue came up. Even though our guild took turns working on it, we only managed to get 2 of those items, and now it's gone to Dongguk."

Code name Rubymix spread his arms in disbelief.

"According to our investigation, he used a Seoguk Free Pass. That's a card managed by Ascension's 1st Division. In other words, there's currently a traitor here."

Fire lit up in Taedaecheon's one eye.

"That can't be. How fiercely have we fought against Dongguk in the Solar War all this time? There's no one who would cross over to Galaxy or whatever. Who would throw away their pride to do such a thing?"

"But the results speak for themselves. And it's Yahweh2, a member of Dongguk's strongest Geumhwaryun. This can't be overlooked."

Yagwi asked.

"Then who exactly is the traitor?"

"We all know."

In the silence, Rubymix spat out.

"Little Witch. She has the shortest membership period, and she always acts impulsively in the Solar War. She's never made mistakes, but she always makes us nervous."

Taedaecheon stroked his chin.

"At first I thought she was crazy. Her skills cover up her personality issues. We need to verify this."

Yagwi asked the Operator.

"What do you think, boss? Honestly, you're the one who suspects Little Witch the most."

She chose silence.

"Fine, let's go find her without waiting. If she's a traitor, she'll have to be prepared."

Just as Taedaecheon was speaking, the door opened.

"You called for me?"

It was Little Witch.

"I thought I heard my code name from outside. What's going on? The atmosphere seems tense."

"You, you..."

Since they had no physical evidence, they spoke indirectly, but everyone had already made up their minds.

'That bastard is the traitor.'

As Taedaecheon bit his cigarette, Little Witch approached the Operator.

"Do you have something to say to me?"

After exchanging glances for a while, the Operator finally opened her small lips.

"...No."

Then she walked toward the door and said.

"I'll be out for a bit. Something came up."

"Hmm."

Little Witch saw off the Operator with her gaze, then exhaled and turned around.

"Little Witch."

Before she knew it, three guild members had blocked the wall.

"You'd better tell the truth. The Seoguk Free Pass - did you give it to Yahweh2?"

"Yeah, I gave it to him. So what?"

"What!"

Rubymix shouted.

"Do you know what you've done? You handed a legendary grade item to the enemy! And you still call yourself Ascension?"

"Hey, it's about balancing, balancing. The Operator is too strong. Honestly, without her, you guys would have been pushed back by Dongguk long ago. What's the point of winning so disgracefully?"

Taedaecheon drew his mechanical greatsword.

"Now you're showing your true colors. Now that we know you're Dongguk's spy, this won't end nicely."

"Ooh, what are you going to do?"

"We recorded your confession. Start by kneeling. Dismantle all your parts. We'll make sure you can't even set foot in High Gear. Even you can't handle three rankers."

Yagwi and Rubymix also drew their respective weapons.

"Anyway."

Little Witch calmly walked past them and sat on the sofa, crossing her legs.

"That's why you guys don't work. You need to create excitement, excitement. Is it fun if only you guys monopolize everything?"

"Are you done with your last words?"

When Little Witch made a gun shape with her hand and aimed it, the guild members stopped walking.

"...What are you doing?"

"Gun. This is a shooting simulation, isn't it? Don't come closer. I'll shoot you."

"Heh. Hehehehe."

Taedaecheon's shoulders shook as electricity flashed in his eyes.

"You're insane..."

As he raised his greatsword and took position, Little Witch bent her elbow and made a sound.

"Pew!"

Taedaecheon flinched.

But nothing happened, and Rubymix and Yagwi looked at each other in bewilderment.

Little Witch tilted her head.

"Huh? Why didn't it work?"

"You, you...!"

Feeling ashamed that he had cowered even for a moment, Taedaecheon screamed and charged.

"Where does this damn bitch get off!"

Just as the booster-powered greatsword was about to strike Little Witch's crown.

"Pew!"

"Gah!"

Taedaecheon convulsed as if electrocuted and collapsed to the floor.

"Hey! Taedaecheon!"

Rubymix and Yagwi rushed over, but before they could touch him, he disappeared.

'His connection was cut. Forcibly...'

With an eerie feeling, they turned their heads to see Little Witch blowing on her finger gun.

"How's that? My gun's pretty deadly, right?"
