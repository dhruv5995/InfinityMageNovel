[608] The Five Prestigious Schools (1)

Winter had arrived.

Alpheas, who had been looking down at the snow-covered school grounds, turned from the window and asked.

"An official document came down from the Association?"

"See for yourself."

The stiff document Olivia had placed on the desk caught his eye.

It stated that graduating students from the five prestigious magic schools must personally deliver their graduation exam participation forms to the Association.

"This could become a variable too."

It was precisely when the final 30th week evaluation was about to begin.

At this time, students' minds became sharp as blades, and they adjusted their biorhythms so their condition would peak on the day of the graduation exam.

Having to travel to the Magic Association in the capital during such a time would be considerable stress.

"Are they using even the students for politics?"

This had happened after Lufist, who had been acting in Gaold's place, officially took the position of Magic Association President.

"That's how we should see it. Lufist is someone with an elite-first philosophy. This is probably part of a plan to manage students who will join the Association in the future from now on."

That's why they had narrowed the scope to only the five prestigious schools.

"Even so, isn't this too much? Until last year, schools handled this themselves, but to change it like this... There must have been considerable opposition?"

"It's a kind of power display. While Lufist's connections are excellent, he hasn't completely taken control of the Association."

"Gaold's influence must have been greater than we realized."

"He was a madman, but he was the kingdom's strongest mage. Even if they criticized his actions on the surface, there were probably quite a few mages who secretly supported him."

Gaold was that kind of man.

"Right. Let's leave politics to the politicians, and we teachers should focus on what's best for our students."

Collie, who had been listening to the conversation, spoke up.

"First, to send 30 people to the Association, we need to fill our quota. Currently, one seat is vacant due to Anchal's withdrawal, and we need to make a decision about Aider as well."

Aider, who had suffered full-body fractures from Shirone's Ataraxia during the hill occupation evaluation, was still hospitalized in the school's medical ward.

While his treatment was complete, the problem was his mental state.

"According to the medical teacher, his trauma has been almost completely treated. Aider is also showing enthusiasm to participate in the graduation exam."

"Hmm."

Graduating students were given the right to participate in graduation exams, and if they chose to exercise that right, the school couldn't stop them.

"But isn't he too young? The fact that treatment took over six months means the trauma was that severe."

Alpheas agreed with Olivia's words.

"Let's check one last time. If there are no problems, we'll bring up one applicant from the advanced class to fill the quota. It should be fine if we give qualification based on grades."

"Yes. I'll leave it to Teacher Siena."

Collie bowed his head and left the principal's office.

As always, Shirone sat cross-legged on the floor of the research society.

Since the upper floors of Estas no longer existed, he came here every day to develop his sequence formula.

'Believe in the power of one day.'

Ned, who had finished his heartache, was also receiving evaluations normally, and the students paying the price for Scramble Royale were steadily dropping their grades.

Now only 10 days remained until the graduation exam.

All the training he had done so far was merely a process to see the results of that day.

"Krrgh!"

As the sequence formula exceeded 200 gyeong, Shirone's face contorted terrifyingly.

He had manifested Shibulsangpokbae upon entering the gyeong unit, and now he had come 200 times further than that.

Even so, surpassing gyeong to enter the realm of hae still seemed distant.

'It's tremendous. There's no end.'

Even when he reached out to grasp it, all he could see was an eternally racing tunnel of numbers.

Numbers have an end.

Recalling Gauffin's words that he still couldn't understand, Shirone accelerated his sequence formula, and the temporal energy filling the research society swirled, distorting the landscape beyond recognition.

'I'm going!'

He would extend endlessly.

"Shirone, are you inside?"

Then came a knock, and Siena opened the door and entered.

"Huh? What's the matter?"

Shirone, who had perceived the future one second ahead, had already stopped his sequence formula and calmly greeted Siena.

"Yeah. Teacher Collie asked me to. Can you come somewhere with me for a moment?"

"Yes, of course."

Siena felt nostalgic watching Shirone get up and dust himself off.

'He's really grown so much.'

Memories of him receiving attention from teachers during the entrance test came flooding back.

It was truly amazing that the boy who had been far from magic and could only use Spirit Zone had grown into the top graduation candidate who yielded to no one.

'Well, this feeling is why I teach.'

Shirone, wearing his winter coat, asked.

"But where are we going?"

"To the medical ward rehabilitation training center. I need your help with something. I'll explain the details on the way."

Following Siena to the medical ward, Shirone heard the whole story.

"Ah, then it'll take two days."

"Yeah. But the travel time won't be too long. We'll take the spatial movement magic circle from the Magic Association's Creas branch to the capital."

Long-distance spatial movement magic circles were devices crucial to the kingdom's security, so no one could use them without official business.

"The kids taking the evaluation probably heard from Teacher Collie too. You'll need clothes for the ceremony, so get them tailored in advance."

The rehabilitation training center was located on the second basement floor of the ward.

In the roughly 80-pyeong space, various rehabilitation equipment was arranged along the walls, and beside the medical teacher stood Aider in patient clothes.

"Aider."

The student who had contained a snake's wickedness within a cute smile.

The memory of him unilaterally beating Maya while enjoying it was still vivid.

"Oh? It's been a while, Shirone hyung."

Aider greeted him with his usual smile, but having already grasped his true nature, Shirone couldn't welcome him warmly.

"Aw, are you still holding onto what happened back then? I'm really sorry. I was acting up without knowing my place."

Sometimes Shirone thought he had been too harsh on Aider, but even that was regret born from the leisure of a strong person who could now choose much more than before.

"Right. I heard the story. You want to take the graduation exam?"

"Of course. I'm a graduating student too."

Shirone understood his feelings.

If he gave up here, he would have to repeat the entire year from the beginning.

"Coincidentally, I've agreed to help with the rehabilitation test."

Since Shirone was the source of Aider's trauma, he was the perfect person for the job.

"Yes. I heard. Please take care of me."

Meanwhile, Siena and the medical teacher were reviewing documents in the corner.

"The rehabilitation was successful. He doesn't have nightmares anymore, and the hallucinations of seeing light have disappeared. However..."

"However?"

"They disappeared too cleanly. I couldn't find anything strange in the interviews, but it's what you might call a doctor's intuition."

"You're saying Aider is deceiving us?"

"That's why we called Shirone to confirm."

Siena nodded and turned around.

"We're going to test now. Shirone will recreate the situation from that time while the medical teacher checks Aider's condition."

Aider's face stiffened slightly.

"The situation from that time?"

"Don't worry. We're not actually going to attack. Can you do it?"

"Yes, of course. I'm completely healed."

And so the final test began, with Aider and Shirone standing at opposite ends of the rehabilitation room, facing each other.

'Ataraxia.'

As a brilliant multicolored magic circle formed above his head, Aider's confident expression visibly paled.

"It's okay, Aider. It's natural to feel fear. You just need to endure it, so there's no need to be nervous."

From a teacher's perspective, it was human nature to want to give Aider, who had worked hard to reach the graduating class, a chance.

Shirone moved to the next step.

'Photon Cannon.'

The moment a golden sphere burst into existence before his eyes and vibrated, Aider's facial muscles contorted with raw emotion.

"Aaaaah!"

Aider fled his position, pressed his head into a corner, curled up his body, and screamed.

"The light, I can see the light! Teacher!"

While the hallucinations had disappeared, he couldn't overcome even real light.

Shirone, who had dispelled the Photon Cannon and Ataraxia, looked at the medical teacher with a bitter expression.

After thinking for a moment, she shook her head and wrote "Rehabilitation Required" in the personal information section.

"Good work."

Collie spoke to the assembled 28 graduating students.

"With this, the entire graduating class curriculum is complete."

There was no applause, no cheers.

The only emotion felt by those who had trained their minds without missing a single day for 30 weeks was nauseating tension.

"As you know, there are currently two vacant spots in the graduating class quota. After a week of selection, two students from the advanced class have been promoted, so please welcome them."

As Collie turned his head, Mark and Maria, the 1st and 2nd ranked students in the advanced class, stepped onto the platform.

"Hello, I'm Mark. Though I'm late, I'm honored to be able to take the graduation exam together."

"Hello. I'm Maria. Please take care of me."

While there was no concept of seniors and juniors in the graduating class, Maria politely bowed according to her personality.

No one paid attention.

The evaluations were already over, and with only real battles remaining, relationships weren't important.

"1st and 2nd place in the advanced class. Isn't that too much of a stretch?"

Anyone who had gone through the graduating class's year-long evaluation process would think so.

"Still, you never know. Those two have been receiving private tutoring from Teacher Sade."

If a certified 6th-grade mage had personally guided them, they couldn't have only completed advanced class-level training.

'Shirone seonbae.'

Mark made eye contact with Shirone.

While experiencing the graduation exam early had considerable advantages, there were also significant psychological risk factors.

Still, the reason Mark chose to advance to the graduating class was because of Shirone.

'If not now...'

When would he get to compete with Shirone again?

The reason he had been able to rise from Class Seven to 1st place in Class Four at super-high speed was because he had been chasing after Shirone.

'I'll learn from you, seonbae. And...'

Mark looked at Maria.

'We will graduate this time.'

That was exactly the reason he had been able to convince Maria.

With the combination play they had refined through Sade's special training, they judged that while they might not be in the top ranks, a final ranking of 10th place was within striking distance.

"Now I'll explain tomorrow's schedule."

Mark and Maria stepped down from the platform, and Collie held up the official document.

"Departure is at 6 AM, preparations must be finished by 5 AM. Wake-up time is 4 AM."

This was due to the security regulations of the long-distance spatial movement magic circle.

"Everyone must wear formal attire. Skirt lengths must be exactly 5 centimeters below the knee. Men wear white dress shirts, women wear white blouses, shoes must be matte finish, no accessories except school badges are allowed, and all women must wear their hair up."

Sabina raised her hand.

"Why do only women have to wear their hair up? There are many men with long hair too."

With having to wake up at dawn, women who would have to spend more time on preparation couldn't help but be dissatisfied.

"These are regulations set by the Association President. If you have complaints, file a formal protest with the Association."

That alone was enough to guess Lufist's personality.

"Your clothes must not be wrinkled by the time you arrive at the Association. Don't run, and refrain from bending your waist or swinging your arms."

The students' eyes grew hollow, already stressed from the graduation exam.

"Wouldn't it be better to just stuff us and carry us there?"

"That's exactly it. You must arrive at the Association without any dishevelment, as if you were stuffed. As you know, tomorrow at noon, all graduating students from the kingdom's five prestigious schools—150 students—will gather in one place."

Only then did the students' expressions change.

"Of course, there won't be many people examining you closely, but flaws are easily noticed. Never show a disheveled appearance. This concerns the school's honor."

They couldn't show themselves as inferior to other prestigious schools.

"Rest well today. Sleep early and I'll see you at dawn."

"Yes!"

The students' voices were more vigorous than usual.
