[791] Betta Fish (1)

The Arachne National Intelligence Service had submitted documents.

She currently appeared to be leading a mercenary guild in Timaros, a small commercial city near the capital Bangol.

'The Jaystin Mercenary Group...'

Instead of changing her name, she had abandoned her surname, and her members numbered barely around ten.

It would be an ordinary life if you could call it that, but she must have given up far too much to obtain this peace.

"Where is Timaros?"

Paronica asked, swallowing nervously.

"There's a small city 14 kilometers east of Bangol. I'll order entry permission to be issued."

"Thank you for your cooperation. Let's put out the urgent fires first regarding the terrorism matter and then discuss it."

Only after Sirone gathered the documents and left the Grand Hall did Paronica feel like she could breathe again.

"Phew, what a terrifying man."

The consul bowed his head with a pale face.

"I apologize, Your Majesty. Even after we handed over Miss Arachne, to think he would show such complete disregard for our dignity..."

"No, this is fine. Since he mentioned terrorism, he won't just sit back and watch."

Even so, Sirone's presence was powerful enough to easily trample the dignity of the Seven Star Kingdom.

'Are those the eyes of one who bears the world on his shoulders?'

When they first heard that Sirone would be coming from among the stars of the Ivory Tower, they had rejoiced.

"Still..."

Now their thoughts had completely changed.

"If we managed to compromise to this extent against one of the Five Great Stars, didn't we do pretty well?"

The consul nodded silently.

Flying vertically up from the royal castle, Sirone flew straight toward the small city on the edge of the horizon.

When he arrived at the entrance arch, the guard captain who had already received word saluted him with a booming voice.

"Welcome! I've been instructed to ensure there are no obstacles to your work. Is there anything you need?"

"I'll just look around a bit."

He wanted to handle things quietly.

"It's Timaros's honor. If you need anything, please visit the nearest guard post anytime."

Nodding as he passed through the arch, countless shops lined the unpaved road.

'Is it because of the World Beauty Contest?'

There were more foreign visitors than locals, and perhaps because of this, the market had a festival-like atmosphere.

After pushing through the crowds filling the streets and finding the guild district, it became noticeably quieter.

Passing by the blacksmith, alchemy, medicine, and recovery guilds, he finally found the place he was looking for.

Jaystin Mercenary Guild

Since a guard unit was sufficient to protect one small city, the building clearly didn't seem to have much work available.

"Excuse me."

Empty tables were sparsely placed around, and the counter was vacant.

A group at a corner table, with bottles beside them playing card games, turned their heads.

"What, who are you?"

The man who threw out words embarrassing for a first meeting was one-eyed, and his tongue was slurred from drinking.

'How few people must be looking for them...'

After thinking for a moment, Sirone asked.

"I'm looking for someone. Could you help me?"

A fat woman sitting on the right side of the table jumped up and approached.

"Oh my, a customer. Come this way."

As she entered behind the counter and slammed down a guest book, dust billowed up.

"Finding people is our specialty. Who are you looking for?"

"Amery Jaystin."

The color drained from the woman's face, and the mercenaries playing cards froze their movements.

The woman asked again.

"Sorry, who did you say?"

"Amery Jaystin. It seems the captain of the mercenary group here uses the name Jaystin."

The one-eyed man spoke.

"Close the door."

The door shut with a bang, and a black-haired man who had appeared from nowhere stood guard at the entrance with his sword drawn.

'Considerable skill.'

Of course, it wasn't a presence he hadn't noticed, but the level was high even compared to the Silver Ring Guild he had been part of.

"You'd better speak properly, kid."

The one-eyed man aimed a gun loaded with magic bullets.

"Who told you the surname Amery?"

Through his question, Sirone could tell that Jaystin had revealed her past to her subordinates.

'So, a mercenary group bound by considerable trust. I'd better be careful with my words.'

Sirone raised both hands.

"I didn't come to fight. I came because I have something to ask of Miss Jaystin. You could call it a commission."

"I warned you."

The one-eyed man's gun clicked, and two other men drew their gleaming longswords.

"Speak properly."

Simultaneously, the magic bullet fired with a blast of flame, and the black-haired man guarding the entrance lunged with a dagger.

"Damn...!"

As he dodged the magic bullet with teleportation, the wall exploded with a thunderous sound.

"Be careful! He's a mage!"

"A mage?"

The men with longswords ran along the walls and leaped at Sirone from left and right.

"Just a brat anyway!"

The longswords carved an X with vicious sounds, but Sirone was already gone.

"I said there's no need to fight...!"

Sirone's voice was buried under the explosive sound of magic bullets, and walls exploded on all sides.

'It's your shop!'

They didn't seem to care at all.

'Or maybe they judged it that dangerous...'

Though he hadn't even seen her face yet, he could guess what kind of life Jaystin had lived.

"Kill him! I'll handle the consequences!"

The woman shouted, and the black-haired man pressed Sirone while gripping his dagger in reverse.

'As expected, this person is the strongest.'

Realizing it wasn't a situation where words would work, Sirone drew his Shining Chain and bound the man's body.

"Kugh! What is this...! Aaahhh!"

Simultaneously, the black-haired man flipped upside down, and the longer chain swept through the guild interior, binding the people.

"Let go! Let this go, you bastard!"

He bound the ankles of the men with longswords to fix them to the floor, and finally wrapped the one-eyed man's hands behind his back.

"Phew."

As Sirone caught his breath, the woman who had hidden under the counter pulled out a pipe and shot poison darts.

"Pffft!"

The darts coated with deadly poison rushed forward, but to Sirone's eyes with Slow magic cast, they appeared stopped.

"......"

As he caught the dart between his index finger and thumb right in front of his eyes, the men bound by the Shining Chain's eyes widened.

"He, he caught it with his hand."

Slow magic - catching a dart with one's hand while it was flying at 1% speed was impossible in their experience.

'They say you devote your lifetime to slow down 1 percent...'

Only someone like Alpheus, a genius of the Photon series, could make the speed of time feel dreamlike.

"You... just who are you?"

As the one-eyed man asked the question, his pupils briefly glanced to the side and the woman at the counter loaded poison darts again.

"Kyaah!"

The Shining Chain wrapped around her body first, pulling her up to the ceiling in an upside-down suspended state.

"Fine, I got it! I'm Amery Jaystin! So let me go now! Let's talk!"

If that was true, verification was needed.

"Can you show me the scar?"

The mercenaries' faces became serious.

'This guy knows everything.'

Then the back door opened roughly and a woman who had just finished bathing with wet hair entered.

"You bastards! Did you lose the deed to the house? Why all this commotion...!"

She had a tough appearance weathered by hardships and carried a sniper rifle modified for long-range shooting on her shoulder.

A shooting range was visible beyond the door.

"What is this ridiculous situation?"

After looking left and right at the unseemly scene, she fixed her gaze on Sirone.

"Are you the one who has my subordinates hanging there?"

The one-eyed man shouted.

"Captain! Run away! This guy knows your surname!"

Her eyebrow twitched for a moment, but Jaystin, befitting the party involved, didn't act rashly.

"...Let my subordinates go."

As long as he could feel the murderous resistance of the mercenaries through Spirit Zone, he couldn't release them.

"Are you Amery Jaystin?"

"Yes. If you have something to say, say it to me."

Like the woman at the counter, if this was also a trick, seeing with his own eyes would be most accurate.

"Please show me the scar on your side."

The one-eyed man struggled.

"Captain! Run away! This bastard! Hurry up and release this! When I get out, I'll kill you... Aaahhh!"

As he tightened the Shining Chain, the one-eyed man screamed, and all those connected by the chains grimaced.

"Hnggggh!"

Jaystin shouted.

"Stop!"

She grabbed the bottom of her shirt and pulled it up to her neck, her chest swaying as her bare skin was revealed.

"Is that enough? Now let my subordinates go."

"C-Captain..."

While the men turned their gazes away at the embarrassing sight, Sirone stared intently at her ribs.

'It's there.'

A scar that must have been fatal at the time was clearly carved along her ribcage.

"What? Should I show you below too?"

Sirone released the Shining Chain.

"Kugh!"

The woman fell from the ceiling and the subordinates knelt with thuds, clutching their aching bodies.

"How pathetic..."

Jaystin clicked her tongue, but couldn't hide the worry in her eyes.

'She's a strong person.'

He could feel the spirit of a soldier who had crossed the line of death.

"Yes, I'm Amery Jaystin. So what will you do now? Are you going to kill me?"

"As I keep saying, I didn't come to fight. I have no intention of harming you either."

"Really?"

Jaystin seemed unimpressed.

"Fine, let's hear it. You want to talk alone, right? Then there's a perfect place."

It was the shooting range where she practically lived.

"Captain! We'll follow! Agh!"

The one-eyed man jumped up but sat back down from the throbbing pain in his bones.

"Just take care of yourselves. Really, such a fuss..."

After Jaystin and Sirone left through the back door, the woman at the counter brought ointment.

"At least apply this. Your skin is scraped."

The one-eyed man applying medicine to his body examined the chain marks carved into his skin and frowned.

"Damn! I'll have to wear long sleeves. How can I go around like this? Anyone who sees this will think I'm a pervert."

The longsword man looked back at the rear door.

"Will it be okay? His skills weren't ordinary. Shouldn't we follow them?"

"Hah, ordinary skills?"

The black-haired man spoke.

"Do you think ordinary skills could subdue me? Well, I suppose it would be possible for you guys."

The one-eyed man bared his teeth.

"What, this bastard! I'm already annoyed and you're rubbing salt in the wound."

"If he wanted to kill us, he would have done it already."

Everyone fell silent.

"If he had evil intentions, we wouldn't be here now either. That's why the captain followed him willingly. Just trust and leave it to her."

"......"

The one-eyed man blew on the ointment-applied shoulder area.

"I won't get scars, right?"

The explosive sound of magic bullets erupted.

"Next!"

When targets were set up on the mountainside, the sniper rifle recoiled without fail.

"Next!"

Watching Jaystin concentrate on shooting practice beside him, Sirone was lost in thought.

'What is she shooting at?'

It was marksmanship close to divine skill that couldn't be obtained without daily training.

'She's still fighting.'

Jaystin finally opened her mouth.

"If you're not a hitman, why did you come here?"

"I have a favor to ask."

"A favor? From me?"

As she pulled the bolt, a shell casing was ejected from the side of the sniper rifle with a click.

"Please kill Havitz."

Her breathing stopped abruptly, then her shoulders began to tremble like a tsunami.

"N-Next!"

As soon as the target was set up, she pulled the trigger, but the magic bullet exploded in a completely wrong place.

"Havitz..."

Terror swept through Jaystin's eyes.
