[572] Reaction and Response (4)

At the same time Shirone's group was gathering their team members, the coalition team also assembled at their hideout to discuss future countermeasures.

Just like with Shirone, the last person to arrive was Cayden.

"...What a complete mess."

From Hersy's perspective, Cayden's condition was seriously poor.

His clean face was covered in blood, and he was caked with dirt from head to toe.

"What's Shirone's current location?"

Hersy shook his head.

"The strategy has changed. You need to actively participate in the matches now too."

"I refuse. We had an agreement. You promised to give me a free role on the first day. My match with Shirone isn't settled yet."

"I know that, but Eden's strategy was figured out too early. You know this, right? If we lose the competition, you'll have to pay the price too."

Cayden ground his teeth.

"We'll give Eden a free role sooner than expected. I'll also focus on finding Iruki's location. The enemy will try to make us reveal our cards. In the meantime, we need someone to collect scrambles from enemy territory."

Fisho raised his hand.

"I'll do it."

Insect magic would be perfect for collecting scattered scrambles.

"Good. The rest of you support Eden once we secure scrambles. If we can create the strongest hand within three days, the match will be over."

"Damn it. I could have killed him."

As Cayden muttered, Hersy finally showed interest.

'Hmm, so even using his sword, he couldn't subdue Shirone?'

While there were others at the magic school who applied schema, Cayden was on a completely different level.

A sword genius who graduated as valedictorian from Kaizen Sword Academy at fourteen.

He had the skill to serve as a commander of a thousand even if he went to war right now.

'How foolish. What's so important about art...'

Seeing him give up a life where he could have thrived under the protection of the Cross family, a sword clan, to enter magic school made one wonder if fate truly existed.

"So, how was it? Facing Shirone?"

Cayden's grumbling stopped and his expression became serious.

The hatred remained, but honestly speaking, he was impressed.

"He's quite good. I can see why Fermi keeps him in check."

"Oh."

This was the first time he had acknowledged anyone in combat, except for Fermi.

"But the feeling was a bit strange."

"Strange? In what way?"

Though everyone was equally tired from fighting late into the night, Hersy didn't overlook even small factors.

"How should I put it? Should I say he avoided my attacks?"

Hersy relaxed the strength in his eyelids.

"That's because Shirone's movement is..."

"I know, the best in school. But it's not that kind of thing."

"I don't understand. Speak precisely."

"So it's a kind of feeling. There was no discomfort in the battle, but every time Shirone avoided my attacks, I found myself thinking 'how?'"

Cayden, who had been racking his brain trying to find a way to explain, lifted his head.

"Right, at some point the tide of battle would reverse. The fight would progress with a feeling of 'I can definitely win this much,' but then at the decisive moment, it would be overturned. If Shirone were strong, I shouldn't have had the thought 'I can win' from the beginning."

"Hmm..."

Hersy tilted his head and stroked his chin.

"That's vague. Wasn't there anything particularly unusual?"

Cayden replayed the battle in his mind.

"There weren't many decisive moments, so I can't be certain, but I think light came from his body."

Eden objected.

"Shirone's major is light. Light manifests whenever he casts any magic."

"That's true, but..."

"Is it intuition?"

Hersy thought Cayden was right.

If his specialty of precise intuition hadn't activated, he wouldn't have even had such thoughts in the first place.

"We'll need to investigate a bit more. Cayden, continue covering Shirone. Can you handle it?"

"I was already planning to. Just tell me where he is."

Hersy spoke with a serious expression.

"I asked if you can handle it. You seemed to struggle quite a bit today, so if you're outmatched in terms of power..."

"It was just reconnaissance."

Cayden said with indifferent eyes.

"Shirone will die by my hand soon enough."

A smile spread across Hersy's lips.

'Let's hope so.'

Scramble Royale Day 2.

Thanks to their efforts the previous night to prevent Eden from collecting cards, Shirone's group was able to keep her hand still bound to ○○ (Saint).

This was thanks to the rule that transfer was impossible without directly collecting scrambles.

However, they had to accept losses as well, as Fisho had quickly collected the scrambles that Shirone's group had given up, gathering all six cards.

Even so, Iruki didn't abandon the existing strategy.

"The most crucial rule in black and white competition is 'the winner of a call doesn't waste cards.' What does this mean?"

Amy said.

"The team that combines the strongest hand first has an overwhelming advantage."

"Right. That's why we're accepting losses to block Eden's collection. The enemy has figured out our strategy too, so from today it'll develop more complexly."

"So that's why we gathered here."

Shirone's group's Day 2 starting point was in front of the central administrative building at the center of the campus.

"There are 12 scrambles. Let's acquire them starting from the closest ones. If we erase directionality first, the enemy won't be able to calculate our movement either."

"A sword swung with eyes covered is harder to dodge."

Sabina said.

"Leave it to luck so they can't calculate reactions. But what if Eden takes a big detour?"

"Then we'll give them one card and think again. Blocking with Saint yesterday was huge."

Lulu's message that scrambles had been summoned permeated through.

"Alright, let's go!"

Six flashes of light flew off in different directions.

'Found it, scramble.'

Dorothy, with Hickory on her shoulder, entered the 4th Training Ground not far from the senior class.

The moment she confirmed the scramble wedged in a rock crevice on the outskirts and launched herself forward, she felt an eerie chill.

'Danger.'

As soon as Dorothy stopped, sharp ice flowers bloomed around the scramble.

"Too bad. Strike out."

Frings approached with a sleazy smile.

"It's not a strike out. I met a loser like you."

Having been beaten by Amy's call last night, Frings currently held two cards.

The hand recorded on his master card was ○●, a strategy openly aiming for a 3-stage hand with a clear set.

"Of course I'm a loser."

Dorothy, who had beaten Anchal with ○●○●(Democracy) last night, had added one random card and her current status was ○●○●R.

It was quite an advantageous condition, but calling against Frings who had a clear set anyway was worth considering.

'Is beating a clear set more important than revealing a 5-stage random card?'

As if cutting off her thoughts, Frings asked.

"Call. Won't you make one?"

"I will. If it gets dangerous."

Frings was ranked 3rd in the senior class and was a combat mage.

'Could it be a perfect hand?'

From ○●○●(Democracy), the only hand that could be combined at the next stage was ●○●○●(Revolution).

Therefore, if Dorothy's random card was white, it would be a perfect hand and there would be no reason for Frings to be disadvantaged.

'I'm curious. I could make the call myself instead, but...'

Frings sleazily stroked his mustache.

'If it's Revolution, I'll be beaten again.'

He was tired of being treated like a peripheral character.

"If you won't make a call... may I start attacking soon?"

'Call is the last resort.'

When Dorothy made a beeping sound with her mouth, Hickory got down from her shoulder and landed on the ground.

Thud!

It was a heavy thump that couldn't be expected from a doll that had come down from such a delicate body.

"Whether anyone makes a call or not, it's advantageous for me. And I can't give up the scramble."

Multicolored light burst from Hickory's gear-toothed mouth.

'4-dimensional Hickory.'

Beep beep.

Even as Hickory showed comical dance moves like moving a protractor, Frings' expression remained unchanged.

Having clashed for over a year in the senior class, he was fully aware of her manipulation-type abilities.

'Dorothy. An interesting subject.'

Freezing mist rose voluptuously around Frings, and the whole world sparkled as if frozen.

'Attack!'

As Hickory lunged forward and swung its spherical steel fist, Frings flew up with a beautiful motion.

Ice Flower.

Frozen petals rotated and pounded Hickory's body.

Major: Freezing, School: Ice Formation.

It was a typical combat mage technique that attacked by shaping ice rather than using extreme cold.

'Iron and ice. Iron has the advantage in compatibility, but...'

Frings flew up in a beautiful posture and cast magic.

'You know you picked the wrong opponent, don't you?'

Sharp sounds burst in succession as ice stalactites thicker than ivory bit at Hickory from all directions.

'This ends it.'

Ultra-thin Edge.

As Frings swung his hand blade, frost formed in the air and extended horizontally, occupying the coordinates.

'Ultra-thin Edge can cut even steel.'

The reason Frings specifically targeted Hickory was because it was a mimesis that shared consciousness with Dorothy.

This was a bidirectional control method where Dorothy manipulating Hickory would cause Hickory to manipulate Dorothy's brain again to manipulate Hickory once more. Such manipulated objects were called mimesis in the magical world, which was why the school also regarded Hickory as an embodiment.

'Anyway, I just need to deal with the tin can.'

In an environment trapped like an ice cave, as the Ultra-thin Edge approached freezing the horizon, Hickory accelerated Dorothy's brain.

The increased computational ability was input back into Hickory, and commands were entered through the expanded time allowance.

'Iron Screw Driver (←↙↓↘→ + Attack).'

Commands were the only means to control Hickory.

Hickory spun up to the ceiling, shattering the ice, then manipulated Dorothy to slam her body against the wall.

"Ugh!"

Since it wasn't voluntary movement, the impact was severe, but it was better than having her torso cut.

'Hickory. Attack tendency 85 percent.'

Even as Hickory switched to offense and wildly swung its spherical fists, Frings responded calmly.

'The martial arts have been updated.'

Though the posture was comical, there weren't many humans who could withstand punches powered by an 85-horsepower engine.

'Now!'

Dorothy's eyes lit up as she input a command.

'Super Rocket Punch (→→ + Attack, Defense).'

The moment she input the direction of thought in a specific pattern, Hickory extended its right arm.

"Hup!"

As the fist flew with a roar, Frings fell backward bending his upper body, and the ice barrier that had been confining them shattered.

'That's a bit dangerous...'

Frings, who had been watching the direction the rocket punch flew, suddenly lit up his eyes and retreated.

'Mammoth Stomp (↓↓↓ + Attack).'

As Hickory crashed down stomping with both legs, the ground cracked with Hickory at the center.

'A finishing move here!'

Dorothy rotated her thoughts in a complex pattern.

'Fire Blast (↓↘→ ↓↘→ + Attack, Defense, Movement).'

Hickory's chest plate opened and a flamethrower popped out.

Faced with a 10-meter-long stream of fire that scorched the air, Frings had no choice but to retreat.

'Control Mode (Attack + Movement)!'

The returning rocket punch began moving precisely.

'Like this (→→↑↘)... and like that (↑↑←)...'

Though Frings belatedly noticed and protected his body with Ice Skin, he couldn't completely block the impact.

As Frings flew away with a bang, Dorothy clenched her fist and reattached the rocket punch.

'Victory Pose Macro 3 (↓↑↓↑ + Defense).'

Hickory put its hands on its hips and danced, then brought its spherical fist to its mouth as if blowing a kiss and sent it toward Frings.
