[783] Alpha Fish (1)

The Ex Machina was a perfect cube measuring 4 meters in width, length, and height, weighing 7 tons.

It was made of smooth metal with a black surface engraved with golden Hena, the language of angels.

"It looks like a giant meta gate."

Minerva agreed with Sirone's observation.

"Even though Archangel Kariel created it, the technology is still fundamentally based on the Mecha system."

Uorin added, "The Mecha race likes perfect cubes. It might be for technical reasons, but this form itself can be considered Mecha."

Thinking of the magical warehouse Estas and the Mecha civilization they had encountered in Heaven, they found themselves nodding in agreement.

"Let's begin."

When Death opened the Ex Machina, there was space prepared for five people.

The card game players who had already done the demonstration entered first, and Iruki moved in last.

"Hang in there, Iruki."

Four people sat in a row on the second floor while Iruki took his position in the center of the first floor.

When he placed his palms on the hemispherical glass attached to both armrests, a drone-like device descended from the ceiling.

With the brainwave detection device covering down to his nose, Iruki flipped his right hand and gave a thumbs up.

"No need to push yourself too hard from the start."

With Death's words, the Ex Machina's exit closed, and shortly after, a terrifying mechanical sound began.

The noise filled the vast warehouse, causing Sirone to cover his ears and slowly step back.

The sound grew louder over time, and when the 7-ton weight began to shake, Death shouted, "Damn it! I told you not to overdo it!"

The noise was so severe that it seemed like only his lips were moving, but the seriousness of the situation was clear enough.

"Iruki..."

Twenty minutes passed quickly, and finally the hellish sound disappeared as the exit opened.

Dense steam poured out as the iron door opened, and Iruki immediately burst out.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

He collapsed on the floor, vomiting gastric fluid, causing everyone to rush toward him.

"Iruki! Are you okay?"

With shocked eyes staring at the ground, he hadn't yet realized this was reality.

"What happened?"

When Sirone turned with reproachful eyes, the card game players came down with bitter expressions.

Guardio looked down at Iruki and said, "He passed."

It was truly monstrous brain function.

"The tutorial we presented was manipulating the winner of a four-person card game."

"And then?"

"Midway through, Iruki took charge first. Said it was boring? So we escalated things too."

Neth said, "The test was this: In a tournament with 300 card game participants, change the final winner to whoever we designated."

Agaya added, "Not only every game's outcome, but real-time financial status of all 300 people, even lottery draws had to be manipulated. He passed the test by consecutively making 17 designated characters—the greedy, the foolish, beautiful women, etc.—into final winners."

"...You're saying he did that kind of simulation in 20 minutes?"

In reality, it would take at least a month's worth of information, and just hearing about it made their heads throb.

"Ugh, I'm dying. My head's spinning."

As Sirone supported Iruki who was wiping his lips and getting up, she exploded in anger.

"Tell me honestly! You used Overdrive, didn't you?"

If sparks from the cortex were escaping through the pupils, no one could live long.

"It's fine. This much is nothing."

Man-Transcendence meant surpassing the barriers of a specific realm, which Overdrive also applied to.

However, what Iruki was breaking through wasn't the natural world but the biological world—specifically, his own body.

"What do you mean 'this much is nothing'! It's not even real combat, just a test! Why push yourself? I..."

The memory of Iruki attempting Overdrive during graduation exams remained painful for Sirone.

"If something happens to you...!"

Sirone's eyes grew hot.

"Sirone, my father once said there are many people in the world who want to do this but can't."

Just because it came to me doesn't make it mine.

"If those who can don't do it, we—humans—can never move forward."

Sirone recalled the day she first met Iruki.

'Right, that's the kind of person you were.'

In the solemn atmosphere, the card game players also acknowledged him with one heart.

'I thought it was just youthful recklessness...'

A young man who willingly shouldered a burden as heavy as his enormous talent—he was more than suitable as a partner to fight alongside.

Iruki patted Sirone's shoulder.

"Anyway, I've adapted now. There won't be any more embarrassing displays like this, so don't worry."

Neth said, "No, you really did well. When we first operated the Ex Machina, we were out cold for almost an hour."

Agaya said, "We'll start proper training tomorrow. Today, let's have a briefing. Follow us."

Now that they'd accepted him as part of the team, Iruki needed to know what the card game players knew.

"See you later, Sirone."

Following behind them, Iruki looked back at Sirone and winked.

"..."

It meant not to run away.

The empire's capital viewed from the spire was dark as the deep sea, except for a few small lights like fireflies.

'Amy...'

Knowing why Iruki had specifically asked to meet today, Sirone couldn't sleep either.

"Sorry. The meeting ran late."

Iruki slid down from the top of the spire like going down a slide, stopping just before falling by placing his foot against the railing.

"Whoa. This is your room?"

Lying on the slope with his arm as a pillow, Iruki's eyes reflected countless stars twinkling in the night sky.

"Nice. Not stuffy at all."

Sirone smiled welcomingly.

"Did the meeting go well?"

"It's quite an elaborate strategy. The problem is that finding the Alpha Fish won't be easy."

"The one who loves Havitz most?"

"Yeah. Alpha Fish is also called Pilot Fish. When keeping ornamental fish, it's the fish that goes in first to condition the aquarium environment."

Iruki raised his index finger.

"It's important to button the first button properly. We could find Beta Fish—those who hate Havitz—if we looked, but..."

Thinking the conversation would get long, he set aside work talk and moved to the main topic Sirone wanted.

"The others are doing well too. Nade is developing technology at Dragon Thunder, Dante got a job at the Tormia National Intelligence Service. We've had meals together a few times..."

He missed their days at Alpheas Magic School.

"Maya rejected offers from famous agencies in other countries and signed with a performance planning company in the Kingdom of Tormia. Fermi seems to have left the kingdom, and also..."

Being Dragon Thunder, which handled national affairs, Iruki was well-informed about his classmates' situations.

"Everyone's living busy lives."

However, about the person he really wanted to hear about—Amy—there was no mention at all.

"...How is she doing?"

Finally, Sirone asked.

"Hah."

Iruki opened his heavy mouth.

"After you said goodbye through dreams and left, she passed the public examination. And recently, while training as a Tormia Magic Corps officer..."

"While training?"

Sirone swallowed nervously.

"She seems to be dating another officer she met. If you ever meet her, she wanted me to tell you thanks for everything."

"A-Amy did?"

Sirone's face went pale.

"Hahaha! Just kidding! There's no way Amy would do that without even talking to you."

Sirone was truly angry.

"You really! Even as a joke, saying such things...!"

"I almost wish that were the case."

Iruki cut him off.

"She quit training midway and came to me. She was holding recruitment papers for the Holy War. She needed a recommendation letter, so I got it written through someone I knew."

"Holy War means... Valkyrie?"

"Right. You know what that means? Tormia isn't that serious yet. But the Holy War seeks out battlefields. Either way, it's a life-threatening situation."

Amy's voice echoed dreamlike.

I'll go.

"To meet me..."

"Right. You called me. Because you needed me. But not Amy. She's risking her life and throwing away her future trying to become someone you need."

Sitting up, Iruki looked down at the capital.

"I wanted to stop her, but I couldn't. I felt good when you called me with that letter. So I understand Amy's feelings. Same with Nade—we want to fight alongside you."

Sirone remained silent.

"How about... visiting the Valkyries once? You could talk to the Empress. She's the leader of the Holy War, right?"

"It's actually the opposite."

Knowing Uorin's feelings, showing favoritism toward Amy wouldn't be good.

'No, she probably already knows.'

She wasn't foolish enough to ruin things over mere jealousy, but there must be a reason she hadn't told Sirone.

"It's not confirmed yet. She has the kingdom's recommendation, but all applicants have that. If she can't pass the Valkyrie's own training, she'll return to Tormia."

"She'll pass."

Even without mentioning the Karmis family name, there was no way she would give up when trying to meet Sirone.

"...Right. That's exactly the problem."

Both young men sighed.

"Iruki, you said you felt good when I called you."

"I did."

"It's the same for me. I would too. If the day comes when I can meet Amy with confidence..."

Bright energy swirled in Sirone's eyes.

"It really means I need Amy. I believe Amy will definitely succeed."

If that day comes.

"Spring is already here."

It was a dawn warmer than yesterday.

Southern Kashan.

The city of Harmattan was an area dense with the empire's military facilities, and also home to the Valkyrie Army Command.

"One! Two! Company! One! Two! Company!"

Valkyrie applicants from around the world raised their voices as they entered the training center, where Amy was among them.

"Hurry! Get in there, you bastards!"

There were roughly 300 people, and unlike ordinary armies, over 30 percent were women.

"Men this way! Women that way!"

After submitting recommendation letters and receiving name tags, instructors as fierce as tigers barked orders, separating men and women.

"Hurry, hurry! Why so slow! Do you still think you're the flowers of your kingdoms, you idiots!"

Though all applicants were talented individuals favored by their kings, no one unexceptional made it to the Holy War.

'This place is no different.'

Having gone through each nation's special schools and passed public examinations, they were as familiar with competition as breathing.

'Just climbing higher.'

Amy chanted the company formation with a calm expression, and other applicants also seemed emotionally unchanged.

While waiting with name tags pinned to their chests, an instructor pointed at an iron gate with his baton.

"This is your grave!"

A sign hanging under the arch read: "We welcome those who have applied to the Valkyries."

'There's a typo.'

It was the most eerie thing since arriving here.

"Everyone enter!"

As the military band began playing, the instructor threw both arms up and shouted:

"Welcome to hell, corpses!"
