Electric Civilization (1)

Seventy warships were rapidly advancing through the windless zone on the sea.

"Captain, it's a dud."

The flagship, of unprecedented size in the world, was equipped with all kinds of weapons.

"You don't need to report every little thing. This is just a greeting. We need to fire a shot to get them fired up too."

The Jakra Pirates.

Famous pirates of the South Pacific, led by Jakra, the younger brother of King Dionas.

"But it was a dud."

His flaming red hair and wickedly slanted eyes gazed across the sea.

"How awkward. Open all gun ports."

Iso Jakra.

One of the world's 100 most dangerous individuals, a master of Schema unmatched in naval combat.

"Open the gun ports!"

The ship slowly rotated to the left, and 120 gun ports opened along its side.

The cannons extended with an ominous vibration, pointing forward like thorns.

"Power level 3. Fire."

The crew member operating the controls turned his head.

"Uh, Captain. If we fire all 120 Electric Guns simultaneously, our own hull will be blown away too."

"It's fine. Fire."

It definitely wouldn't be fine, but Jakra was the type who didn't care about consequences.

The vice-captain spoke up.

"How about we lure them first? His Majesty's orders were to avoid direct confrontation if possible."

For Dionas, making an agreement with Arachne wasn't necessarily a losing proposition.

The problem was Rangi.

Pirates could always steal treasure again, but humans were irreplaceable.

The Jakra Pirates' job was to induce combat and lure her away.

"If we just take Rangi, there's no reason to be at a disadvantage in negotiations. The opponent is Yahweh. There's no need to provoke them unnecessarily, is there?"

"Yahweh, huh."

Jakra had heard of him.

"What... he supposedly saves the world and stuff? Why doesn't a guy like that come to me? Honestly, aren't I the most pitiful person around?"

The vice-captain got straight to the point.

"He's strong. Has an impressive record."

"Right, so he's incredibly strong. Meanwhile, I'm just a cowardly, vicious, half-wit pirate scumbag."

The vice-captain didn't deny it.

"Kahahaha! Fine! I'll show you a pirate's battle. Kill the weak ones first! Torment them, threaten them!"

Jakra jumped up and pointed forward.

"King or whatever, on the sea I am god! If I decide to do something, it gets done! Blast them!"

The vice-captain sighed, turned around, and nodded, prompting a crew member to input coordinates.

"120 Electric Guns ready. Power level 3. Estimated projectile speed... Mach 4.2."

People still on deck watched Poine with blank expressions.

Half of the cannonballs that fell with a thud were dented with finger marks.

"What? She caught cannons with her hands...?"

Only a select few on the sailing ship knew that her true identity was a dragon.

"Messiah."

Poine approached Shirone, who was still watching the enemy fleet.

"The projectiles exceeded the speed of sound. If you hadn't been watching ahead, there would have been casualties."

This was why Shirone maintained his position.

"How's your hand?"

Even with a dragon's durability, she was still a living being—there were limits to how much cells could be strengthened.

Poine examined her right hand.

"It's fine."

Her fingertips trembled involuntarily, and the skin on the back of her hand was torn.

"But I can't guarantee the next one. I think we should strike first."

If Shirone permitted it, she wanted to fly up right now and boil the sea with poison.

While he was lost in thought, people evacuated and Arachne's sailing ship approached.

A knight order equipped with Flight Artifacts flew vertically into the air and landed on the deck.

"What's the situation?"

Pushing past the knights, Foreign Minister Cairns approached.

"Pirates. They're probably acting on orders from the Kingdom of Dionas, but there's no way to confirm it."

Cairns felt no sense of betrayal.

"Tch! That's definitely their style. By the way, where the hell did that bastard Benahar go?"

He was probably hiding somewhere among the refugee ships, but searching three hundred vessels was impractical.

Shirone said.

"This is just the beginning. If combat breaks out, the damage will spiral out of control. Retreat."

"We'll fight too. We've assembled our elite knight order for situations like this."

For him, having already been defeated by Shirone in negotiations, this was a battle he couldn't give up.

'If I lose the initiative here, I'll lose even Mica's relics to Shirone.'

Looking back at the Arachne sailing ship, Shirone made eye contact with Rangi standing on the deck.

"...Do as you wish. However, if you've decided to fight, I'll classify myself as a combatant too."

This meant that depending on circumstances, he could become a strategic sacrifice, and Cairns agreed.

"Of course."

As the knight order moved to the front of the deck, Poine wore a serious expression.

"They don't seem interested in dialogue."

Through the giant lens of light that Shirone deployed, a warship with over 100 open gun ports was visible.

"Th-that's..."

Hot heat shimmer appeared above the warship, and it moved away at tremendous speed, pushing through the sea.

'Faster.'

The knight order witnessed 120 cannonballs approaching faster than sound, but...

'Dodge.'

Reaction was impossible.

Being unable to avoid something at close range was a familiar pattern to the brain, but...

'Huh? Huhhh?'

When faced with something approaching at incredible speed from a distance, their nerves screamed.

KWAAAAANG!

When the roar arrived, the knight order felt as if time had reversed.

'Hand of God.'

The cannonballs had already arrived, creating the illusion that Shirone had moved afterward.

"Kugh!"

Shirone scattered the 120 cannonballs he had swept up with his hand of light into the air and shouted.

"Poine!"

As if she had been waiting, Poine's lips twisted wickedly and her skin began to crack.

"KRAAAAANG!"

The knight order stared blankly as she soared into the sky, transforming.

"Dragon..."

Compared to commonly imagined dragons, she had an exceptionally lean and elongated body.

"Kugh! Take cover!"

Sensing the gravity of the situation, the knight order retreated with Cairns to where the captain's quarters were located.

Just the poison seeping between her scales made it difficult to breathe.

"Insignificant humans..."

This was why Shirone restricted the apostles' transformations—once transformed, not a trace of humanity remained.

'She's furious. I can't stop her.'

Given her personality, even if it meant being killed by the Messiah, she would go through with it.

"Follow me!"

Shirone spread his wings of light and flew toward the pirates, with Poine following behind.

"Karrrrrr!"

A boiling sound came from the poison dragon's throat, and thick green smoke billowed out abundantly.

"KRAAAAANG!"

300 meters from the pirate fleet, Poine cast her breath attack—Mist of Despair.

The smoke, expelled like a meteor's tail, instantly filled the sea.

Screams from the pirates could be heard.

"Gas! Gas!"

The charging time was short for one of the 12 apostles at 2 hours, but its duration exceeded 2 hours.

"Aaaaah! My flesh is melting!"

Hearing the screams erupting from within the giant green cloud, Shirone checked on the allied fleet.

'At this distance, it should be fine.'

If this weren't a windless zone, the poisonous smoke would have been carried by wind and killed their allies too.

"Kukuku, the smell of rotting flesh is fragrant."

Shirone glanced at Poine, who was stretching her neck to look down below, and sighed.

"Even so, what are you doing casting a breath attack? Now we can't identify the enemies."

"You permitted the transformation, Messiah. If it wasn't a one-hit kill, our allies would have suffered heavy casualties."

They were indeed handling dangerous weapons.

"Huh?"

Suddenly realizing the air's properties had changed, Shirone hurriedly turned his head.

The green cloud that had been simply floating was gradually picking up speed and rotating.

"What?"

Giant electric bolts shot out from the cloud, striking down lightning-like branches in all directions.

'Magnetic field?'

The green smoke scattered outward, revealing a warship wrapped in a magnetic field.

"Kahahaha! Is that all? Even dragons aren't much. Right?"

At Jakra's words, Poine's eyes became bloodshot.

"I'll chew you up personally."

"Wait a moment."

Something was off about the enemy formation.

"There aren't enough ships. More than thirty have disappeared."

Grasping the situation, Shirone looked behind to see the missing pirate ships pursuing the refugee vessels.

'I didn't see them?'

Like magic, the ships had moved through space.

"Save the world, Yahweh!"

From where the voice came, Jakra was pointing his index finger skyward and laughing.

"Huh? Or can't you? Because they're all going to burn to death on 'Birdron' soon. Puhahaha!"

Poison leaked from Poine's body, but compared to Shirone's killing intent, it was pure matter.

"...Wait for me."

The moment his wings of light flapped, Shirone's body streaked across the sea like lightning.

"Kugh!"

Flying at tremendous speed, Shirone looked at the pirate ships' positions and was certain.

'Even flying like this takes over 2 seconds. Definitely a physically impossible phenomenon occurred.'

From the thirty pirate ships, thousands of shadows rose like birds taking flight.

'Are those the Birdrons?'

They were small spheres with vibrating metal wings that scattered in all directions as soon as they locked onto targets.

"Damn..."

Shirone moved, and thousands of Birdrons traced massive arcs before striking the allied fleet.

KWAAAAANG!

A chain of explosions erupted, so massive that their firepower was evident even from a distance.

"Puhahaha! What? You call that Yahweh? That's nothing! Now who are you going to protect?"

The crew members trembled at Jakra's attitude, completely ignoring the dragon floating in the sky.

'He's our captain, but he's genuinely insane.'

It was amazing how he always led battles to victory while completely disregarding power balance.

"Hey! If you're pissed off, why don't you come down? I've always wanted to catch a dragon!"

As Jakra drew his sword and taunted, Poine, who had been watching the smoke, turned her head.

"I am not the one who will punish you."

At that moment, a crew member looking toward the horizon with binoculars shouted in surprise.

"Captain! Over there...!"

Jakra frowned and pressed his temple, causing light to enter his pupils.

Where the Birdron smoke had cleared, instead of refugee ships, there was a Hand of God.

"What? Where did they all go?"

As if showing him, the Hand of God opened its palm, but there was nothing there.

As Jakra's expression turned cold, the Hand of God waved quickly.

Then the next moment, as it struck down at the sea, nearly three hundred refugee ships appeared.

Neither the pirates nor the refugees, not even Poine, could understand the situation.

"Hand of God."

Shirone said.

"Slate of Hand."
