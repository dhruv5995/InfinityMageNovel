[636] The Final Gateway (2)

'You're the most impossible one of all!'

Leaving behind the silent outcries of those who had been eliminated, Nade approached Shirone.

"I'm sorry."

"It's okay. Let's fight with everything we've got."

"No. That's not what I mean."

The electrical activity surrounding Nade's body decreased, flickering as if falling asleep.

The fact that he had achieved perfect control over magical assimilation was itself extraordinary, and the power unleashed from it would be beyond imagination.

"You're blessed, Shirone."

Shirone didn't respond.

"You could do whatever you wanted to do. Even if you failed, there'd be no one to blame you, and everyone around you would be cheering you on."

Nade turned and began walking.

"But do you know? While you were fighting fiercely and steadily accumulating victories, someone else was being deprived of even the chance to fight fiercely, screaming in agony."

Nade's steps stopped.

"Effort? Experience? If you think that's enough to say you did your best, then you're foolish."

Nade had finished steeling his resolve.

"The reason I'm saying this is because if not now, you might never get to hear it. If you fight me, you might die."

His resentment toward the world, that nameless rage, grew larger and awakened the monster in Nade's heart.

"Give up. This is my final warning. You cannot defeat me."

"Alright. I'll give up."

The colosseum stirred with murmurs.

"If that would make your pain disappear, if it would make you happy, I can give up as much as you want."

Nade gritted his teeth and lowered his head.

"...That's why you're foolish."

Using Spark magic to instantly close the distance, Nade appeared before Shirone and extended his hand.

"You said you have no roots. But you don't realize how beautiful what you have is. Are you saying that something like being first in the graduation exam means nothing if it's for a friend?"

"No. This is an important exam where my life is on the line too. Maybe it's even more important than a friend. But..."

Shirone was sincere.

"It's not more important than a friend's suffering."

'This is why I hated it.'

This was why he had desperately hated fighting Shirone.

Being with Shirone made his disgusting jealousy and rage toward the world seem too vivid.

"Stop spouting nonsense!"

Struck hard in the face by Nade, Shirone spun around and collapsed to the ground.

"You're always like that! Do you think I'll be moved if you say things like that? Do you think the world works however you want it to!"

"If you put your mind to it, you can do anything!"

Shirone pushed himself up with both arms and shouted as he rose.

"So fight with everything you've got! Don't ruin your life because of some anger!"

"Some anger?"

Hearing the sound of his reason snapping, explosive electrical power surged from Nade's body and rose in the form of a thunder god.

"Some anger, you say!"

KRAAAAAA!

An electrical roar erupted as the audience covered their ears.

I'll kill them all!

As Nade's hatred manifested through magical assimilation, Shirone also activated Avatar and fought back.

The moment the thunder god and light angel filling the colosseum collided, all sorts of simulation data raced through the analyst's mind.

"Similar, but different."

Light and electricity.

The dazzling magical combat that perfectly projected each one's nature left not only the audience but even the scouts mesmerized.

The thunder god's hostility was so violent that even the light angel had to give ground, but to Liz, it seemed she could hear Nade's screams within the roars.

'Nade, you mustn't lose hope.'

Achieving perfect control over magical assimilation itself demonstrated genius unprecedented in history.

But he doesn't shine like Shirone.

Everyone die! Friends, family, humans, all of you disappear from before my eyes!

"I won't let that happen!"

Shirone, pushed back to the edge of the colosseum, planted both feet firmly on the ground and activated Quantum Superposition.

"I'm going to become a mage!"

A 300-fold Photon Cannon bombarded the colosseum like a meteor shower.

A mage, you say...!

Nade shed tears of blood as he discharged lightning.

"I am a monster!"

The moment Shirone saw Nade's face emerging through the torrential flashes, tears welled up in his eyes too.

'No, Nade. You're not a monster.'

As Nade's cry calling himself a monster left the audience holding their breath, Baical spoke.

"If he had received proper education."

If he had been given the opportunity to hone his magic with everyone's encouragement and support.

"The talent he would have eventually reached."

Who made Nade into a monster?

'I'm sorry, Nade.'

Ballroom couldn't lift his head, feeling like everyone around him was staring at him.

"...No."

Meanwhile, Teria still glared with frightening eyes, denying her son's pain to the end.

"It's not my fault."

The thunder god, collapsed beyond recognition, projected Nade's hatred and formed a massive electrical net.

"I thought he was always a bright child."

At Olivia's words, Alpheas smiled bitterly.

"He wasn't exactly like that when he was young. He overcame it well. The fact that he lived a normal life while embracing magical assimilation is itself a miracle."

"It's heartbreaking. If only we had known a little sooner..."

"No. I want to believe it's not over."

Alpheas didn't give up.

"When getting angry becomes too bothersome, humans become adults. But youth knows no compromise. Being angry means there's still longing left in the heart."

The purist ideals of youth that wish for not a single blemish on life.

That's why Nade, who had ruined most of his life with hatred, might be in even more pain right now.

I am a monster!

Just from the movement of electrical charges filling the colosseum, Shirone's mental strength continued to diminish.

'Ugh! This really is tremendous magical power!'

Who can understand my anger!

Young Nade, captured by bandits, had to dangle over a pit filled with thorns with his hands and feet bound.

Biting down on a rope with only his teeth while being tortured, his mind was slowly going mad.

When even the mocking voices could no longer be heard, half-unconscious Nade dreamed of swimming in a vast ocean.

A terrible nightmare where he could see land in the distance but no matter how much he flailed his limbs, he couldn't advance even a little.

Nade. Nade.

The nightmare from that time, trapped in Nade's unconscious, began to emerge once again through the thunder god's body.

Save me, Nade.

Teria rose above the surface like a water ghost and pressed down on Nade's back.

'Swim! Let's go together, Mom!'

I don't want to do anything. So you save me.

'It's too hard, I can't!'

It's okay if it's hard for you. Because I need to be happy. Because my happiness feels the best.

"Hnghhh!"

As if he were still biting the rope, Nade clenched his jaw until his molars might break.

'I want to live! I want to live too!'

Right. So keep swimming! Save me.

'I don't want to anymore! I won't swim!'

Then we'll die together. Your life will end too.

"AAAAHHH!"

Waiting for parents who never returned, Nade wanted to let go of the rope in his mouth.

He really... wanted to let go.

"What would you know!"

Shirone wouldn't know.

What kind of pain it is to live your entire life unable to cut away rotten roots.

"How could you possibly know!"

As the thunder god's lightning intensified, shockwaves of anti-magic rushed in at tremendous speed.

There was nowhere left to escape.

"Right, I don't know! But you can't give up!"

Shirone's heart also felt like it was tearing as Nade's life was vividly broadcast through the thunder god's voice.

"Fight to the end! Struggle to the very end!"

Nade's face twisted grotesquely.

'Don't talk nonsense!'

Why wouldn't he want to live?

But even if he fought fiercely, all he'd gain would be Teria's satisfied smile, and his heart would become even more diseased.

"I'm going to die! I'll destroy everything and die in the most painful way possible!"

He would die.

If he could make those who had shirked responsibility onto him and escaped from life suffer, nothing else mattered.

"And you still tell me to struggle? Without knowing anything, you tell me to fight more!"

"Yes! Fight!"

"Why! Why should I! When I'm the only one in pain, why should I!"

As the thunder god's lightning struck with unprecedented power, Shirone's mental strength, which boasted powerful durability, was shaken.

"You idiot! Why don't you understand!"

Still, the reason he could endure was that if he collapsed here, no one would be able to stop Nade's destruction.

"If you don't fight... if you don't at least struggle..."

Tears flowed from Shirone's eyes.

"You'll sink!"

As unprecedented magic was cast, countless Shiroes began overlapping at a single coordinate.

Quantum Superposition

The Wheel of Emptiness.

It starts with double-layering.

Shirone unfolds Four Dimensions as the base, and from that state, a newly overlapped Shirone activates Quantum Superposition once more.

So what would be the result?

Miro, who knew that answer, widened her eyes and shouted.

"He's insane! What is he thinking with that!"

Since events occurring in Four Dimensions are independent, even feeding back the overlap just once makes control impossible.

In other words, it was an emptiness fractal.

'How does he plan to control it?'

Even Shirone himself could no longer know how many events were overlapping.

Some Shiroes would stop overlapping, but if even one among thousands made a different judgment, the fractal structure would begin again from there.

Eventually, he would be trapped in what's called a quantum bubble phenomenon, where nothing could be done except overlap.

"Krrhhh!"

All the Shiroes lost activity under the weight of endlessly overlapping events, but desperately waited for the limit of control.

'I can do it. I can integrate them.'

As events increased, variables would also increase, and those variables would exponentially increase the number of variables that would occur in the future.

'Now!'

The moment he reached the limit of variables that could be controlled across all time, Shirone's eyes widened as he glared at the world.

Ultima System

Elysion.

As the unified Shirone stopped activating Quantum Superposition and simultaneously raised his head, Miro's body trembled.

'So there was such a method.'

To others, it appeared to be one Shirone, but Miro could clearly feel the terrifying presence contained within.

'And perhaps this is McClane Guffin's true ability...'

Quantum fluctuation.

'Live! Live, Nade!'

As Shirone flew into the sky and compressed photons, a massive sphere of light fluctuated as if a hole had been punched in the heavens.

The power of the God particle drawn up from the realm of emptiness was nearly equal to Samadhi, the level Miro had reached.

The scouts who witnessed that transcendent realm lost even the will to analyze, simply accepting the tremendous phenomenon.

'Ah, God. Is that how it is?'

Alpheas shed tears of emotion.

'Am I... all right as I am?'

The light of the Mirhi family.

The mistake he had made in his youth had tormented him his entire life with guilt over betraying his God-given talent.

But at this moment, the genius he had waited for so long since establishing the magic school, one who would surpass him, had appeared.

'That true light is not extinguished by darkness. That I as a human am nothing more than a tool to kindle that light.'

Beyond the curtain of the world turning white, it seemed as if God was extending His hand.

Your sins are forgiven.

At the voice that rang like certainty after decades of waiting, Alpheas knelt and raised his head.

'Ah, is this why You show me this, God? Your creation...'

The greatest masterpiece.
