[781] The Definition of Evil (3)

War had broken out.

The Gustav Empire, which had rapidly advanced toward Cotria's capital, now had the fall of the enemy nation right before their eyes.

'Gustav Habitz.'

Sitting atop the spire of the imperial palace, Shirone gazed at the night sky with sad eyes.

'Pure evil.'

When he heard the news that the Gustav Empire had buried alive 70,000 citizens of Pasipa City, his vision went dark.

What's more, the commanding officers hadn't even shown up, and the captured women were sold as slaves to their own countrymen.

'How can someone wear the guise of human form and...'

Once Cotria fell, the Gustav Empire's gaze would turn toward the entire world after finishing their cleanup.

"I need to find a solution quickly."

Just as Shirone was muttering to himself, Minerva flew up to the spire on a jet.

"When did you get back?"

While the card game players were searching for a way to kill Habitz, Shirone had focused on sealing the altars.

"An hour ago. I've almost blocked off the area around Agaroth. How's the design for 'Legal Murder' coming along? Any progress?"

Minerva shook her head.

"I've roughly figured out the framework, but there's a lot of detailed coordination to do. First off, the amount of change in the laws is too vast, and we need to carefully approach the alpha fish and beta fish we're looking for."

Shirone said glumly.

"I see."

"Still, it's becoming clearer bit by bit. Once we resolve a few key issues, we can put it into action immediately."

"Yes, please do."

Shirone prepared to leave Agaroth.

"You haven't forgotten, have you?"

Minerva asked.

"You're dealing with the altars here because you're staying in Kashan. Remember that the Holy See is a human organization, and Uorin is also using you to pursue her nation's interests."

"I know that much."

Uorin was not pure.

Though she looked down at the world from the top with the power of Mitochondrial Eve, she was human through and through.

Her reason for wanting to kill Habitz was also because his evil nature threatened Kashan's future.

'Whatever she's thinking...'

In the end, she was someone who lived for herself, so he couldn't treat her as simply as Nane or Miro.

"Nothing will change. I also don't want Habitz to destroy the world. Same goes for the altars."

"Well, that's a relief, butâ€”"

Just as Minerva was exhaling through her nose, Kando shot up from below the imperial palace, reversing lightning upward.

"Her Majesty summons you."

As Shirone turned to look at Minerva and raised his hand to emit Yahweh's light, their figures instantly disappeared.

"There you are. Good timing."

Upon arriving at Uorin's room, an unfamiliar figure sat across from the card game players.

"Who is that person...?"

"An envoy from the Cotria Republic. He entered Kashan through the Holy See's highest security channel. Gustav doesn't know."

Knowing they were already on the verge of collapse, he could roughly guess why the envoy had come.

'But it's probably already too late to turn back?'

The Cotria Republic's intention to form an alliance with Gustav had been thoroughly shattered by the live burial of 70,000 people.

'Are they grasping at straws?'

With Cotria Republic's collaboration coming to light, even the Holy See had turned their backs on them.

"Sit down for now. We don't have time, so I'll explain quickly."

Uorin spoke on behalf of the envoy.

"To cut to the chase, we're going to reincorporate the Cotria Republic into the Holy See."

Minerva asked.

"What do we get in return?"

Even if Uorin was the leader of the Holy See, she couldn't unilaterally recognize a nation that had tried to collude with the enemy.

"An ancient weapon. They'll provide Ex Machina to the Holy See."

"...That's sufficient."

Minerva was convinced, but Shirone, who didn't know about Ex Machina, was still puzzled.

"Is it a weapon powerful enough to change the war situation?"

"It could be, or it might not be."

As Uorin passed the floor to an expert, Ness from among the card game players spoke.

"Ex Machina is an anti-law weapon. It changes the laws within its radius. It's not certain, but there's a theory that Kariel, the Archangel of Creation, made it."

Kariel had been annihilated.

"Though it's called a weapon, it's closer to a computational device. It detects and analyzes all factors that a specific variable influences, running simulations until the desired result comes out. We can modify the laws based on those results and reapply them."

Mayth said.

"For example, if I want to eat pasta for dinner? Someone nearby has to make pasta. Then for that person to think about making pasta? Their wife would have to buy pasta ingredients from the market. And for the wife to buy pasta ingredients?"

Agaya said.

"By digging endlessly like this, we can find the initial factor needed to get the result we want. It might be absurd - it could be because some man 4 kilometers away from here fell down in the morning."

Goodio said.

"Of course, what Ex Machina provides is just a simulation. But if we use those results to induce that man 4 kilometers away to fall down in the morning?"

Shirone gulped.

"We can stamp out exactly the result we want at specific spacetime coordinates. A single picture among countless possibilities. A picture of the entire city showing the scene of Mayth eating pasta this evening."

That's why it was called a weapon.

"It exceeds human brain capacity."

Goodio nodded.

"It's awkward to call an angel a genius, but without Kariel's level of creativity, it would be impossible to make something like this. Anyway, with Ex Machina, our design becomes even more perfect."

Uorin interjected.

"The most credible theory is that Ex Machina's origin lies in battles with the ancient Gaians. The purpose would have been to control their actions against heaven, but..."

Minerva said.

"No other Ex Machina has been discovered besides this one. It might have been lost, but they might not have mass-produced them from the beginning."

"They stopped... production?"

Shirone thought of one possibility.

"Right. If it's the latter, the Gaians solved the Veron problem. They became able to change the future through their will alone, breaking free from the laws. Whether it was originally possible or they reached that point, I don't know, but..."

"They reached it."

If it had been possible from the beginning, Kariel wouldn't have made it either.

"The 11th sense, Ultimate."

A race that achieved an integrated mental system by breaking through even Ex Machina's laws in resistance to Ankera.

'Gaia.'

Shirone missed them, whoever they were.

"By the way..."

Breaking from his thoughts, Shirone asked.

"No matter how severe the power difference, if you have such an ancient weapon, why were you pushed back so helplessly?"

The envoy said.

"Ex Machina isn't omnipotent. There are three main reasons we lost to Gustav."

The envoy's fingers folded one by one.

"First, lack of personnel. As you can tell from Ex Machina's functions, performance varies drastically depending on the user. This was originally operated by angels. Without at least equivalent brain function, you'll go insane the moment you enter the device."

That would certainly be the case, so he didn't want to go in.

"Second, radius limitations. Ex Machina's maximum radius is 200 kilometers, wide enough to be called a map weapon, but it can't even cover a quarter of the Cotria Republic. We've managed to defend the capital because of this. That's why we're having alliance negotiations like this."

The envoy clenched his fist.

"Third, General Balkan. I don't know how it's possible, but he's reacting almost instantaneously every time Ex Machina changes the laws."

It was crowd reading.

"When we change something, they change too. Because they counter with new responses every time, overload occurs, and eventually all five Ex Machina users died. We have a second team, but with the first team defeated, we can't afford to fight."

Revealing their nation's internal situation in detail meant they were staking everything on this alliance.

'The same applies to the Holy See. If Balkan reads military moves, our side also needs the five most outstanding people...'

Shirone raised his hand.

"Wait, five people?"

The envoy explained.

"Originally it was space for one angel, but it's equipment that transcends the amount of information humans can process. So they modified it to connect four brains in parallel and connect the remaining one in series to make the final decision."

As Shirone looked at the card game players, Agaya shook her head.

"We'll enter the parallel side. Not just because of brain function balance, but because teamwork is important in that position."

Though they had lost to Balkan, when it came to teams, they were undoubtedly the strongest quartet.

"Then who's the remaining person?"

"The Holy See will find us a good partner. The important thing is that they're in a position to decide our opinions. If it were just a machine-like servant good at calculations, every nation would have a few, but..."

"It's a problem that requires value judgments."

Ness nodded.

"Environmental factors are basic - you need to be able to solve human emotions with equations. You need the qualities of a gambler who can take risks while having brain function that doesn't fall behind ours. Creativity is important too."

Those were quite demanding conditions.

"We'll leave it to the Holy See, but the first person who comes to our minds is Snake from the Black Line. He's now joined Zion under his real name, Sein. If it's him, it would be possible."

Sein's Wheel Eyes calculated emotion and reason simultaneously, but Uorin made a troubled expression.

"I'll send an official document requesting cooperation, but it'll probably be difficult to bring him."

"Why? Zion would want to stop Habitz more than anyone?"

"Heaven's movements are ominous now that Terraforce no longer judges law-breaking. Currently, Sein is deployed to heaven's defense line following Miro. He won't be able to participate in this matter that could take months."

Since it was as important an issue as Habitz, the card game players also gave up their lingering attachment.

"It's tricky. Most servants are weak in emotion. What we need isn't an excellent calculator but a perfect gambler. But finding such a person is..."

"There is someone."

Shirone's eyes shook with excitement.

"Someone who can express human emotions as equations..."

He had once designed hologram routes by predicting the emotions of all students at Alpheas Magic School.

"Outstanding computational ability."

When he emitted electricity from his eyes, he could calculate all events that occurred in the city for 3 seconds.

"A gambler willing to take risks when necessary."

He had led Scramble Royale to victory.

"Such a... person exists?"

While Minerva tilted her head, Uorin was smiling meaningfully.

"Hmm, indeed... That would be interesting."

Encouraged by those words, Shirone stood up and looked at Uorin.

"May I recommend someone?"

She readily agreed.

"That would be an honor. With Yahweh's recommendation, even the Holy See couldn't carelessly raise objections."

As Shirone smiled, two people pointed at each other and spoke simultaneously.

"Mercordyne Iruki."
