Underwater Maneuvering (2)

The Arachne sailing ship.

In an upscale restaurant where sweet melodies from musicians could be heard, Cairns enjoyed lamb.

"Where did Langi go?"

He was only thirty-four years old, yet held the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs—third in the kingdom's power hierarchy.

"She said she had some business and went to the refugee ship. Should I call her back?"

"The refugee ship, huh."

He paused mid-chew, lost in thought, then nodded slowly as he continued.

"She went to meet that guy called Shirone. One of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars. What kind of guy is he?"

The formally dressed mage standing beside Cairns bowed respectfully.

"Yes. He's one of the world's four great transcendents and head of the Ivory Tower's Integrated Universe Management Department. Currently, around the world..."

Cairns waved his knife.

"Ah, no need to recite what's written in the files. How strong is he? If you fought him, who would win?"

Even if it seemed like a childish question, things were different once you reached a certain level.

"He's strong. Naturally, since he's a star of the Ivory Tower, and he's stepped into the infinite realm—the highest level of magic."

"Huh? That's it?"

There was no way his secretary would show deference when naming any mage.

"He's not someone I can make guarantees about. But if we were to fight with everything on the line..."

The secretary's name was Benahar.

"I'd predict my victory by a narrow margin."

He was a mage at the pinnacle of the mercenary world, with a record of defeating multiple officially certified first-class grand mages.

"Interesting."

Cairns said as he cut his lamb.

"The Ivory Tower is just mages anyway. Set up a meeting. I'll try to recruit him."

"Bringing him won't be a problem. If he refuses, we can just drag him here by force. However, most of the Ivory Tower's stars don't have much material desire. I'm not sure if negotiations will work..."

"Tsk, tsk, tsk."

Cairns clicked his tongue and shook his head.

"Do you know what most humans are mistaken about? They believe there are humans who are detached from things like money, women, and power. But there are no such humans. Why? Because they're human."

He made a circle with his finger.

"Some guys will fall for just 100 gold. But others will snort at 100 million gold. So is negotiation impossible?"

Benahar listened intently.

"No. If they refuse 100 million, give them 1 billion. If they refuse 1 billion, give them 10 billion. It's ultimately a matter of quantity and quality. You should understand what I mean, right?"

"Of course."

The amount Cairns had invested to hire Benahar reached 28 billion gold.

"There can't be men who are detached from women either. How would that be biological? Of course, some might be prideful. So what do you do then? You push with charm they can't refuse. Not just appearance, but body, personality, tendencies, intelligence, dignity, interests—you create a custom match for that person and hit them with it."

Benahar felt anew.

'Politicians aren't quite sane either.'

The reason he couldn't dismiss it as bluffing was directly connected to Cairns currently being Minister of Foreign Affairs.

"People all live the same way. There are only differences in degree. That's where negotiation starts."

Cairns put down his utensils and wiped his mouth.

"Bring that human called Shirone before me. If I observe him for about 30 minutes, I'll get a rough estimate."

"Understood."

As Benahar left the restaurant, staff members came with carts to clear the dishes.

"That was delicious."

When he handed over gold coins with a gentle smile, the staff member bowed even deeper.

'Always the same reaction. Humans are no different from machines. Machines enslaved by desire.'

Cairns was an ambitious man.

The young child who had dreamed of world conquest early on displayed exceptional skill and became a minister in his mid-twenties.

'The king of Arachne is just an intermediate step. Through this expedition, I will make a tremendous leap.'

The pinnacle of the world was unfolding before his eyes.

As if suddenly remembering Langi, he clapped his hands.

"Right. I have something to return."

She pulled a book from her diagonally worn bag and held it out to Shirone.

"Huh? What's this?"

"During the World Beauty Contest, you left this book at the hotel, Mr. Shirone. I've been keeping it."

"Ah, right. This book."

When he turned the book over, the title "The Grand Mage Who Slays Dragons" was written at the top of the cover.

"An interesting book."

Shirone gave an awkward smile, sensing barbs in Poine's words.

"I just bought this to pass time while traveling. Ah! So it was at the hotel."

"Yes. It was funny at first, but it got interesting as I read. Especially when the protagonist ripped out the dragon's heart at the end—it was really satisfying. Oh, haven't you read it yet?"

As murderous intent flared terrifyingly from the two apostles, cold sweat ran down Shirone's spine.

"...Haha."

Poine cleared her throat and said,

"Anyway, I have business to attend to, so I'll be going. Please have a pleasant time."

"No, there's really no need to..."

Langi grabbed Shirone's arm.

"Oh my! Then let's look around the deck. This is my first time on this ship. Thank you, grandmother."

As the two moved away to the end of the deck, Chaos turned toward them.

"How is it?"

Poine's eyes narrowed.

"She's not ordinary. She didn't notice the killing intent, so her combat ability is zero. But her emotions are hard to read. She's a professional."

"Really? She seemed sincere though. Anyway, isn't it fine as long as she's favorable toward the Messiah?"

"How naive."

Poine clasped her hands behind her back and turned away.

"Human goodwill is fragrant poison. Get intoxicated by the sweet scent and your lungs will rot."

Chaos followed behind, saying,

"I'm deploying to stop the next tsunami. Will it be okay if you leave your post too? Arachne's movements seem suspicious."

Poine looked back at the Arachne sailing ship.

"The aura is certainly strangely strong. I don't know who put those powerful people all on one ship, but..."

Her eyes narrowed.

"They're just humans after all."

Langi's face was sad as she looked at the sea.

"The damage was less than other countries, but many people died or were injured. There was someone I was seeing, and he was swept away trying to save me."

"I see."

"I lived with a self-destructive mindset for a while. Then I heard Mr. Shirone was coming. You know how it is, right? Someone in your life you can never forget."

Langi said with tears welling up.

"Even knowing it was a dangerous mission, I felt like meeting Mr. Shirone would somehow give me breathing room. Ah! I really feel like I can live. I couldn't tell this to anyone."

Just as Langi moved a little closer, Shirone said firmly,

"What's the real reason you came here?"

Langi's eyes wavered for the first time, and Shirone didn't miss that change.

"I'm well aware of your charms, Langi. But what could you gain from me by lying?"

"I'm not lying..."

She could make any excuse, but Langi realized there was no need.

'My true feelings can't be conveyed anyway.'

When she raised her head again, Langi's expression was different.

"Mr. Shirone, actually..."

Then a voice was heard.

"There you are."

As both turned simultaneously, a man in a suit was walking toward them.

"Mr. Benahar."

"I've been looking everywhere. Even for you, Langi, rules must be followed. Outing time is 30 minutes."

Langi covered her deliberately exposed shoulder and turned around.

"I'll be going. It was nice meeting you."

Thinking there was still more to discuss, Shirone called out to stop her.

"If you have time later, would you like to have dinner together? I'll come find you."

Langi's steps stopped abruptly, and one of Benahar's thick eyebrows twitched.

"Yes."

Langi smiled brightly.

"I'll wait."

Watching her first truly sincere expression, Shirone was puzzled.

'Arachne. What are they plotting?'

Benahar said,

"Sorry, but the appointment is canceled. You have a prior engagement. I'll tell Langi myself."

"Who are you?"

After sizing up Shirone's capabilities, Benahar extended his hand for a handshake.

"Arachne Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary General, Benahar. I've heard of your reputation. One of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars."

Shirone was not authoritative.

Therefore, his curiosity about someone who didn't use honorifics toward a Five Great Star was pure interest.

"Ah, yes. Nice to meet you. But what do you mean canceled? That's an appointment between Langi and me."

"The Minister wants to see you. I'll arrange a quiet meeting, so come over to the Arachne side."

"No, I mean, I have a dinner appointment with Langi. Why should I follow your orders?"

"Sigh."

Strength entered Benahar's eyes.

"Because even that Langi is the Minister's property. Don't you understand priorities?"

"Prior appointments come first. And people aren't property. Take that back."

"It's not exactly wrong. But we call things we can trade 'property.'"

It was precisely Cairns' philosophy.

"Trade?"

Feeling the person wasn't worth dealing with further, Shirone shook off Benahar's hand.

"Tell the Minister this: if he wants to meet me, come to the time I want and the place I want."

As he said this and walked away toward the captain's quarters, Benahar cracked his knuckles.

"Can't be helped."

If he and an Ivory Tower star collided at full power, the entire ship would explode, but...

"That would be fine too."

Just as he deployed ice and flame magic in both hands and launched himself from the deck.

"Ugh!"

Shirone turned around.

'What is this feeling...'

Just the Spirit Zone he felt before even casting magic made his heart feel like it would burst.

'No. This can't be. It must be a technique.'

There had to be a way to break it.

'Avatar technique? Or maybe Yahweh's rumored ability? It could be some kind of mental...'

As Shirone took one step closer.

"Gasp!"

Benahar unconsciously opened his mouth wide and expelled all the air from his lungs.

'It's not a technique? Is this really a human's...'

Pure spirit?

"...Listen carefully."

At the suddenly heard voice, Benahar realized his consciousness had been cut off momentarily.

Shirone's position, now standing right in front of him, told him how long it had been.

'Why does he look so tall?'

By the time his senses returned and he realized he was kneeling.

"I'll go meet the Minister. I've changed my mind, so tell him clearly."

"Y-yes..."

"The Minister should prepare definite answers to the questions I'll ask. If I don't get the answers I want, Arachne will never achieve what it desires."

"Y-yes."

As Shirone released his Spirit Zone, the organs paralyzed by shock began moving rapidly.

"Ah, ahhh..."

Hot steam rose from beneath Benahar's feet as he convulsed while gripping the ground.
