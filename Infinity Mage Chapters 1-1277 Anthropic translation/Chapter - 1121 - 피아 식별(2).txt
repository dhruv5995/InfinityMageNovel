Friend or Foe Identification (2)

Ikael had been expecting this.

'She must feel hurt.'

To Wizard, Sirone was her only teacher and the pillar she could lean on.

'It's only been seven years since she experienced the world. But her abilities as a biological entity are top-tier.'

Even so, she loves.

Though she lacks adult desires, that's what makes her feelings pure and blind.

'Sirone can give what parents cannot. This situation was bound to happen.'

For an ordinary child, this would be something to just laugh off.

But Wizard would soon have to stain her hands with the blood of Satan, the most evil being in the world.

'I hope there won't be any emotional changes. When she kills Havitz, I hope she'll be in a pure state.'

Like a machine.

'If she fights for someone, if she has to kill out of necessity, if such thoughts seep in...'

Variables arise.

'Sirone couldn't be unaware of this fact. So he accepted it knowing the consequences.'

Sirone could have made Wizard into a weapon solely for killing Satan.

'But he couldn't be cruel. He couldn't drive a child's life to ruin.'

That was Yahweh's greatest weakness.

'I have to help.'

Having ruled heaven as an archangel, she understood the price that comes with conviction.

'This isn't something he can do alone. Sometimes... one must be cruel.'

Guffin would probably be angry.

'I'm sorry.'

She no longer wanted to see her son bearing humanity's suffering alone.

In the awkward atmosphere heading toward Zive, Wizard suddenly looked up.

"If Satan dies, will peace come to the world?"

Her gaze turned to Amy.

"Well, of course. This world became so turbulent because of Satan."

Ikael listened silently.

"But the world was turbulent even before Satan came. I heard there was a lot of fighting."

"You heard that from Sirone."

Amy knew what Wizard was trying to say.

"Yes. He said Satan was created by human hearts. Even if we kill Satan right now, if we don't achieve an integrated mental system, the world won't change."

That was Yahweh's philosophy.

"That might be true. But we do what we can. Wizard, you'll be the beginning of that."

Wizard let go of Amy's hand.

"If Satan dies and peace comes to the world, will you marry Sirone?"

"That's uncertain. I love Sirone, but marriage is something for the distant future."

"Is that okay?"

"Hm?"

Wizard frowned.

"If you love someone, you want to stay with them forever. You seem very confident."

Amy couldn't explain the trust built through countless battlefields she and Sirone had crossed together.

"You'll understand when you grow up."

"I wonder about that. Time is running short for that. There's only a future if I kill Satan."

Amy sensed barbs in Wizard's words and turned around, only to hear surprising words.

"If I kill Satan - if I succeed in the mission - can you promise me? That you won't marry him until I become an adult."

Amy had been young once too.

To seek love from her individualistic family members, she had sometimes acted difficult.

'Sirone must be her everything. She might be certain there's no one better.'

When there was no answer, Wizard spoke again.

"I was just curious about your thoughts. Don't worry too much about it. The heart is something..."

"Wizard."

Amy stopped walking and crouched down, causing Wizard to quietly avoid her gaze.

"I know how much responsibility you're carrying. Your feelings for Sirone too. I'll do anything I can for you as you fight for humanity."

The child's lips trembled.

"When Satan disappears from the world, I won't marry Sirone until you become an adult."

Rain fell in Wizard's heart.

'That's not what I meant.'

She had only dreamed, knowing there was no way for everyone to be happy.

As Wizard's eyes welled up with tears, Amy smiled.

"Weâ€”"

At that moment, the triangular Mara Ashur appeared beside Ikael and drew his sword.

"Take cover!"

Before he could finish speaking, Ikael threw herself forward.

KWAAAAANG!

A tremendous impact struck the earth at a point 23 kilometers from Delta.

Around the crater with flowing lava, Ikael's group reappeared.

Amy checked on Wizard.

"Are you okay?"

The child, who had switched to battle mode, was glaring at the massive archangel.

"Who is that?"

Amy looked in the same direction.

"Uriel."

Uriel, the Archangel of Destruction, rose while creating a magnificent vibration.

"Ikael, how long did you think you could avoid me?"

Ikael had an intuition.

'He's made his resolution.'

This was also the situation she least wanted to face.

Ashur bowed his head.

"I apologize. Though I blocked all signals that could expose our location, the narrowed range..."

No matter what deception was used, Ikael coming to Zive was inevitable.

"No. I'm also responsible. I couldn't react to his approach."

The fact that he had penetrated even the sensory heavy bombardment showed Uriel's strength.

"Please take Wizard away. I'll hold him here."

"However..."

Ashur hesitated.

'Can she really win? Uriel has never seriously attacked Ikael.'

Though he never showed it, Uriel respected Ikael more than any other angel.

'Ikael, the source of all concepts, becomes a force just by existing.'

It wasn't just Ymir's strength.

'No child overpowers their parent just because they're stronger. That too is a kind of force.' To Uriel, Ikael had been such an existence, but now the Archangel of Destruction intended to break free from the source's shackles and finally reveal his power.

Ikael said:

"...This is a wound I inflicted. I need to talk with Uriel. I'm counting on you."

Ashur bowed and manifested next to Wizard through his signal ability.

"Let's go. We'll move to Zive."

With the stealth signal broken, Satiel would also soon discover Ikael's location.

Amy stood up.

"I think one more person should stay."

As Ashur looked up, a Mara in training clothes was approaching with large steps.

Uriel's second-tier Mara, Aruta.

His sole reason for existence was understanding martial arts, and his level far exceeded humans.

Aruta spoke:

"Uriel desires a private meeting with Ikael. I will eliminate anyone who interferes."

"Wizard, go."

Amy said, but Wizard shook her head.

"No, I'll do it. I'm confident."

"You can't win. Go."

Of course Wizard was strong, but all her training had been conducted with Havitz in mind.

'Even with talent that surpasses experience, she chose the wrong opponent this time. This guy is strong.'

If asked what kind of strength, she couldn't answer.

But if someone had trained only one thing over tens of thousands of years, this would be that kind of aura.

'There can't even be a 1% chance that Wizard becomes unable to perform her mission.'

Wizard was stubborn.

"I can win. If I struggle against someone like this, I won't be able to kill Satan either."

"Don't be arrogant."

The reason Wizard was unique was because only she could break through Vanishing.

"You're still far from ready. Go catch Satan."

"At least compared to you, I'm more...!"

Just as Wizard was about to shout, Amy glared at her with burning red eyes.

"I said go!"

Wizard's shoulders flinched.

Thunder struck in her heart, and before she could say anything, Ashur activated his signal.

"Be careful."

Following those last words, Wizard disappeared, and Amy exhaled and said:

"Don't even think about chasing."

"Don't misunderstand. This is according to Uriel's decision - I don't do cowardly things."

"Really?"

Amy snorted.

"You deliberately came when Sirone wasn't around, yet you speak so grandly. Were you that afraid of Yahweh?"

Aruta's muscles bulged.

"I'll say it again..."

Uriel said he had something to discuss with Ikael, but explaining would be more pathetic.

Aruta withdrew his words, lowered his stance, and brought his right fist to his side.

"I'll end this in an instant."

At that moment, his aura changed overwhelmingly.

'So that's it.'

All the principles needed to subdue an opponent with fists seemed to concentrate into one point.

'One killing blow.'

If he failed, his level would collapse, but he was confident he would never fail.

'Bad compatibility.'

The red eye's ability maximized from the second round - the key was whether she could avoid the first strike.

"Your expression doesn't look good. Are you afraid?"

At Aruta's words, Amy lifted the corners of her mouth.

"As if."

From her body filled with the spirit of never retreating, flames that burned the air erupted.

"Come at me."

The battle would end with dodging the attack and counterattacking, and Aruta knew this too.

'Interesting.'

Amy's aura, flickering like fire, was following the laws of nature itself.

With each keeping one simple strategy in mind, they faced off.

"Uriel."

Ikael spoke to Uriel as he rose above the crater.

"I know I'm not qualified. But Satiel will destroy humanity. She's not in a state to make rational judgments right now."

"I know."

Uriel, landing on the ground, approached Ikael closely.

"Isn't this what you wanted? You abandoned angels and heaven for one human you love."

"I didn't abandon them. I just..."

Before she could finish, Uriel's fist struck Ikael's face squarely.

A roar erupted, and the ground split in a V-shape along the path of Ikael's flight.

Uriel, looking at the radially opened landscape, stomped the ground hard.

Arriving faster than the thump of the sound wave, Ikael was crouched at his feet.

"I could have killed you."

Just now too.

"I've thought countless times since you left. Whether I should really annihilate you. You, the source of all angels..."

"It seems you've made your decision."

Ikael still had strength remaining but didn't move from where she had fallen.

'Uriel can destroy everything.'

The reason she could control him was because Ikael was the conceptual origin of all angels.

'It must feel like self-harm.'

This was a strike of different weight from mutual antagonism and bickering.

And that was truly the mindset of wanting to kill someone.

"Get up. Let's have a good fight. Even if you seek sympathy this way, my thoughts won't change."

"What do you want?"

The moment they clashed, the world would shake, but the result wouldn't change.

'I can't perish yet. At least until Sirone fulfills his will...'

Ikael looked up.

"If you demand an apology, I'll give it. Even something greater than that - I'll follow your will. Give me time. I still have work to do here."

"I merely destroy."

Uriel slowly raised his foot.

"I've already thought enough to be sick of it. More thinking than I've done since my birth..."

His expression, meeting Ikael's gaze head-on, was cold as metal.

"Let's end this."

The judicial halo Ragnarok activated, and his foot flew toward Ikael's face.

KUUUUUUUNG!

Just by stopping his foot in front of her nose, the entire landscape behind was blown away.

If he had seen even a moment's fear, he would have blown her face off.

The gaze looking at him without a shred of doubt, that expression, that bearing, that dignity.

'Kariel.'

So much like a mother.

'This is the first time I understand you.'

Before this other force that only Ikael possessed, Uriel found himself conflicted again.
