Face-to-Face (4)

A day had passed.

"Ow."

As Amy opened her eyes in bed and moved her body out of habit, muscle pain surged through her entire body.

'Feels like I fell off a cliff.'

Clutching her aching back, she limped over to look out the window.

She could see Nane and Shura, who had gotten up early, working on a small garden.

'What are they doing?'

The world was racing toward destruction, yet this so-called Buddha of the age was out there tilling fields.

Sensing her gaze, Nane straightened his back and looked toward the cabin.

Taking in Nane's smile, Amy recalled what he had said yesterday.

'He needs to make sense.'

It was understandable that he wanted to become like Shirone's heart in order to understand Shirone.

'Does wanting something make it love?'

The moment she asked herself that question, she suddenly realized something.

'Why do I love Shirone?'

Perhaps, as Nane said, simply throwing your heart at someone was all there was to love.

"Ugh, forget it! It's not my business to worry about anyway."

What worried her more was what Shura had told her yesterday about heaven's army arriving.

'Havitz alone is overwhelming enough. Iruki's going to have a hard time. No, it's not just that level...'

It would be the worst war in history.

Having thought that far, Amy looked at Nane with different feelings than just moments before.

Though his face was covered in tattoos making him look fierce, his smile was nothing but pure.

'He doesn't seem like a bad guy.'

She didn't want to imagine what would have happened if she'd been captured by Havitz instead of Nane.

'If he would become Shirone's ally...'

Above all, Nane was the one who had devoured Ankera's dream, the one who controlled heaven's army.

As if reading Amy's thoughts, Nane shook his head with a mischievous expression.

"Hmph!"

When did he say he loved him, anyway.

'No, that's not it.'

Since having such expectations was dangerous in itself, Amy shook her head.

'I have no choice but to fight myself.'

Though her body was still too weak to even run, magic wasn't done with the body.

When she opened the cabin door and went outside, Shura stood up, removing the hood she'd been wearing.

"You're so lazy. Hurry up and come help."

"Why should I?"

"Those who don't work shouldn't eat. Don't you know that? If you don't want to starve, at least pick out some pebbles."

Not eating for a day wouldn't kill her, but she didn't want to be childishly stubborn.

"I'll take a hoe too..."

Nane interrupted.

"Is your body alright?"

"Don't worry. I'll earn my keep."

Nane smiled warmly at Amy puffing out her cheeks in a sulky manner.

"A guest doesn't need to work. Leave this to us and do what you want to do. If you go into that forest, there's a good place for mental training."

"I said I'm fine. And I'd prefer if you didn't act so familiar with me. It gives me goosebumps."

Nane wasn't offended.

"Don't be like that, go take a look. You're a soldier - with the world on the brink of destruction, you'd burst with frustration leisurely tilling fields. It's not good for your health either."

Reminded of her mission, Amy came to her senses.

"Right, exactly. What am I doing here? Whether you feed me or not, I'm going to train."

Without even listening to a response, she turned and walked away. Shura threw her hoe down in irritation.

"Ugh, so annoying! Acting like she's something special."

"A Hwagye isn't exactly nothing special."

Shura fell silent.

Amy might have once been just a powerful mage, but now she was a system unto herself.

'That pillar of fire back then.'

The massive flames that had pierced the sky at the Canian Plateau still flickered before her eyes.

"Tch!"

Shura glared at Nane.

"Then all the more reason we don't need to be nice to her, right? She'll be our enemy someday."

"I told you. If I can't understand Shirone, I can't become a true Buddha. Same goes for Shirone. He's probably realizing the truth of emptiness right about now."

"It's not just because she's pretty, is it?"

"Haha! I can't deny that."

Shura's eyes grew hollow.

"What kind of Buddha are you?"

Nane patted Shura's head.

"Pretty is pretty. The first quality in facing truth is not turning away from facts."

Since the Buddha's words were always right, she should have just accepted it this time too.

'Why am I being like this?'

What was this feeling crushing her heart ever since Nane confessed to Amy?

'Buddha, why am I by your side?'

For the first time, that small fact felt more immense than the secrets of the world.

Shura never asked in the end, and Nane just returned to tilling the field with his characteristically benevolent smile.

'Ignite!'

The moment the cartridge for ignition, the foundation of flame magic, was loaded, fire blazed up from Amy's body.

"Whoa."

The power was tremendous, surprising even herself.

'Is this flame incarnation?'

She felt like she had become flame itself rather than a mage who handled flames.

"But this isn't enough."

She needed at least the level of power she'd cast at the Canian Plateau to fight heaven's army.

"Huff. Huff."

Since she'd already faced death once, she was afraid to take the first step, but...

"Here I go."

Amy was a soldier.

'Crown of Gonggeop.'

As her focus endlessly drilled toward gonggeop, her consciousness grew distant as if her brain had opened.

'I can't give up!'

If she couldn't control the inertia of the Crown of Gonggeop, she would die just like at the Canian Plateau.

"Grraaaah!"

Her red eyes flashed thirty times per second, but control was impossible - the flames grew endlessly.

'No! No!'

The moment she realized the line of control had snapped, the flames blazed up as if oil had been poured on them.

"Sermon. Suppress."

As Nane's voice resonated through the world, the flames of Hwagye subsided as if pressed down.

"Gasp!"

Like she had been submerged underwater to the point of drowning and someone had grabbed her hair and pulled her up.

"Haa! Haa!"

Amy's mind bounced back into the world.

After panting with unfocused pupils for a long while, she slowly turned her head to the side.

Nane was scratching near his eyebrows with a troubled expression.

"This is problematic. I recommended mental training, not training with death-defying resolve."

"What's it to you?"

She wanted to snap at him fiercely, but since his sermon had helped her, her voice was small.

Nane walked over with his hands behind his back.

"Your flame incarnation is dangerous. It's rare for humans to actually awaken natural elements as incarnations. Unless it's someone like Shirone."

Hexa itself was light.

"Of course, Amy is special too. It seems like a fire spirit dwells within your human mind."

'Jack O'Lantern.'

The fire spirit Shirone had given her outside heaven had grown together with Amy.

"You're saying that manifested as an incarnation?"

"You've maintained a higher affinity for fire than others. Of course, it's a level that can't be reached without tremendous training. It's a double-edged sword. If you can't handle it properly, it will hurt the caster."

'Flame incarnation isn't simple.'

She had felt through her recent demonstration that it wasn't something that got stronger through repetitive training like magic.

'Spiritual cultivation.'

It required special enlightenment that could control not just the mind but the heart.

'Though I can't exactly start meditating now. Actually, would it even work if I tried?'

Amy knew better than anyone that she was far from being a spiritual seeker.

Nane asked.

"Shall I help you?"

"No thanks. I'll research it on my own."

If she hadn't heard yesterday's conversation, it might have been different, but she didn't want to owe Nane any more debts.

"Don't think about it so complicatedly. It's natural to help someone who's fallen into mental demons. It has nothing to do with Shirone. And probably, I'd be a pretty decent teacher."

He was the closest to rightness in this world.

"I know. But I still don't want to."

Nane let out a deflated laugh.

"You're really stubborn. Then let me give you a hint. You're not far off. Of course, there's no big or small when it comes to being wrong, but that's how enlightenment is. A momentary flash. If you just shift direction a little, it could be solved in an instant."

"In an instant?"

"Yes. It depends on how you do it. But for that, you need to put down your stubbornness for a moment."

Amy pouted her lower lip.

"Shall we try again? Don't worry about anything and try completely opening your incarnation."

Nane spread his right arm.

"Sermon Wall."

An ochre-colored wall spread out like a fan, blocking the surrounding scenery like a net.

When Amy looked at him with suspicious eyes, Nane shrugged.

"I at least need to protect my land."

"Hmm, fine."

Though she didn't hear the incantation, she felt something from his words about completely opening the incarnation.

'I was scared.'

This time she would definitely control it.

'Crown of Gonggeop.'

As her red eyes lit up, flames blazed fiercely around Amy again.

"Grrrr!"

So this is why it's difficult.

'I understand it in my head, but...'

She had thought the heart was lighter than a feather, yet fear still remained.

Her mind was being sucked in.

"Gasp!"

Again the flames grew uncontrollably large, hitting the ceiling of the barrier Nane had created.

'I need to stop here...'

Then Nane's voice echoed in her head.

"Don't stop."

What?

"You are fire. You don't stop until you've burned everything. Grow larger. Grow endlessly."

"Endlessly?"

A momentary flash crossed Amy's mind.

'I see!'

The only thing that could control fire.

"Kyaaaaa!"

Amy broke through the limits of fear and raised her firepower in a state of selfless absorption.

'Yes! Burn! Burn everything down!'

As if she had become a bomb, Amy's mind was swept up in the will of fire.

"Gaaaaaasp!"

The moment the will of fire drilled in, transcending the speed of gonggeop, a tremendous catharsis washed over her.

"That's right."

Nane smiled.

"That's exactly it."

When Amy came to her senses, what she saw were flames surrounding her.

"This is..."

Though small in size, the flames pointed in all directions like a hedgehog's quills.

"The will of fire."

Nane clasped his hands together and spoke.

"The true meaning of Hwagye is to become fire yourself before fire can consume you. Remember that what suppresses Hwagye is an even greater Hwagye."

"I did..."

Amy, who had been listening to Nane's words in a daze, threw both hands up and shouted.

"I did it! I actually did it!"

She had dominated fire.

She had finally reached the level she had desperately dreamed of since her magic school days.

"I did it, I did it! I...!"

Nane watched her jump around with tears glistening in her eyes and smiled warmly.

"You really do love magic. Congratulations."

Amy's movements stopped abruptly.

"...In the end, I received help."

"You're the one who did it. I was once a mage too, so I know how desperate that feeling is. And saying a few words doesn't count as help."

"It's different if it's the Buddha's words. Honestly, if it had been someone other than you, I wouldn't have been able to risk my life following them."

"If you dig that deep into it..."

As Nane scratched his head awkwardly, Amy felt a little sorry too.

'Right, I should accept kindness as kindness.'

"I really have no ulterior motives. You're the one who risked your life, and no spiritual seeker would ever turn away from a lost soul..."

"Thank you."

Amy smiled as she spoke.

"This time, I'll accept that I received help."

Caught off guard by the unexpected response, Nane blinked for a moment, then suddenly realized.

'I see.'

He felt like he understood Shirone a little bit.
