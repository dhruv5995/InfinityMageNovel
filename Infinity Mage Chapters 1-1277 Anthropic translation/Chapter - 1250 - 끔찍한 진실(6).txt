The Terrible Truth (6)

Arius muttered.

"Tachyon?"

The darkness blooming within the Miracle Stream was truly a signal of nothingness that could not exist in this world.

Sirone's eyes widened, and the ominous light of the tachyon expanded like the sun.

As negative and positive energy caused mutual annihilation, the black hole began to evaporate.

"Oh, ohh!"

Arius confirmed the familiar scenery visible through the gaps in the darkness being torn apart.

'Ymir's maternal psychology.'

As the cracks of light increased exponentially, gravity also rapidly decreased.

Crackle. Crackle.

Noise emerged from the Ultima in Arius's hand.

"Remember."

As the connection to the outside world was cut off again, God's voice also became distant.

"Imaginary time... Even so... everything is... result... God's arrangement..."

The final message faded pathetically, and at last the darkness of the black hole completely lifted.

"Sirone!"

From the ground that still looked distant, Miro, Gaold, Sein, and Kang Nan were waiting.

Sein muttered.

"The Ultima?"

As if hearing those words, Arius held out the Ultima extracted from the outside world.

God was silent, and the most powerful intelligence became a single phenomenon and crossed over to the inner world.

On the other side of the universe, constrained by the five planets and the number 5 of the law, Ymir realized.

'Kekeke.'

The sensation of his body, which had been so enormous that he couldn't even feel its presence, began to return.

'It's done.'

As he clearly felt his arms and legs, fingertips and toes, his muscles began to contract.

'It has been truly long.'

The planets of the Five Great Stars, which had remained as points smaller than his body, rapidly distorted.

'Wait. I'll smash everything I can get my hands on.'

The rhythm of power he had been gathering for quite some time finally reached his mind.

"Uaaaah!"

Along with the battle cry spreading at sub-light speed, the number 5 of the law was destroyed.

Ymir's Deep Layer 1st Stage.

Sirone felt the simultaneous events that had been blocked until now rushing in all at once.

'I see.'

Truly many things had happened.

The reason the connection to other simultaneous events was severed after the activation of "Zhuangzi's Butterfly" was because the information from the outside world that Sirone had accepted was that heterogeneous.

But now the barrier had crumbled, and the Sirone in other simultaneous events had also realized the tachyon.

Kukukukuku!

As Ymir's Deep Layer 1st Stage shook as if an earthquake had occurred, Arius said:

"This is terrible! Ymir is being released."

Sirone was feeling it too.

'There's no time.'

If the King of Giants returned to Sirone's planet, then nothing would remain.

"Let's go down first."

As Sirone and Arius landed where Gaold's group was, Miro approached.

"The Ultima?"

Though Arius had blasphemed against God in the outside world, he was like a mouse before a cat in front of Miro.

"H-here..."

Watching the dynamically swaying blue electricity, Miro finally smiled.

"I told you, didn't I? If you do it, it works."

"Haha, yes..."

As Arius lifted his head in emotion, blood suddenly poured from his mouth.

"Urgh!"

"Arius!"

Having traveled the outside world together, Sirone was the first to support him.

Miro asked.

"What happened?"

Arius's face was rapidly turning pale and his breathing gradually weakened.

Sirone said with a sorrowful expression.

"To extract the Ultima from the outside world, he connected to it. With a human body to God's intelligence..."

Though there was no clear way to express it, Miro nodded as if she understood.

"I see."

"Cough!"

Arius spat up blood again.

"I'm fine."

Though he sensed the end of his life, his lips were peacefully curved upward.

"Here, please take this."

Arius held out the Ultima to Miro.

Only Sirone in this place would know what he had accomplished.

'Something far greater than risking his life.'

He had realized the merit of the outside world but fought to the end for his own heart, for Miro.

"What am I supposed to do with that? Why should I take it?"

Miro looked down at the dying Arius and said coldly.

"You're not saying you're dying from just that much, are you? Hey, that's just running away. Stop the nonsense and get up quickly."

"Hehehe."

Arius burst into laughter.

'I'm a lucky bastard.'

How many people in history had been born human and penetrated God's mind?

'But the best thing in my career was still...'

Seeing Miro's mind.

'Don't worry. I won't regret it or be afraid. Don't I know you?'

The last clot of blood gushed out.

"I'm sorry."

He should stay by her side a little longer, helping to maintain the dignity of someone who pretended to be cold.

"I... really have to die now."

Miro's nostrils briefly tensed.

"Is that so?"

She could not grieve.

Maintaining equanimity in any situation, the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara had no blind spots.

Miro knocked away Arius's arm that was offering the Ultima and knelt beside him.

Then she buried the dying Arius's face in her chest and whispered softly.

"You worked hard."

The corners of Arius's blood-stained mouth turned up.

'How truly strange.'

Tomb raider Arius.

He had been so far from justice that even his reputation as one of the world's 100 most dangerous people was something to be proud of.

'How did I end up here?'

He had never thought about things like "for humanity" or "I should live righteously from now on."

'It was just... fun.'

Good or evil - it didn't seem necessary for a human to worry about such things while living.

'Still.'

It was good to be able to sleep in a holy place for good.

'What will I become after death? Will that world really be waiting?'

He imagined himself laughing emptily upon learning it was all just a dream.

"Kekeke."

Go to hell.

'Even if I lived twice, no, even if I reincarnated hundreds of times, I would...'

Serve the goddess called Miro.

'Got it?'

As Arius's head fell to the side, Miro finally grasped the Ultima in her hand.

"So this is that..."

"Hand it over."

Everyone turned their heads at Ymir's voice.

"That's mine, you know."

Though countless words of rebuttal came to mind, the reason they couldn't come out was:

"Crazy."

Because of Ymir's face grinning like a demon and his fighting spirit that seemed to overwhelm the world.

Miro passed the Ultima to Sirone.

"Go. I'll hold him back."

"But..."

"That's our only hope. I'll block Ymir, so you quickly make it into an object."

By entering Drimo and using Louver's authority, the Ultima would become a perfect object.

'Can they hold out?'

Though Miro and Gaold were both masters he acknowledged, Ymir, whose source of power had been threatened, was on a different level.

"Let me make a proposal."

Contrary to his words, Sirone's group felt queasy.

"My body will soon regain its freedom. When that happens, you won't survive either. Someone scarier than me will come charging in."

The ruler of the mind, the Superego.

Just as Sirone had been before, Ymir's constrained Superego would be in a weakened state, but...

'Now it's different. If Ymir gains power...'

Sein asked.

"What do you want to say?"

"If you leave the Ultima as it is, I'll send you back nicely. Let's settle this outside."

"Hmph, how can we trust that..." Sein cut off his words.

'We have no choice but to trust.'

Wouldn't it also be sad if the universe's strongest ego told petty lies?

"Decide. You have 30 seconds left."

Kukukukuku!

The 1st Deep Layer shook violently, then a giant hand entered through the sky's curtain.

Graaaah!

As it spread the sky wide with both hands, a giant so enormous it was breathtaking could be seen.

'Ymir's Superego.'

"20 seconds."

At Ymir's countdown, the group whose hearts had dropped looked at each other.

Without speaking, they could read each other's thoughts.

"Run!"

The moment Sein shouted, the entire group ran without looking back.

Sein wasn't ashamed.

'This is right. Why would we be crazy enough to fight that monster when there's nothing to gain? Anyway, once we extract the Ultima...'

Ymir's mind would split into 10 billion pieces.

"It's over. We've won."

"10 seconds."

Ymir's eyes narrowed to slits, and the Superego in the sky raised its fist.

No matter where they ran, instant death from one blow.

'A way to avoid it...'

"Great Stars!"

Louver and Mong-a were waiting with a gate set up to escape into Drimo.

Sirone held out the Ultima and shouted.

"Quickly! There's no time! If we don't convert it to an object...!"

"5 seconds."

Graaaaaaah!

The Superego's roar deafened them, and though Louver pointed at the door and shouted something:

"...!"

No one could hear.

At the top of the ivory tower where the sky was visible.

"Grrrr!"

Argones made a more violent sound than ever and contorted his face.

"Have you finally invaded?"

With Sirone's contact with the outside world, Argones had gained the authority of apocalypse.

"I will destroy humanity."

Just as Argones was about to activate Cell Buster, Taesung opened his mouth with difficulty.

"Wait."

"Wait? What are you saying? No matter how much you love humans, humanity has crossed the line."

"That's not true. I can persuade them. Sirone, answer me. Do you really want to fight to the end?"

The Sirone in the ivory tower now also knew the truth about the Illuminati.

"I just want to protect my world."

"I see."

Taesung looked back at Argones.

"Nothing has happened yet. Give us a chance. You can do that, can't you?"

This time he spoke to Syng.

"Stop now. Do you really want Cell Buster to activate? Is implementing your ideas really more important than the survival of all humanity? Trust me. I will protect you as humanity's representative."

Syng's face contorted.

"Grrr."

Even she, the most principled person in the world, couldn't get her bearings in this situation.

'What exactly do you want me to do?'

"Syng."

Sirone said.

"I obtained the Ultima."

"What?"

"From the outside world, through someone's sacrifice. Now humanity can be unified. You don't have to fight alone anymore."

Was it true?

"As you said, everyone except me might be illusion. But won't you trust me? Leave it to me."

"Huuuu..."

Syng's face turned tearful.

'Really amazing.'

Though Sirone didn't know, faced with the question of humanity's survival, Son Yu-jeong couldn't last 10 minutes and her hair had turned white.

"Unity."

Syng said in a hoarse voice.

"You're saying we can live together? No longer suspecting each other, no longer trembling in anxiety..."

Sirone said with earnest eyes.

"Yes."

Syng didn't move for a long time, but everyone in the ivory tower waited calmly.

"Alright."

And finally... Syng's arms that had been restraining Taesung slowly began to fall.

"I'll trust you."

The obsession was broken.

But Syng's face looked peaceful and she wore a pretty smile he'd never seen before.

'So she can make that expression too.'

Though it was meaningless now, with this the stars of the ivory tower had become one again.

Sirone extended his hand.

"Let's go. I'll need your help with many things."

"Hmm."

Just as Syng was about to grasp that hand, Sirone's eyes suddenly widened and his body swayed.

"Huk!"

"S-Sirone?"

Syng couldn't move despite seeing it.

The eyes of the woman who had stabbed Sirone's heart from behind were too cold.

"How truly arrogant, human."

It was Taesung.
