[529] Helper (5)

The people in the restaurant turned their heads toward Rian.

Since Maha's Knight was the hottest topic in the area, it wasn't surprising that they were startled, but they had also intuited something from Rian's great sword and blue hair.

"Could both of them be imposters? Or maybe one of them is real."

Since it wasn't far from Rafne Village, it wouldn't be impossible for the real one to be among them.

"But that young man said it himself—that he's not Maha's Knight."

The man who claimed to be Maha's Knight was flustered when people's reactions were lukewarm, unlike usual.

Realizing that the cause was the young man with blue hair who was fortunately carrying a great sword, he approached.

"Hey, you. Is it funny that I'm Maha's Knight? What's with spitting out your food and making a fuss?"

"Maha's Knight?"

When Rian asked back, the man seized the opportunity and shouted at the top of his voice.

"That's right, I am the rising sacred one, Maha's Knight Rian!"

'So that's what this is about.'

Rian also knew from wandering the world how rampant fake names were.

Of course, he had never imagined that someone would impersonate his own name, which was nothing more than unknown.

"So you're Rian. Then what's your family name?"

Since only rumors were abundant while Maha's Knight's family remained veiled in mystery, people's eyes lit up with curiosity.

"You want to know that badly? Fine! I'll reveal it specially today! I am Rian of the Ryan family! Ryan Rian!"

One of the customers acted knowingly.

"I knew it. After all, you'd have to be at least from the Ryan family to earn the title of Maha's Knight."

The Ryan family was one of the seven schools called the Seven Swords of the Baiden Kingdom, characterized by bold swordsmanship like the Ozent family.

'The Ryan family...'

Rian put down his utensils and stood up.

There was no way a swordsman from such a prestigious family would go around impersonating someone else's name, but even if it were true, he couldn't tolerate someone else using one of the names representing his family.

"You're not Rian. The swordsman named Rian has blue hair, is nineteen years old, and uses a straight sword, not a serrated one. And his family name is Ozent. One of the oldest swordsmanship families in the Tormia Kingdom."

When Rian started saying strange things, the man flinched.

'What's with this bastard?'

His real name was Alph.

A former bandit who had led a small mountain stronghold until he was betrayed by his subordinates, now dreaming of success and fame while performing knight's duties.

"Don't spout nonsense! You think I'll be fooled by mentioning names from other countries? And how do you know that?"

Rian scratched his blue hair roughly as he approached.

"Because I'm Rian."

"Haha! You're Rian? What? Rian!"

Alph's eyes widened.

"That's right, Rian. I don't know if you're Maha's Knight or whatever, but anyway, I'm Rian. So if you want to make a name for yourself, either fight directly to earn it or find someone else's name."

Cold sweat ran down Alph's back as he never expected to meet the real one in a place like this.

'No, it's not certain yet. I'm also running a scam, so what's to say this guy isn't a fraud too? Hair can be dyed, and that sword...'

Having lived by swinging a sword, Alph couldn't lie before the true value of <Idea>.

Though it had a crude form and no luster, he intuitively felt the ideality of an object that couldn't get even a small scratch, let alone chipped teeth.

"Hey everyone, so who's the real Rian?"

"Maybe both are fake? That would be really funny! Puhahaha!"

The situation of both claiming to be Rian was ridiculous regardless of the truth, and the atmosphere in the restaurant turned circus-like.

'Damn it...'

He might be the same kind of fraud, but he could also be real, and above all, this guy somehow seemed genuine.

'Don't be ridiculous. Give up here?'

The events of the past few days flashed through Alph's mind like a revolving lantern.

The rising sacred one of the swordsmanship world, Maha's Knight Rian.

The reverent gazes from people he couldn't receive when he was just a bandit, unknown swordsmen who sought him out to build connections, and especially the treatment at pleasure quarters was simply the best.

'How did I climb this far?'

What he realized while living as Maha's Knight was that ultimately, the world was all about reputation.

With the same skill, those with fame would teach subordinates in safe places, while unknown swordsmen would wander battlefields and have their necks cut by generals' swords—that was the way of the world.

"Shut up! I am Maha's Knight! I am Rian!"

Alph decided to take the gamble of his lifetime.

He would defeat this green kid here and become the true Maha's Knight.

"Calm down. I'm not trying to fight you. You don't even need to apologize. Just go back like this and don't use the name Rian from now on. Wouldn't that end it?"

Alph couldn't accept it.

Coming out like this would make it seem like the real and fake had truly been decided.

"No! I'm the real one! If you want to use the name Rian, you'll have to kill me. What, not confident? Avoiding a fight would be proof that you're fake!"

Several people nodded as if to say 'exactly.'

It made some sense, and they were disappointed that something that could be settled with fists was being ended with words.

200 meters away from the restaurant where Rian was.

Miro was eating spicy chicken skewers, a specialty of Baiden, at a street stall selling local products.

Her outfit had evolved considerably each time she crossed borders.

Her braided hair was tied up like sheep's wool, fully exposing her neckline, and she wore a robe much larger than her body frame with red letters on both arms.

"Whew, spicy. But this is really delicious."

"...Miss, where exactly are you from?"

To the stall owner, her attire was peculiar, but her outstanding appearance made him think it was just interesting.

"I've been here and there. Oh, give me one more of these."

The stall owner handed her a freshly grilled chicken skewer.

"Take your time eating. If you eat too much, your stomach might hurt."

"It's fine. I even ate snakes in the desert."

"A fight! There's a fight in the restaurant alley!"

Just then, a man ran past Miro shouting.

"Maha's Knight has appeared! Gather quickly before you miss the good show!"

The stall owner looked at the gathering crowd and said.

"Amazing. To think Maha's Knight would come here. If it weren't for the shop, I'd go watch too."

"You know about Maha's Knight too, mister?"

"Of course I do. Isn't he the swordsman who not only annihilated bandit groups but even defeated Lamdas? The rumors have already spread to Baiden's capital. What was that name again, Rian?"

"Hmm."

Miro turned her head toward the restaurant alley and stuffed the remaining half of the chicken skewer into her mouth, chewing.

"Swing it there! Scrape down with the serrated edge! Ah, at times like that you should go for wrestling! Close the distance!"

When Miro arrived in front of the restaurant, a wall of people had already formed an arena.

Since they would naturally disperse when the guards arrived, they seemed to be burning their souls to enjoy the moment.

Squeezing through to look, the battle situation was quite peculiar.

While the burly, hairy giant swung a menacing weapon, the blue-haired youth showed no will to counterattack despite holding a sword.

"Hey, what are you doing! Fight! Are you scared? At this rate, the serrated great sword guy will be confirmed as Rian!"

The spectators tried their best to provoke, but Rian didn't even pretend to listen.

After annihilating the Red Spear Bandit Group, his killing intent had completely disappeared, and whether to cut or not was something only he could decide.

'Why are they so eager to fight? Is there really a need for bloodshed over something like this?'

Though Rian had swung his sword without hesitation at humans who had pointed blades at him until now, he hadn't become a good person.

'It doesn't feel like fighting.'

That was the key.

He felt no threat whatsoever from the sword his opponent was swinging.

'It changed after cutting down 100 people.'

Because he wasn't tense, he had composure, and therefore could see properly.

'I've become stronger.'

Finally realizing his change, Rian tasted a brief thrill even in the moment of battle.

"You bastaaaaard!"

Alph, who felt this as mockery, raised his serrated great sword to the sky and charged.

When Rian, who had been lost in other thoughts, came to his senses, the serrated blade was already descending to within 30 centimeters.

Before, his heart would have sunk, but the current Rian was seeing properly.

'Still okay. There's about a span's worth of leeway.'

When Rian applied Denai to inertia and twisted his upper body like a spring, the serrated great sword struck the ground with a bang!

"What? Wasn't that just strange?"

The spectators stirred.

The moment Rian dodged the attack, they felt as if the surrounding scenery was distorting.

Miro's eyes sparkled.

'Yaksha.'

That was the end of her judgment.

"You bastard...!"

Alph bared his teeth like a wolf, but his legs were slowly backing away.

Axing, which changes the body's laws, betrays the future situations humans expect through learning.

That sense of disparity causes optical illusions, but those who don't know can't help but feel bewitched by magic.

"Found you, Rian."

Just then, as Miro entered the duel area, Alph frowned unpleasantly and said.

"What are you? If you want to date Maha's Knight, come back later. The duel isn't over yet."

"No, it's over. I'll tell you who's pretending to be fake."

"What? Someone like you..."

Though he said that, he was secretly hopeful and couldn't openly stop her.

After all, with fifty-fifty odds, she might point to him, right?

But contrary to his hopes, Miro pointed at Alph's face as if she didn't even need to think.

"The fake is you."

Stung by his conscience, Alph flew into a rage.

"What! Don't spout nonsense! Do you have proof I'm fake?"

"Of course I do. From what I heard, Maha's Knight annihilated a bandit group to save threatened women and children. Such a wonderful person couldn't possibly look as brutish as you, right? Therefore, you're not him. No, you shouldn't be him."

Reason disappeared from Alph's eyes.

"This damn bitch!"

And the moment he brought down the serrated great sword vertically, Rian embraced Miro and swung his sword.

"Oh my."

With a bang! as the two swordsmen's blades clashed for the first time, Alph was shocked by the superhuman strength that transcended common sense.

"Crazy...!"

To deflect a great sword struck down with both hands using just one hand.

"Are you alright?"

Rian looked back at Miro and asked.

"Yes, thank you. As expected, Maha's Knight is kind."

"Please go outside. Having a third party carelessly enter a duel area dishonors a swordsman's honor."

The smile disappeared from Miro's face as she had been acting like a gentle lady.

"So you're Rian, Shirone's friend. I need you to come with me now."

Rian's face turned pale as if struck by lightning.

"You know Shirone? What's wrong?"

"I need your help. Will you come or not?"

As if there was no need to think, Rian equipped his great sword behind his back and signaled that he was ready to leave.

"I'll go. Where is he now?"

'Phew, much easier than Marsha.'

Thinking of the day-long conversation disguised as interrogation with the suspicious Marsha still made her head throb.

"This damn bitch is ignoring me!"

Alph charged at Miro from behind.

Having been the leader of a bandit group, he wasn't the type to discriminate between kids and women when things went wrong.

"I'll grind your face with this saw!"

Feeling the killing intent, Miro's eyes turned coldly calm.

The moment she gently pushed Rian's chest away and turned around, the form of Guanyin appeared in her halo.

As if separated from the world, time relativity activated, and Alph experienced something strange.

In the Scale Magician's mind, spacetime was split to the extreme, and following the trajectory of her moving arm, her palm spread out like a fan as it descended.

The serrated great sword fit exactly into Miro's prayer position, and then countless Guanyin palms pressed in succession, compressing the force.

Thud thud thud thud thud!

Just by pressing from both sides, the thick blade rippled like rubber, and finally the iron handle shattered like glass, spreading shockwaves.

"Aaaaah!"

Alph, who fell screaming, stared blankly at the smoke rising from between Miro's palms.

When she unclasped her hands, a red-hot palm-shaped iron plate fell with a clattering sound.

"This, this is..."

It was completely compressed like a thin film, and the iron that had lost its heat was burning black.

Rian looked with a bewildered expression at Miro, who was approaching while dusting off her hands refreshingly.

"Just who are you..."

As if nothing had happened, Miro smiled with her eyes and pushed Rian's back.

"Let's go. I'll explain on the way."

Thus, the final puzzle for the hell journey was completed.
