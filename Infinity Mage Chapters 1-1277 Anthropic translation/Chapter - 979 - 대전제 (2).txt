Major Premise (2)

Although Miro had maintained a critical attitude, she couldn't hide her disappointment when she heard Arius's words.

"How can there be no way?"

"The human mind is exclusive and abhors concepts that are forcibly intruded upon. That's why divers endlessly take detours using familiar concepts as keywords. Even so, they can't avoid becoming egotists. After all, it's impossible for someone to perfectly understand another person's mind. Tomb raiding is still manageable since forgetting is a natural flow for humans. But engraving something into the maternal psyche is exactly the same as what Ikael did to Sirone. They'll go insane, or might even die from shock. Usually divers proceed with a 'who cares' attitude, but this situation is different."

"Then it doesn't make sense from the start. Even if we expand cognitive limits with Agape and transplant Ultima through Drimo, if the person can't accept it..."

"I have something in mind about that."

Sirone spoke.

"If there's resistance to accepting another's concept, then we make accepting it feel natural."

Most didn't understand, but only Arius wore a serious expression.

"Hmm."

He judged it had merit.

"You mean to lower the threshold by repeating the experience."

When Sirone nodded, Miro looked down at Arius and snapped harshly.

"Explain."

"Yes."

Arius straightened his posture for the first time and began explaining.

"Humans are creatures of adaptation. We have a function that makes us consider something natural the more we repeat the same experience. For example, even the most delicious food becomes boring if eaten daily. Of course, the opposite is also true."

Arius raised both index fingers.

"Let's call Sirone's Ultima System a kiss. And assume the transplant target is someone who has never kissed in their life. In that case, when the concept of kissing is transplanted, resistance will naturally occur. Something unexperienced has been defined in their head. But what if we transplant both the experience and the memory of having kissed before? The resistance would drop to less than half."

Miro opened her mouth in bewilderment.

"So you're saying now..."

"Yes. What Sirone is suggesting is to conceptualize the entire experience with the Ultima System. There's definitely possibility. We can actually transplant familiar concepts. Even if you transplant different memories of pedaling to someone who rides a bicycle, there might be some confusion but they'll eventually accept it as their own memory. From that perspective, the mind has extremely strong self-assimilation properties as much as it's exclusive."

Miro said.

"But this isn't something trivial like kissing. We're transplanting a realm no one in human history has reached."

Arius countered.

"In the Ultima System, there's only one experience. Information in base-1 gets integrated no matter what you add to it. Once we can conceptualize it, the transplant itself will be easier. And don't speak so casually. Master hasn't kissed anyone either."

"Why bring that up all of a sudden..."

Miro glanced toward where Gaold was and sighed seeing him lost in his own thoughts.

"Fine. Then where do we get that experience? Even Sirone has never integrated with anyone."

Minerva asked.

"That 4-star resident Seong Noe. That guy's a Gaian, right?"

Sirone admitted honestly.

"Yes. But he lost Ultima. He won't be helpful for this."

Sirone knew through Omega what had happened between Adam and Eve.

Miro asked in frustration.

"Then what are we supposed to do? There's no way."

"No."

Sirone looked around at everyone.

"There's exactly one. Someone who has a perfect Ultima System with no need for further integration."

"There's such a person?"

Miro rapidly flipped through everyone she knew in her mind.

She tilted her head briefly, but when the category expanded beyond people, she finally realized and widened her eyes.

"...Ymir."

The hall stirred, and even Lian, who hadn't joined the conversation and was lost in meditation, opened one eye.

"Yes, Ymir. The only life form in the universe with experience integrating 10 billion Gaians."

As no one spoke, Sirone looked at Luber and concluded.

"We enter Ymir's maternal psyche through Drimo and tomb raid the Ultima System. Then transplant it to all humanity. That way we can end the war."

"Huhu. Huhuhuhuh."

A half-mad voice echoed through the Grand Hall, drawing everyone's attention.

Arius was shaking his shoulders frantically.

"Hehe... Kekekeke."

Though Sein was also a top figure in mental systems, he couldn't match Arius in tomb raiding, so the gathering waited for him to exhaust all his emotions.

"Haa."

For the first time, the man who had become Miro's dog with a servile mind lifted his chin like a human.

"So it comes to this?"

Then he roughly faced Miro's direction with his missing eyes and raised his index and middle fingers.

"Master, could you give me a cigarette?"

"Shut up and just talk."

"...Yes."

Arius licked his lips and spoke.

"I have experience entering the maternal psyche of Sirone, called Yahweh, and even my master Miro."

Though both were approached with ill intent, it certainly established authority.

"It was truly amazing. Yes, amazing. But in the end, it's still just one human's mind. I don't mean Sirone's or Master's minds are shallow, just that it's like that. What I really want to say is... 10 billion minds."

Unlike his trembling shoulders in fear, Arius's mouth was tinged with blissful madness.

"And their integration. I can't even imagine what kind of world it would be. Are you really going to do this? If you want to call it our only hope, let me put it this way: It's just suicide. You're giving up without even fighting."

Sirone smiled and asked.

"So you won't go?"

"I have to go."

For the first time, Arius regretted the two eyes he had pulled out when he decided to dedicate everything to Miro.

"I'll definitely go. However, as someone who will be the guide, let me say this - we're not going to survive. I'll do my best, but please keep that firmly in mind."

"Good. I'll also join through simultaneous events, but since this is the most important issue in the Ultima System project, we need more collaborators. Anyone willing to volunteer..."

Before he finished speaking, countless hands throughout the Grand Hall rose.

Lian didn't need confirmation, and Iruki, Nade, Amy, and Tess's eyes burned with determination.

Nade approached.

"Sirone, we're going too. You know how stubborn I am, right? I'm definitely going. Right?"

Sirone smiled awkwardly.

He was moved by his friends' resolve, but considering the mission's difficulty, it was an impossible team.

"Kids step aside."

Nade and Iruki glared as they turned around, but immediately shrank their necks like turtles.

Miro was walking toward Sirone, emanating the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara like smoke.

"How about me?"

Though she didn't need evaluation, it would be convenient for forming a team.

Sirone nodded after examining the ironclad aura emanating from the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara.

"You're sufficient."

When even Miro sought permission, Iruki, Nade, and Tess quietly stepped back.

However, two people still hadn't given up - Lian and Amy.

Amy said.

"Sirone, I'm going too. I've experienced Drimo and was active there."

It was Amy's wit that had saved Sirone's life.

'Amy is strong.'

Her power from conquering the Fire Realm was beyond imagination, but Sirone couldn't readily answer.

'A little... just a little ambiguous.'

That level of difficulty.

Sirone turned his gaze to the person he had most in mind when first mentioning volunteers.

'Gaold.'

He expected Gaold to naturally follow if Miro went, but he was still lost in thought.

As if Sirone's gaze contained invisible force, people opened a path left and right.

Miro walked along that path.

"What, you're not going?"

Contrary to expectations, no answer came.

"Are you really a has-been? If you can't fight, just leave. Stop lurking around in front of me."

Gangnan glared at her.

"That's harsh. He's never ruined his body for himself, not even for a moment. It was all because of you."

"Really? Sorry about that. But what can I do - it seems there's no body left to ruin anymore. You pathetic cripple."

Though the insult was directed at Gaold, Gangnan's eyes nearly reddened with sorrow.

"What gives you the right..."

Why was Miro being so harsh to Gaold?

"There's a condition."

As if he didn't even care about Miro and Gangnan's conversation, Gaold looked at Sirone.

"Please tell me."

"Instead of me going, Miro stays here. If that's decided, I'll smash Ymir or whatever."

Gaold's statement probably came from the same cold analysis as Sirone's, but to Miro it felt like unbearable humiliation.

"You bastard!"

The moment Miro rushed forward and swung her leg to strike Gaold's jaw.

'Gasp.'

Everyone watching realized it was a hallucination and blinked rapidly.

Miro was breathing heavily.

"...Just drop dead."

She really wanted to kick him, but the moment her heart's seal loosened even slightly, the Thousand-Armed Projection would break.

"Just die. Get out of my sight."

Sirone thought he understood a little why Miro was being harsh to Gaold.

Then Rufist entered.

"I am Rufist, the Magic Association President in charge of the coronation ceremony. Please follow me."

He bowed politely and looked at Pony.

"It's time for you to become queen."

News that the coronation ceremony would be held reached even the farmlands outside Baska.

"Going to see such an occasion too. People really do see everything if they live long enough. Right, honey?"

The farmer Klein's wife looked at him with disdain as he tied a bowtie over his worn clothes.

"Are you really going just because they invited you? What's a farmer like you going to do at such a place?"

"We won the war. There aren't many households besides ours where the whole family survived. Anyway, they say the city center was devastated too, so I'll look for money-making opportunities."

"If you had that kind of brain, we wouldn't be living like this. Don't go somewhere just to get ripped off."

Klein scratched his cheek.

"Why has my whole body been so itchy since last night? Did something weird happen here?"

"The only weird thing here is your face."

"Woman, the way you talk..."

Just as her husband turned his head, not seeming to dislike it, their son ran out from the kitchen.

"Dad! Are you going into the castle?"

My beloved son.

"Hahaha! Yes! Today Dad will go in and..."

The moment he opened his heart to his son, intense pain like stabbing his teeth with an awl spread throughout his body.

"Aaahhhhh!"

His son stopped in surprise, and his wife grabbed her collapsed husband's shoulder.

"Honey! What's wrong?"

"It hurts! Don't touch me! It hurts!"

He was losing his sanity.

"Where does it hurt? Here? Here?"

"I don't know! I don't know! Just every... Aaahhhhh!"

As if his pain receptors had become over 100 times more sensitive, even breathing felt like his bronchi were burning.

Farmer Klein.

He was the name of the first reported case of emotional disease infection in the Baska territory.
