The Right Choice (4)

Bashka's royal castle.

"M-Monster!"

Giants over 80 meters tall broke through the castle walls and surrounded the royal palace.

Even seasoned politicians wet themselves at the sight of bulging eyes peering through the windows.

Was this a sign of the kingdom's fall?

In the king's bedchamber, Adolf XII, who had become king in his youth, was facing his final moments.

"Haa... haa..."

Pony felt sad that the man who had opened a new age of magic would see such a sight as his last.

"Your Majesty, please do not worry yourself. The glory of Tormia will surely continue through your descendants."

"Hak! Hak!"

With the royal family gathered around, Adolf XII raised his head to deliver his final words.

"My... everything..."

At that moment, he came face to face with the giant's eye peering through the window.

"Aaaahhh!"

Adolf XII convulsed in terror and finally drew his last breath with a death rattle.

"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"

The King of Tormia had passed away.

While the royal family wept sorrowfully, only Pony maintained a calm expression.

'This is what a king is.'

Just a mere human.

'What should I do now?'

Thanks to her desperate plea to Rupist, she had learned of the disaster that would befall Bashka.

Soon an elemental bomb would explode above Bashka, and no one would survive.

"Listen carefully from now on."

"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"

When none of the royals paid attention, Pony widened her eyes and shouted.

"Everyone listen to me!"

The royals frowned and turned around.

But seeing the giant pacing outside, they were reminded of reality once again.

"R-Run!"

Just as they tried to turn the door handle, a violent torrent of water swept everyone away.

"Pony! What is the meaning of this!"

As the royals were pushed against the wall, glaring angrily, Pony said coldly:

"Where do you think you're going without even holding a succession ceremony?"

"W-Well..."

For those who had staked their lives on bloodline, royal succession was as important as life itself.

"Of course the next king will be Adolf XIII here! Why ask something so obvious?"

The three princes each had their own names, but the eldest had already become Adolf XIII.

The royals grew tense.

'What is that girl Pony thinking?'

The castle guards had already been sent to the flower garden on Rupist's suggestion.

There were a few royal guards, but as a magic school graduate, Pony could kill someone in an instant.

"If brother Tenar becomes the next king..."

As everyone watched tensely, Pony spoke:

"How about we hold a brief succession ceremony? The legitimacy of the crown must be maintained."

"Huh?"

The royals blinked.

"Look outside. This is a national crisis. We must quickly restore royal authority and lead the people."

When she yielded obediently instead of plotting rebellion as they expected, sighs of relief could be heard.

"That would be best. The throne must not remain vacant for even an hour."

The eldest royal brought Adolf XII's crown and placed it on Tenar's head.

"There. Now let's go. Quickly, quickly!"

The succession ceremony ended in an instant, and the royals hurriedly left Pony behind.

Watching her relatives hurry away, Pony smiled with relief.

'At least they have minimal courage.'

When she first heard Rupist's proposal, she had dreamed that perhaps she might become queen.

"What's so great about that?"

Now that the world had come to this, she realized that truly important things couldn't be given by others.

"You were right, Shirone."

She would survive.

At least her end would be different from Adolf XII, who died with a miserable expression.

The giant, who had been observing the interior with interest like watching a miniature world, let out a tremendous roar.

"GRAAAHHH!"

The giant's desire to crush small things would be incomparably greater than humans could imagine, but...

"I won't make it easy."

Through the gap in the wall broken by the giant's fist, a flash of teleportation escaped.

Code name Lucky Boy.

"There!"

The aircraft Neide was piloting was a self-powered flying vehicle designed for mages.

Since it drew power from external sources, it was lightweight and small, perfect for mobile missions.

'Bashka.'

From high altitude, Bashka appeared no bigger than a thumbnail, but he felt like he could see each individual demon writhing within.

It was disgusting, and if he could, he wanted to crush them with a hard boot.

'That will happen soon.'

A single elemental bomb mounted on the aircraft's underside.

'Only one shot.'

If it was a dud, the operation would fail and humanity would perish to hell's army.

Yet Iruki had insisted on just one shot.

'Even though he's so thorough...'

Who in the world could blame him?

'Don't worry. I'll definitely succeed.'

Looking down again, most of hell's army was concentrated inside Bashka or in nearby areas.

'I'll drop it here.'

When the first realistic signal reached his brain, his heart sank.

'Really? Am I really doing this?'

As if all the simulations he had imagined until now were absurd illusions.

'Everything I can see now will disappear. In just an instant.'

Thinking about life, living, civilization, and the emotions contained within - it was an unbearable weight.

"Huuuu..."

Though his heart wasn't moved, strangely sobs escaped and tears flowed.

"Timer. Timer."

So he decided not to think about anything.

'I'll just do it. Like an idiot, like a machine. Like a psycho, I'll just do my job.'

The elemental bomb's panel showed 60 seconds, and once separated from the aircraft, it would count down second by second.

'According to calculations, it will explode 200 meters above Bashka, and once it explodes...'

No life would survive.

"Here we go."

Just as Neide brought his trembling hand to the button, a sharp voice rang out.

"Capture that human!"

An army of fairies was flying toward him.

The moment he saw them, what flashed through Neide's mind was:

'Press it.'

A pure electrical signal containing all the circumstances.

With a click, the elemental bomb separated from the aircraft, and the fairies sharply changed direction.

"Catch that object! It's Lord Ikael's command!"

Time remaining until explosion: 59 seconds.

Miro swept through downtown Bashka.

"Like cockroaches!"

Every time the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara unleashed palm techniques, buildings collapsed with crashes.

"Over there!"

It was unclear who the real thugs were, but Miro's group had no time to worry about such details.

"Kekeke! You think you can catch me?"

Paimon sneered while freely moving between hundreds of points in the air.

'What an annoying ability.'

Unorthodox Ban.

An ability that isolated specific spaces and used the mobility of those trapped within.

And currently, Bashka had an abnormally high population density that didn't even need the qualifier of "world's highest."

Paimon's voice came from all directions.

"Hohoho! You moths drawn to flame! The most magnificent festival in this world will soon...!"

The roof where Paimon stood was first crushed into a palm shape, then the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara's palm techniques struck in rapid succession.

"Begin."

Having escaped the space, Paimon looked up at the high sky with ecstatic eyes.

The elemental bomb was falling.

"What's that?"

The Sun-Moon Halo created a telescopic effect in the atmosphere, and Miro's group looked up at the sky.

"Oh no!"

Even though they had prepared for death, knowing a bomb was about to explode made their minds reel.

'How much time is left?'

The timer Sein checked showed 38 seconds.

Neide's aircraft, evading the barrage of fairy attacks, increased its output.

"This is frustratingly maddening!"

Even casting lightning magic was useless as it was absorbed by the aircraft's power source, making counterattack impossible.

'I won't escape in time anyway.'

Finally abandoning the aircraft, Neide surrounded himself with plasma and began casting magic in earnest.

White electricity exploded in brilliant flashes.

"Kyaah!"

The fairy's scream was cute, but the result was horrific.

The fairies struck by lightning glowed, revealing squirrel-sized skeletons.

'What the hell are these things?'

According to information he'd heard as chairman of the Neide Group, they would be heaven's army.

The dynamics of good and evil were complex, but they were definitely not beings humans needed.

'Too many.'

The number of fairies at the main base exceeded 20,000, and there were about 1,000 in the surrounding area.

"I'll handle the human. You retrieve the bomb!"

At fairy commander Tanote's order, hundreds of fairies pursued the bomb.

'No!'

He had already thrown away his life, but the elemental bomb absolutely had to explode at the designated location.

"Stop right there!"

Just as Neide headed toward the ground, powerful restraining force wrapped around his body.

"Urgh!"

Tanote smiled coldly and said:

"Triangle Prison. Triangle Field."

Neide quickly scanned the red lines surrounding him.

He was trapped inside an acute triangle, with ominous flames flickering at each vertex.

"When three points are connected by straight lines, that area becomes mine."

'Damn it!'

Time remaining until explosion: 23 seconds.

"Iruki! Iruki! Please open the door!"

Iruki, alone in the Stella's command room, sat collapsed on the floor without responding.

Empty bottles lay scattered beside him, and his eyes had lost focus after finishing everything.

"Iruki, please."

Following Dorothy's voice came the commander's shout:

"Stand back! He said he wants to be alone!"

"How can you do this? What if he has dangerous thoughts? You know what state Iruki is in right now!"

"That's exactly why we're doing this! No, nobody knows! We can't interfere!"

The arguing voices sounded distant, like they were from another dimension.

"...I made the right decision."

Based on Lucky Boy's performance calculations, it would reach Bashka's airspace in about 5 minutes.

Iruki smiled faintly.

'I did it. I actually did it. It couldn't be more efficient. That's why...'

Was it right?

"Uaaah..."

As the fear trapped in his heart burst forth, sobs escaped without his knowledge.

"Uaaaah... uaaaah..."

Seeing himself trembling while clutching his head, Iruki was certain:

"It's over."

He wouldn't be able to live with his sanity intact.

"I'm finished."

"Iruki! Please! Talk to me! Please?"

Dorothy's pounding on the door sounded like the footsteps of death's messenger approaching.

"Uaaaah! Just leave me alone!"

When the sounds outside the door stopped, Iruki again clutched his head and wept.

"I should just die. If I just die..."

Then, a different, calm knocking sound was heard.

"Iruki."

His eyes widened the moment he heard the voice.

Thump! Thump!

His heart beat so fast it felt like it would burst, and even knowing it was a hallucination, his head lifted.

"Iruki, it's me. Can I come in?"

It was Shirone's voice.
