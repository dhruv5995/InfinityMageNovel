[609] The Five Prestigious Schools (2)

Shirone woke up sharp at 4 AM and threw off his blanket, getting out of bed.

Though darkness still hung thick in the air, he could hear his classmates bustling about in the hallway.

Those sounds of life seemed to break the stillness of night and breathe vitality into his body.

After entering the bathroom and washing himself with warm water, Shirone stood before the mirror wearing only his underwear.

'Should I have gotten a haircut?'

When you're devoted to magic all day long, nothing else matters except eating and sleeping.

'This is where it all begins.'

With each button of his dress shirt he fastened, he felt his resolve being reborn anew.

Arian Shirone (Final graduation class ranking: 27th place).

Major: Divine Particle series of Photon Magic.

Special notes: Immortal Function. Panya. Ataraxia. Elysion. Time destruction cognitive ability through Cybul Explosive Sale.

'Should I take it in one more notch?'

Amy pulled the skirt button at her waist as tight as possible.

She had lost even more weight than a year ago, so even with her blouse tucked in, her waist looked as narrow as an ant's.

'The second graduation exam.'

When she had failed last year, she couldn't see how she would endure another year.

'I gave it my all.'

Time eventually comes.

She had trained desperately day by day because she didn't want to regret it when that day finally arrived, and now those days were finally rushing back as exhilaration.

'I couldn't have prepared more perfectly than this.'

Even so, the probability of passing was one in three.

Still aiming for the distant peak of the pyramid, Amy bit down on her headband and pulled her hair up.

Karmis Amy (Final graduation class ranking: 4th place).

Major: Fire series Sniper.

Special notes: Jack O'Lantern. Fire marks using spirit batteries. Red eye self-image backup ability. Mana enhancement through Samadhi.

With a click, Fermi fastened his suit sleeve buttons and looked at himself in the mirror.

Since he always wore suits, it didn't feel awkward.

'I'll have to quit the student business this year.'

With even the Gold Wheel disbanded, it was unrealistic to expect major profits from school.

'I think it's time to leave now, Mother.'

The fortune he received in exchange for extracting Valhalla Action would transform into countless high-level magics to be showcased in the graduation exam.

Fermi winked at himself in the mirror.

"Looking sharp."

It was time for the big fish that had been crouching beneath the surface of school to head out to deeper waters.

Ardino Fermi (Final graduation class ranking: 1st place).

Major: Non-regulatory type.

Special notes: Magic collection ability through depreciation trading.

"That's it."

Arin attached the Alpheas Magic School badge to Canis's suit.

As if it had been seeping into the clothes, the magical creature Harvest emerged from the shadows.

"Kekeke, I thought I was going to die waiting. Are we finally getting out of this damn school?"

"You can't feel boredom."

"It's just a figure of speech. To think I was actually in this school for over a year. If Arcane had heard, he would have beat the ground and wailed."

'Master.'

Canis recalled the face of the Great Mage Arcane, who had been an authority on dark magic.

Though the end wasn't good, he had still given him a chance at a new life.

Canis (Final graduation class ranking: 12th place).

Major: Physical series of Dark Magic.

Special notes: Disciple of Great Mage Arcane. Deciphering of the Book of Light and Darkness. Subordination of magical creature Harvest.

"Yes, we'll definitely pass. Both of us."

At Canis's words, Arin smiled with her eyes.

Though he had always worn cheap clothes so she hadn't noticed, he was radiating surprisingly mature handsomeness in his neat uniform.

"You look cool, Canis."

"You're pretty too. But... how do I look cool?"

Arin tilted her head and smiled.

"That's a secret."

Arin (Final graduation class ranking: 8th place).

Major: Mental series of Dark Magic.

Special notes: Disciple of Great Mage Arcane. Deciphering of the Book of Light and Darkness. Extreme mental assimilation ability to grasp the essence of forms through transcendence.

"Shirone, are you ready?"

Following the knock, Iruki's voice could be heard.

"Yeah. Coming out now."

When he opened the door, Iruki and Nade were waiting, dressed neatly.

"Oho, looking good?"

It was the first time for Shirone, as well as Iruki and Nade, to wear uniforms that met Association regulations.

"You guys too. You look like different people."

Iruki's face was certainly strange enough to seem bizarre to others, but now even that looked like character.

"Current time: 4:50:32 AM. Let's go. The Association is only opening the long-distance spatial movement magic circle for one hour."

Mercordyne Iruki (Final graduation class ranking: 5th place).

Major: Detonation series of Explosion Magic.

Special notes: Servant Syndrome. Ultra-high-speed detonation equation calculation. Cancellation. Nuclear Fusion combining Double Spirit Zone.

"Right."

Shirone stepped out the door and looked back at Nade.

"But... will you be okay?"

Oscar was working at the Creas branch of the Magic Association.

Meeting him when his emotional wounds hadn't healed yet would be poison for Nade.

"I'm fine. It's already over anyway."

Though Nade was smiling, he couldn't hide his bitter expression.

West Nade (Final graduation class ranking: 21st place).

Major: Electric Shock series of Electric Magic.

Special notes: Magical engineering application of alchemy. Controllable mana assimilation in specific situations.

'Still, he made it up to 21st place.'

This was possible because all five Scramble Royale participants except Anchal had dropped below Nade in ranking.

This also caused students who had been in lower ranks to rise significantly.

'Everything's gotten tangled up. Honestly, rankings might be meaningless at this point.'

When they arrived at the assembly point, it was still dark outside, but students arriving one after another were casting illumination magic, making locations easy to identify.

"You're early?"

Amy approached, raising her hand.

Shirone and his friends, who were about to greet her, couldn't speak for a while due to her mature atmosphere they'd never seen before.

"What? Why are you staring like that? You guys look the same."

Amy felt just as awkward.

"Uniform assembly. This Magic Association president is quite the eccentric."

Cayden approached.

Since the Gold Wheel disbanded, Amy was about the only person he talked to.

"Huh? But you...?"

Looking at Cayden, Amy discovered the cross sword at his waist and pointed at it.

"It's the family symbol. I have to carry it at all times."

Shirone asked.

"But the official notice said no equipment could be carried at all. That's why I left out Kubrick too."

When Cayden lifted his cross sword and cast magic, the blade glowed brightly and disappeared without a trace.

"Alchemy?"

Nade immediately recognized it.

"I didn't bother using it last year, but now I have a reason to leave school."

When Cayden transmuted metal again to create a cross sword, Amy looked at it with fascination.

"You're good at it. When did you start learning?"

"This morning. Of course, it came easily."

"Annoying. Should I kill you?"

Though Amy spoke her thoughts directly, Cayden just chuckled.

Cross Cayden (Final graduation class ranking: 26th place).

Major: Magic Swordsman.

Special notes: Laws of the Red Cross. 100% potential demonstration in all fields through sacrifice.

"Good morning, senior!"

Mark's voice loudly broke the dawn silence.

"Yeah. How are you feeling?"

"Great. I'm not nervous at all."

The fighting spirit Mark had shown at the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was acknowledged, which was why he had thrown down the gauntlet for the graduation exam.

"Good, let's do our best. And since you're in the graduation class, you can drop the 'senior' title."

"I know. Just until today. I'm going to beat you in the graduation exam, senior."

Slider Mark (Final graduation class ranking: 29th place).

Major: Impact series of Earth Magic.

Special notes: Sade's top disciple. Fighter. Aggression without taboos.

'Right, he wouldn't have decided without any plan.'

Having nothing to lose was psychologically a great weapon.

Also, Mark had Maria, the only student in the graduation class majoring in recovery magic.

"Maria, you hang in there too."

"Thanks. I'm not really confident, but..."

Though her gentle personality remained, she was different from before when she had operated the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed's mechanism while trembling with fear.

"I've grown during this time too."

Erlang Maria (Final graduation class ranking: 30th place).

Major: High-speed Activation series of Recovery Magic.

Special notes: Sade's top disciple. Longest-term advanced class student, capable of utilizing high-level magic from each series.

"Dante's coming."

At someone's words, everyone turned their heads.

Though they referred to him as Dante, it included Sabina and Closer who had transferred together from the Royal Magic School.

After confirming the assembly point, Closer turned his head.

"...How was it, Alpheas Magic School?"

Dante looked up at the dawn sky, recalling his year and a half journey.

"I looked down on it at first."

Then he lost to Shirone in the 2,000 times duel and had been waiting for a chance at revenge.

"The competition was fiercer than expected."

It was 3.8 times higher capability on average compared to other prestigious schools.

"Still, well... I don't think there was anything particularly different. It was boring all the same."

Airhein Dante (Final graduation class ranking: 2nd place).

Major: Information series of Photon Magic.

Special notes: Olivia's top disciple. Genius-level information entropy analysis ability (capable of calculating information entropy of each individual in an ant colony). Operation of integrated information processing system Pascal.

When Dante arrived, Boyle glared at him.

"What's this? You who are so fashion-sensitive are following regulations to the letter. Even Dante must be scared of going to the Association?"

Dante looked Boyle up and down.

With his hair neatly combed with pomade and wearing a suit that fit his plump body perfectly.

"For formal wear like this, not decorating is the fashion. You could call it a true face-to-face battle."

Boyle's face reddened at losing the true battle.

"Hmph, let's see if you can stay so confident after the exam is over. If you think the summons I've shown so far are everything, you're mistaken."

Chris Boyle (Final graduation class ranking: 17th place).

Major: Beast series of Summoning Magic.

Special notes: Special affinity for beast species. Possesses 18 types of summons total.

'Of course you would.'

As a prodigy who maintained 1st place in the advanced class until Shirone arrived, he would certainly be hiding at least one secret summon.

Meanwhile, Mark couldn't take his eyes off Closer.

'How dare you humiliate me?'

Just thinking about getting beaten by Closer's cowardly trick when Dante's group had just transferred made him wake up even in his sleep.

'And in front of Maria too.'

Closer noticed his gaze and bared his teeth.

"Yo, how are you feeling? You finally became a graduation class student as you'd dreamed. Though it's just for three days."

"Anyway, we're on the same level now."

"Keke, even if we're both earth series, you and I are on different levels."

"Want me to tell you a secret? The reason I chose earth series was to beat you up."

Closer's eyes widened.

"Then let me make a prophecy. The worst failure in the graduation exam will be you. Because I'm going to make it happen."

Bonifar Closer (Final graduation class ranking: 15th place).

Major: Earth Power series of Earth Magic.

Special notes: Olivia's top disciple. Capable of soil transmutation, a type of alchemy.

'Ugh, macho smell.'

Regardless of the two thugs' power struggle, Sabina approached Nade as soon as she arrived at the assembly point.

"Hi."

Though no one else seemed to notice, she alone knew that Nade's atmosphere had subtly changed.

Victor Sabina (Final graduation class ranking: 14th place).

Major: Blow series of Air Magic.

Special notes: Olivia's top disciple. Capable of aerodynamic control using Press series.
