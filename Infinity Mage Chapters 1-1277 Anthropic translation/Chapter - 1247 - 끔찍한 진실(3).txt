The Terrible Truth (3)

A village near the Pyramid of Truth.

Most of the people had left after becoming Yins, but a small number remained in the village.

"Dad! Dad!"

18-year-old Artie was thrilled at the realization of a story she had heard since childhood.

"You were right, Dad! The pyramid! The Pyramid of Truth is shining incredibly bright!"

"Artie!"

Her sturdy father stood up.

"I told you clearly! Don't even go near the Pyramid of Truth! That's no place for humans!"

"But we're fine, aren't we? We know the incantations like you said. We didn't even leave the village."

"Sigh, you're really unstoppable. You're making your dad age because of you."

His wife looked out the window and said,

"It seems the time of prophecy has come. Honey, shouldn't Artie know now too?"

"Yeah! Yeah!"

After thinking for a moment, Dad went into the room and brought out an old wooden box.

"Come here."

Dad sat Artie in front of him and opened the box, revealing an old parchment document inside.

"What's this?"

At his daughter's slightly disappointed tone, Dad smiled.

"A guild charter."

"Guild?"

Dad looked back at the window.

"No one knows when the Pyramid of Truth was built. But the king who founded ancient Pharas, the Pharaoh, seemed to know secrets passed down through oral tradition. So the Pharaoh built his own tomb exactly like the Pyramid of Truth. He believed that by sleeping there, he could someday be resurrected."

"So did he resurrect?"

"Artie, death is the privilege of the dead. Things like eternal sleep or bodily decay are just thoughts of the living. Resurrection would be the same."

"Hmm."

She sort of understood, sort of didn't.

"The important thing is that the ancient Pharaoh knew of God's existence. It was probably passed down secretly. But there were others besides the Pharaoh who knew of God's existence."

Dad held up the guild charter.

"The stonemasons who had to explore the Pyramid of Truth and build pyramids exactly like it. This is the secrecy oath of the ancient stonemason guild (Freemason) they formed."

Artie examined the seal stamped at the top of the charter.

"Ooh."

Inside a triangle identical to the pyramid, a single eye was radiating brilliant light.

Dad continued,

"This is called the All-Seeing Eye. Also called the Eye of Providence. The eye of God that sees through everything in this world. Dad's dad, grandpa's grandpa, going all the way back like that, you'll find our ancestors who built the pyramid."

"So the incantations you taught me too?"

"That's right. The ancient stonemason guild had mysterious abilities. They seem to be lost now, but who knows. Maybe somewhere the lineage continues. All Dad knows are the incantations I heard from Grandpa."

Even that made the girl's heart race.

"So that's why we didn't leave the village. Everyone else changed strangely."

"That's right. But..."

As the house flashed with light, Dad turned his head.

"I think we need to leave now."

The electricity surrounding the pyramid struck the sky like lightning, tearing space apart.

Artie approached the window.

"...The All-Seeing Eye."

A single eye was contemplating the world.

"Aaaaah!"

Rukia was blasted out from inside the pyramid, completely wrapped in electricity.

Her body convulsed as she collapsed on the ground, her eyes trembling as if in shock.

"Ms. Rukia! Get a hold of yourself!"

What on earth had she seen?

Her mind had already crossed into the realm of infinity and could not be brought back by any means.

"Damn it!"

The party looked up at the ceiling, following the bundles of electricity surging from the mechanical device.

The bricks infused with electricity were transparent like glass, and God's eye lingered in the sky.

'I've seen this before.'

Sirone said to his companions,

"I'll go and come back."

Canis said,

"I'm going with you. I have business with that guy."

"No."

Sirone was firm.

"I'm going alone. We don't even know what's up there, I can't put you in danger."

"Don't act superior. I acknowledge you're strong, but I have my own fight too."

"Canis."

Sirone said soothingly,

"If you go, Arin will want to go too. Leave it to me. If that eye really is God, maybe I can negotiate with it."

He had realized it when he went to the Maica ruins.

'It might just be my imagination, but it definitely tried to convey something. About Guffin...'

"Sirone."

Canis said,

"If words don't work, grab him by the collar and drag him back."

"Yeah."

He was grateful to Canis for yielding gracefully, knowing better than anyone what it felt like.

"Whooooo."

The outer world.

Though he had a vague idea, this was the first time confronting its reality head-on.

"I'll go and come back."

Miracle Stream enveloped his body, and he became particles of light like dandelion seeds, piercing through the wall.

Looking up at Sirone materializing outside the pyramid, Ares muttered,

"Yeah, make sure you come back."

Can't make a widow out of an unmarried sister.

The members of Catacomb left their enemies in front of them and charged toward Sirone.

"Abominable Yahweh!"

What Sirone intended to do was obvious.

'Melkidu's Purification.'

In other words, he would embrace the sins of everyone here.

Gyorgi thought,

'Is he serious?'

If he could have forgiven them in the first place, he wouldn't have abandoned magic like vomiting something disgusting.

"Hypocrite."

Gyorgi's voice gained strength as he walked forward.

"Can you really do it?"

The evil that is so terribly selfish, pursuing only pleasure, and pushing everything onto others.

"Grrrr."

Sirone, who had opened Immortal Function, embraced all of Melkidu with his heart.

It was a terrible feeling.

'Evil is evil.'

So hateful, detestable, and disgusting.

'It's contradictory.'

Sirone didn't know Yorahan, but how could great forgiveness know someone's dreams?

'Sacrifice.'

Just like Rukia had.

'If you love, you can sacrifice. I can give my life. But why must I...'

Embrace even evil?

The moment he faced that contradiction, his heart was instead stained with murky anger.

"Die, Yahweh!"

Just as Catacomb members charged, lightning struck around Sirone.

"Thunder God's Judgment."

Nade, who had manifested the avatar of Thunder God Reincarnation, glared at them with a fierce expression.

"Approach and die."

Eden approached with Iruki's support.

"Something's wrong."

The Spirit Zone that should have spread infinitely was instead collapsing inward.

Iruki said,

"He's caught in a logical contradiction. He can't swallow Melkidu. At this rate, he'll be tainted by evil instead."

Sirone's heart was screaming.

'Why?'

Was I really a hypocrite?

'I don't know. They don't do anything. It's always me who has to sacrifice. I carry the burden, I forgive, I, I, I do everything...'

Sirone stopped thinking.

"Ah."

Havitz had said:

Spend your whole life cleaning up trash alone, you idiot.

'I see.'

The reason evil must be forgiven is...

'Just one.'

Because that is good.

"Ugh!"

Though Sirone's face looked tearful, the Spirit Zone rapidly spread to infinity again.

"Aaaaah! No! Don't do it!"

Sensing a different nature, the demons of Catacomb fell to their knees, clutching their heads.

'Really?'

Gyorgi couldn't believe it.

'With perfect good without a trace of malice, reaching the pinnacle of that goodness... you forgive?'

The integration of good and love.

'Yes.'

Sirone's gaze turned toward Gyorgi.

'I don't resent anyone. I'm not wronged. I'm doing this because I can.'

With not a trace of evil remaining, Sirone was not a hypocrite but true good.

So let's drop the pretense.

'Really...'

Let's forgive.

As he embraced everything with ultimate sacrifice, the Spirit Zone spread at tremendous speed.

Rumble rumble rumble!

As Melkidu's system was purified, the entire island containing the Hall of Evil began to shake.

Thud. Thud.

Debris fell on Curtis and Pena's heads.

The moment Sirone's heart was conveyed through the Spirit Zone, they felt enormous forgiveness.

Pena asked,

"What happens to us now?"

"I don't know."

Curtis turned his head.

"It's not something we can choose."

After a moment of silence, the two smiled bitterly and bumped fists.

The Hall of Evil.

Sitting slumped in Lilith's room, Cain looked up at the portrait with a calm face.

Rumble rumble rumble!

Even as his life's work disappeared, his mind remained focused only on the past.

Tears flowed silently.

"Mother."

He tried to smile, but only his lips moved.

"I was wrong."

The Hall of Evil collapsed.

"Ugh! Huuugh!"

As the light of purification grew stronger over time, Catacomb members shed tears.

"Yahweh. Us, us..."

Because until now, no one, not a single human, had ever truly forgiven evil.

"Save us."

In the great catharsis, demons evaporated, and Nade watched Sirone gradually becoming transparent.

"He'll come back."

"Of course. He's the Infinite Wizard."

At that moment, Gyorgi, the only demon remaining, opened the Devil's Bible.

"Satan's Revelation. Chapter 32."

It was the last page.

"Satan said, 'Fear not the good. They are all hypocrites, so raise the forces of evil.'"

"That bastard, to the very end!"

As Nade tried to step forward, Eden stopped him.

"Wait."

Gyorgi's voice was calm.

"The hypocrites will persecute you. Prepare for holy war. Seize victory through evil methods."

Is that so, Yahweh?

"Be not persuaded. Seek not to persuade. There is no mercy for those who abandoned us."

Can we too become you?

If all humans achieve a perfectly right integrated mental system.

"Dry up the seeds of good."

We too are not evil, ugly, and disgusting.

"Erase the name of good."

Just thoughts we can have because we're human, things we can restrain because we're human, sometimes joy, sometimes the most wonderful and happiest thing in life...

As emotions.

"Remember, my children."

Can we be saved?

"As long as even one good remains in this world."

Thud.

Closing the Devil's Bible, Gyorgi calmly shut his eyes and waited for annihilation.

"There is no sanctuary for demons."

Melkidu disappeared in a massive flash of light.

And at the same time...

Sirone's consciousness, racing toward the True Voice in the other world, spun around.

"Gah!"

In the state of Ultra Nivada bridging reality and the other side, emotional integration was a real shock.

Though it was half the impact, it was powerful magic that could drive one insane.

'No. Just a little further...'

With the Valley of Lamentation at the horizon's end in his sight, Sirone collapsed to the ground.

Black monks filling the sky swooped down.

Now! Bind Yahweh!

Countless chains bound Sirone and black clouds covered the earth.

"Kraaaah!"

With a flashing sensation, the tangled black curtain ripped apart.

"Phew!"

Lian appeared, holding Sirone in his left arm while wielding his great sword.

"Hey, Sirone. What's wrong all of a sudden?"

There was no answer, but his eyelids trembled as if fighting something.

Though Yahweh's heart was integrating good, evil, and love, Lian couldn't know that.

"...What the hell is going on?"

Someone's screams echoed from the Valley of Lamentation.
