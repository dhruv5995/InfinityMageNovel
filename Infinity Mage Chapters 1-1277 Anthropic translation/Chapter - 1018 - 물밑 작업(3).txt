Underwater Work (3)

Sirone's mood was not good.

'An attack right out of the blue.'

Honestly, it had been an eerie aura, and the destructive power contained within it would have been beyond imagination.

'The ship nearly sank.'

It was fortunate that he had subdued it before the battle began, but it had been a situation where the passengers' lives were nearly in danger.

The anger about this was also underlying Sirone's display of killing intent that was different from usual.

'Foreign Minister Cairns.'

He knew roughly through Omega, but Cairns was quite young for his age.

'My memories of Cairns' records only go up to age twelve. Of course, he wasn't ordinary even then.'

He couldn't even imagine how he might have evolved during the 22 years he'd lived since then.

Sirone massaged his eyes.

"I'm tired."

He had absolutely no intention of getting deeply involved in politics, but what bothered him was Rangii.

'He called her goods. A person, he called goods.'

Even when the world beauty pageant was held, she had entertained high-ranking officials, so that itself wasn't strange.

However, the smile she had shown at the end was genuine sincerity without a trace of falsehood.

'Throwing one's heart away.'

Wouldn't that be reason enough to get involved in politics?

The Arachne sailing ship.

"I apologize."

In a huge room decorated like a palace, Cairns was drinking with dancers.

"You know how to say such things?" 

Among the dancers wearing affectionate smiles, Cairns' eyes were cold as ice.

Benahar bowed his head again.

"I was mistaken. Sirone's prowess that I met in person is beyond imagination."

"How would you know that? You didn't even fight him, did you?"

It was half true.

If an actual battle had occurred, it might have been a good fight, but there was no point in thinking about it now.

'His spirit was broken. That person's mind... is not human.'

How many lines of death, what degree of mental strength that would be impossible even if one compressed a human lifetime into war.

Regardless of skill level, how mentally trained must those who could 'battle' Sirone be.

'Training? No, they'd be insane. Only in the realm of madness could one oppose Sirone.'

"Anyway, forget it."

Cairns didn't dwell on failed hands.

"We have no choice but to wait for the right time. You go back now. And tell Rangii to come."

"About that..."

Benahar, with several facts colliding in his head, spoke with a troubled expression.

"Things have gotten a bit complicated."

Cairns, who had been looking at Benahar with one eyebrow raised, made a meaningless cold smile.

That evening.

Sirone left the work to Poine and headed alone to Arachne's sailing ship.

Flying through the sky and easily crossing the 700-meter distance, he could see the deck where a banquet was being held.

They were all working-level staff, and a feast of delicacies that couldn't be found on other ships continued.

Sirone landed among the people drinking under the cozy moonlight of the windless zone.

"Whew."

They weren't surprised by the magic.

They simply showed displeased expressions at the fact that he had broken the mutual treaty and invaded the ship through the sky.

"What are you? Do you know where this is..."

Just as the man wearing decorations was about to move, a guard mage stopped him.

"Vice Minister, that person is Sirone."

"The Five Great Stars?"

Though his abilities fell far short of Cairns, the Vice Minister had the weapon of experience.

"Ahem, I meet the star of the Ivory Tower."

Even if he was a thorn in politicians' sides, there was nothing good about making an enemy of the Ivory Tower.

At least until the Holy War opened.

"I came to meet Cairns. Where is he now?"

'This young punk calling the Minister by name?'

He wasn't one to fall for petty provocations, but official matters had to be addressed.

"Since you didn't attend the banquet, he's probably in his private quarters. But what business do you have?"

"I have a few things I want to ask. If you won't guide me, then get out of the way."

"Whew."

As the wine he'd been enjoying pleasantly rushed to his head, the Vice Minister exhaled long, releasing his intoxication.

"Well, fine. I shouldn't interfere with what the star of the Ivory Tower does. However, from what I understand, the maritime exchange was first proposed by Sirone-nim, wasn't it? And Arachne gladly agreed. But now..."

"Who ordered this banquet?"

The Vice Minister frowned.

"The agreement regarding the comprehensive investigation is finished. Do you have complaints about a country consuming its own food supplies?"

"Why specifically on the deck?"

The Vice Minister picked up his wine glass and looked around at the night sky.

"Well... the weather is nice and the moon is bright."

The moment strength entered Sirone's eyes, he straightened his posture and continued speaking.

"I know what you mean. The other ships aren't eating as well. But we're also elites dispatched on important national business. We have our own routines and clear pursuits. This kind of emotional approach cannot serve as an excuse for the star breaking the agreement."

Befitting a Deputy Foreign Minister, he was strong in both psychological warfare and eloquence.

"Agreement."

Thinking of what Benahar had done during the day, Sirone was simply astounded.

"Fine. I'll apologize for breaking the agreement."

The nobles stirred.

"Well, now."

The Vice Minister tried to suppress his laughter, but he couldn't help the strength entering his shoulders.

"Such a minor issue, isn't it? The relationship between the Ivory Tower and Arachne is..."

The moment he saw Sirone's gaze, the Vice Minister's heart sank.

"Then let's go hear from the Minister how well he's keeping the agreement. There might be serious matters, right? But if there are parts that severely break trust..."

The nobles couldn't even blink.

"Don't expect this ship to still be floating on the sea tomorrow morning."

Saying that, as Sirone turned around, the Vice Minister extended his hand with an expression like he'd been hit by a hammer.

"Wait, just a moment. Star-nim, no, Sirone-nim."

"Enjoy the banquet."

Sirone turned his head and swept his gaze over the people.

"Wait here without a single person missing. So it won't be troublesome when I return."

Benahar opened the door leading to the private quarters and came out.

"What's going on?"

The moment he spotted Sirone, he broke out in cold sweat as the events of the day came to mind.

"Ah, Sirone-nim."

"As I announced earlier, I came to meet the Minister. I heard he's in his private quarters now."

Benahar looked at the Vice Minister beyond Sirone.

'No, no!'

Making a gesture of slicing his throat with his hand, the Vice Minister kept moving his mouth without making sound.

'You can't let him go to the Minister. Whether it's diarrhea or some illness, make any excuse and turn him away!'

Though he roughly understood the meaning, Benahar had no choice.

"Please come. I'll guide you."

The Vice Minister, knowing his personality, looked at him with a bewildered expression, but ultimately couldn't meet his eyes.

The door closed, and the remaining nobles felt a chill in the warm temperature of the southern lands.

"...Damn it."

"Please forgive the incident during the day. I acted without knowing who you were."

Benahar hammered the point home so that his mistake wouldn't interfere with Cairns' work.

But on the other hand, as one mage, there was also respect for Sirone contained within.

"People could have gotten hurt. If you have complaints against me, I'd prefer if you called me separately next time."

"...That won't happen again."

Opening the door, Cairns and Rangii were sitting side by side at a high-end restaurant table.

"Rangii?"

Sirone asked back, but Benahar only bowed his head while grasping the door handle.

"Have a good time."

Hearing the sound of the door closing, as Sirone approached, Cairns stood up.

"Please come in. I meet the star of the Ivory Tower. You're quite the handsome man as the rumors say..."

"Rangii, what's going on?"

He had no intention of ignoring Cairns, but calling Rangii was clearly not out of goodwill.

"Haha! She said she had a prior engagement. Actually, Rangii and I aren't strangers, so I thought it might be nice if we sat together. I apologize if this offended you."

"Sirone..."

Rangii's appearance was more beautiful than usual, but the window to her heart was already closed.

"Let's hear what you have to say first."

As he took a seat across from Cairns, staff carried in food as if they had been waiting.

"Outside, the banquet is in full swing..."

"I apologize!"

As Cairns placed his hands on the table and bowed his head, the staff froze in shock.

"Everything is my fault. The incident during the day, the banquet, breaking the agreement - I apologize for it all. I'll take full responsibility."

The fact that he could guess Sirone's intentions without looking was certainly excellent, but...

"How will you take responsibility?"

Without action, words are worthless.

"I'll open our food supplies. We're also passengers, so we should share together. I'll accept a comprehensive investigation. Since we have troops, you can use them as security forces if you want."

"Hmm."

Sirone crossed his legs.

"What is Arachne after in this voyage?"

"...I'll be frank. As you know, Dionas is a country founded by pirates. The king rules with an iron fist through force, and the majority of citizens make their living through maritime plunder. We want to obtain one thing in exchange for recognizing Dionas as an official nation of Kurtesia."

"What is that one thing?"

"Relics of the ancient civilization Myca."

The moment the words ended, Sirone felt a chill.

"That is..."

When he searched through the 5-dimensional cube containing all atomic movements that had occurred since the beginning of time.

"What?"

There were no records.

"I don't know the details. Nobody does. It's just a theory that it was a civilization that existed somewhere in the South Pacific long ago, and is now probably submerged under the sea."

"But Dionas knows about it?"

Since speaking plainly was evidence of excitement, Cairns continued without showing it.

"Kurtesia is on the periphery of the world, so it might be unfamiliar to you. But the Ten Island Kingdoms have been investigating Myca relics for a long time. However... after the World War, Dionas has been unusual. Even if there was no tsunami damage, having absolutely no demon damage is strange."

How should he accept this?

'What's not in Omega doesn't exist. Therefore, the Myca civilization is also just a folk tale.'

...was what he thought, but then again.

'But even such folk tales should be recorded. Why don't I know about this?'

The fact that ordinary people knew but Sirone didn't meant it had been removed only from Omega.

'Erasure? No, that's impossible. Even if there was a reset, erasure logs would remain.'

It wasn't a logical deduction.

'The outer world.'

There was only one thing left after removing all categories that existed in Omega.

'It's connected to the outer world somehow. Otherwise, it would be impossible to bypass Omega.'

Having thought that far, Sirone asked.

"Even if Dionas found relics or traces, would they really want to share them?"

"That's why I'm going. Armed with vast treasures and weapons, and the finest beauty."

These were things that would be revealed if a comprehensive investigation was conducted.

"You're going to win them over with just that much? Even if the opponent is a pirate, aren't you underestimating them too much?"

"That might be so. Then how about I put it this way? What if Dionas' King Kalt is..."

Cairns pulled Rangii around the waist.

"Crazy about Miss Arachne? Enough to actually organize an armed fleet and attempt invasion."

In the end, he's a pirate.

"Of course, Rangii is a valuable talent. But with the Holy War opening soon, shouldn't we do our best?"

'This is why I didn't want to get involved in politics.'

Because to achieve what you want, you have to see countless things you don't want.

"Take your hands off. Rangii is also my friend. If you do such things in front of me, I won't forgive you."

"She's still mine, though?"

Cairns, pressing his body even closer to Rangii, spoke with eyes aiming for victory.

"She's also necessary for negotiations. But... if the Five Great Stars help me, Rangii might not be necessary."

He thought it was over.

'What in the world can't be done? With this, even the Five Great Stars will come under me.'

"Cairns."

Sirone burst into hollow laughter.

"Have you ever heard the name Fermi?"

Cairns certainly had outstanding abilities in understanding humans and techniques for disrupting systems, but...

"Huh? No."

Compared to the drug lord who had even his memories of whatever deal he'd made erased, he was at infant level.

"You'll have to learn a lot from that guy."
