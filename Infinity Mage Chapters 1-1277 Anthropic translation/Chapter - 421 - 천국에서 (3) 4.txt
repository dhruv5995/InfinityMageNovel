[421] In Heaven (3)

A desperate death cry erupted in the Great World War.

Arius, shot by electricity, flew 10 meters and rolled across the floor.

The magic of diving into one's own thoughts, Apoptosis, had trapped him in the concept of eternity where time did not exist.

It was a kind of mental death, and the shock of actually returning was incomparable to the terror of a newborn infant.

"Aaahhh! Aaaaaahhh!"

Arius could not stop screaming.

Everything was confusing and unsettling.

Only the blurry afterimages remaining in his memory vaguely told him who he was.

At that boundary of oblivion, a thread-like intelligence flowed in and connected with his memories.

Only after the scene of casting magic while avoiding Guard Captain Walker's sword at Kazra Palace came to mind did his screaming subside.

'Damn, I can't even do this properly.'

Wiping the drool that had flowed down his chin as he stood up, Arius felt suspicious about the unfamiliar scene.

"Where is this...?"

If someone had pulled him out of Apoptosis, it would be one of the Seven Sages of Magic, and then this should be their secret hideout that no one knew about, but the landscape before his eyes was completely different.

Everything was a pale purple metallic color, and incomprehensible mechanical devices were operating while emitting light.

"Are you the one called the Grave Robber?"

Arius turned around with an unpleasant expression.

But he soon had to lift his head, and his pupils contracted with surprise.

A halo above the head, wings of light several times larger than the body.

It was an angel.

'Why is there an angel...?'

The moment his questions were about to overflow to the top of his head, he quickly suppressed them with the battery of Flicker magic.

He had to escape.

Thinking could come later.

Just as his body was transforming into light with a flash, Uriel's hand flew faster than an instant.

"Kugh!"

Grabbed by the throat, Arius struggled at a height of 3 meters.

It felt like his neck bone was being grasped rather than his throat being choked.

"S-save me...!"

When Uriel slammed Arius down, he arched his back like a bow and groaned in pain after being smashed into the floor.

Then he struggled to kneel on one knee and looked up at the angels.

"Damn, what the hell are you guys?"

"I am Uriel, the Angel of Destruction."

"U-Uriel?"

One of only eight archangels even in Heaven.

Arius's gaze quickly swept around.

The furnishings, devices, even the galactic mirror - realizing this was the Great World War, he understood.

'Then the one next to him must be Kariel...'

With two archangels present, even Arius of the Seven Sages of Magic had no possibility of escaping this place alive on his own.

"There's something I want to show you."

Kariel, who had lifted Arius into the air, flew to the galactic mirror and threw him down again.

"Kugh!"

Falling chest-first, he gasped for breath, then realized someone was in front of him and struggled to lift his head.

A woman was sitting cross-legged.

"A human?"

Uriel said.

"Adrias Miro."

Arius's eyes were swept with shock.

"M-Miro? This woman is?"

For a Scale mage, Miro was an unforgettable name.

But even Grave Robber Arius was seeing her face for the first time.

So this is what she looks like.

An ordinary girl you could see anywhere in the world. The kind that would make you glance twice if you passed her on the street.

But the modifiers attached to her were all superlatives: greatest, final, ultimate, strongest.

Therefore, Arius could only stare as if enchanted at the face of the young woman with closed eyes.

Beautiful, just by existing.

Hastily regaining his composure, Arius analyzed the situation based on existing information.

Archangels, Great World War, Miro.

'Damn. So it's come to this after all?'

The fact that Miro was in Heaven could also be interpreted as meaning the final war was imminent.

'What the hell is going on? Do they know in the original world?'

He wanted to talk with Miro, but she showed no signs of waking up.

Arius turned to Kariel and asked.

"Did you put her to sleep?"

"No. Miro has entered the dimension of Void Calamity. You should be able to return her to normal."

'Void Calamity...'

Arius's face contorted.

'Damn! It's Samadhi.'

Now things were finally starting to make sense.

Having entered Samadhi, Miro would be impossible to kill. And that was the reason they had summoned him, the Grave Robber, here.

"Destroy Miro's Void Calamity."

Arius snorted.

Though he had instinctively begged for his life when caught by Uriel, death was not a priority for him now that he had regained his intelligence.

If he were to pull Miro out of Void Calamity, Miro's space-time would be destroyed and what remained would be humanity's extinction.

'Not that I particularly care, but I don't like things going their way.'

Still, he had no intention of giving up.

This was nothing less than exploring the mind of one of the most renowned mages in human history.

He wanted to know what was inside this woman's head.

What she liked, what she disliked, what made her feel shame, what secrets she would take to her grave.

"Destroy the Samadhi?"

Arius frowned as he spoke.

"Are you joking right now?"

"If you cannot do it, you will die."

"You don't think that's a threat, do you? This woman is humanity's strongest Scale mage. No matter who dives in besides me, they'll just be crushed by the Egoist."

"Then you have no choice but to die."

As Kariel extended his hand, Arius raised both hands as if to calm him down.

"Wait. I'm not saying I won't do it. I'm just saying we need to find a way around it."

"Around? The mind, you mean?"

"If I dive in now anyway, I'll just get swept up in the Samadhi. But what about Drimo? Drimo collects any thoughts that flow in. From there, I'll find keywords powerful enough to break the Samadhi."

"Keywords?"

"Every human has trauma. Trauma severe enough to stop their breathing the moment they recall it. I'll make a powerful net from such things and cast it into the abyss. Then when I pull? The big fish called Miro will be caught."

Kariel stared blankly at Arius, who was chattering excitedly.

Was he sane? To be so enthusiastic about destroying humanity.

'I simply cannot understand these human creatures.'

Arius set conditions.

"But Drimo has a multidimensional structure, so it's not a place you can investigate at will. So give me some information. You guys must know, right?"

"Hmm."

Suddenly Kariel's halo expanded into a light wheel.

As Arius's face turned pale, a pitch-black sphere was born, squeezing through space.

"Come forth, Brahma."

"Kiiiiiii!"

A hooked nose emerged first, followed by a red-skinned facial area.

The eyes were unpleasantly slanted and the teeth were irregularly arranged.

Three glowing triangles floated on the front of the forehead, and beyond the crown, a brain was connected - unlike humans whose brain matter was contained within the skull, it flowed down like hair all the way to the small figure's feet.

Kariel's familiar, the Triangle Mara Brahma.

In some places in the human world, this being was called the god of creation.

"Lowly Brahma pays respects to the great Archangel Kariel."

"Follow that human to Drimo. Cooperate with whatever he wishes to investigate."

Arius looked dumbfounded.

'Damn, Brahma?'

That the god of intelligence from mythology looked like this was shocking for a mage.

But he quickly regained his composure.

This was an opportunity.

Borrowing the knowledge of a Triangle Mara, he could access the deep places of Drimo that humanity had never reached.

'Hehehe, the god of magic smiles upon me.'

Arius approached Miro.

He would dig up everything about her.

And when he returned, he would have become a god of the world.

"Let's go. Heaven seems quite busy too."

Brahma extended a strand of brain matter and pushed it through Miro's mouth into her brain.

As the brain region governing Drimo was activated, a small space-time tunnel appeared before his eyes.

Arius launched his body without delay, and Brahma followed behind.

"Phew."

Only after the space-time tunnel closed did Kariel slump down.

Summoning the Triangle Mara had been squeezing out all his remaining power.

"Are you alright?"

"My strength will return with time. Once Miro awakens, humanity is finished. I'll gain voting rights in the Archangel Council too."

"He might not succeed. Due to the Law of Familiars, Brahma isn't in normal condition either."

The total abilities wielded by the three Maras serving an angel could never exceed the angel's abilities.

This follows the principle that posterior concepts cannot appear without preceding concepts.

This was the Law of Familiars.

With Kariel's presence weakened, the Triangle Mara Brahma could not exert his full power either.

"It doesn't matter. Anyway, Brahma is a being born by imitating my intelligence. He can make in one second the judgment that 10,000 prudent humans would reach through compromise. It will take some time, but he'll be able to do it."

It would take time. But what did it matter?

If that was humanity's remaining time anyway.

The strategy meeting room was captured by silence.

Niflheim.

A place even the border guards of the mainland were forbidden to approach, inhabited only by evil spirits that had once been objects of terror to humans.

Crude gave realistic advice as always.

"Let me be clear - it's an extremely dangerous place. Considering the value of the Black Elixir, countless people should have attempted it, but even that stopped thousands of years ago. For one reason: if you go, you die without exception. So choose carefully."

Sein asked.

"Do you think we have a choice? In this situation?"

"Even if you don't go to Niflheim, we can maintain our alliance. This isn't the only opportunity. But it means these three conditions must absolutely be met if the 1st Command is to engage in full-scale war."

Taking the safe method would take a long time. Conversely, taking the fast route was too dangerous.

"Gaold, what will you do?"

Sein passed the judgment to the commander.

But in reality, it was just a courtesy question. In a situation where there was no way to know Miro's life or death, there was only one choice he could make.

"We go to Niflheim."

"Hmm."

Crude's sigh continued for a long time.

"I hold you all in high regard. That's why I want to stop you. Using the light of Area 73 to grow the rebel forces is also a good method. Why are you so impatient? Is there some special reason?"

Impatience breeds mistakes.

Gaold also knew this fact, which was why he was desperately maintaining his composure.

But objectively speaking, time was not abundant.

Heaven couldn't kill Miro who had entered Samadhi, but they also weren't the type to cause such trouble without any countermeasures.

"You don't need to know that. Just meet the three conditions as quickly as possible. Then you'll have no complaints, right?"

"Of course. If possible, that is."

Crude remained skeptical to the end.

"From now on, we'll divide into teams. I, Kang Nan, and Zulu will enter Niflheim."

Sein asked.

"Then the rest?"

"Armin, Shiina, Ethella, and Quan will handle the military supply community. Sirone and Flu will persuade the 2nd Command. This is the only way for now."

In Sein's opinion too, it was the maximum personnel distribution considering the difficulty of the missions.

"Then I'll remain here to plan strategy. I also need to understand planetary motion."

For God's Punishment to properly strike Araboth, precise forecasting of the impact point was necessary. To do that, understanding planetary motion had to come first.

"Are you really going to Niflheim?"

Crude couldn't understand Sirone's group.

Even if ten people rushed in together, or even if they requested support from the rebels, it wouldn't be enough, yet they were dividing the team.

"Are you guys sane?"

Gaold said as he left his seat.

"No."
