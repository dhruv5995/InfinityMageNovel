The Beginning of Destruction (2)

In the inner castle of the Jive Kingdom, Uorin sat deep in thought with her lips tightly sealed.

"Wheeee."

Havitz, leaning against her back, whistled while puffing smoke from his Asker.

"I can hear the sound of your heart."

It was Mayray's abilityâ€”God's Frequency.

"The sound you made when you saw Sirone. That was probably close to pain, wasn't it?"

Uorin opened her mouth.

"If you had asked me to step aside, I would have done so."

"Are you having delusions too?"

Silence fell again before Havitz continued.

"The reason I didn't kill you at first was because you said you had someone you loved. I was curious. Back then I couldn't hear the sound of hearts. But now that I can hear it, it seems you love in a way similar to me."

"Have you ever been in love?"

"Well. If what you're doing now counts as love, then I do it every day. No, maybe every second?"

"People, you know, when a certain word exists, they mistake it for something that actually exists. Love is like that, and so are success or failure, happiness or unhappiness. I wonder what they did with their lives when such words didn't exist."

Though his eyes were glazed from the drugs, his emotions were actually much calmer than usual.

"Try erasing all the words in your head. Your heart will still be beating, and your body will want something. Whatever you want, you'll eventually achieve it. If you don't define it."

"Is that Vanishing?"

"There you go again."

Havitz threw his cigarette butt at a Jive official who was watching him with horrified eyes.

"It gets complicated because you try to trap it in words. When you divide thoughts, you can't feel the whole. It doesn't have to be love. Isn't what matters not what that feeling is called?"

Uorin felt bitter.

'To receive comfort from Satan. Well, maybe it means I've fallen that far.'

What did it matter?

Desperate desires are always close at hand, while God remains distant to humans.

"...Can I achieve it? If I don't define my feelings toward Sirone, can I reach that something I want, that feeling?"

"Of course."

There was no desire Havitz had failed to fulfill.

"You can definitely do it."

His face, smiling up at the sky, was as pure as a child's.

"What beautiful weather."

Today too...

May everyone in this world seize what they desire.

'Without a single exception.'

At the fountain plaza overlooking the Papal Office, Sirone, Iruki, and Nade were deep in thought.

Nade spoke up.

"How about sneaking in? If Sirone's identity is revealed, the Paladins will move. You'll understand when it happens, but getting tangled up with those guys is the last thing I want."

Iruki rested his chin on his hand.

"Hmm. But would they really act that way inside the Papal Office? As far as I know, the Lamie religion doesn't have particularly aggressive doctrines. Who knows what they're like outside, but at least it's a religion that maintains public decorum."

Sirone said, "That depends on the case. The Lamie religion's attitude toward other religions is divided into two categories: cults and heretics. If you believe in a god other than Cria, from the Lamie religion's perspective, you're a cult. And they tend to leave those alone. On the other hand, I am..."

Not a cult.

"I'm treated as a heretic. Meaning, a religion that calls itself god. In such cases, the Lamie religion has always aggressively suppressed them. This time won't be different."

"But you've never said you were a god, and more importantly, you haven't established a religion."

Iruki said, "So it's about reputation. Already countless people regard Sirone as the Messiah. Believing in other gods can be dismissed as fake. But if a human being who exists in reality is revered as a god..."

Finally, Nade's expression became serious.

"It would be fatal to the Lamie religion. Because it directly contradicts the doctrine of monotheism."

Iruki agreed.

"So that's why the Paladins are particularly hostile toward Sirone. It would be dangerous to approach this thinking it's just a matter of different religions."

It surely would be.

"But still! Revealing it outright is a bit much, isn't it? We can't have a big fight here."

Iruki raised his index finger.

"How about using an alias? Though it comes with the prerequisite that it has to be someone who could attract the Pope's interest."

"Frontal assault."

Sirone made his decision.

"If we strategize, meeting Pope Constantine won't be difficult. But that way, I won't be able to get my point across. Besides, the Pope is leaving for the Holy War soon. There's something I want to confirm before then."

Nade sprang up from his seat.

"Alright then. Let's formally request a meeting. If the Paladins come at us, I'll be the villain."

Inside the Papal Office, they found the administrative office located between the Diocesan Administration and the Paladin Order.

"Excuse me."

A priest greeted them with a smile.

"Welcome, servants of God Cria. What brings you to the Holy Office?"

Nade spoke up.

"We came to meet Pope Constantine. We really want to see him before he leaves for the Holy War."

"Pardon?"

The priest blinked for a moment, then checked the ages of Sirone's group and scratched his head.

'Well, they are that age.'

Among the followers of the Lamie religion, spirited young people had crossed continents to seek an audience with the Pope.

"I'm sorry to say this, but the Pope is a very busy person. To have a meeting, you need to go through proper procedures. There's a department set up in the Diocesan Administration..."

"I am Sirone."

The priest didn't understand at first.

"I want to have a conversation with Pope Constantine. Please tell him that Yahweh requests a meeting."

The priest's face turned white.

"Ya-Yahweh?"

At the same time, all the priests in the integrated administrative office jumped up and looked at Sirone.

"What? Yahweh?"

Of course, he wasn't evil.

He wasn't a murderer or a terrorist, but several priests looked at him unkindly.

The High Priest, head of the integrated administrative office, approached.

"Hmm."

Comparing Sirone's face with the description he'd heard in rumors, he bit his lip.

'It seems to be true.'

Unless he had two lives, he wouldn't tell such a lie in the Papal Office, would he?

"If you truly are Yahweh, you should know what kind of place this is. Is this a declaration of war?"

"I have no intention of fighting. I have no reason to. However, I came because I have something to tell the Pope."

Addressing the Pope as an equal.

'Such outrageous arrogance...!'

Anger flashed in the High Priest's eyes, but this time Sirone wouldn't back down either.

'Constantine.'

He thought of him as a good person.

No, could there exist a human in this world who could clearly distinguish between good and bad people?

'Even if there were.'

Could we really call that human?

'By that point, it would already be a concept that transcends humanity. Just as Miro represents ultimate good and Havitz represents ultimate evil.'

Of course, Sirone was included in that category.

"It won't take long. Please let me meet him. I'll be attending the Holy War anyway, and I can meet the Pope there too. The reason I came now is because there's a matter that needs to be handled at the Papal Office."

"Ahem."

Since the Papal Office knew more detailed information about the Holy War, he couldn't refute that.

"I'll report it for now. But if the Pope refuses, then there's nothing we can do."

"Yes. Please."

Following the High Priest's instructions, two priests ran down the corridor and split left and right.

'Two people.'

The Diocesan Administration and the Paladin Order.

'They won't let me go peacefully. In any case, the Pope will meet me. To maintain authority at the Holy War, he'll have to negotiate with me.'

The problem was what came next.

'How will the Pope answer my question? If it's a human-like answer, I'll accept it. But if...'

If that answer denies humanity.

'There will be bloodshed.'

Paladin Order.

Senior Paladin Seina of the Oracle Management Department stood before a mirror, wearing ivory-colored armor.

'Oh God.'

With golden short hair and a pure face, she was beautiful enough to believe God had sculpted her.

'Please punish me.'

But for her as a Paladin, the body was merely a shell containing faith.

'Please erase the doubt within me, oh God.'

Her divine power had weakened.

'Why is this happening? Nothing has particularly changed. Why have I come to doubt my life, everything I've achieved...'

She first felt the change when she returned to the Papal Office after meeting Yahweh.

'Sirone, he was called.'

When she had knelt before the temptation of Sheol, Yahweh had rushed over and baptized her.

'I had resolved to be martyred. I wasn't afraid of death. But then why...'

Did she shed tears?

The moment Sirone struck her forehead powerfully with his hand, terrible evil was completely expelled.

'Perhaps...'

What if it wasn't just the demon that was expelled?

"No!"

Seina shouted.

"There's no way my heart was shaken by that guy. Yes, this is the price for submitting to Sheol."

It was mentally easier to be a loser defeated by evil than to become a traitor to faith.

"But..."

When she recalled the brilliant radiance of that light that had rushed before her eyes, she became dazed again.

"Miss Seina, are you in there?"

"Ah! Yes!"

At the voice from outside the door, Seina, who had equipped her holy sword, turned around hurriedly.

When she opened the door, a handsome man in his early thirties with a short beard was smiling.

"Leon."

He was a Senior Paladin from the same department.

"Miss Seina and I were selected for this week's patrol team. Was I too early? There are still 5 minutes left."

Five minutes before roll call was slightly late timing.

"Oh, no. I'm sorry."

Seina's social skills weren't particularly poor, but Leon always made her feel awkward.

The reason was probably...

"It's been so long since I was on a patrol team with Miss Seina. It really seems like God Cria has answered my prayers."

Because he was frivolous.

'He's not a bad person. It's just...'

Leon's remarks that subtly emphasized male-female relationships were very irritating to Seina.

'Paladins are forbidden to marry. Our bodies and souls have already been dedicated to God.'

Perhaps noticing her discomfort, Leon changed the subject.

"I heard that the Paladin training program has been revived since Miss Seina's report was submitted. The subordinates' complaints are considerable, haha. It was really brutal back in our time."

'That's right.'

From her childhood when she decided to become a servant of God, Seina had undergone harsh training repeatedly.

And that was certainly her pride.

'But why?'

Since receiving baptism from Yahweh, all those processes felt disgusting to her.

'Yes, this doubt is what's making me weak. Get it together, Seina. You're a Paladin.'

Leon's expression was ecstatic as he stared intently at Seina's thoughtful face.

'She's truly a wonderful person.'

Though Paladins were forbidden to marry, the doctrine wasn't forced upon ordinary laypeople.

'If I gave up my position as a Paladin, would Miss Seina...'

Just as he was spreading his wings of imagination, a priest came running breathlessly from down the corridor.

"Temi? What's wrong?"

"Ah, Lady Seina! Sir Leon!"

The priest, who had been breathing heavily with his hands on his knees, suddenly lifted his head and shouted.

"This is terrible! Right now in the Papal Office... I mean, in this sacred Papal Office...!"

Leon grabbed his shoulders.

"Speak calmly. What happened?"

"Yahweh has come! And he boldly entered through the front gate! He says he wants to meet the Pope!"

Leon frowned at the unrealistic statement.

"What on earth are you talking about?"

At that moment, hearing rough breathing from behind, he turned and his eyes widened.

"Miss Seina?"

Her face was red as a persimmon.

"Yahweh is..."

Unable to control her rapidly beating heart, she asked with a dazed expression.

"He came here?"

Waves of light flickered before her eyes like afterimages.
