The Dark Organization (1)

Yorahan felt a warmth in his chest.

'It's not wrong.'

He had visited many cities so far, but his philosophy had never been popular with the masses.

'But there are people who understand. If someone empathizes with it, then it's not wrong.'

Even if they weren't human, he thought it didn't matter as long as their hearts connected.

"Thank you. Not just for saving my life, but this has truly given me great strength."

"Not at all. Your thoughts are truly wonderful, seeker. There's nothing logically wrong with them either."

That was where Yorahan's dilemma lay.

'If everyone showed just a little consideration, suffering would disappear. There's no contradiction. So why can't we reach that point?'

Because human existence itself was a contradiction.

'Convincing them is the reason I exist. Yes, let's start over. In this village.'

Yorahan asked.

"This is presumptuous of me, but could I stay for a while? I'll help with whatever work I can do."

"Please don't say such things. Teach the Fire Tribe many things. Everyone will listen attentively."

The Fire Tribe helps humans.

As long as the teachings of someone presumed to be Buddha are passed down through the lotus bloodline.

'This person is different. Unlike the humans who tormented us.'

The words of her predecessor came to mind.

Lutia, even so, you must believe. Humans make mistakes, but they are ultimately a race that finds the right path.

Perhaps this man was...

"Please rest well. Your body must still be uncomfortable. I'll tell the children."

"Thank you."

Since the Fire Tribe conversation he had overheard earlier was bothering him, Yorahan added.

"Oh, and you don't need to be too kind to me. I'm used to hardship. Ha ha!"

Lutia smiled.

"I see."

She could tell that this was probably the very small consideration he had been preaching about.

"Well, I'll head back for now. I need to unpack and check my notes."

Yorahan returned to his hut.

"Phew, fortunately it didn't get wet."

Just as he grabbed his notebook that served as both diary and memo pad and lifted the tent flap again.

"Aaah! You scared me!"

Armang was standing right in front of him.

"You."

"Ah, yes."

With those fierce eyes glaring at him up close, his heart already felt guilty as if he had committed a crime.

"You're staying in this village?"

"That's what's been decided. I absolutely won't cause any trouble. I can promise that."

"You know about the Fire Tribe, don't you?"

"Ah, no! I have some sense of it, but not in detail... I'm absolutely not a bad person...!"

"Whatever you say, I don't trust human words."

Yorahan closed his mouth.

"I'm going to watch you all day from now on. When you eat, when you go to the bathroom, when you sleep. Got it? The moment you leave my sight, you can figure out for yourself what will happen."

"Even the bathroom?"

He thought it was harsh, but if what he said about the Fire Tribe was true, it was understandable.

'A race that can't refuse others' requests? Seeing them go this far, it's probably not a lie.'

"Your answer?"

Yorahan looked at Armang's blazing eyes for a moment, then spoke as if resigned.

"Yes. If that's what it takes for you to feel at ease."

And so... a strange cohabitation began.

Inside Melchidu's inner track.

Shirone's group had entered here from compartment 321 of the outer track, the Pilgrim's Village.

There was also an entrance at outer track compartment 122, but they had heard that wasn't the recommended route.

"We arrived faster than I thought."

Nade looked around at the scenery of compartment 7, the first they had reached in the inner track.

"It's a city... or is it?"

More precisely, it was part of a city.

Gray buildings stretched endlessly along the horizon, with each district blocked off by walls.

Iruki said.

"They divided a cylindrical structure into 197 compartments. If the outer track has non-players, this might be directly operated by administrators."

Eden agreed.

"Well, things like dice enhancement or items that cause variables in the system are in the administrators' domain. But somehow... isn't this too obvious?"

Shirone started walking.

"Let's think of it as meaning we're closer to the core. Since no message appeared, missions probably only occur under specific circumstances. The hidden mission we're looking for is probably that type too."

Nade said.

"Getting information about purchases is important, but what's most urgent is utilizing points. Current points are roughly 260 million. We need to save 50 million for purchase costs, so our resources are limited. And that's the minimum at 50 million."

Iruki nodded.

"Mm. Under the premise that we should save Crime Points as much as possible, let's consider enhancement costs and item prices."

Upon entering the government office, there was a fork in the road where the number 7 was written large.

"One side is system business, the other is a shopping corner. So dice enhancement and item purchases."

"Let's start with system business."

Since Curtis had advised them to enhance their dice as much as possible, there was no disagreement.

"Welcome. I'm the administrator of Sector 7."

A woman in an immaculate suit that didn't match the murderers' sanctuary at all was sitting there.

"Uh, so..."

"First time, I see. Welcome. This is where you apply for Crime Dice enhancement."

"Yes. How much does it cost?"

"The basic Crime Dice are two 6-sided dice. Dice enhancement is divided into two types: you can increase the number of sides or increase the number of dice." The administrator pointed to the price list on the table.

"It's all different depending on the grade. In Sector 7, you can only do basic enhancements. Please check."

The group checked the price list.

'10 million points to upgrade from 6 sides to 7 sides. 100 million points to go from 7 to 8? The increase rate is insane.'

Increasing the number of dice was even worse.

'100 million points to go from 2 to 3 dice. From 3 to 4 dice... 1 billion points?'

Considering that the key known as the standard route cost 10 billion, it was an enormous amount.

Nade looked at Shirone.

"This is serious."

"Yeah. Curtis had one octahedral die and two hexahedral dice. So he spent a whopping 210 million points on enhancement."

It exceeded the points Shirone possessed.

The administrator interjected.

"Enhancement is really important. No matter how good your items are, if your Crime Dice are weak, efficiency drops."

Eden said.

"But why did Curtis enhance like that? Wouldn't it be more effective to change all 3 dice to 7-sided ones?"

Iruki rested his chin on his hand.

"...Doubles."

"Doubles?"

"Right. No matter how many dice you have, if the same number comes up on 2 dice, a double judgment activates. Right?"

The administrator nodded.

"Yes. That's correct."

"So the more dice you have, the higher the probability of hitting doubles. You only need 2 out of 3, or 2 out of 4. On the other hand, when the number of sides on dice increases, the probability actually decreases. Because the variables that can determine doubles increase."

"That's exactly it. It's a small probability, but in Melchidu where dice are everything, it would make a huge difference. A difference worth paying an extra 80 million points for. In the end, it's not necessarily good to just increase the number of sides. What's really important is the number of dice."

That was the standard approach, but.

'It doesn't matter for us. Or more precisely, it doesn't matter for Shirone. He can manipulate any number.'

Shirone was thinking the same thing.

'Hmm. We need to spend 100 million to get one more die anyway. The difference between 2 and 3 is dimensional. If that's the case, going with 7, 7, 7 gives us 1 more in total.'

Just 1, but that 1 would someday become a thousand, then ten thousand, and determine victory or defeat.

Iruki asked.

"Is there a build you'd recommend?"

"Every build has advantages and disadvantages. It can vary depending on the user's tendencies, and strategy and tactics change depending on what items you mainly use. For example, an item called Bonanza cubes the value of the largest number minus the smallest number. In that case, dice with asymmetrical balance would probabilistically get higher numbers."

"Hmm, we need to know about items too. But from what I hear, it's not more efficient than Windgod."

Converting all additions to multiplication.

"Hehe, Windgod is a high-grade item. While some users play with a few high-grade items, others compete with many low-grade items. For the latter users, Bonanza has quite good cost-effectiveness."

The administrator continued.

"Therefore, the only hint I can give you is information based on statistics. Among Melchidu's 3-dice users, the most common 17 percent use an 8, 6, 6 build. That shows how diverse users' preferences are. The characteristic of 8, 6, 6 is that it enables stable tactical operation and has good compatibility with items. However, here we can only go up to 7, 6, 6, so if you want to enhance from 7 to 8, you'd need to go to Sector 40 or higher."

"I see."

Iruki nodded.

"There are two pilgrim entrances to the outer track. 122 and 321. But if you enter through 122, you go backwards from inner track 197. In that case, you might buy expensive items early and not be able to buy the items you really need. You might also make mistakes in enhancement."

Eden said.

"But if you're a veteran who already has items or finished dice enhancement, it wouldn't matter going backwards."

"Right. So this is a structure to prevent beginners' luck. If you're lucky enough to enter the inner track early and buy certain items, the gap will continue to widen due to snowball effects."

Nade grumbled.

"For a game about killing people, this is annoyingly rational. Are they telling us to kill fairly and squarely?"

The administrator took it as a compliment.

"Thank you. The fast track strategy you just mentioned was once popular. You have to go backwards through 197 compartments, but you can buy items anyway, and after one lap you exit to 321, a high-difficulty zone. Of course, to use this strategy, the user's skills must be outstanding..."

In Shirone's opinion, it was a strategy worth trying on the second cycle.

The administrator reminded them.

"Have I explained enough? Then let me help you with enhancement business. There are two ways to enhance. One, pay all the points. Two, get a discount on points."

The group blinked.

"Discounts are available? What, like a holiday event?"

"It's a system for users. If you can persuade me, you can enhance your Crime Dice at 20 percent off the set price."

"20 percent?"

It was a bigger discount than expected.

'If we assume we're spending 100 million to add one more die, we could save 20 million.'

Nade asked.

"How do we persuade you? Should we sit down for tea and chat?"

"Hehe, no."

The administrator smiled coldly.

"Dice, of course."

Curtis's words about dice being king in the inner track suddenly came to mind.
