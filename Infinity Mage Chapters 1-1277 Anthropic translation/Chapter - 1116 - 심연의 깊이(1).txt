Depths of the Abyss (1)

Caden had given it his all, but in the end his fist roughly cut through empty air.

'Huh? Empty air?'

His movement stopped, but the people in the banquet hall were busy looking around in confusion.

"What? What's going on?"

Not just Marcus, but the positions of everyone in the banquet hall had changed.

Uorin grimaced.

"Ugh."

Sirone caught sight of her expression, but assessing the situation came first.

"Did something just happen—"

"I don't know."

Lufist shook his head.

"Something definitely happened, but I don't know what. Was I next to you?"

Sirone traced back his memories.

'The process of how I got here. I left my room, went through the corridor, and met Mr. Lufist...'

The moment he finished his recollection, goosebumps rose.

'I definitely moved.'

He was about 3 centimeters away from his position in his memory.

And digging deeper into his memories, it was the shortest distance among those whose positions had changed.

'I wasn't forcibly moved.' If something had moved, it would probably be his mind.

'I came here of my own will. Some action occurred, and it changed my mind.'

It felt like one of two events had been chosen, like with Ataraxia.

Therefore, those without temporal senses would be in an awkward feeling like déjà vu.

Lufist asked.

"Can you explain?"

"There are parts I can guess. But what I can't understand is that the scale is too large."

Ataraxia only causes changes where Sirone's actions are applied, but...

'Now everyone's positions have changed. In other words, the entire event has been twisted.'

This wasn't the level of temporal manipulation.

"This is the result of assuming hundreds of people's wills were twisted simultaneously. Who could do this?"

"Right."

Lufist stroked his chin.

"As you said, it's not spatial movement. I'm also standing here of my own will. But I have no memory of coming here. I was definitely over there."

He pointed to a corner of the banquet hall.

"Fleur was next to me, and I was making contact with an official from the Moon Kingdom. The memory is clear. The problem is, despite that, I feel like I came here of my own will."

"That's the key point."

Would it be possible to accept suddenly changing position despite having no memory of it?

"There's a similar case." Sirone recalled a man's face.

"Shagal of the Quick Sword. His life was filled with memories injected by La Enemie. Because of that, he became a murderer and has now fallen to hell."

"So essentially we all experienced the same phenomenon as Shagal. Just to different degrees."

"Yes. Shagal's entire life was completely erased. Anyway, changing the cause to control the result requires Anchera-level authority."

Lufist summarized.

"So what happened now is some ability that changes minds, quantum signals. And its power is..."

His gaze turned to the floor.

"Enough to push Yahweh's mind 3 centimeters?"

Considering everyone's positions had changed significantly, Sirone had essentially stayed in place.

'A mind unshaken by any variable.'

But the fact that even such Yahweh's steps had moved even a little was serious.

Lufist muttered.

"The system has changed..."

Sirone had the same thought, but this time he had no choice but to remain silent.

'This is definitely the work of the outside world. Sharing information is premature.'

Of course, there were those who knew, and probably one of them had reached the answer.

'Uorin.'

When Sirone turned his gaze, she was hurriedly leaving the banquet hall.

"Still, questions remain."

Lufist asked.

"Right. This is the result of everyone's will changing. Minds were twisted, and I'm standing here. But then..."

He pointed at Caden.

"Why did he swing his fist? If the result is that Marcus isn't in front of him, his right hand shouldn't have moved."

'Right, this is strange.'

As Sirone turned his head, Caden was looking at his right hand with a frown.

'What did I do?'

He remembered Marcus harassing Maya, but he also accepted that Marcus wasn't in front of him.

'I was just fantasizing. That bastard never actually came to me. But then why did I...'

Try to attack Marcus?

'Did I get angry just from thinking? Is that really it?'

His right hand had no answer.

While everyone felt similar confusion, Fermi's cold gaze targeted Caden.

'So that was it.'

It was one of the few unanalyzed keywords obtained from Apocalypse.

'Jailbreak.'

It was the phenomenon of escaping from the prison called the body, which tolerates not even an inch of gap.

Uorin's face, having left the banquet hall, was covered in cold sweat.

'This is impossible. How could such a thing...'

When the positions of people in the banquet hall changed, her future sight twisted drastically.

'The future changed.'

The lines of light fluctuated to a blinding degree, and tremendous shock was applied to her brain.

'The system. Changing the system itself isn't something humans can do. If it's possible...'

"Uorin—"

Her shoulders flinched.

Looking back, Sirone was walking quickly down the empty corridor.

"...Hmph."

She knew he would follow her, but she was somewhat disappointed.

'He only looks for me at times like this.'

Sirone said.

"The situation just now, you know what happened, don't you?"

"I don't know. Even if I did, there's no reason to explain it to you. We're competitors."

It was the irony that to win Sirone's heart, she had to defeat Sirone.

"God's perspective."

Since he had told Fermi the secret of the outside world, it would have reached Uorin's ears too.

"This is something only God can do. But I don't know exactly what happened."

"Sigh."

Uorin, who let out a sigh, said.

"Follow me."

Arriving at the Kashan area, she looked around before entering her room.

"No one will come for 35 minutes."

Because no special event traces appeared in the corridor she saw with future sight.

"In other words, only 35 minutes remain. I'll explain briefly. I also have information obtained from you."

Uorin organized her thoughts.

"Twelve nations gathered in the banquet hall. Some countries had kings attend like me, but several countries didn't come. The culprit is probably one of those countries."

"Moon. South. And..."

Sirone said in a sunken voice.

"Paras."

"Right. If God's ability acted on the banquet hall, Paras with the Pyramid of Truth is a strong candidate. You probably guess that King Kitra entered the pyramid."

"The emotional disease seems to have been cured too. The problem is by what method the system was changed."

"The Zodiac."

Uorin raised her index finger.

"The movement of stars."

Several people had left the banquet hall, and one of them was Emperor Jingang of Jincheon.

"Explain."

Getting straight to the point, Anchal, who had come close, bowed his head and said.

"The Jincheon Space Agency is investigating. Nothing particularly special happened. However..."

"However?"

"The positions of the stars have changed."

As Jingang's expression became displeased, words immediately followed.

"Actually, it's not enough to say they changed. Maybe they didn't change, but..."

"Explain properly."

Though he understood Jingang's feelings, even Anchal had no better explanation.

"Your Majesty must have felt it too, but some event was crushed into the realm of delusion. However, if that was an event that might have actually occurred..."

"Are you saying the star positions are different from before?"

"Yes. Not enough to confirm with the naked eye. About one over an astronomical number. But since my Magic Eye is an ability that deals with minds, I'm definitely feeling that something has changed."

"Hmm, the star positions are different."

Jingang stroked his beard and asked.

"What does that mean?"

"The primordial universe."

Uorin continued.

"All atomic actions from that moment created the current celestial bodies. Humans too, no, all existence in this universe is bound by the operation of those laws."

She opened the window.

"Because there is water, there are fish. Because there is sky, there are birds. Ancient humans realized this fact. And they named it fate."

Stars twinkled in the night sky.

"Actually, constellations don't have special power. They're just celestial bodies made that way. According to those rules determined from the start, the result is that certain humans live this way. The man named Caden was born with the fate of the Red Cross constellation, but..."

Uorin turned around.

"To be precise, Caden being born that way was already determined from the beginning of the universe, and the form of that result is the constellation we're seeing now."

A specific pattern created by star positions.

"The Red Cross is in the southern sky, seven red stars forming a cross shape. But what if... the star positions changed?"

Sirone finally understood.

"The laws change. Since the beginning of the universe, the initial cause, changed, the results also change."

"Right. Actually moving planets would cause big problems. But if it's different from the start, there's no sense of discomfort. Human logic is based on causality. I was born, I have parents, my parents have parents..."

Uorin rotated her hand.

"And finally reaching the beginning of the universe, human logic ends. Conversely, human logic begins from there, so whatever result appears now, we can't find it strange."

"Because it's a result reached while thoroughly following causality."

This was why everyone in the banquet hall believed it was their own will despite having different memories.

"Right. There are memory errors. But that's not everything. The changed positions of people in the banquet hall means a universal-scale change occurred. Of course, the numerical value of that change might be infinitesimally small, but we must consider that Paras has the ability for fine adjustments."

Sirone recalled Piri, the leader of the new humanity.

'Nane said this is just the beginning. But did Fermi know that beginning would be Paras?'

"Sirone, I can't know what Kitra is thinking. What we need to do is uncover the secrets of the outside world faster than Paras."

"I'm exploring the Pyramid of Truth, but it seems like it will take time. We need to settle things before the holy war ends, but..."

"There's one more thing."

"Huh?"

Uorin crossed her arms and asked.

"Inside Ymir's dream. Doesn't the quantum signal being cut off mean it's connected to the outside world?"

At the cool analysis, Sirone closed his mouth.

'Come to think of it...'

What were those who entered the dream to loot Ultima doing now?
