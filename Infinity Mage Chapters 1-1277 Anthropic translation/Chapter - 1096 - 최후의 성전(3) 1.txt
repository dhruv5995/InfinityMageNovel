The Final Holy War (3)

'Come to think of it...'

Shirone recalled that Ares was an explorer by profession and immediately understood.

'He said he makes maps.'

Ares spoke.

"Wherever I go, I hear stories about you. How are things with Amy? You two are getting along well, right?"

"Don't tell me you haven't been home?"

"Haha! Life just turned out that way. I send letters occasionally, but I can't receive replies."

Ares seemed cheerful, and that was truly the free-spirited Karmis family way.

"Anyway..."

After their pleasant reunion ended, he became conscious of the surrounding gazes and whispered.

"Let's go somewhere quiet first. You're trying to enter the Pyramid of Truth, right? I need to talk with you."

Though his thoughts about it being a dangerous mission remained unchanged, it would be good to hear about Ares's current situation.

"Should we have a meal then?"

"Good. My team is waiting. I'll introduce you, so take a good look. They're all capable people."

Even at the words subtly steering toward an interview atmosphere, Shirone wasn't swayed.

While heading to where his team members were, Ares asked.

"How is she doing?"

He didn't need to ask who.

Stang National Magic School.

The final training ended as the sun was setting.

"Haa. Haa."

Wizard exhaled roughly, but her expression was full of accomplishment.

'I did it.'

Everything Shirone could teach her - literally Shirone's essence.

"Congratulations, Wizard."

The teachers applauded, and Shirone and Amy, who had been watching the training, walked over.

The reason they couldn't simply smile was because her first real battle would be too harsh.

'Will she be able to do it?'

To kill.

'Even if someone is the worst human in the universe, killing someone isn't easy. It has to be considered separately from skill. If Wizard hesitates even for a moment...'

Havitz wouldn't miss that opening.

"Teacher."

Wizard looked up at Shirone with clear eyes.

'Good eyes.'

Clear and bright eyes that seemed incapable of killing anyone, not even a single insect.

'But that's exactly why it's possible.'

He had no intention of glorifying it, but even so, Wizard's thinking transcended the category of murder.

'No resentment toward Havitz, no special purpose or will. Purity that transcends humanity.'

That's why she could see through Vanishing.

'It's like a natural phenomenon. No, her mind is already nature itself. If I were to describe Wizard...'

A good Havitz, perhaps?

The deep meaning contained in those words weighed heavily on his heart.

'The only natural enemy. This is the only way.'

Now able to know his mood just by looking at Shirone's eyes, she smiled and said.

"All preparations are complete."

"Yes. Let's go."

To Jive, where the Holy War General Assembly would be held.

"Rest well today. We'll leave the Stang Kingdom tomorrow. I'll follow you too."

"Yes. Thank you for everything until now."

Watching Wizard walk away, Shirone sighed, and Amy patted his shoulder.

"You did your best. Let's have faith."

"We have to."

Shirone's eyes became momentarily distant, then he suddenly turned his head as if remembering something.

"Oh, by the way, have you heard any news about Ares?"

"Huh? My brother? No, I haven't heard anything. Why all of a sudden?"

"Well... actually, he's with me right now. In the Paras Kingdom. He seems to be investigating the pyramid."

Amy blinked with a blank expression, then suddenly frowned.

"That idiot..."

Then she grabbed Shirone's ear and shouted.

"Hey! If he's alive and well, shouldn't he come home at least once! Do you know how worried Mom and Dad are?"

"Ow ow ow!"

Shirone squinted one eye, but Amy was half out of her mind.

"Whether he's dead or alive, no news at all! The only letters he sends are bloody drawings, and I really..."

"Stop, stop!"

Shirone rubbed his earlobe and grumbled.

"That's not how you do it. This is..."

But the moment he saw tears forming in Amy's eyes, he couldn't say anything.

"I really thought he was dead..."

Shirone embraced Amy and patted her back.

"It's okay. He's doing well."

Wizard, who had turned around at the training ground entrance, watched that scene for a long time.

Nagnag Oasis.

"When this is over, you should probably contact them. They're very worried."

Ares smiled sadly.

"...Is that so?"

When you love your work too much, you sometimes hurt the people you love.

"Ares!"

At the rough voice, Shirone looked ahead.

Three people who appeared to be Ares's team members were making puzzled expressions.

Shirone recognized one of them.

'Great Swordsman Yufra.'

Except for his graying beard, he looked almost identical to his younger self recorded in Omega.

'Master of twin swords. Aggressive personality.'

Though he must be well over sixty, he seemed to still be active.

The other two looked like a couple, appeared to be in their late twenties, and were wearing priest robes.

The woman asked.

"Ares, who are these people?"

As if nothing had happened, Ares laughed heartily and introduced Shirone.

"Aryan Shirone. Amy's boyfriend."

That was the entire introduction, but there was hardly anyone in the world who didn't know Shirone.

"Yahweh?"

"Nice to meet you. I'm..."

Shirone, who was about to offer a handshake, saw the priests' brows furrow slightly.

'Lamicists.'

If they were reluctant upon hearing the word Yahweh, they could only be Lamicists who believed in the one god.

The man turned to look at Ares.

"What's going on?"

He was asking why Ares had brought him here despite knowing the relationship between Lamicism and Yahweh.

Ares scratched his head.

"Well, you see..."

If it were another matter, there wouldn't be a need to introduce them, but this time was different.

"We were rejected by the government office. Even showing the ministerial certificate was useless."

The woman raised one eyebrow.

"What do you mean? After all the lobbying... I mean, persuasion the Papal Office did to obtain that."

She glanced at Shirone and continued.

"Give it here. I'll go and come back."

"There's no need. No matter what we say, they won't listen. First of all, the king has changed. Plus, there are rumors that this king isn't normal."

The man asked.

"So what. What does that have to do with bringing Yahweh? Can this person enter?"

"Exactly that."

"Huh?"

"He has a pass personally approved by the king. With this, we'd have free passage too."

Shirone interjected.

"I never said I'd accompany you."

While the priests' expressions became serious, Ares pushed Shirone's back and said.

"Now, now! So let's eat first, food."

Ares, who was taking Shirone's group away, turned to look at the priest group and winked.

The woman asked.

"...What are we going to do?"

"Let's go for now. His Holiness has high expectations for this expedition too."

If there was something in the outer world, it should be the one god that Lamicism believes in.

So the ten people gathered in the restaurant sat facing each other across a long table.

When Ares introduced himself, Canis and Arin looked surprised.

'So that person is Ares. I didn't recognize him because of his beard, but now I see his eyes resemble Amy's.'

Archaeology and mapmaking were different fields, but they were in the same general category.

"The two priests here are, well, as you've probably guessed, Lamicist priests."

The man's name was Glen, the woman was Rukia.

"You know the Papal Office is divided into two departments, right? The Parish Management Office and the Holy Knight Office."

"Ah, yes."

The Holy Knight Office has Paladins.

"Glen and Rukia work at the Parish Management Office. Both are top-class clergy."

Faith to a priest was like mental power to a mage, so he could guess the meaning.

'Well, for a mission investigating super-ancient civilization, the Papal Office wouldn't send just anyone.'

Next he introduced Great Swordsman Yufra, and it was Shirone's group's turn.

Glen and Rukia listened calmly, but their expressions changed when the Twelve Apostles were mentioned.

'Dragons.'

A few days ago, they had seen the ice dragon and earth dragon's breath fill the oasis.

They were in polymorph form now, but the eeriness from that time still remained in their bodies.

Ares cleared his throat.

"Well, now that we've all introduced ourselves, shall we listen until the food comes? How did you get the king's approval? I heard he's eccentric and completely unpredictable."

"We received Zulu's help."

When Shirone told them about what had happened, Ares's group also nodded in understanding.

"Hmm, you stayed quite a long time. Still, it's fortunate you got the permit. So, speaking of which..."

Ares pointed at himself with his thumb.

"Include us too."

"No."

Ares hadn't expected to be rejected outright and looked dazed, while Glen and Rukia narrowed their brows.

"I'm sorry. I'd like to help you too, but this is really dangerous work."

"How would you know?" Glen argued.

"The Papal Office has eyes and ears too. Super-ancient civilization is a place related to the outer world, but no one knows what kind of place it is."

Shirone knew.

"Shall I tell you? Yahweh, you just don't want Lamicism to investigate the Pyramid of Truth. If the existence of God is proven there, Yahweh would become a fraud."

"That doesn't matter to me."

"Then why are you saying no! Do you think we, who are called the Papal Office's finest priests, would give up because it's dangerous? Ares too, and Yufra here, would probably be stronger than the friends sitting next to you?"

Canis bristled.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Canis, hold back for now."

Arin stopped him, but Canis's shadow was already extending beyond his back.

'Mado creature.'

As long arms emerged from both sides of the shadow, Yufra finally revealed his killing intent too.

Ares held out both hands.

"What? Why's the atmosphere like this? He's my little sister's boyfriend. Everyone calm down first."

Shirone didn't want to fight either.

"This kind of thing is meaningless. I received the pass. Forming a team is also my authority."

Glen didn't back down either.

"Exploring the existence of God is our authority. If we can't enter, you can't enter either."

Canis said.

"Shirone, let's just accept them. Glen, was it? Does the god you believe in tell you to steal other people's passes too?"

Glen's face turned red.

"Don't attach God's name to just anything! This is my personal fight!"

"Haha, so it's personal at times like this? Well, you guys..."

"Stop it!"

Rukia stood up abruptly and shouted.

"Don't blaspheme God anymore! Glen is acting like this because of me too. Glen, let's give up now."

"No, I can't do that. I'll go to the Pyramid of Truth by any means necessary."

Canis said.

"Then go get yourself a pass."

Not caring about the sarcastic remark, Glen stared straight at Shirone.

"Let's decide here. You and me, who is more suitable to explore God."

"I'm telling you clearly, I refuse. I don't want to fight anyone. Ares, I'm sorry."

Since Glen was the one who ruined the atmosphere, even Ares had nothing to say this time.

"Let's go."

As Shirone tried to leave, Glen glared fiercely and rushed at him.

"Wait a minute!"

"Glen! Please... Heok!"

Rukia, who had stood up to stop her lover, suddenly clutched her chest and collapsed to the floor.

"Rukia!"

"Ahh! Ahh!"

Her whole body trembled in tremendous pain, and blood vessels that rose along her neck climbed to her cheeks.

"Rukia! Get a hold of yourself! Just hold on a little! Rukia!"

Shirone immediately realized.

"Emotional sickness."

The disease created by demons had flowed even to the Papal Office, carried by the continent's winds.
