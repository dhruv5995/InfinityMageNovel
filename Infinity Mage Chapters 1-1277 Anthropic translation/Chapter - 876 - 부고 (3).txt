Obituary (3)

After the grueling four-hour training session ended, the students were completely exhausted.

Among those who showed signs of fatigue and were gasping for breath were Mark and Maria, who had been close to Shirone.

"Long time no see."

When Shirone approached with a smile, Mark jumped up despite his exhaustion.

"Senior! I didn't think you'd actually come."

Though their time together had been brief, Mark and Maria were also among those who had taken the graduation exam alongside Fisho.

"Yeah. So you heard too."

"Yes." Mark glanced around at his friends, trying not to show his feelings, but suddenly turned red as if remembering something.

"I'm sorry, senior. I wanted to catch up quickly, but I'm still stuck in the graduation class."

It wasn't something that could be achieved through determination alone.

Since Shirone had already graduated, it was fine for him, but thinking back to that time, it was dizzying to remember how he had managed it.

"It's okay. You're making progress."

Mark took pride in that.

"Of course. I'll never give up."

After the students left for lunch, Shirone's group talked with the teachers in the faculty office.

"Huh? But where's Teacher Ethella?"

She hadn't been visible during class, and even her desk in the faculty office was missing.

"Teacher Ethella..."

Shiina chose her words carefully.

"She left the school."

"Left? Where to?"

"Well..."

Shiina hesitated again, unable to find any words to explain to Shirone.

Alpheas changed the subject.

"So, where are you planning to go now? There are three days left until Fisho's funeral, so you should visit home too."

"My parents are staying at the Ogent house. I'm planning to stay there as well."

As he spoke, Shirone realized something.

'Rian isn't there.'

There was no one to defend him regarding Guy's death, and even his parents were there.

'Maybe it's for the better.'

To rebuild his spirit, he shouldn't hide behind anyone.

Shirone's group left Alpheas Magic School after their brief reunion.

Since they would meet again at the funeral, they decided to ask about Ethella then.

In the nobles' district, Amy asked.

"I'm going to my family home. Do you want to come with me, Maya? You don't have anywhere to stay anyway."

"It's okay. I can stay at a hotel."

Shirone strongly objected.

"No way. You're a celebrity. Besides, your agency people aren't here either."

Palmers had made a separate request to the military and was coming down through a different route.

"Don't be like that, let's go together. Are you uncomfortable being with me?"

"No, absolutely not!"

Maya jumped up in denial, but as a human being, it was true that it wouldn't be a comfortable situation.

"Then how about going to Ogent?"

"Ah, no... that's also..."

Maya waved her hands again, but she seemed much more hesitant than before.

"Just let me stay at a hotel. I'll stay somewhere nice, so I won't need security."

Shirone also thought it would be best for Maya to stay wherever she'd be most comfortable.

"Alright. Then let's meet in three days."

"Yeah. Take care, everyone."

Being considerate of Amy, Maya left first and headed toward the lodging facilities.

"Sigh."

She was sad to part with Shirone, but honestly, she felt much more relieved now.

'How long will this continue?'

Both Shirone and Amy were the type who couldn't hurt others, making her position caught in the middle even more miserable.

'Should I try meeting someone else?'

She had heard the saying that wounds from trials should be forgotten with new people so many times it was ingrained in her ears.

But if it were as easy as it sounded, there wouldn't be people in the world suffering from love's fever.

'A man more wonderful than Shirone...'

She couldn't readily think of what that would be, and feeling frustrated, Maya shook her head.

'I don't know. It's wrong to have such thoughts before a friend's funeral.'

Though it was a luxury hotel, since the population wasn't as large as the capital, it was only a four-story building.

Maya's popularity in Tormia was far superior to other countries, so noble young men recognized her.

"Hey, over there! That's her, right?"

"Huh? I think so! This is the first time seeing her up close. What brings her to Creas?"

"Right. She seems to be alone."

As Maya, who had rented a room on the fourth floor, went up the central stairs, the young men made eye contact.

"Should we ask her to hang out with us?"

They had nothing to lose.

Cross family training room.

In a narrow stone chamber barely large enough for one desk, Cayden sat cross-legged.

"The fate of the Red Cross star."

Having left magic school and returned to his family home, he spent time only in the training room.

"Cayden, it's time to leave."

Cayden's father opened the door and entered.

Seeing the portraits of Maya densely attached throughout the stone chamber, he sighed.

'Just how long...'

At first, he had asked who it was, but Cayden wouldn't tell him anything.

However, as time passed, he learned that the person in the portraits was Maya, the world-famous singer.

'At your age, to be obsessed with an entertainer.'

Cayden opened his mouth.

"I'll leave after staying one more hour."

"Listen, you shouldn't be late for at least your classmate's funeral. Just how long are you going to live like this?"

The world is turbulent.

Even when the Cross family, one of Tormia's representative bloodlines, should step forward, the heir is obsessed with a singer.

"Say something. You didn't say anything when you left magic school either. But what is this? You don't even train, just hole up here every day drawing pictures."

"Training isn't necessary, father."

Given the reputation of the name Cayden, his father asked with hopeful eyes.

"...Did you gain some kind of enlightenment?"

"Enlightenment isn't necessary either."

"Then what! What exactly have you been doing all this time holed up in here!"

"I'm accepting it."

As golden energy emanated from Cayden's body, his father stepped back.

"Th-this is..."

The Red Cross star of sacrifice.

From the beginning, what Cayden needed wasn't grueling training or supreme enlightenment.

"I'm accepting fate."

He was giving up on Maya.

If that were possible, the Red Cross star would elevate Cayden to become the strongest being in history.

Arriving at the Ogent house, Shirone burst into tears at the reunion with his parents.

Family head Bishoff and Reina, who had come down to the main house, watched the scene warmly.

But the touching moment was brief, and Shirone's face soon turned cold as he moved away from his parents.

"I have something I want to tell you."

"Yes. We have a lot we want to hear too."

Bishoff sat at the head seat and offered a place, but Shirone knelt heavily on the cold floor.

Reina stood up again.

"Shirone? What are you doing? Why are you acting like this?"

"Just a moment... please listen to what I have to say."

At Shirone's serious tone, Reina sat back down, and the story began.

In a calm tone, but honestly, he confessed everything.

From the first time he met Guy to the incident where Yahweh's Rage, which he had no memory of, was unleashed.

"Brother Guy..."

Guy was dead.

Vincent and Olina buried their faces in their hands, and Reina's staggering knees buckled.

"Brother... brother..."

Unable to hold back any longer, Reina burst into tears.

Even in the pain as if a dagger was piercing his heart, Shirone just stared down at the ground.

"I am the one who killed Guy."

As Shirone stated the fact once more, Bishoff spoke for the first time.

There was undeniable anger in his voice.

"Does Rian know?"

"Yes."

"What did that guy say?"

"This has nothing to do with Rian."

Shirone was firm, and Bishoff could easily imagine what kind of action Rian would have taken.

'It's not Shirone's fault.'

Anyone would think that, but from Bishoff's perspective, his son was dead.

"Guy betrayed humanity. He brought shame to our family. No one in the world would blame you."

"That's why I came here."

Bishoff stood up.

"I suppose so. You're my son's enemy. So... what are you going to do now?"

Reina, who had been sniffling, opened her eyes wide seeing Bishoff draw his sword.

"Dad, what are you doing right now?"

As the blade approached Shirone, Vincent and Olina's faces turned pale.

"F-family head..."

Vincent spoke in a trembling voice, but Bishoff's killing intent didn't waver.

"Why is that? My child is dead, but you're saying I should just forgive Mr. Vincent's child?"

"Th-that's..."

Vincent closed his mouth.

If the dead person had been Shirone instead of Guy, would he have been able to forgive the Ogent family?

"Let me ask you one thing."

Shirone raised his head with the sword at his neck.

"Yes, please speak."

"Really... was there really no other way? I know how strong you are. Can you be certain there was no choice other than killing?"

"No."

Bishoff's face contorted.

"Choose your words carefully."

Shirone thought again.

"I've already agonized over this countless times. The answer is the same. If I had made better judgment, Guy wouldn't have died."

"Hah."

Bishoff sheathed his sword and returned to his seat.

"Why don't you make excuses? You know you need reasons for us to forgive you, don't you? Do you want to become enemies? Even if you do, we don't have the ability to kill you."

"I don't know."

Shirone spoke honestly.

"What I should do. I just felt like I could find an answer by coming here."

Because it wasn't an answer he could find on his own.

"Leave."

Bishoff said.

"Even if we forgive you, nothing will change. This is a matter of emotions. And emotions require time."

He could understand that.

No, the fact that Bishoff could suppress his emotions to this extent alone made him superhuman.

"There's one condition."

The spirit of the great sword way wasn't cowardly, so Shirone readily nodded.

"Yes. I'll comply with anything."

"Forget. I give you permission. At least until this war ends, don't keep Guy's matter in your heart."

"Family head..."

"It's not for your sake. It's because you must show in the future that my son's death wasn't in vain."

Tears flowed down Shirone's cheeks.

"Thank you. Thank you."

He finally understood why he had thought there would be answers at the Ogent house.

There was dignity here.

"Then I'll be going."

As Shirone prepared to leave, Vincent and Olina stood up to follow.

"Family head, then we'll also..."

Reina stepped forward.

"Dad, that's just talk, but what if you really send them away? It would be difficult for Shirone's parents too."

Not accepting Shirone was a form of punishment, but there was no need to complicate the situation.

Bishoff, who had been staring at Reina, stood up as if he had made a decision.

"Fine, I'll go out for a while. I need to announce Guy's obituary anyway. Shirone, you come with me."

Reina asked.

"You're going out together? Just the two of you?"

Ignoring his daughter's words, Bishoff looked back at Shirone and said.

"Do you drink?"
