Heart and Error (4)

Apocalypse.

The mining team's judgment was correct.

As they descended into the building's underground levels, a main system towering dozens of meters high filled the vast cavity.

"What is this?"

Marsha gaped in amazement, looking up at the pillar that reached all the way to the ceiling.

It was pulsing out brilliant white light like a heartbeat, as if all the signals of this world had been combined into one.

"Hurry up."

The Operator backed away while looking toward the entrance they had come through.

Jet wasn't visible yet, but they could feel through the vibrations that countless androids were descending.

High Gear's administrator, Lollipop Mark, pressed a hacking card against the pillar.

As a hologram unfolded, code raced by too fast for the eye to follow.

Lollipop Mark, who had been holding onto a sliver of hope, hung his head.

"I'm sorry. As expected, I can't decode this. This world's language seems to be far more sophisticated than what we know."

"What do you mean? Sophisticated?"

"There's absolutely no room for misinterpretation. This would be the final stage that code can reach, but humans can't understand something like that."

Number Seven said, "You don't necessarily need to understand the language to infiltrate a system. It's like how you can startle a dog even without knowing dog language."

"That's only possible because you know the concept of a dog. So what do you think this is?"

When the group fell silent, Lollipop continued.

"Number Seven isn't wrong. It's just that we need at least this world's basic code table. That's the only way we can create data."

Marsha asked, "Where do we get a code table?"

"The easiest method is to reboot the system. Then we can decode it to some extent. It's like guessing that the first thing a foreigner would say is 'hello' even if you don't know their language."

The Operator asked, "What if that foreigner is from a strange country and doesn't say 'hello'?"

"Then there's no way. But if my prediction is correct, that won't happen. This isn't a strange country. It's just..."

Lollipop looked up at the top of the pillar.

"Our future."

Marsha asked, "Should we destroy this? That might create an opportunity."

It sounded absurd to the programmer, but honestly, he had considered it.

"If we could, we would have done it already. We confirmed from outside, remember? No attack can damage it."

The Operator said, "They're coming."

The elevator arrived underground, and they could see Jets swarming inside the transparent glass walls.

'Sirone. I don't know where you are or what you're doing, but...'

He hoped Sirone would hurry.

"Please have some tea."

Following the Jet he had met on the rooftop into the building, Sirone was being hosted in a room.

"Ah, thank you."

He couldn't understand how an android could brew tea, but the room's scenery was even more surprising.

A bed with fluffy blankets, carpet on the floor, and unfamiliar fish swimming in an aquarium.

Just like... a human.

Jet said, "Don't worry about your companions. I opened the door to the main system, so they should have entered safely."

As Jet sat at the table with his own cup of tea, Sirone's gaze turned to the teacup.

"Yes, I cannot drink. Or rather, I have no need to drink."

Code flowed across his facial screen.

"Just the code of having drunk tea means I've already drunk tea. The result would be the same anyway."

Sirone realized there was no difference between his drinking tea and Jet's action.

"Why did you help me?"

"Is it strange? I suppose it could be. By your standards, we're just lifeless machines."

Jet looked around at the aquarium.

"These are the ones I brought before rivers disappeared. Though 30,000 generations have passed, these little ones continue to live with me, endlessly carrying on their lineage. Of course, their forms and habits have changed considerably."

How far in the future was this place?

"Raising these little ones, I witnessed death. I also witnessed birth. Without such events, I too would have been no different from other Jets."

"How are you different now?"

Jet didn't answer.

"What is life?"

Instead, he posed a question to Sirone.

"Why do we live? If the end of life is ultimately death, what meaning does our existence have?"

"Since having such doubts, I've studied life. The conclusion I reached is that life is time spent preparing for death."

Sirone listened attentively.

"How shall we die? Life exists solely for that question. Then another doubt arises: How then should we live?"

Jet raised his index finger.

"Without regret. Living with utmost effort so that not a trace of remorse remains at the final moment."

It was a paradox about death.

"Then what is 'utmost effort'? I believe it's moderation. An overly ascetic life leaves behind lingering attachments. Conversely, a dissolute life leaves behind obsessions."

Jet formed a mudra with his hands.

"Therefore, emptiness. Emptiness is not nihility. It's feeling and accepting countless emotions, yet not imprisoning them but letting them flow. By completing such a mind that accepts death, one reaches enlightenment that transcends life and death."

It felt strange receiving a sermon from a machine, but precisely because of that, questions arose.

"But you are..."

"Yes. I have no life. I'm a machine."

Jet pointed to the aquarium.

"Those small lives may have changed something in the system that comprises me. Perhaps I am nearly the only error in this world."

"Error."

Sirone also thought: 'Heart.'

Can a heart dwell in a machine?

"How is that possible? For an error to occur in a world of perfect law?"

Jet smiled.

"No system is perfect until it's complete. It's a conceptual problem. Just like there's no way to prove there isn't a single bug in this city."

Unless the city itself disappeared.

"I see."

Warning code appeared on Jet's face.

"Your companions are attempting to access the main system. But it won't be easy."

"Can you help?"

Jet shook his head.

"It's beyond my authority. I bypass the system in ways other Jets cannot approach, but I cannot change the system itself. It's the exact opposite concept from heart. The main system is perfect. Regardless of whether errors exist or not, it doesn't acknowledge any errors."

That god's perspective had driven the world to this point.

Jet continued, "Nevertheless, the reason I brought you here is because I believe change will come soon. Just as the small lives in the aquarium changed me, I think there's hope as long as you've entered this world."

What dreams was Jet dreaming?

"I will tell you. The secret of this world. Where we are. Where we came from, and where we're heading."

It was the truth of the outer world.

The Sun's core.

In their spiritual forms, the archangels were doing their utmost to reverse the laws of the universe.

"Huuuugh!"

Though not in a physical realm, it was the work of changing the forward motion of the entire universe.

"It's impossible."

The law was so powerful that such words could be uttered.

"We were merely such beings all along. Insignificant parts within the gears."

As Satiel began losing the will of an archangel, Rayel said, "Hold on just a little longer. If we retreat here, it's over. Not just for you and me, but all angels will lose the meaning of existence."

Though he encouraged her, he too knew the truth.

'We can't hold out much longer.'

The angle of change wasn't large, but it was bearing the weight of the entire universe.

'If we give ground one step, we can continue living like that. But the moment we hold firm to protect something...'

We get crushed.

'Should we stop here? Should we lay down angelic authority and live as mortals, according to God's will?'

It didn't matter either way.

'But why?'

Why did we exist in this world?

'Fight.'

The moment he resisted with all his heart, his spiritual form began to collapse.

"Rayel!"

Before his comrade's devastating state, Satiel bit his lip.

'How frustrating!'

If he had a body, he would have wept tears of blood.

'Is this all we are? Are we so weak...'

"Don't give up."

At that moment, tremendous force pushed back the law.

"Ikael."

As the pressure decreased enough to breathe, Satiel and Rayel realized anew:

'Incredible power.'

The mother of all concepts, the power of amplification born simultaneously with the universe's birth.

"We can do it. We're not insignificant beings. We define ourselves."

As much as those words gave him courage, Satiel felt both anger and sadness simultaneously.

'The very one who took Guffin away.'

But also... an angel he had respected more than anything else in the world.

'I hate this.'

The hatred that seemed like it would remain in his heart forever was seeping away, and the feeling was unbearably bitter.

Could he let it flow away like this?

"Joining hands is only for now! Once we reverse the law, we'll fight again."

If one more chance were given, then he wanted to hear what Ikael had to say.

"...Yes."

Of course, Ikael also knew this was the end.

'I existed with all my might.'

To award at least that medal, Ikael pushed her consciousness into the law.

"No! Don't go!"

'I'm sorry, Sirone.'

Just as her spiritual form was about to scatter like mist and decompose into mere signals.

Opening her eyes at a strange sensation, she found one archangel bearing the law before her.

"Kariel?"

Kariel, the Archangel of Birth, looked back at her with a beautiful smile.

"Kariel..."

Just as she remembered, full of curiosity and goodness.

Then Phiel, the Archangel of Extinction, placed a hand on her shoulder, and Metatron and Methiel approached from left and right to lend their strength.

'My life wasn't in vain.'

Thus, hearts connect.

As the seven archangels combined their power, they could feel the law gradually reversing.

Satiel trembled.

'It's working. We can do it!'

And the change that occurred in the Sun's core immediately affected not only Sirone's planet but also Apocalypse.

As the building shook as if an earthquake had struck, Sirone looked up at the ceiling with a startled expression.

Fragments were falling down with thuds.

"What?"

The structure that no method could even crack was breaking apart.

"It's the beginning of change."

Being able to guess the result without knowing the cause was Jet's unique insight.

"There doesn't seem to be much time. It would be faster to explain in machine language rather than human language."

As Jet sat cross-legged on the floor, Sirone also calmed his mind and sat facing him.

The vibrations were growing stronger.
