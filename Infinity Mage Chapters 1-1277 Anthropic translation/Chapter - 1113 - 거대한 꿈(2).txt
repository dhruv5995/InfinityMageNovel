**Huge Dream (2)**

The chamber fell silent.

Having taken pride in their nation's military might, they now realized the gravity of the situation.

'He broke through the royal guards of all 12 nations. It's right to assume he can't be stopped.'

In the minds of each nation's leaders, Quan's status was elevated to Harvitz's level.

'There's no need to step forward unnecessarily and draw attention.'

In the face of a realistic assassination threat, no amount of caution was excessive.

Of course, this had nothing to do with pride.

"Hmph."

Starting with Unryong's snort, the kings of each nation showed their displeasure with the current situation.

It was simply... better for troublesome arrows to be aimed at others rather than oneself.

Uorin looked back at Harvitz.

"Snore."

God's Frequency was still operating, and Quan's sounds would be collected even in sleep.

'As expected, he's not waking up.'

The human who had once severed his neck didn't seem particularly important to Satan.

'So that's how it was.'

Uorin realized why she had been able to rely on Harvitz, even if briefly.

'He doesn't resent anything.'

He too must have had a life. The causes accumulated from before birth must have created the current Satan.

'He doesn't think about it. A being with causes but unaffected by those causes. The most inhuman thing.'

That's why he was supremely evil.

"Snore."

If Satan also dreamed, she was quite curious what the scenery in those dreams would look like.

Kayla of the Corona Kingdom asked.

"Are you worried?"

Ever since Quan entered the chamber, it felt like Armin's bottom had been fidgeting.

"No."

Armin changed his words.

"Actually... yes."

Though he had set aside his feelings for Shiina, she was still someone precious to him.

"Don't misunderstand. I don't mean I'm worried in that sense. It's because of Mr. Quan."

Kayla observed Quan.

"He's lost one ear. Doesn't look like he cut it off though."

"The reason for disrupting physical balance is to create mental asymmetry. When he first cut off his arm, he had to carve out the schema, but strictly speaking, it's a matter of the mind. Even when he cut one eye, he wasn't greatly constrained by form. Now it seems blocking sensations is sufficient."

"That's fortunate. Honestly, though it's someone else's business, it would be too horrible from Ms. Shiina's perspective."

"It's actually the opposite." That was why Armin was worried.

"He won't be able to lean by cutting something anymore. Yet he sat next to Shiina."

"...What more could he possibly carve out?"

"I don't know. Only he would know, but one thing's certain - he's made a decision."

He wouldn't hesitate.

And when he finally carved out half of whatever last thing remained to him...

'What will Quan become?'

Receiving the attention of everyone present, Shiina kept glancing at the seat beside her.

Quan had no particular expression.

'I can't figure him out.'

She had been excited about meeting Quan since being selected as part of the Teachers' Council delegation.

'He never once came to see me.'

So clearly avoiding her, he never came anywhere near where Shiina was.

"Why have you changed your mind now?"

There was no answer.

"You kept avoiding me. Shouldn't you at least tell me the reason? I have my pride too."

When Quan showed no sign of opening his mouth, Shiina's frustration burst out.

"Fine. Go back. Honestly, I was trying to set aside my feelings for you too."

Quan quietly stood up.

"Oh, really."

Desperate, Shiina grabbed Quan's wrist and pulled him forcefully back down.

"Sigh."

How did she end up entangled with such a stubborn person?

"Fine. I won't ask for reasons, so let's talk later. Don't run away again."

She didn't mention his lost ear.

'He's a good person.'

She knew that even saying such things would burden Quan.

"Ms. Shiina."

Shiina looked back at Quan and was stunned.

It was the first time he had smiled with such an expression when he had been nothing but venomous before.

"I like you. I'm sincere."

At the sudden confession, Shiina's face reddened and the teachers cleared their throats awkwardly.

Shiina hastily turned her head away.

'Why is he suddenly like this?'

Quan's face wasn't scary at all, but somehow fear was rising.

'He's resolved something.'

In her anxious heart, she made a promise.

"Fine. Then promise me just one thing. Don't leave like that again. When I say I want to meet you, I should be able to."

Had he resolved to die, or was he about to disappear somewhere again?

All kinds of thoughts swirled in her head, but surprisingly, Quan nodded.

"Yes."

Wondering what had gotten into him, she turned to see Quan's single eye filled with conviction.

"I'll stay by your side, Ms. Shiina."

After watching him for a long while, Shiina realized what her expression must look like.

"Ah."

Hiding her shy face, she adjusted her glasses back to her cold image.

"I'll be watching. This is your last chance..."

Quan also turned his head, but his smile lingered at the corners of his mouth like an echo for a long time.

The chairman stepped forward to handle the situation.

"I judge the previous speaker's remarks to be contrary to the Holy War's motto and will invalidate them. The Holy War exists for world peace, and we will make an official proposal as soon as possible..."

Things concluded awkwardly, and representatives of Holy War affiliated organizations briefed on world affairs.

Amira from the World Climate Organization reported the situation of demon realms opened in various countries on a large screen.

"Emotional diseases, mutations, tsunamis, heat waves - the entire world is suffering from disasters. In response, each nation..."

Numerous chatter was buried under the microphone sound.

"75 points. Pretty face but those eyes are a bit... I'd be too scared of a woman like that."

"Come on, Your Highness. That style is exciting. Just look at that figure. Isn't it killer?"

A secretary behind them made a disgusted expression and scratched his thumbnail while listening to their conversation.

'Ah, damn. The jewel fell off again. I paid a lot for this. Would it look weird if I looked for it now?'

Amira changed the screen.

"Mommy! Mommy!"

A child sat crying where a tsunami had swept away their home.

"War orphans number in the hundreds of thousands, and relief supplies are severely lacking. Above all, for orphanage construction..."

"Oh right, there's supposedly a royal banquet on the Arachne side around midnight. Will you be attending?"

"Of course we have to go. Humanity is in crisis - shouldn't we do something big?"

"Of course. There's just no time to rest these days. Your Highness works so hard."

Seriel from the World Health Organization came up.

"Hooh?"

The prince's gaze changed.

"Greetings. It's an honor to stand before the gathered leaders of each nation. As you've seen on screen, countless people are suffering. As a researcher with the World Health Organization, rather than special explanations, I'd like to tell you about one case of emotional disease."

"85 points. She passes."

Seriel opened a file.

"A terrible tragedy that befell one family just 10 days ago."

Emotional Disease Case, Number 9-674.

"Aaaaah!"

The man screamed while tied to a chair.

"Dad! Dad!"

"Don't come!"

Households that couldn't get help when analysis of emotional disease was nearly complete knew what they had to do.

'No! Absolutely not!'

If you can't endure it, you have no choice but to force yourself into a state where you can endure.

'Not my family. Never my family.'

Cases of killing family members for momentary comfort when unable to bear the pain were common.

"Aaaaaaaah!"

It hurt too much, and his skin was tattered from being tied with rope.

The nail driven into the chair bottom shook.

"Go! Don't come!"

Even as his consciousness faded from pain, he didn't regret his choice.

'I should be the one tied up.'

Because he was the man, the strongest.

'Yes, this is how it should be.'

Then the locked door burst open and two children and their mother came in crying.

"Dad."

They held knives in their hands.

"Dad, I hurt so much. It hurts so much I feel like I'm dying."

Seeing his family, who had already lost human appearance after months of pain,

'I love you.'

The man smiled and nodded.

"The family that lost their head hanged themselves three days later when emotional disease broke out again."

The atmosphere became solemn.

'Stupid fools. They should have believed in Satanism.'

Seriel's voice was choked.

"Do you think this is an extreme case? There are still underdeveloped regions worldwide where information is lacking and relief efforts don't reach."

"The more I look, the better she gets. Good, 87 points."

When the prince's quietly muttered words seeped into the air, Fermi turned his head.

Seeing the cool gaze, the prince mouthed:

What's it to you, bastard?

After glaring at the prince for a long while, Fermi turned his head and muttered.

It was a curse.

King Manolka of Kesia shrugged his shoulders.

"Kekeke! Living long enough, I even get to see you show emotion. Leave him be. No decent food has come out yet, so he's acting up from boredom. You're the same."

"Just go to sleep."

"World peace? Humans can't even manage peace in their own hearts. Greed has no end, and complaints are endless. I need to pee so badly - do you think that video is entering my eyes?"

"I told you to just sleep."

"Or what? Is there something between you and that girl?"

Fermi's mouth closed.

"Leaders of the world! Please provide more support for humanity!"

'Damn, everything's always about money.'

"So you don't lose your beloved families! So you don't lose human dignity in any situation!"

'When the bonus comes out, pay off the loan, give some to mother, move somewhere with a better educational environment...'

"So you don't abandon the precious memories, relationships, and love that everyone treasures!"

'The decorations from Moon Kingdom are pretty. Should I ask the director to get me one?'

"If your powers combine, you can change the world! I earnestly beg you!"

'Soon it'll be everyone's speaking time. The angels' direction is important. First, keep Kashan in check...'

Seriel struck the podium and shouted.

"Please unite your will!"

"Bravo..."

Just as Gis jumped up to applaud, a crazy laugh was heard.

"Ehihihihi!"

The atmosphere turned cold, and everyone in the conference hall turned toward the sound.

"Kekeke, kekekeke."

Harvitz had his head tilted to one side, desperately trying to hold back laughter.

"Ah, sorry. I'm sorry. Euhehehehe!"

Seriel was mentally confused.

"What's so funny?"

"It's not that, kekeke!"

"I'm asking what's so funny!"

At the thunderous shout, the air finally grew heavy, and Harvitz exhaled deeply.

"Haah."

Stroking his beard, he said:

"Hmm. Ah, truly tragic. So many people suffering."

"That was funny to you?"

Harvitz waved his hand.

"No. That's sad. The reason I laughed was... the people here..."

God's Frequency.

"Well, I get it. It's hard and difficult, life is like that. What I want to say is just..."

Satan asked:

"What are you all doing here right now?"

Satan's gaze swept across the assembly.

"Huh? Huh? Huh?"

Some looked away, some stared directly, some got angry.

'How annoying.'

Having one's mind read.

Turning his gaze back, Harvitz pointed at Seriel and nodded deeply.

"Acknowledged."

Then he stood up and clapped his hands.

Clap. Clap. Clap. Clap.

As dry applause echoed, Lufist muttered bitterly.

"That was close."

The Holy War almost ended.

"That's enough."

Smiling, Sirone looked proudly at Seriel, whose makeup had run with tears.
