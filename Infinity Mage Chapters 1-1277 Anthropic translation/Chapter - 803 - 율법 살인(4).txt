Legal Murder (4)

Natasha's temperament had changed.

'A transformation technique?'

Above her head, the upper body of a black-hooded skeleton flickered like a phantom.

As if playing piano keys, ten fingers extended forward, with dozens of steel wires attached to the joints connecting to Natasha.

'I see.'

Whatever ability this was.

"Are you also a doll?"

Natasha smiled with madness.

"Let go! Release me!"

Natasha, who had been Gustav's genius dancer, was kidnapped by mysterious assailants one day.

"You bastards! Who ordered this? Was it Daphne?"

Daphne, the second-best in the dance world, but the skill gap was too great to even call her a rival.

"Shut up! It won't change anything even if you know!"

Natasha's schema was perfect in art, and her mind was the extreme of eccentricity beyond normal bounds.

"Hurry and tie her up! Before the bodyguards break in!"

The assailants laid Natasha face down on a long table and restrained her limbs with iron chains.

"What are you planning to do? Expose my butt?"

One of the assailants pulled out an iron club.

"Do it, do it now?"

When his colleague nodded, he screamed and struck Natasha's spine with all his might.

Natasha's eyelids, which she still had at the time, shut tight, and a cracking sound traveled through her bones.

"Tough bitch. She's not even screaming."

Feeling the sensation in her lower body fade, Natasha lifted her sweat-soaked face.

"It hurts like hell, how can I scream!"

"I told you to shut up!"

When the iron club struck her waist again, sparks flew in Natasha's eyes.

"Hnnngh!"

The assailant's face was also drenched in sweat.

"Damn! Why won't it break?"

Natasha twisted her head as if it would break and shouted.

"You moron! If you're going to do it, finish it properly in one blow! What are you doing!"

"Argh! Die!"

The assailant struck her waist repeatedly, but his momentum was already broken and no proper force went into it.

"Argh! So annoying!"

Natasha, tears streaming from pain, pulled at the iron chains around her wrists.

"You can't even swing a club properly in front of a woman's butt! Are you perhaps impotent?"

The assailant, regaining his senses from her mockery, clenched his molars and swung his arm vertically.

"Krgh!"

Finally, a crack was heard as her spine snapped.

Natasha became paralyzed from the waist down.

But she never found out who broke her spine, nor did she seek revenge.

'Ah, whatever. I can just live casually.'

Because she didn't harbor hatred, she could dance again.

Crouch modestly lowered his gaze.

'In exchange for giving up the agency of life, what I gained was multiple lives.'

And Natasha...

"Let's dance together."

By becoming Death's doll, she could elevate all her physical status to the realm of transcendence.

'Here she comes!'

The moment he felt killing intent, Crouch took quick steps to create distance.

"Interesting rhythm?"

When tremendous speed was added to steps that mixed up the beat, it looked like watching disconnected movements.

"How long can you keep dancing?"

Those who danced with Natasha for more than a second could be counted on one hand.

'Fast?'

As Death's white fingers formed a rhythm, Natasha's form scattered into afterimages.

'...It's not just that level!'

A cracking sound echoed in Crouch's ears, then his vision spun around.

'Damn!'

Before he could counterattack using his spare life, his neck was severed and spun near the ceiling.

"What, that's boring?"

Crouch's face rolled and bounced against the wall.

'This is Gustav's Fourth Arts...'

It was skill worthy of Habits' Four Divine Generals, who had elevated specific techniques to the realm of art.

'Truly the pinnacle of movement.'

Crash!

One of the two porcelain dolls displayed on the shelf broke with a sharp sound.

"Hmm."

A mournful sigh escaped from Uorin's lips as she drank alone in the deep night.

"Wow, so this is what you look like inside."

Natasha, having cut open the fallen Crouch's belly, examined the complex mechanical devices inside.

Black oil flowed out instead of blood.

"Tastes bad."

Natasha, who had tasted it with her finger, wrinkled her face when a patrolling maid was startled.

"Kyah! Wh-what is that?"

"Oh, good timing. Clean this up. Throw it in the garbage dump."

The maid looked up.

"Pardon? The garbage dump?"

"It's broken. I tried to fix it but it won't work."

Leaving it to the maid, Natasha was about to leave when she suddenly stopped as if realizing something.

"Right, I was supposed to find out who sent it."

Her shoulders shrugged upward.

"Whatever."

"Ugh, why is this so heavy?"

Strong men groaned as they carried the sack.

"What a horrifying doll. I saw it briefly earlier and it really looked alive. What the hell is it?"

"Mind your own business, if you want to survive long. Getting interested in what happens in the imperial palace will drive you crazy."

The men who had been swinging the sack like a swing threw the doll over the wall at the signal.

"Phew, let's go."

Even as the men dusted off their hands and left, there was no movement from inside the sack.

Movement finally began to show on the day of Habits and Abella's wedding.

"Damn."

The sack tore open and Crouch, grasping his head by the hair, sat up.

'Strong. Even Pungzang won't be easy.'

Though not a style that relied on force like a hitman, his pride as the industry's best was shattered to pieces.

'I can't imitate that.'

Just realizing Natasha's power was worth losing one life.

'What's important is resetting 'Legal Murder'.'

Since Balkan would already be prepared, using Catenia was impossible.

"I must die."

To complete his final mission in life, Crouch leaped high over the wall.

The most splendid wedding in the Gustav Empire was held in Marsak's garden.

There were 10,000 guests alone, and gold, silver, treasures, and famous items filled the imperial palace's warehouses.

Gustav rewarded with gold.

"Hey, Natasha."

On the way back after the reception, Balkan personally came to find Natasha.

"About the assassin. Are you sure you finished him off?"

"Yeah. I blew off his head. I even opened his belly to check. He couldn't possibly be alive. But why?"

"Nothing, just. It's an important day."

Balkan rested his chin on his hand.

'Since I left it to Natasha, there can't be any mistakes. She definitely killed him. But the problem is that it was a doll.'

He had heard there were secret arts in the East for breathing souls into dolls.

'Was it from Jincheon? I heard the opponent was quite something too, but why is there no particular movement?'

Even the military intelligence showed no special signs.

"Why so serious? We keep hiring assassins. If military intelligence doesn't catch them, they're really not there."

"That's not it. What military intelligence reads is killing intent - it can't guarantee whether humans exist or not."

Zetaro interjected.

"So if an assassin without killing intent is staying in the imperial palace, military intelligence can't detect them."

Sumodo said.

"Anyway, it's the same thing. An assassin without killing intent isn't an assassin. What's certain is that no one is thinking of killing His Majesty, right?"

Balkan was stubborn.

"That's what's strange. If they're not thinking of killing His Majesty, why would they stay in the imperial palace?"

Natasha raised her index finger.

"The assumption that an assassin is staying in the imperial palace is just speculation. I think you're digging too deep."

This time even Balkan couldn't argue back.

"I don't know. It's clear when I think simply, but it keeps feeling complicated. I feel like I'm missing something."

Zetaro said.

"Because the opponent was a doll. When unexpected results appeared, you keep suspecting other things too."

"A doll."

Balkan stopped walking.

"Natasha, go to the garbage dump and check again."

"Sumodo does that every day. It's just as we left it."

Interior Minister Sumodo.

His 'Cleanliness' essentially discerns all kinds of differences except for things that are exactly the same.

For instance, he realizes that grasshopper A and grasshopper B are completely different organisms.

He can also classify a thousand swords made from the same mold by their characteristics.

"Today is different. Go together and check. I'll go to His Majesty to see if there's anything strange."

"Got it."

There was never a loss from listening to Balkan, so the two headed to the garbage dump.

"Hey, Natasha."

On the way, Sumodo said.

"Want to do it with me tonight?"

Natasha looked back with surprise.

"Don't you hate doing it with the same woman?"

"Just... in case you're lonely."

If even he, as a man, felt unsettled by Habits' marriage, how much more would Natasha, being a woman?

"Hehe, what? Are you comforting me?"

"We're friends."

"I appreciate the thought, but I'm fine. You wouldn't enjoy it anyway, and I'm also feeling a bit off today."

"Just because Habits loves another woman doesn't mean he's leaving us."

Natasha smiled brightly and nodded.

"Yeah."

Chatting as they arrived, they opened the door to the garbage dump and climbed over the trash pile.

"It should be buried around here... Huh?"

Seeing traces of the trash pile being dug up, Sumodo's eyes widened as he shouted.

"It's different! Definitely different!"

"...Sumodo, I think I can see this too."

Like a massive prank, the assassin doll that had been there until yesterday had vanished.

On the way to Habits and Abella's honeymoon apartment, Zetaro said.

"I understand suspecting Abella. But if that were the case, military intelligence would have already detected it."

Alphafis loves Habits.

"I know. Military intelligence is certain. But if I were hiring an assassin, I'd exploit that point."

If the reason the assassin doesn't reveal killing intent is to maintain singularity...

"I wish to see His Imperial Majesty. Please relay the message."

The head maid bowed with a humble gesture.

"I'm sorry, General. His Majesty said not to let anyone in tonight."

"It's urgent. Can't you at least deliver the message?"

The head maid had to choose whether to die by Habits or by Balkan.

"You may cut me down and enter."

Since it was sincere and not a threat, Balkan made a troubled sound.

Zetaro laughed.

"Kekeke! He's all heated up. Well, that's understandable. Isn't this the day he's been waiting for since 14 years ago?"

Knowing how strict Habits was about controlling desires, Balkan couldn't demand further.

"Can't be helped. Let's just go drink."

"What if something happens?"

Balkan clicked his tongue.

"What can we do? Everyone has their own fate."

Laughter from Habits and Abella echoed through the apartment with hundreds of rooms.

"Hahaha! Right! That's how it was before."

"You played the monster role so well back then, Uncle. Wait, is it because you're really a monster?"

"Could be. Puahahaha!"

Intoxicated, Habits found everything funny and was led by Abella's hand into a room.

Each room had features for spending the wedding night, and the room she entered was for perverted acts.

"We're doing it here?"

"Yes. I really wanted to try it."

From the wedding ceremony to the reception to the honeymoon house, everything was according to the script Abella had been educated on.

"So that's why you didn't let people in."

"Why? Don't you like it, Uncle?"

"No, I like this kind of thing too. So what should we try first? How about this whip?"

"Fufu, good. But there's something I need to prepare first."

"Prepare?"

Abella nestled in Habits' arms and whispered.

"I'm going to tie you up tight, Uncle."
