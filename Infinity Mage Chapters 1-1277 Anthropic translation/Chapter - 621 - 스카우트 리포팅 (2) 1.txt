[621] Scout Reporting (2)

Once I return to school...

On the day the Shibal Sangpokmae training ended, Miro explained the strategy.

"You'll have to refuse the evaluation."

"Refuse the evaluation?"

"It's already too late to catch up to the senior class score gap. You'll only give the scouts a bad first impression. Rather than that, it's better to give up on the evaluation and bet everything on the graduation exam."

Even Shirone thought it was the right diagnosis.

"But mere graduation shouldn't become your ultimate goal."

Miro put strength into her voice.

"Even if you do graduate, there aren't many associations willing to embrace a time bomb that could explode at any moment. If you want to become a mage, you need to show them that you have enough value to make the risk worthwhile."

Miro's required strategy was singular.

"Think of the graduation exam as a long-distance race. You need to sprint at top speed from the very start. And then..."

Miro pointed to the destination.

"You maintain that speed and complete the entire course."

Entering Survival Training Stage 5.

Just as fatigue began to show on the participants' faces, Tier 6 creatures were summoned.

"Now we'll see dropouts in droves."

Befitting a tier that even summoning magic professionals use in actual combat, those who confirmed the monster lineup turned pale.

Grrrrowl!

There were werewolves far more cunning than orcs, Cerberus with massive bull-like bodies and three heads, Bugbears - hairy monsters weighing a full 300 kilograms, and Gargoyles with stone-hard skin - all monsters capable of ending a human life with a single blow.

'This will definitely create differentiation.'

Would they cooperate to advance to the next stage, or would they conserve their strength until others dropped out?

While most participants pondered the same dilemma, Shirone predictably shot to the front.

The strategy of tearing through formations with Scatter Movement and picking off enemies individually with Photon Cannon was simple, but its power was beyond imagination.

When flashes of light burrowed deep into the protruding bellies of Bugbears, they were inevitably sent flying, and Gargoyles swooping from above couldn't penetrate the curtain of light and were pushed back.

"Movement, attack, and defense form a balanced trinity. He's properly trained despite being an Unlocker."

"That makes it all the more puzzling."

Baikal stroked his chin.

"Surely he studied the Survival Training event? He can't possibly complete it anyway."

Since even one person completing the Survival Training event that selects 15 people would shake the very foundation of evaluation criteria, the association presents an impossible difficulty level.

"Yes. From Tier 5 onwards, the lineup consists of creatures that even professionals use as their main summons."

He would have to fight hundreds of such creatures.

Lara raised a counterargument.

"Simple comparisons are dangerous. Icheon is just a simulation, after all. Even considering the intellectual level of species when designing reactions, there are limits. Especially creatures handled by mages move according to the mage's intellectual level."

"Of course it's different from actual creatures."

Baikal acknowledged that point too.

"But the ability stats reflect reality. Even the current Tier 6 would be life-threatening difficulty for student-level participants. Wouldn't eliminating participants as quickly as possible be the rational decision for the second evaluation too? What's the ulterior motive?"

Elizabeth analyzed Shirone's combat.

"Magic power reading: 2.03 million. Average Photon Cannon single-shot power: 2,847 crash. Rate of fire: 267 rounds per minute."

"That's insane."

The words slipped from Baikal's mouth involuntarily.

"He's already far exceeded the master difficulty level set by the association. Particularly noteworthy is that impact force and rate of fire were classified as separate categories. But Shirone is currently achieving both simultaneously."

It meant he was unleashing over 4 strikes per second of what he thought would be the maximum single blow achievable with peak concentration.

'Has he exceeded the association's expectations?'

As Baikal seemed to ponder, Lara asked.

"Evaluator, your overall assessment..."

"F."

Elizabeth turned her body, requesting an explanation.

"The 29 participants are already out of his mind. He's not grasping reality properly."

"But Shirone's ability stats are clearly..."

"I know. I'm disappointed in the strategy Number 27 has adopted. With current numbers, he could probably handle Stage 6, even Stage 7. But that's ultimately the end."

Baikal shook his head and continued.

"Scouts remember every single creature stat when it comes to exams. Even at Tier 3 level, that approach won't even scratch them. If 15 people will be selected before reaching the end anyway, his current display of power is mere showing off. F."

"...Understood."

Lara's pen inscribed the letter F on Shirone's page.

'I know.'

If Shirone had heard Baikal's explanation, he would have nodded.

'I know that.'

This wasn't a strategy built with clear success possibilities in mind.

He knew that sprinting from the start and pushing through to the end was the only possibility remaining to him.

"I absolutely won't stop!"

Shirone's Photon Cannon fell like rain, breaking the Cerberus's spine.

"It's troublesome when you come out like this."

Having his leading role stolen, Frings cast Ice Wave, and sharp ice spikes bisected the colosseum.

Seizing the opportunity, Amy sniped enemies from all directions.

'87. 88.'

Elizabeth was watching.

"Rate of fire: 67 rounds per minute. Considering sniper mode, that's a phenomenal speed."

"The accuracy seems a bit lacking though. How many shots missed?"

Elizabeth, connected to the Icheon core system, checked the exact figures.

"Current accuracy is... 89.4 percent."

While excellent by senior class standards, it didn't meet Baikal's criteria.

'Red Eyes!'

Amy, having backed up her self-image memory, began shooting with greater precision as Bugbears caught fire one after another.

"It's rising. 90.2 percent. 91.6 percent."

"That's what we'd expect from Karmis. B for now."

Having finished his cold assessment, Baikal's gaze moved to the next participant.

'Atomic Bomb!'

Iruki's breakaway-type Spirit Zone flew rapidly, causing explosions in the monsters' faces.

"Looks like instant casting."

Pop-pop-pop-BANG!

It was as if an invisible striker was going around bursting monster heads.

"Actually, it's quite a high-level detonation equation. And accurate. To Servant Number 5, object forms are perceived as fractal structures. Being mathematical, there are no errors."

Baikal carefully observed Iruki's movement patterns.

"Neural response speed: 0.024 seconds, among the top tier of current participants."

"Hmm."

The character 'H' was written in Lara's notebook before the pen stopped abruptly.

"Isn't he... lacking intuition a bit? Being accurate doesn't mean being efficient. His response patterns are too mechanical."

"He seems to focus more on blocking variables than improving efficiency. Even so, his annihilation speed exceeds average."

"B for now."

Lara recorded it, but Elizabeth pouted.

"Isn't the standard too high? No matter how high the participants' level, that degree of performance could be considered flawless for now."

"Being flawless doesn't create advantages. For example, Flu would have made different judgments."

Comparing to the Royal Magic School's valedictorian meant the standards were indeed high.

"What a mess."

"Uoooh!"

Screamer, casting Scatter Movement, drove his iron fist into a Bugbear.

"Someone intoxicated by his own power with paralyzed thinking."

"Maya! Don't fall behind me!"

Caiden rotated around Maya as the center, slashing Cerberus with his sword.

"Someone who forgets his mission and obsesses over conviction."

Shirone's Photon Cannon bent a werewolf's back as it shot forward.

"Abandoning tactics entirely for firepower alone."

Now even Elizabeth fell silent.

"There are cases like this too. Ability stats are far superior compared to other schools, but their mental state isn't normal. What do they think this exam is? They're just doing whatever they want."

No matter how perverse one's personality, being mage-like in the face of duty was the kind of talent the kingdom desired.

"According to Red Line regulations, graduates have first negotiation rights with their domestic association."

If primary negotiations break down over treatment, compensation, or other issues, then foreign countries can make scout offers.

"Standards are important to them, not to us. Our job is to find the most capable individuals and report to the association."

"...Understood."

They had no choice but to accept Baikal's opinion.

"Still, several are quite useful."

Fermi's various magic was adding firepower at exactly the right moments, and Dante was also leisurely dispatching enemies using instant magic circle applications.

Additionally, Frings's freezing magic was sharp enough to truly be called masterful.

"Numbers 1, 2, 22. Grade A."

As grades were assigned to every participant's action, Stage 5 annihilation time was nearly ending.

'One minute left.'

With monster numbers still exceeding two hundred, Shirone's heart grew anxious.

'58 seconds. 57 seconds.'

At this rate, Stage 6 creatures would be summoned to the colosseum without even 30 seconds to recover mentally.

'I must finish this!'

For Shirone, who had ramped up firepower from the beginning, those 30 seconds were desperately precious.

Pop-pop-pop-pop-BANG!

Scattered Photon Cannons struck monsters in all directions.

Bugbears with broken shoulders, Cerberus with one head blown off, Gargoyles with cracked skin - all enemies began charging toward Shirone.

"Graaaah!"

Shirone steadied his stiffening mind and fired Photon Cannon even more rapidly, but the number of charging enemies was increasing.

"...Didn't he make a mistake?"

Elizabeth asked.

"He's been casting magic at that power level for nearly 10 minutes. His mind has to be scattered."

Even non-scouts could feel that Shirone's accuracy was declining.

"Isn't that dangerous?"

At Reina's words, Olina shed tears again.

"Way to be tactless. If you don't know, just watch."

Receiving Rian's rebuke, Reina patted Olina's shoulder and said defensively.

"But even someone like me who doesn't know can see he's visibly exhausted."

Rian bit her lip and turned her gaze to the colosseum.

'Shirone...'

Only those who had experienced it physically could know how many entities the number 100 truly represented.

"It's fine. There won't be any problems."

"Really?"

Now even Reina relied on her younger sibling's judgment.

"Whether he dies or not..."

Rian's voice was firm.

"He's not the type to lose focus just because he's tired."

'Now!'

Having drawn in numerous monsters, Shirone gritted his teeth and concentrated his mind.

'Elysion!'

Raising concentration again at the end of a 10-minute sprint consumed far more mental power than usual, but if he could succeed in annihilation, it wasn't a bad trade.

'30 seconds. I can recover if I have just 30 seconds!'

With that thought, his area destruction magic Multiple Photon Cannon was cast.

BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BANG!

"My goodness..."

The sight of seven Photon Cannons with 10-meter diameters overlapping and exploding left spectators spellbound, and monsters caught in the wave of mass had their limbs broken as they flew around between the spheres of light.

'9 seconds! 8 seconds!'

With 7 seconds remaining, the creatures dominated by Multiple Photon Cannon decomposed back into minimum pixels and disappeared.

"That's exactly it! I told you so!"

As Rian raised both arms and shouted, Olina's shoulders shook.

"Magic power reading: 2.93 million Magical! Heart rate: 237 beats per second!"

"What? 237 beats?"

"Four-point impact force average: 6,800 crash! Five-point impact force: 13,000 crash!"

As the VIP section became as noisy as if in chaos, everyone turned to look that way, and the embarrassed Rian quietly lowered her hands.
