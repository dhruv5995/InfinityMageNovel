Acceleration (4)

Valkyrie Base 73.

In a bunker prepared in the mountains of the southern continent, Valkyrie's VIP-level leadership had gathered.

Humanity's win rate in wars fought across the world hadn't even reached 7 percent.

But without them, even that 7 percent couldn't have been guaranteed.

"Urgent news! Bornai's 7th Brigade annihilated!

4 million demons are crossing over the Max Mountain Range."

The 7th Brigade's flag disappeared from the three-dimensional map placed on the military table.

Then four red pieces representing million-unit forces moved to the Max Mountain Range.

"General, your response strategy."

All the strategists who had reorganized the pieces on the military map through intelligence reports looked to one person.

Valkyrie Supreme General Mercordain Iruki.

He was the one who had narrowly escaped death after recklessly executing an overdrive in Ex Machina.

Though he was more gaunt than before and his hair had turned gray, there was no wavering in his eyes as he stared at the military map.

'This is really troublesome.'

This wasn't a war that could be won from the start.

What the Supreme General could do was at most minimize damage and buy time.

There was also the reason of it being a poisoned chalice that allowed him to defeat numerous experts and assume the position of Supreme General.

'Counterattack is impossible. We need to pull back a bit more.'

But Iruki had won.

Though the 7 percent win rate included the activities of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars, he had accomplished something miraculous by achieving victory against Havitz's army.

Electricity sparked in Iruki's eyes.

'Overdrive.'

The residents of the Ivory Tower, the 'card game players,' watched Iruki with wonder.

'It's a miracle he's alive.'

Though Iruki had opened his brain, strictly speaking, he had been devoured by Ex Machina.

'That moment of synchronization.'

Iruki thinks like Ex Machina.

'The world of quantum probability.'

In fact, humans probably don't need to know that much to win wars.

'It's enough to be cut when cut, pushed back when pushed. War is ultimately just the interaction of particles.'

This is called the law.

'But Satan exists outside the law.'

Iruki defines it this way.

The state that exists as probability before the result is observed - that is Havitz's essence.

'Chaos cannot be predicted.'

But if it's Iruki, he can establish new strategies at those unpredictable points.

'We don't lose because we deserve to lose. It's not that we must lose. The moment we respond to Havitz, the result becomes fixed as a defeat event.'

Only Iruki understood Havitz.

'Then we just need to not observe.' If he could proceed with events from outside the maximum radius so that Havitz couldn't produce specific results.

'We can't win, but we won't lose either.' The 7 percent win rate obtained that way.

'As long as we don't make direct contact, Havitz's chaos becomes poison to Vulcan's military power instead.'

Hundreds of millions had already died, but there was definitely something gained from their sacrifice.

'An opportunity will surely come.'

Iruki was waiting for the day when Havitz's choice would become a bad move that changes the war situation.

? ? ?

"Should I call it strange..."

Vulcan continued.

"We could lose. Winning and losing in war isn't that important. What's strange is the cause of defeat. How should I put it... It's like..."

Vulcan looked at Havitz.

"It seems like someone is thinking like Havitz."

"Hmm."

Smodo stroked his chin.

"Facing him with the same strategy, right? But that's only possible because it's Havitz. If just anyone did that, it would be a hundred defeats in a hundred battles."

"But they won."

Silence fell.

"It's too systematic to be considered lucky. First, dividing forces before Kashan. If we had just attacked the central continent directly, it would have been a battle we wouldn't have lost."

Vulcan hit the key point.

"Did they anticipate in advance that we would divide our forces? That doesn't make sense either. If they had anticipated it and positioned their army accordingly, Havitz wouldn't have divided his forces either."

Zetaro nodded.

"Because he always makes victorious choices. Yet Havitz divided his forces and consequently lost."

"Right."

Vulcan was almost certain.

"Among them, there's someone who can circumvent Havitz's events."

It wasn't something that could be done just by being far away.

"I don't know the method. How it's even possible. But there's no other way to explain it."

Natasha asked.

"I don't understand what you mean, but anyway, how dangerous is that for us?"

"In my opinion..."

Just as Vulcan was about to speak.

"Should we stop?"

Havitz, who had been crouching, lifted his head toward the sky and spoke quietly.

"What? Havitz?"

Vulcan asked back, doubting his ears.

"Should we stop here? I suddenly had that thought."

It was a statement that completely negated everything they had done so far, but that made it all the more like Havitz.

Vulcan asked.

"What's the reason?"

"Where in the world could there be a more fun game than this? But a little..."

Havitz yawned.

"I'm starting to think it's boring."

Zetaro said with an apologetic face.

"I'll try to develop some more interesting ways to kill."

"Come to think of it... humans are really pitiful too."

His companions' eyes widened.

'Havitz showing sympathy?'

It was impossible.

"For humans, life is everything. As long as they can live, things like fun don't really matter."

Smodo realized.

"Is it Wuorin?"

"Wuorin said that, that she loves Sirone. Did those words change some part of you?"

"Not really..."

Because it was fun and thrilling, he had no regret about sacrificing Abella, who had been his wife.

"I'm just bored."

Though it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say Havitz possessed the entire world, loneliness was unavoidable.

'I want to play.'

He just... remembered Abella.

'I want to play.'

Havitz pursed his lips toward the sky.

"Mooooooo."

As he made a sound like a cow's moo, the Gustav 4th Arts looked at each other.

"Mooooooo."

A dry cry unaccompanied by even a single tear.

It was the grief of ultimate evil.

'One day's time.'

Sirone mulled over Seong-eum's words.

Currently, wars were raging in countries around the world, and countless people were dying even now.

But since Jincheon was in the same situation, he thought there must be a reason for Seong-eum's proposal.

"Why?"

Sirone asked.

"It would be fine after the war ends. No, why is spending a day with me important in the first place?"

Seong-eum kept her mouth tightly shut.

'I'm sorry, Sirone.'

The reason she couldn't reveal was closely related to the safety of the Jincheon Empire.

"I already know from hearing how important the war in the central continent is to you."

Amy.

"The woman you love, and your homeland the Kingdom of Tormia is also close to the front lines. I know it's an unreasonable request. But you said you would give me 10 days."

Seong-eum looked straight at Sirone.

"That's because my ability earned you 10 days. Trust me. If you give me one day, I'll use whatever means necessary to earn you even more time."

Since he knew Seong-eum's upright character, there was no need to doubt her words.

Though it bothered him that he couldn't hear the reason, time was flowing even as they spoke.

"Alright."

Seong-eum's face brightened rapidly.

"Thank you. Really, thank you."

"But what are you planning to do for a day? Do you have something planned?"

"As you know, ether waves are the ability to shake spatial fields within spacetime. So I can go anywhere I want, but..."

Seong-eum lifted her head with a wistful expression.

"Looking back, I realized I've never been anywhere."

Sirone stared at her intently.

"I don't have any grand plans. Just for one day... help me see the world."

'She's thinking of dying.'

Otherwise, there was no reason for Seong-eum, who was qualified to be an Ivory Tower candidate, to suddenly act like this.

"I understand."

Knowing how high her Kar was, Sirone decided to follow her wishes for now.

"Let's go wherever you want to go. I'll follow you anywhere."

"Then..."

Seong-eum glanced at Lian standing behind Sirone.

"Go ahead. I'll wait here."

Perhaps sensing some kind of resolve from her, Lian got up from the table and sat on the bed.

Seong-eum expressed her gratitude with a small nod and cast ether waves.

The two people's bodies were sucked into space, and suddenly a completely different landscape was revealed.

"Where is this?"

It was a valley with a small waterfall.

Seong-eum sat on a rock, took a deep breath, and smiled with satisfaction.

"I've never come to a place like this with someone in my life."

Because she hadn't allowed spiritual insight.

"When I think about it... I wonder what I lived keeping such distance for."

Sirone sat next to Seong-eum.

"You can change from now on. When the war ends, days will come when we can all be happy together."

"I suppose so..."

Persuasion was indeed impossible.

"Tell me. What exactly are you thinking... mmph."

Before Sirone could finish speaking, Seong-eum leaned her upper body close and gently kissed his lips.

Sirone's eyes widened at the unexpected situation, and after a while, Seong-eum's lips parted.

Only the sound of the waterfall could be heard.

"I'm sorry." Seong-eum said with her head deeply bowed.

"It's okay. I was just a little surprised."

"...I heard you have someone you love. I've hurt you. Please forget this."

That could be the case, but it didn't seem like Seong-eum was overthinking it too much either.

It was probably because she was pure.

"Why did you do that?"

"I always used to think. If I had someone who could walk beside me, in a quiet place like this..."

Seong-eum changed the subject.

"We competed together. For the stars of the Ivory Tower. You, me, and Nade."

It was an unforgettable memory for Sirone too.

"Yeah. Back then, I never thought the world would change like this."

"You with philanthropy, Nade with merit. Each of you carried through your beliefs to the end. It might sound funny to say this, but sometimes I'm proud of you both."

"You're strong enough too. And you're fighting for the world even now."

"...Am I?"

She felt good at Sirone's praise.

"Time and space are actually one field. If you fight for the world, that's enough for me."

She wasn't afraid.

"Seong-eum, if you're having bad thoughts..."

"The day has only just begun." Seong-eum got up and dusted herself off.

"I don't want to think about it right now. Would it be okay to enjoy this moment a little more? Let's go somewhere else."

"Huh? Already?"

"I have to fulfill a lifetime wish. I don't want to miss a single place."

"It's fine if it takes more time."

He didn't want to pressure her.

"No. One day is enough. But I have a request."

Seong-eum extended her hand to Sirone.

"Will you hold it?"

Sirone, who had been looking at her slender outstretched fingers, slowly took her hand.

'Whatever you're thinking... in the end, I won't let go of this hand.'
