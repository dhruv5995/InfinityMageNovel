[736] Two Perspectives (5)

'Really......'

Was such a realm truly possible?

Guffin had already been erased, so his name existed only as a hypothesis to countless mages.

The Infinite Magician.

No one could guess what that truly meant, but the head of the Zion Universe Nation possessed evidence that it had actually existed.

"Have you contained the entire universe?"

Nane's question was casual, but somewhere in his eyes dwelt a feeling of expectation.

"What did you realize?"

Sirone spread both arms wide as he spoke.

"Life."

All life that exists in the universe.

"Existing is not a sin, Nane."

Though they spoke the same language, the words that came from Sirone's mouth contained a different depth, and it was Nane who understood this.

"If suffering simply for being born is everything, if eternally reincarnating in the cycle of emptiness is our destiny..."

Sirone wept.

"That would be far too sad."

Disappointment flashed in Nane's eyes.

"What you gained from containing the universe is merely a heart? Isn't that very heart the source of suffering?"

"It's not something we can help. No matter how vast the universe is, it's not larger than a mother's heart loving her child."

Could this be denied?

"The heart transcends the universe."

Nane, who had realized almost all principles, pondered Sirone's words with all his might.

"When the universe disappears, the heart disappears too."

Because we exist, we have hearts.

"Though it may seem right at first glance, it's almost entirely wrong, Sirone."

As Nane's sermon continued, while the sword containing the concept of apocalypse that would end the universe still pointed toward the earth, another sword was born.

"God is without heart."

The iron-colored sword of emotionlessness, which would remove all emotions from this world, rose above his head and was absorbed into the sword of apocalypse.

As Nane's will grew stronger, the earth trembled, and the feeling that the world's end was truly coming struck them to the bone.

Mun-gyeong ground his molars.

"Damn it! How are we supposed to stop that?"

Nane's sword manifestation was pressuring the world from the realm of concepts that transcended phenomena.

"My refusal to back down is not stubbornness. Do you know how much suffering that love you've realized will inflict on countless lives going forward? It's suffering without compensation. Don't you pity them?"

Distance remaining until universal extinction: 0.00001 nanometers.

"No beginning, no endâ€”just reincarnation. Is it unreasonable to end eternally repeating suffering?"

Nane's precise Car coefficient, racing at 99.9999...percent, extended to 184,000 digits below the decimal point.

Sirone said:

"Because it's not our sin."

Even if it's good and evil created by humans, even if it's suffering created by humans, there is no original sin in existing.

Therefore, Sirone, who had no cause...

"I am loving."

He reached the point of negating Nane's merit by forgiving the sins of all who exist.

"That too is empty."

Dozens of swords spread out behind Nane and rushed toward Sirone.

Destruction, extinction, dissolution... all concepts necessary to erase any existence were being shot forth.

Simultaneously, the entrance to the 1st world exploded.

"Gasp!"

As a quantum information tunnel transcending space-time opened, the realization of universal love came flooding in.

Then Sirone's Car coefficient, which had well exceeded 90 percent, began to drop rapidly.

Car coefficient: 86.24 percent.

Having sacrificed everything, he had no purpose left, and what remained was just one pure emotion.

'Love.'

The entrance to the 283rd world exploded, and his Car coefficient plummeted to 74.31 percent.

Toward the lives that would exist in the future, good and evil, absolute universal love with nothing trivial or grand.

The entrance to the 847th world exploded.

"Aaaaah!"

Car coefficient: 49.24 percent.

Though Sirone's mind had degraded to an animal's level, what we must hold onto until the end was therefore clear.

Car coefficient: 24.11 percent.

What was needed to achieve perfect love was the purest emotion that discriminated against no existence.

'It's not empty, Nane!'

Nane was almost right, but even if this were a world where suffering was everything, the reason we must exist is...

'The heart is larger than the universe.'

Because we are so precious to ourselves.

Car coefficient: 1.4 percent.

"Si, Sirone..."

Looking at Sirone shedding tears of blood from his bloodshot eyes, everyone wore expressions of terror.

Just as the Infinite Magician couldn't be understood, no one knew what was happening to Sirone now, but one thing was certain.

"He's carrying something... tremendous."

Car coefficient: 0.24 percent.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

From animal to plant, from plant to microbe, from microbe to the lowest possible phase with nowhere left to descend.

But therefore, he could love.

'Everything.'

Car coefficient: 0.0000017 percent.

"This is bad! Andre is going to collapse!"

As they passed the entrance to the 9999th world and worlds in the ten-thousands exploded in succession, the ceiling began to cave in.

"Why do you give false hope?"

Nane's sermon "End" spread tremendous wind pressure as it advanced toward the ground.

"How can you not know that the hope you give is the seed of suffering?"

"That suffering is..."

Car coefficient: 0.0000000000000001 percent.

"Proof of existence."

As his Car coefficient plummeted toward 0, any reference point disappeared from Sirone's mind.

Not a trace of subjectivity remained.

For him, who distributed equal love to all things, sensation could no longer serve as a criterion for judgment.

'They merge.'

Time and space, temporal and spatial senses integrated, and a new sense completely captivated his mind.

The eighth sense that living beings could possess: Super Qualier.

All information transmitted through super-sensation seemed to expose the reality of this world.

'Idea.'

One who senses truth cannot have subjectivity.

"Get out! If we don't leave now...!"

Finally, as even the 19,000th world exploded, the space-time trapped in Andre was completely liberated.

As space-time mixed chaotically and tried to swallow everyone, Seong-eum cast an ether wave.

"I'll block it."

Beyond the spatial barrier she deployed, countless events transcending space-time began to overlap.

"Damn it! This is complete hell!"

No one could predict what would happen if they were swept up in the space-time storm.

As everyone hesitated to venture outside Seong-eum's space, the figures of Sirone and Nane facing each other majestically flickered briefly in the mixing of events.

"Can you endure?"

Nane, whose Car coefficient was near perfect, guessed why Sirone wasn't swept away by the space-time storm.

Sirone, wrapped in light, said:

"Would this be enough of an answer for what you wanted?"

As the light blocking space-time expanded into a massive sphere, the space-time storm was torn to shreds.

"Your Highness! It's disappearing!"

In the burst of light that spread explosively, the sword of sermon scattered like ash, and the landscape of reality finally came into view.

"He blew it all away."

Andre's cave left no trace, and the structures built as tourist attractions were nowhere to be seen.

The lights that had spread toward Sirone, standing in the middle of an endlessly sprawling desert, began to be drawn back in.

"Th, that's..."

Light wrapped around the brain, the source of consciousness, and pale but not cold-feeling droplets of light flickered endlessly.

Nane, who had been watching the sword of sermon being destroyed, slowly turned his gaze to Sirone.

"Yahweh?"

The name of that special light arising from senses transcending cognition was omnipotence that only the Infinite Magician, who contained all information in the world, could wield.

"You are not denied."

Since no one in the world had a higher Car coefficient than Nane, no one existed who could deny him.

"However, I cannot deny you either."

The sole truth had not yet been established in this world.

"Now I understand why I cannot become God."

Guffin had not left a question.

"Ariane Sirone."

No, the very existence called Hexar was the final barrier blocking perfect truth.

Sirone and Nane, Nane and Sirone.

"I think it's emptiness."

The universe is full of void.

"It's love."

The heart transcends the universe.

Though both knew it was nothing but a dream, these two perspectives looking at the same truth were so extreme.

"Contradiction. No one can obtain the correct answer."

Though Sirone's Car, freed from prejudice, was so minimal, it was also the only point Nane could never reach.

"I can never be absolutely right."

Nane's fingertip pointed at Sirone.

"And you can never be absolutely wrong?"

Thus, living beings must still endlessly anguish over the value of existence at the lowest phase of the universe.

"But two standards cannot coexist. If you and I coexist, countless lives will suffer."

"I have no intention of backing down."

"..."

Mahagaruta had said that Nane's realization was the extreme end of thesis-antithesis-synthesis that came after encompassing his own realization.

But Sirone's realm was shining at the diametrically opposite point that Nane could never reach.

"Sirone, as much as you pity living beings, I too sympathize with them."

This was true.

"Therefore, neither of us can compromise. Unless one side disappears, the suffering of this world will continue."

Nane spread both arms in an archer's pose, and a massive sword containing tremendous power was born.

"So..."

As Nane turned his body and spread both arms, an iron-colored sword bent into an arch.

"I will force it through."

Nane's sermon "Break" shot toward Sirone in a twisted form, bouncing like a spring.

Though it was a linear attack, it was probably the most powerful strike in the world, and it penetrated Sirone's brow in an instant.

'Stop.'

As "Break," which had flown toward Sirone with force to pierce him, froze in space, Seong-eum's eyes shook with shock.

"He stopped time."

It was magic called Stop.

'He's already surpassed me.'

If ether waves existed in the spatial category of Scale magic, then Stop could be called the pinnacle of the temporal category.

"So that's how you interpreted it?"

Nane was the only person who could remain calm in the face of supreme magic.

"Then what will you answer to this question?"

The coldest concept on Nane's left and the hottest concept on his right transformed into dozens of swords and shot forth.

"Sermon: Contradiction."

Along the path the swords traveled, the desert sand froze solid while flames soared on the opposite side.

"Origin."

Yahweh's light, containing all information in the universe, expanded along the Spirit Zone as small spheres of light rose in both hands.

Mental Implementation.

Spherification.

Sirone, who sensed super-cognition, controlled all phenomena like matter, and that concept manifested through spheres, the basic form of the universe.

"I'll reverse it from the beginning of causality."

As Yahweh's two spheres merged and rotated at tremendous speed, the concept of yin-yang rotated the world.

"Grrrrrr!"

As heat and cold mixed and a terrible event violating universal rules seemed about to occur, it immediately dissolved into nothingness.

Kido's mouth fell open in bewilderment.

"What the hell kind of fight is that?"

No one could answer the question because it was a collision of concepts transcending phenomena.

Even Nane had to acknowledge that this realm of Car coefficient converging to the ultimate zero was equal to his own.

The sword carved on Nane's tongue lost its light.

"...I cannot force it through here."

It seemed it would be an endless battle.
