[740] Towards the Stars (4)

A long silence followed Shirone's question, making the name "Great Earth Cathedral" seem meaningless.

"Shirone."

Taeseong opened his heavy mouth.

"Humans have the ability to name things that exist. In other words, intelligence."

Naming things is the entirety of intelligence.

"But just because you have the ability to know something doesn't mean you can know everything."

Countless scholars explore the ends of the universe.

"If you think you'll someday know everything, that's merely the limitation of humans who haven't yet grasped the essence of intelligence."

Because the answer lies beyond infinity.

"That's why even I, who know everything in this world, cannot definitively say what exists outside the universe."

"But I'm here."

It wasn't a matter of the outside.

"Right here, right now, you can tell me what you see beyond that infinite veil you're looking at."

"I truly don't know. I have no reason to lie to Shirone."

"Can't you at least guess?"

"Guessing is something I must not do."

Taeseong was firm.

"Standing with both feet on the ground and looking up at the sky, you can make countless guesses. It's free to spread your wings of imagination. But at the edge of the world, you must not do that. You know how dangerous that would be, don't you, Shirone?"

One cannot believe the essence of the world based on guesswork.

"Beyond the veil might be only nothingness. This might be the beginning. Why are you denying yourself?"

"It's not denial—I want to acknowledge it. I heard that Mahagaluta achieved enlightenment. And he didn't return."

Has Mahagaluta awakened from the dream by now, or has he achieved annihilation in eternal nothingness?

"I was able to return to this world because I let go of everything in the realm of infinity, but..."

This was why Shirone was sad.

"If I had crossed the boundary, I wouldn't have returned either."

One cannot return from outside a dream back into the dream, and he knew that Nane was right about this too.

"To protect this world against Nane—no, to surpass him—I think we need to define Hexa first."

Taeseong let out a long sigh.

"What is..."

He turned to look at Shirone and asked.

"What is infinity? What is the void? What are humans? What are stars? Everything is just names given to things that exist without reason. They simply exist, and we define them according to our needs. That's why infinity and the void are nothing more than names we've given them."

Taeseong's index finger pointed at Shirone's forehead.

"Even God."

"..."

"For humans, the concept of God doesn't need to be complicated. It's a realm of faith, a name created for that purpose from the beginning. But when the person in question actually enters God's realm—that is, when someone called the Infinite Wizard like Shirone becomes..."

Taeseong lowered his arm.

"You encounter all sorts of contradictions. You can handle all the information in the world. You are God. But the problem is, that information comes from a human perspective to begin with."

Shirone had certainly become God, but only a God that humans could define.

"I know why you asked that question, Shirone. The Idea you realized through the 8th sense simply exists, needing neither to exist nor not to exist..."

And so it freely controls all phenomena in the universe.

"But since that too is only the infinity that humans have named, you wonder if the true meaning lies outside."

Taeseong continued immediately.

"Also, because Hexa is made of light—in other words, to put it differently... it's merely an abnormal signal flowing through a system, not a specific entity."

Hearing it directly from Taeseong felt like his heart stopped.

"In the end, I am..."

Taeseong's expression softened.

"This is as far as my hypothesis goes."

"Hypothesis?"

"Yes. Let's try it once. What Shirone wants to know. Let me guess what lies beyond infinity from the edge of the world."

Shirone could feel Taeseong's gentle heart.

"As Shirone knows, I am the reincarnation of a star. My name, governing all stars, is Gaia. For instance... let's say I'm actually a program. The Gaia Program."

Taeseong emphasized the sense of hypothesis.

"The universe is born and nature forms within it. There are two massive programs that constitute this nature. One is me, Gaia, governing planets. And the other is..."

Taeseong's gaze turned toward the ceiling.

"The stellar program, Ra."

Ra was another name for the sun.

"The Gaia Program constructs new systems through energy transmitted by the stellar program. The lower system of nature—the biological world—is born."

"And in that biological world..."

"It's too early to speak of humans yet."

Taeseong interrupted.

"When Ra provides power and Gaia creates the environment, the biological program Argones spreads cells. The possibilities of evolution are infinite, but the reality is the simplest information transmission material."

Shirone's eyes widened.

"Argones?"

It was the name of the alien organism that Fisho, who had specialized in insect magic during graduation exams, had made himself a host for.

"Ra's power, Gaia's environment, Argones' cells. When these three elements are combined infinitely, specific spaces where life can inhabit will inevitably emerge in this vast universe. Then the basic preparation is complete."

"Preparation for what?"

"Preparation for users to use this world."

Shirone closed his mouth.

"This is all under the assumption that Shirone's guess is true. Even if life exists, constructing consciousness is another matter entirely. First, it must seem real, yet still offset the fear of death."

"God."

"Yes. The mind program, God. Since it's a program derived from the star that is the source of life, humans also call it this."

Taeseong raised his index finger.

"The eternal and immortal Ra."

It was Ankh Ra.

"Even so, Ankh Ra couldn't know that he himself was a program. He would probably only know himself as some being who suddenly opened his eyes in the realm of nothingness. When such a being subjectively defines all concepts and stores them in the Akashic Records, they're transmitted to all life in the universe through quantum transmission. That's why Nane called this world Ankh Ra's dream."

Everything he had felt through his supernatural senses was becoming as clear as if visible.

"But an unexpected problem arose."

Taeseong's eyes darkened.

"The mind program was activated, and all users were supposed to achieve eternal life through reincarnation. But the first humans from Gaia—the Gaians—began to resist the God program."

Shirone recalled the Gaian records he had seen in Babel.

"They tried to break free from Ankh Ra."

"Yes. It was a fierce war. Every time Ankh Ra tried to reset to fix the error, Gaia desperately blocked it. They believed their enlightenment was more important than the universe itself. They had to pass it on to future generations somehow."

Shirone swallowed hard.

"Ankh Ra also mobilized all the concepts he had defined to attack them. The tide of battle turned, and it seemed impossible to prevent the reset. In the midst of this, someone among the Gaians found a way to preserve their enlightenment."

"That method was..."

"Going outside and directly injecting code. Infiltrating a special signal that could withstand the reset."

Shirone shook his head.

"How is that possible? Even Mahagaluta, having already achieved enlightenment, cannot influence this world."

"There is one way."

Shirone's eyes widened as he suddenly realized.

"Don't tell me..."

"Yes. Guffin's deletion."

Taeseong waved his finger.

"Simultaneously with the reset, exit the photon system and inject a new signal. This is the truth contained in the first reset."

Shirone gritted his teeth.

"Then Hexa is..."

"The mind program transmits information through quantum, the biological program through electricity, but ultimately it's a network based on photons. Time, matter, energy—everything is light. And the Gaians called that unit of information..."

Taeseong spoke in a careful voice.

"Hexa."

Tears began flowing down Shirone's cheeks.

"The concepts of cause and effect are merely definitions arbitrarily interpreted by Ankh Ra's dream. Hexa, which entered from outside this world, has no cause. Therefore, it's free from Ankh Ra's resets and is the only existence living outside his dream."

"Huk. Huuk."

Taeseong's heart also broke at Shirone's sobbing, but having come this far, he had to reach a conclusion.

"The light composing Hexa perfectly mimics human information. That's why you're human too, Shirone. But when viewed from the outside, as you suspected..."

Taeseong bit his lip briefly.

"You might be nothing more than a single signal."

Shirone's shoulders shook as he hung his head.

"I am... I am..."

The parents who raised him, beloved Amy, friends from magic school, countless people he had met over twenty years of life.

'None of them...'

Are connected.

They're merely programs of some pioneers trying to escape Ankh Ra's control.

"However, it might not be so."

Shirone raised his head again at Taeseong's words.

"I clearly said it, Shirone. This is just speculation. I don't know the truth either. I've merely applied what you realized in the void to an infinite perspective. If I wanted to, I could create any other story. The biggest problem is that Guffin has already been deleted."

"Why is that a problem?"

"Though I know the entire history of the universe, I cannot remember anything about Guffin. The most curious part is why the Gaians composed Hexa with human information."

Shirone's eyes blinked.

"Even if this world is some point in the void, there's quite a bit of evidence that humans aren't the only users. The Terraforce species, the Gaians too. It's obvious that it's a much more complex model than Shirone imagines. But surprisingly, what the Gaians chose was humans."

"Hmm."

Shirone, finally regaining his composure, stroked his chin.

"You opened the 8th sense to become the Infinite Wizard, but the Gaians were a species that opened the 11th sense, the ultimate sense. They're on a different dimension from Shirone, who wields omnipotence by human standards. Therefore, their analysis of the universe and their speculation about what's beyond the veil might be completely different from Shirone's current thoughts."

"Beyond infinity."

It was a single phrase Guffin had conveyed to Shirone after the Gaian records ended and the screen reset.

"...come to me."

Taeseong grasped Shirone's trembling shoulders.

"You might not be just a signal, Shirone."

Though Guffin was deleted.

"You might not be alone."

"Not... alone..."

Much hotter tears than before flowed down profusely.

"Surpass Nane and reach the ultimate. And at the end of this world, meet them proudly. Your real parents."

Shirone nodded repeatedly.

"Yes. Definitely..."

At least it wasn't time to give up everything yet.

"Good. Then."

Taeseong patted Shirone's shoulders and spoke with a pleasant smile.

"Now we'll begin the star bestowal ceremony."
