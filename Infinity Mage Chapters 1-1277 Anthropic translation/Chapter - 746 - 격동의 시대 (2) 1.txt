[746] Age of Upheaval (2)

"But you used to tell me to meet other men!"

Amy entered her room to escape Isis's nagging and sat down on the bed with a huff.

"As if I'm just sitting around because I enjoy this!"

Her anger quickly subsided.

Isis's words did make sense, and her fears were a natural reaction for any normal person.

'What will become of this world?'

The psychic zones that had appeared in various regions around the world would shake up global politics far beyond just the problem of demons appearing.

'Countless deaths, civil wars, wars with other countries...'

Being a soldier would become the most perilous occupation.

Perhaps this was Amy's only chance to change her dream of preparing for the civil service exam.

'Shirone.'

When they graduated, she thought they could dream of the future together and live a happy life.

'What am I to you?'

Exhausted from fighting demons, Amy fell asleep without even realizing how she had gotten into bed.

Tears trickled down between her eyelids.

"It's been a while, Miss Amy."

"Huh?"

When she turned around at the voice, she felt like the person was somehow familiar.

An elderly man with a kind smile and a mustache.

Only he seemed to have vivid colors as if he were truly alive, and her consciousness was drawn into the 6th level REM domain.

"Where is this?"

Realizing it was a dream, the scenery became clear, revealing a green field covered with all kinds of rare flowers.

"Huh? What?"

She had occasionally experienced sleep paralysis while dreaming, but this was the first time she had awakened so perfectly.

Amy, finally understanding, looked back at the old man.

"Could it be?"

"Yes, I am Louver, a dreamkeeper."

She knew that only those who had obtained a lucid dream certificate through special training could find Louver.

"Did you come to me directly?"

"Yes. Originally, it's forbidden by Terraforce universal law for dreamkeepers to forcibly awaken individuals' dreams, but given the circumstances, I had to intervene directly."

He had already notified the Terraforce Supreme Judge, and it was approved considering that Shirone was humanity's representative.

"Why did you seek me out?"

"There is someone who wishes to meet Miss Amy. If it wouldn't be an inconvenience, may I connect you to that person's dream...?"

Amy felt slightly tense knowing that the dreamkeeper was using honorifics for this person.

"Who is it?"

"I cannot tell you that. But I can assure you that it's unlikely Miss Amy would need to slap them."

Amy, who had been pouting thoughtfully, readily made her decision.

"Alright. It's just a dream anyway."

"Then, please have a pleasant time."

Louver's body gradually became transparent and completely disappeared.

"What?"

As Amy was looking around, she suddenly heard a familiar voice behind her.

"Amy."

Her shoulders flinched as she slowly turned around with a shocked expression to see Shirone standing there with a smile.

"You, you...?"

"Sorry for coming to you like this. But..."

Even though she knew it was a dream, seeing his face made all the resentment she had been harboring explode.

"You jerk!"

Amy grabbed Shirone by the collar and shouted.

"How could you not even contact me? I had to hear about it through my dad?"

Shirone just wore an apologetic expression.

"Do you know how embarrassed I was? Mom tells me to meet other men, people whisper that I was abandoned! But how could you... to me..."

Shirone suddenly pulled Amy into his arms.

"I missed you."

Amy understood.

There are emotions so vast and desperate that no exaggerated language could describe them.

'I know. I know that too.'

The heart is larger than the universe.

"Sigh. Well, since you're here now, I'll forgive you."

Shirone, who had grabbed Amy's shoulders and pulled back, also had tears in his eyes.

"But! Before that, there's definitely something I need to confirm!"

Just what does this guy think of me?

"You said you came through dreams, right? Knowing your personality, I'm probably not the only one you came to see. What number am I?"

"Of course you're first."

Shirone answered hastily, then seemed unable to overcome his guilt as he looked around nervously and spoke carefully.

"Actually... I visited my parents first and was on my way here."

Amy beamed.

"Then I am first. Come on, you need to tell me everything that happened."

Shirone, holding Amy's hand, nodded and ran across the meadow.

In a place where butterflies flew like fragments of light over the flower field, a small house could be seen.

It was painted entirely in pink, and Amy, caught revealing her subconscious, covered her mouth and coughed awkwardly.

"Ahem."

This was why Terraforce prohibited dream connections.

But since it was Shirone, rather than being embarrassed, she felt thrilled.

"...Let's go in."

Amy said shyly, and Shirone followed her with an indescribable smile.

"Amy, I have something to tell you."

"I know. You're in such a hurry..."

Since time was limited, Shirone first told her the things she absolutely needed to know.

As the story progressed, the candles underwent various changes, and when she finally learned the whole truth, her room was dim.

"So I..."

"I understand."

Amy interrupted Shirone.

"Why you couldn't contact me, what kind of work you have to do from now on."

The candles brightened again.

"But it's okay. It can't be helped. I'm glad I have a clear goal now too. Let's join forces and finish off Nane."

"No. This isn't at that level."

Since this might be the last chance to treat someone with human emotions, Shirone struggled to speak.

"Amy, I can't be with you anymore."

"What?"

Amy's house became completely dark.

"I'm too happy being with you like this. So happy I can't bear it, I feel like I'm going crazy."

"Then what's the problem? Why are you suddenly acting like this?"

"That's exactly it. That I'm too happy. I'll end up obsessing over you. And if that happens..."

Shirone bit his lip.

"Nane will definitely use that. The more I love you, the more dangerous you become."

"Nane is supposed to be a Buddha, right? What kind of Buddha does such cowardly things?"

"That's also human emotion."

Shirone looked at Amy's face beyond the darkness.

"To Nane, everything in this world is meaningless. He doesn't care what he does to close the world."

Because it never existed in the first place.

"He's already transcended the concept of good and evil. The realm of god reached after mastering all good and all evil."

It would be a lie to say he wasn't afraid.

"And I can't fight such a being while protecting someone. So Amy, let's stop now..."

"I understand. Let's stop."

At the suddenly cold voice, Shirone's heart, who couldn't bring himself to say the words, sank with a thud.

"Sigh, I knew this would happen. What romance in times like these? You don't need to worry about me anymore. You can fight Nane however you want from your position. Is that enough now?"

She spoke without hesitation, but the sound of wind howling outside couldn't be hidden.

"I'll leave."

Like the sound of wind, Amy sobbed.

"I'll become strong enough that you won't need to protect me. So I'll definitely, definitely come to you..."

Something hot and damp was spreading across Shirone's chest as he held Amy in his arms.

"Don't worry about anything and wait. I'll come. Wherever you are, whoever you're fighting, I'll come to your side."

She would become strong and stronger, and punch Nane in the face.

"Amy..."

Shirone couldn't hold back his tears either, and the two caressed each other's faces with their hands in the darkness.

If only he could hold her right now.

'It's a dream. It's just our dream.'

Their lips, which had almost touched, wandered lost, and only their emotions swirled frighteningly.

"I'm going. You have to be careful."

"No. You can't go. You can't. Shirone... wait..."

She thought she was ready, but when reality hit, she absolutely couldn't accept it.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Amy."

What if they loved each other madly until the world ended and all came to a close together?

The moment this utterly human thought crossed his mind, Shirone squeezed his eyes shut, kicked off from the bed, and left the house.

"Shirone! Wait, just wait...!"

That was the end of Amy's dream.

"Ahhhhh!"

Louver approached with a sad expression in front of Shirone, who was crouched and crying in the dream.

"Do not be angry."

"Why, why me! Why only me... why!"

"Forgive me."

At the two firm statements, Shirone's breathing rapidly subsided.

"Hah. Hah."

'Are you accepting it again? What a truly formidable spirit.'

Neither Shirone nor Nane was born a god.

Their base was still human, yet because of this level of spirit, they could aspire to transcend the realm of gods.

"This is only the beginning. The Great Purification has just opened. If you're not bold, you will kill yourself."

There was no guarantee that wouldn't happen.

"I'm sorry. Mr. Louver did this especially for me."

"I'm the one who should be sorry. I actually knew. But if Shirone becomes human in reality, the world will close."

That's why he confirmed it through dreams.

"Will you return?"

"No. Now, before stronger obsession develops, is the last chance. I want to inform as many people as possible."

The Five Great Saints' mission had already begun.

"Please take me to my friends."

Louver muttered in a choked voice.

"May you have good dreams..."

"Ugh. Ughhh."

At Nade's voice heard at dawn, Liz, who was sleeping beside him, shook his body.

"Nade? Is it a nightmare?"

They had fought demons all day trying to escape beyond the psychic zone's radius.

"Is it because you're tired?"

"This is really a dream?"

Louver had told him everything, but Nade, who hadn't experienced drimo, was skeptical.

"Hahaha! Who cares! Wow, it's Shirone!"

Nade ran over happily, but his expression hardened as soon as he saw Shirone's face.

"...What's wrong, Shirone?"

Why are you crying?

"Nade."

"What happened? Did something bad happen?"

This was the first time he'd seen Shirone cry so sadly.

"Who's bothering you! Tell me who it is! I'll go right now and smash them!"

"Nade, I..."

It had been a long dream.

"Gasp!"

Nade, who woke up startled, bolted upright and breathed heavily.

"Are you okay?"

Hearing Liz's voice, he looked around and the inn room where they had evacuated from demons felt strange.

"Did you dream about demons? You wouldn't wake up no matter how much I shook you..."

"It wasn't a dream."

Shirone had said Nane.

"Get ready, Liz. Let's return to Tormia right now. I need to meet Iruki. He's probably waiting for me."

"Tormia?"

As the psychic zone covered the capital, Nade had immediately crossed the border with Liz.

While Nade had no patriotism anyway, for Liz, who was a full employee of the Magic Association, this was absolutely something she shouldn't do.

"Don't you know what the capital situation is like now? We'll be arrested as soon as we arrive. And what do you mean Iruki is waiting?"

"Shirone is struggling."

"..."

The reason Liz couldn't argue was that both of them had gained new lives because of Shirone.

"Some crazy bastard is messing with my friend."

The high realm Shirone mentioned wasn't something Nade needed to worry about.

"So you're really going? Now?"

"I could abandon my country for the person I love..."

Nade said as he put on his shirt.

"But I won't forgive even Buddha for bothering my friend."

That was Nade.

"Sigh. Men really live and die for loyalty."

Nade, shouldering his backpack, looked at Liz and raised the corner of his mouth.

"Let's go. Whether he's Buddha or a dog bone..."

If humans were the problem, he would dominate humans.

"Let's show them exactly what happens when you mess with Shirone's gang."
