Acceleration (3)

The Eastern Sea of the Jincheon Empire.

The place Seong-eum arrived at by distorting space was the airspace above coastal waters where a white sandy beach was visible.

"Advance! Advance! Do not retreat!"

At the boundary of the white sandy beach bathed in sunlight, the armies of Jincheon and Hell were engaged in fierce battle.

As their noise mingled together, piercing the eardrums like white noise, Shirone looked back at the sea.

In the distant waters, demonic beasts the size of sailing ships could be seen.

On the beach side, tentacled monsters were striking down soldiers from heights of several meters.

'This is serious.'

What could be discerned from observing from the sky was that it was only a matter of time before the coastline would be occupied.

The reason Jincheon had been able to hold out until now was singular.

It was their tremendous mass offensive that could rival Hell's army without shame.

"There are humans over there!"

Demons with long beaks like spears flapped their wings and flew toward Seong-eum.

'Ether Wave!'

As Seong-eum refracted space, the scenery became complexly intertwined, and the demons' beaks pierced through their comrades' bodies.

"Kreeeeee!"

Watching hundreds of demons simultaneously crash into the sea, Seong-eum turned to look at Shirone.

"Hell's army is already advancing from the land route, conquering the Eastern Seven Kingdoms. If we can't find a breakthrough here at sea, Jincheon will perish."

To Shirone, Jincheon's value was equal to other nations, but strategically speaking, it was more than that.

"I'll fight right away. Let's go to the beach."

Just as Lian gripped the handle of his great sword, preparing to sortie, Seong-eum shook her head.

"No. What I want to ask of you isn't that. You have something else you need to do."

Seong-eum's eyes wavered as she watched the soldiers' deaths.

But soon she made a resolute expression and waved her hand to cast an Ether Wave.

As if a carpet was being crumpled, the scenery was pulled, and the view of the imperial capital Yeomra rushed in quickly.

Forests and buildings flowed like rapids, and after penetrating thick walls, the great hall where officials were gathered appeared.

"We cannot retreat! If we fail to recapture the coastline, they'll push straight into the imperial capital!"

The military officers were divided into two groups, engaged in debate.

"But are you saying we should continue this disadvantageous battle? There are limits even to wars of attrition! At this rate, we'll be annihilated!"

The shouting also resembled a battlefield.

"This way."

Seong-eum walked toward the dragon throne with Shirone and Lian following behind.

"Your Majesty!"

Emperor Jingang, who had been listening to the military officers' opinions while resting his chin on his hand, only moved his gaze to look this way.

"Have you come?"

Even though the empire was heading toward catastrophe, no anxiety could be found in the emperor's eyes.

'Indeed. He's a different kind of emperor from Uorin.'

Since this was much better to deal with than a frightened appearance, Shirone followed Jincheon's etiquette despite being a star of the Ivory Tower.

"It is an honor to meet you."

"There's no need to be so humble. We're the ones who need help, after all."

Shirone relaxed his posture and spoke.

"Regardless of nation, these are difficult times. Your grief must be great."

"What grief?"

Jingang raised the corners of his mouth.

"If we perish, we perish."

The noisy great hall became quiet in an instant.

Jincheon's Inspector General Anchal stretched out both arms and prostrated himself flat as he reported.

"Your Majesty, Jincheon will not perish. We are doing our utmost to devise strategies, so the tide of war will turn soon."

"'Utmost' is nothing but an illusion."

As Jingang rose from his seat, all his subjects straightened their postures and knelt.

"Only do as much as you can. That point is the strongest. You become weak when you try to use things that don't exist in reality. As I always say..."

A deep feeling emerged from Jingang's eyes.

"The simple defeats the complex."

The military officers fell into thought.

"If you've done everything you can do, then clash. If you keep doing that, something will surely emerge. Even if we perish when the time comes, don't tremble with fear from the start."

"We humbly receive Your Majesty's solemn command."

As all the military officers bowed, Jingang clasped his hands behind his back and approached Shirone.

"You seem to have something you want to say?"

Shirone shook his head.

"No. I completely agree with Your Majesty's thoughts. Facing reality is efficient."

"Is that so?"

Jingang smiled bitterly.

This meant that even in the eyes of an Ivory Tower mage, Jincheon's current state was seriously poor.

"I have no choice but to place my hopes on you."

"I'll go to the Eastern Sea. If I defeat the legion commander, the demons' morale will also be broken."

"No. Though it's precarious, Jincheon isn't so weak as that. What you need to do is something Seong-eum will tell you."

As Jingang looked at Seong-eum, she also met her father's eyes with a complex gaze.

"I'm sorry I can't give you much time."

Seong-eum bowed.

"I'll go ahead first. Please preserve your health."

It sounded like a farewell.

"Yes. Don't worry about me. And mage of the Ivory Tower, though the world is in a precarious situation..."

This was the last request he could make as a father.

"Please respect Seong-eum's wishes."

"What do you mean by—"

Before Shirone could finish speaking, Seong-eum cast an Ether Wave and moved locations.

As the great hall receded, they arrived at the palace where Seong-eum resided.

"Have you arrived, Miss?"

Mungyeong, the leader of the Three Guards, came out to meet them.

Though they had become acquainted during the Ivory Tower exam, for some reason his eyes were swollen as if he had been crying all night.

'What's going on?'

Come to think of it, all the maids around were also looking at Seong-eum with pitying gazes.

But the person in question rather showed no particular expression and pointed to Shirone as she spoke.

"I have things to discuss with my friend. Prepare accommodations."

"Please come this way."

Mungyeong followed from three steps behind, and other maids also guided Seong-eum from their respective positions.

'Still the same.'

Shirone was aware of her obsession with spatial boundaries.

The reason he could approach close to her side was because she had permitted zero distance.

Since he had been in that position, Mungyeong couldn't say anything about Shirone either.

'If he's someone the Miss loves, I can step back as much as needed. But the timing is what's heartbreaking.'

"Please enter."

When Mungyeong opened the accommodations, a room with a round table and bed appeared in a neatly arranged annex.

It was according to Seong-eum's taste.

"Everyone, go outside."

"However, Miss, this swordsman is..."

The only one Seong-eum had permitted zero distance was Shirone alone.

She couldn't have Lian in the narrow room together.

"It's fine. I permit it."

Seong-eum looked at Lian.

She had been surprised by his martial prowess in defeating Ymir's incarnation before, but now he had grown much more than that.

'Without doubt, he must be the world's strongest.'

Does Shirone fight with such a person by his side?

In any case, from Jincheon Empire's standpoint it was a good thing, so Seong-eum also gave him a distance.

"0.1 steps."

She couldn't give him the same distance as Shirone.

As Lian shrugged his shoulders and entered, Mungyeong had nothing more to argue about.

"I'll be waiting outside."

In a somewhat awkward atmosphere, Shirone, Lian, and Seong-eum sat around the round table in a circle.

"First, let me start by apologizing. I can well imagine how busy you must be, having become a star of the Ivory Tower."

"It's fine. This is my job, after all. By the way, what is this thing I need to do here? And why did His Majesty—"

Seong-eum looked up at the ceiling, reminiscing about the past.

"Do you remember by any chance? When I took you to the Ivory Tower, I asked you. How much time you could give me."

"Huh? Time?"

From Shirone's perspective, it was something he had said casually, so it took him quite a while to recall.

"Ah, that's right. I think I said 10 days?"

"Right, 10 days."

Shirone spoke with a troubled expression.

"But now it would be a bit difficult. I'll definitely keep my promise once the war is over."

"There's no need. Forget about it."

Seong-eum was smiling, but no vitality could be felt.

"Time is of the essence. Even now, countless people of Jincheon are dying. That's why I'm asking. Regardless of promises..."

Seong-eum looked at Shirone with earnest eyes.

"One day. Please give me just one day of your time."

Lian let out a "hmm" sound, and Shirone blinked.

'One day?'

He couldn't understand what she was thinking.

"What is all this?"

Havitz and Gustaf's 4th Corps, who had joined from the battlefield, had set up camp 20 kilometers away from the battlefield.

Following Balkan's instructions, they had killed all the humans in every city along the route, but there were spoils to give to Smodo.

"Huuk. Huuuuk."

Roughly 2,000 young girls in their prime were tied with ropes and lined up in rows.

Zetaro, sitting on the ground, pulled at grass as he spoke.

"You said you'd take all the women in the world. Actually, I killed many because they were troublesome to carry around. I don't know your taste, but anyway, I roughly selected them by my standards."

Natasha gave up counting the numbers.

"Even at 10 per day, it would take forever. Smodo, don't overdo it. You'll wear your bones out."

"Put your worries aside."

Smodo didn't know the meaning of giving up.

"That's why humans need tools."

Taking a repeating crossbow from a soldier, he looked at Natasha and raised the corner of his mouth with a grin.

"Anyway, I just need to shoot, right?"

More than ten arrows per second poured into the crowd.

"Kyaaaaa!"

Girls dying.

Screams of hell broke out, and people trampled while tied with ropes appeared in succession.

"More! More!"

When the arrows ran out, subordinates brought new crossbows, and the cruel slaughter continued endlessly.

After shooting 600 rounds, his body was on the verge of breaking from the recoil.

"Wow, this is really tiring. Zetaro, want to do it together?"

"Kekeke, that's what you get for being greedy."

Zetaro, holding crossbows in both hands, began shooting arrows randomly without caring about the recoil.

"Kyahahaha! Kyahahaha!"

Behind the two men, tears of blood flowed from the eyes of Natasha, who was performing a beautiful dance.

'Crazy bastards.'

The soldiers seriously wondered if this was truly a right given to humans.

'Shouldn't someone stop them?'

Balkan sat on his horse, absorbed in studying a map.

Havitz was also just sitting with his back against something in a corner grassland, drawing pictures on the ground.

"Haa! Haa!"

Finally, when all 2,000 had fallen, Smodo threw down his crossbow, drenched in sweat.

"Really tiring."

"Hek! I know, right. Hek!"

As Zetaro sat down heavily, breathing hard, Smodo looked at Balkan.

"Hey, strategist. How many have we killed so far?"

Balkan looked up and stroked his chin.

"Hmm, let's see. Roughly between 600 million and 700 million?"

"What? 600 to 700 million?"

Smodo's face turned incredulous.

"We've been killing everyone we came across, but we haven't even reduced half of half yet? Damn, why are there so many humans?"

Balkan agreed.

"It is a bit slower than expected. There seems to be a decent strategist in Valkyrie. They're minimizing the damage."

Humanity didn't have the military power to stop Hell's army, but even in such a situation, their response was agile.

'Just who the hell is it?'

Someone with a brain capable of opposing crowd tactics.

Balkan's gaze aimed at someone in the enemy camp whose name he didn't even know yet.
