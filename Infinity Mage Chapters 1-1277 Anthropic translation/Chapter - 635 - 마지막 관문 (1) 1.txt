[635] The Final Gateway (1)

The moment Nade's chin caught Amy's fist, she instinctively knew.

'It landed perfectly!'

Even in that brief moment, she twisted her waist with all her strength, causing Nade's head to turn and his body to spin around.

"Graaaah!"

Just as Nade had unleashed a lifetime's worth of rage, Amy's fist also contained the deadly resolve of countless hours compressed into that single moment.

"The magic power reading...!"

The percentage displayed on Elizabeth's retina dropped as rapidly as water being drained with an eyedropper.

Considering it was 1.2 billion magicles, the speed was hair-raising.

When the percentage fell below 3 percent, she truly thought it was over.

"Uaaaah!"

But Nade didn't lose consciousness.

Baikal, guessing the reason, showed emotion for the first time as he struck his knee with a regretful expression.

"The reaction speed of electricity."

Amy's strike had certainly delivered impact, but with reflexes faster than the speed at which the shockwave traveled, he twisted his body to negate the force.

As Amy stepped forward in her punching stance, electricity sparked from Nade's spinning body.

It had been such a brilliant idea, and for a moment they had seen a glimmer of hope, so Baikal could only bite his lips.

'It was nearly perfect. You can be proud, Amy!'

It was already a counter that transcended human perception, but if only it had gone just a little deeper.

If she could have reached just 0.1 millimeters further, it would have created an unprecedented result of toppling the monster of magic assimilation.

"Kraaaah!"

Watching Nade roar and discharge powerful electricity, Amy let out a sigh.

'Get it together, you idiot.'

Simultaneously, massive anti-magic struck her mind.

Carmis Amy. Final graduation rank 4th confirmed. Remaining participants: 3.

Amy collapsed forward, and Nade, having discharged electricity, fell beside her looking up at the sky.

However, Nade's mental strength had also weakened.

"What's the magic power reading?"

"4 million magicles."

"It dropped tremendously. He was right on the verge of losing consciousness."

"Yes. But even in that dazed state, 4 million magicles itself is abnormal."

Shirone and Iruki, each gasping for breath from different positions, were thinking the same thing as they looked at the fallen Nade.

'Just sleep. Please just sleep.'

Then blue electricity coiled around Nade's body.

As his consciousness returned, magic assimilation was blooming fully, and the rising numbers were bizarrely high.

"20 million, 50 million, breaking through 100 million magicles."

"...Something seems strange?"

The lightning surrounding Nade shot up into the sky, forming the shape of a giant human figure.

Kaaaaaaang!

The sound waves created by the electricity shook the entire colosseum, and everyone covered their ears.

"Urgh! What is that!"

Everyone just die! Disappear!

"Is his consciousness being manifested through magic power?"

The electric giant that expanded with each sound was overwhelming enough to be called a thunder god.

I...

The thunder god crossed both arms and shouted with the loudest voice.

What did I do so wrong?!

Electric bundles spread in all directions, and as if transparent walls had been erected in front of the spectator seats, they began scraping against the edges of the two-thousand-fold domain.

"T-This...!"

The pale-faced spectators couldn't even blink as they stared at the blue-white currents spreading right before them.

Each one was Nade's face, wearing a distorted expression.

Answer me! Why must I be unhappy? Why must I alone bear everything?

Bollum, who had been watching Nade's face flickering in electrical form, looked at his wife.

An ordinary person should have been terrified, but Teria was showing the same angry expression as Nade.

Answer me!

As lightning concentrated and opened a giant mouth to emit sound, Teria shouted.

"Because you're pathetic!"

All the spectators turned to look at her.

"Dear."

Bollum tried to restrain her, but once she was angry, only death could stop her.

"What kind of whining is this! Mom did her best too! I gave you everything you asked for! On our meager income, I even sent you to magic school! That's why you can take this test!"

You didn't want my success!

"Don't talk nonsense! What parent in the world wants their child to fail! Does that annoy you so much? If you pitied your mother, how could you do this!"

The sudden mother-son argument had the spectators murmuring.

"The West family. I heard they had fallen, but they're really badly broken."

"It's someone else's family business. Don't interfere and just stay quiet."

Teria, having lost her reason, shouted.

"You think you're the only one suffering? Mom wants to die too! Supporting you, and your father too - I'm sick to death of it all!"

Why... did you abandon me?

Compared to all the previous thunder, it was a small rumble, but Teria closed her mouth for the first time.

"That was, in that situation..."

You never even said you were sorry.

"Was it my fault? I too, because of that..."

Shall I tell you what happened that day?

Teria's body trembled.

Despite seeing the countless burn scars carved into Nade's body, she had never once asked what had happened.

"I don't want to hear it. It's already over."

Electricity flowed down like tears from Nade's face spreading across the transparent wall.

I think so too. It's already over and can't be undone. So...

As the face retreated, the electricity returned to Nade.

Watch clearly from there, what kind of monster I've become.

Nade, who had been hanging limply like a puppet beneath the thunder god's form, opened his eyes.

"Shirone. Iruki."

The voice came from Nade's mouth, not the thunder god's.

"Sorry, but I have to win."

Even though he had controlled his magic assimilation, Nade's face remained cold.

"We told you to do that from the beginning."

Shirone and Iruki weren't resentful.

Betrayal or whatever - if it was a conclusion he had reached through his own judgment, they could accept anything in the graduation exam.

"Magic power reading: 240 million."

It was higher than Ataraxia's physical impact system, but compared to his previous rampage, it was rather human-like numbers.

"The most powerful instinct versus slightly less powerful reason. Which do you think would be worse to face?"

Elizabeth didn't feel the need to answer.

Shirone, Iruki, and Nade each slowly moved their steps around the center of the colosseum.

A triangular formation.

Perfect balance where no one could act first made the battlefield's atmosphere heavy.

"Huh? Come to think of it, the final three."

Mark said.

"It's the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Club, isn't it?"

"Oh my, you're right. 1st through 3rd place."

The teachers had mixed feelings too.

"Sheesh, those troublemakers."

Shiina grumbled, recalling the various incidents the trio had caused since their advanced class days.

"They never just let things pass quietly until the end."

"They were quite unique children. Oddballs, but pure, I'd say. They gave me headaches many times, but now that I'm thinking of sending them off from my care, it feels bittersweet."

At Ethella's words, Shiina also smiled bitterly.

"...They'll be students I'll never forget for life."

Only after making a full circle around the huge colosseum did the three establish their respective strategies.

'Ataraxia.'

As a colorful magic circle accumulated before Shirone's eyes, the scout seats stirred.

"He's going for an immediate showdown."

"Probably so. If they fight considering the future, they'll actually get eliminated in this structure. They have no choice but to play their strongest cards."

'Nuclear Fusion.'

Simultaneously, Iruki began drawing up an explosive equation with unprecedented power.

The best outcome would be eliminating both at once.

For that, he needed an explosion powerful enough to dominate the entire colosseum.

'Watch clearly, what your ruined son can do.'

Nade's thunder god compressed into a sphere and began emitting white lightning.

He intended to destroy everything - the graduation exam, being a mage, wealth and glory, all of it.

And he would tell Teria:

Everything you could have had has disappeared forever at this very moment.

With the lightning sphere floating in the air like a divine object, the spectators gulped.

"It'll be power beyond measurable numbers. Someone will definitely be eliminated here."

Iruki glanced sideways at Shirone.

'This is tricky. Should I detonate first instead?'

But then Shirone and Nade's magic would concentrate on him.

'The best would be for Nade to attack Shirone and for me to blow both of them away. Then it's over.'

As soon as his thought ended, Nade's lightning split into two.

"Anyway."

Iruki made a rotten smile.

'Being too close is also a problem.'

Shirone was also expecting Nade's response.

'Good. If Nade checks Iruki, I'll attack Iruki too. Then I'll dodge Nade's attack.'

The speed of lightning Nade would fire would be beyond imagination, but with Spatial Leap, he could dodge it sufficiently.

'Now all that's left is timing.'

Who would move first?

Before the thought could finish, Nade's temperament twisted.

'It's Nade!'

The moment the other two reacted, both lightning bolts flew toward Shirone.

'Tch, he doesn't move as expected after all.'

A tactic of pretending to target both while actually aiming to eliminate Shirone first.

This was why slightly less powerful reason was frightening.

'Then...!'

A massive flash that passed through Ataraxia swallowed the lightning and rotated toward Iruki, and as expected, Nade, who had cast Spark magic, appeared before Iruki.

'Hehe, idiot. Don't I know you? But thanks to that...'

Iruki's lips curled up fully.

'It was a fun school life!'

Nuclear Fusion!

A tremendous explosion erupted from the center of the colosseum, sweeping across the entire arena.

Albino, gauging the power from the brightness of the light, muttered with a dazed expression.

"That... isn't he an idiot?"

In the psychological warfare of mutual targeting, Iruki's final method was to blow everything away with an explosion even he couldn't handle.

'Truly a human weapon.'

New explosions continued to birth from the center of the explosion, and the sight of filling the interior of the two-thousand-fold barrier was all the scouts could see.

"If this were reality, everyone would be dead."

As the sun-like explosion disappeared, the spectators' gazes wandered aimlessly over the colosseum.

With all three collapsed on the ground without even moving, murmurs flowed like waves.

"W-what happened?"

Mercodain Iruki. Final graduation rank 3rd confirmed. Remaining participants: 2.

Simultaneously with the two-thousand-fold announcement, Nade staggered to his feet.

"Brutish bastard."

Iruki said, looking up at the sky.

"That depends on perspective. You go ahead and explode as you like too. No one here will say anything about it."

If not for his magic power exceeding 200 million, Nade would also be lying next to Iruki.

"...I will."

As Nade moved away, Iruki, who had read through 19 years of life like a flashback, smiled with satisfaction.

"Ah, what a relief~"

The spectators held their breath and waited, but no more announcements from the two-thousand-fold system came.

"He neutralized the explosion with amplified mass waves. He intended to defend and attack simultaneously."

"Ow, my head."

The spectators' gazes focused on one spot.

"I knew it before, but..."

Shirone, slowly rising while supporting himself on the ground, rubbed his shoulder and grumbled.

"You guys are really impossible to handle."
