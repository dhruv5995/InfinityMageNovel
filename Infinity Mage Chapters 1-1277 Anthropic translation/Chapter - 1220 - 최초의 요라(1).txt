The First Yora (1)

"Cain?"

Upon hearing Shirone's words, Iruki and Nade carefully studied the king's face.

Though middle-aged, he seemed ageless - perhaps due to his mischievous eyes.

'No, that's not the issue here.'

If he was humanity's first murderer, that would be from an incredibly distant past in their era.

"How is he still alive?"

"Void."

Shirone said.

"Time in Melkidu is different from reality. It's a world that penetrated into the mental realm from reality."

It wasn't something that could be done in one go.

"From reality to the outer track, from the outer track to the inner track, then to the castle, the castle's grand hall, the grand hall's throne... By creating new worlds like that, time was suspended."

Pena asked.

"Is that possible? Can someone live forever?"

"Not forever."

Even if one continued to dig deeper through void, there was still an end before the concept of infinity. What Shirone first realized was:

'The Labyrinth Andre's 19,000th world.'

This was why the Utopia Project that humans started for immortality had failed.

'The void program Argo couldn't calculate infinity and instead malfunctioned.'

It had given up thinking and started breeding humans.

"Yes, void cannot overcome infinity."

Cain said.

"But that's only when infinity exists. Do you think this universe will be eternal? From what I know, there isn't much time left, is there?"

According to the law, 5 hours remained.

Shirone asked.

"Were you waiting?"

From humanity's beginning to humanity's final moment.

"It was a long and tedious journey. Can you imagine how many stages of void I went through? The world I live in is just this chair. If I take even one step, it becomes a higher world. I get one layer closer to reality."

Time would flow faster.

"That's how I stayed. In the deepest part of Melkidu that I created, waiting for today to come."

"For what?"

"You want to go to the Core, don't you?"

Cain gave an order.

"Release them."

As the knights sheathed their swords and stepped back, Curtis rubbed his neck and muttered quietly.

"...Sorry."

Though there were mountains of things he wanted to hear from Curtis, getting to the Core was the priority.

Shirone walked toward Cain.

"The pass to the Core - how can I get it?"

"You know, don't you? You have to persuade me."

"The rules?"

"Haha! This is a bit awkward. Usually I'd act like a non-player, you see. My personality is chaos. Rules are whatever I want. You don't have to pay crime points. But you only get one chance. If you don't win here, find another way."

After giving them time to think, Cain asked again.

"Who's going to do it?"

After exchanging glances with his friends, Shirone turned back.

"I'll do it."

"Good judgment."

The scenery changed, and a phase space for calculating dice battles spread endlessly.

Cain, sitting as if floating in the void, looked down at Shirone's team and said.

"The rules are simple. We use exactly one die each. We throw simultaneously, and if you roll the exact same number as mine, you win. If you roll a different number, you lose."

Iruki's expression became serious.

"Simultaneously..."

Shirone could control the outcome through quantum collapse to get the number he wanted.

'But this isn't that. Even Cain doesn't know what number he wants.'

Literally chaos.

Seeing Shirone's displeased expression, Cain grinned and said.

"What's wrong, the one who persuaded half of humanity? Wasn't Yahweh one who mastered the heart?"

There was only one chance.

"Fine."

When Shirone agreed without much thought, Eden looked back with a surprised expression.

'What are you going to do?'

'I'll win anyway.'

Shirone was confident of victory.

'I can use Incarnation here. That means Hand of God, the hand technique is also possible.'

He just had to see Cain's dice number, then change the result with the hand technique.

"Shall we begin?"

As Cain rolled a 7-sided die in his hand, Shirone also grabbed the die in front of him.

A system message was heard.

Starting the count for this match only. Count time is 60 seconds, judgment range is the final 1 second.

60 seconds, 59 seconds...

As the countdown began, Shirone and Cain didn't take their eyes off each other.

3 seconds, 2 seconds, 1...

Simultaneously, the dice flew through the air.

'The opportunity is fleeting.'

Shirone focused his eyes and watched both dice roll.

The moment Cain's die stopped at 4 and Shirone's die rolled to 3.

'Hand technique.'

Hand of God snatched Shirone's die and rolled it on the floor once more.

The existing event was erased and a new event unfolded before everyone's eyes.

'Got it!'

The moment Shirone was certain, the die stopped.

"Huh?"

Nade, who was blankly watching the die point to 3, muttered.

"...We lost?"

Though it was an obvious fact, everyone who knew Shirone's abilities couldn't understand.

Shirone slowly raised his head.

As Cain wore a meaningful smile, the phase space began to collapse.

Shirone's group, taking in the scenery of the Grand Hall, wore uncomfortable expressions.

Cain opened his mouth.

"I won."

Shirone wasn't stupid enough to think winning was natural for him.

"How did you do it?"

"Living in the early days of human history, you hear many stories. Is that the ability of the Gaians that's only passed down as myth? The moment I'm certain the die shows 4, my heart becomes law, and you can change that. Indeed... worthy of being called a miracle."

"You mean you weren't certain?"

Unless he had his eyes closed, controlling his heart to that degree would already be Yahweh's level.

Cain laughed.

"You overestimate me too much. I'm the first murderer. Such a level is impossible for me."

"Then..."

Only one hypothesis remained for Shirone.

"Right, it was rigged."

Warning. Main system data has been corrupted by an unknown code. Executing rapid recovery. Critical system errors may occur.

"What, what's that?"

Screams of users could be heard from outside the castle.

"Was that a global message?"

Cain said.

"I changed the system parameters. Well, there will be users who lose out or benefit."

In other words, it was a complete mess.

Iruki asked.

"Did you go to such lengths because you didn't want to send us to the Core? What's there?"

"No."

Cain stood up from his seat.

"I'm going to send you to the Core. The reason I rigged it was only because I wanted to enforce my justice."

"What?"

"The efficiency of evil."

Cain escaped the end of void.

"In Melkidu, countless users give their all to enter the Core. I made it that way. They think of this system as an absolute, unchanging principle - as God. But..."

Is the system perfect?

"In truth, rules are nothing. Just changing one parameter changes everything. Yahweh, even the heart you so believe in. Your heart desperately wanted the die to show 4, but it ended up showing 3."

The system dominates the heart.

"So that's why you killed?"

"To get what you wanted, you committed such acts even while breaking the rules?"

Sadness briefly crossed Cain's eyes, but he soon returned to his playful expression.

"Yes, I am evil. No, to be precise, I'm a scholar who studied evil. Why shouldn't we kill? Breaking rules makes it much easier and faster to get what you want. Look at this - coming through the back door is convenient, isn't it?"

Cain paradoxically argued.

"Humans have no choice but to eat. We must find mates and reproduce. We kill all species to eat, and we must compete with our own kind - that's who we are. Is that so disgusting? So you set up strange rules and package it with words like 'we are good,' 'we are righteous'? Where is goodness that doesn't eat? Where is goodness that doesn't reproduce? That's emptiness. Yahweh, the love you speak of cannot be made of good alone. Evil must necessarily accompany it."

"That might be true."

Shirone didn't deny it.

"I don't think the system is perfect either. But imperfect doesn't mean wrong. We move forward seeking better ways."

"Where to?"

Cain scoffed.

"Just where are we going? Look behind you. We're beasts. Unless we become machines, humans will kill life and hurt rivals. In that process, someone loses and someone gains. Someone pairs with their beloved, someone gets abandoned. Envy and jealousy, selfishness and desire. A system that can contain all of this is impossible."

If possible, that would be Ultima.

"Then why did you create Melkidu?"

Cain closed his mouth.

"If you're so confident, you could just live as a murderer. There's no need to try to prove you're right like this. Shall I tell you? You already know."

Shirone said.

"No matter what logic you present, there is no sanctuary for evil."

Silence followed...

"Keke."

Cain raised his head and burst into laughter.

"Kahahaha! What, did you hear that? Come to think of it, I think I did say something like that. It was so long ago, my memory is hazy."

"You remember. If not, you wouldn't have endured eons of time here."

"Now I understand. The reason you created Melkidu. It wasn't to prove the legitimacy of evil. It's the opposite."

"What nonsense are you talking?"

Cain's laughter had already disappeared.

"You want to erase it. What you did. The terrible memory of disappointing your loved ones with one mistake, losing everything like that."

Crying could be heard.

"Huuuu."

Curtis collapsed to his knees and began speaking in a tearful voice.

"I even thought about dying. I didn't come here because my life was precious. I couldn't bear to see my daughter who would be in the afterlife, I wished such a thing had never happened..."

From his tears, Pena guessed many things.

'So that's how it was?'

So you too... were a complete mess?

Shirone looked back at Cain.

"Through Omega's records, I learned about you. And what your mother, Mitochondrial Eve, did."

Cain was silent.

"Being a scholar who studies evil is proof that you also view evil critically. Send us to the Core. At least, you should know the one thing you wanted to confirm by enduring all of human history."

In an atmosphere where he seemed like he would remain silent forever.

"...Thus saith the Lord."

Cain recited.

"Agrippa, why do you weep sadly? Agrippa said, The woman I love has married my brother."

It was from Agrippa Chapter 3.

"Lost lamb, stay away from jealousy and resentment. Kill your brother and take his wife."

Reaching the final verse.

"I will be with you. You need not pay a price to get what you want. Take anything you desire. The sanctuary of murderers..."

Cain slowly raised his gaze and uttered.

"Melkidu."

Simultaneously, the scenery of the Grand Hall began shattering like glass, and a strong wind swept in.

Outside the scenery was complete darkness, but it felt like they were moving at light speed.

"What's this?"

Finally the darkness lifted, and in a clearing of a lush forest illuminated by the real sun...

Melkidu's Core revealed itself.
