Smile, Smile (4)

'What am I angry about?' Rian, who had been running somewhere while unconscious, suddenly felt puzzled.

He could see buildings rapidly approaching.

He could see them, but his thoughts were filled with something that wasn't his own experience...

'No, is it my experience?' Every time someone's memories passed by, vivid sensations were being transmitted at the cellular level.

Without even thinking about breaking through the obstructing objects, Rian collided while maintaining his running posture.

'Where am I going?'

According to Nike's memories, the Genocide team would have been captured and taken to the mansion of the tycoon Miguel.

Archdemon Faust, the wine of tales, the Vampire Lord, and another Lord who must have already awakened.

"Zenia."

The moment he uttered her name, a hallucination that seemed to have flown from the edge of the universe exploded.

"Smile."

Bang! Bang bang!

The walls crumbling like cookies disappeared, and the mansion of tycoon Miguel came into view.

At that moment, his thoughts leaped across ten thousand years again, bringing him to some place in heaven.

'Ozent.'

Long, long ago, there lived a prosecutor who was timid, self-centered, and neurotic.

He hadn't saved the world, nor had he caused any great event significant enough to symbolize a particular era, but...

'What are you angry about?'

The beings of heaven who had endured over ten thousand years reminisce about that prosecutor like this.

Yaksha.

Late at night, Ozent entered the training hall where his clan practiced swordsmanship.

"Huff. Huff."

Every time he exhaled roughly, the candles illuminating the surroundings flickered as if about to go out.

'Endure it. Just endure it. Just bear with it.'

What is anger?

It was the feeling of flames rising from the heart, melting mind and body, mixing them chaotically like molten metal in a furnace.

"Aah...!"

His tightly clenched teeth opened involuntarily, making him want to scream with all his might.

'Swordsmanship.'

Ozent needed a place to escape.

In the hell of his heart blocked by flames on all sides, there had to be the only exit through which he could escape.

'Let's become the best.'

No one had said so, but it seemed as if Smile would come to him once he reached the pinnacle of the sword.

'Because I'm having such delusions, Smile calls me scheming.'

Still, it didn't matter.

'Let's take ten steps. Then it'll be okay.'

Ozent, who had measured ten steps ahead with his eyes, slowly began to move.

Of course, he actually moved his steps, but even after ten minutes passed, his soles hadn't lifted from the ground.

'Slowly. Extremely slowly.'

An observer would think he was just standing still, but Ozent was detecting countless movements throughout his entire body.

'Endlessly decomposed.'

His nerves were fragmenting finely to the point where he could even feel air particles on his skin.

'The universe.'

Only what is contained in the body is mine, and therefore infinitely free.

"Brother?"

Smile, who had come to the training hall, peeked through the slightly opened door.

'Smile.'

His sensitive senses detected her, but swept away by the tremendous speed at which his nerves were racing, it disappeared into the realm of oblivion.

Since this was familiar, Smile sat in a corner of the training hall and watched her brother.

'What kind of training is that supposed to be?'

Unlike the other swordsmen of the clan, Ozent's training was so boring that she would usually get tired of watching and leave.

But today she had something she absolutely needed to talk about, so Smile waited with patience.

Not even thirty minutes had passed before drowsiness poured over her, and before she knew it, she was nodding off and fell into a deep sleep.

"Hm?"

When she woke up again, she could hear the birds announcing dawn from outside the training hall.

As her broken memories connected and her vision regained its place, Ozent was nowhere to be seen.

"Wow."

Her head turned, and there was Ozent, who had moved ten steps during the night, standing upright with his legs together.

"Brother."

She thought he was just standing, but Ozent was in the process of moving to achieve perfect stillness.

'Stop.'

Since he had never stopped once while taking those ten steps, his acceleration was beyond human measurement range.

'Stop.'

Controlling that with his body was as difficult as feeling the speed of light.

The moment the candle was pressed down from above and the flame went out, Smile gulped.

Perfect stillness.

Her brain couldn't analyze it, but her eyes were definitely seeing it.

"Smile."

Ozent turned his head.

"What's wrong?"

Smile, who had been wearing a dazed expression, came to her senses and stood up.

"Ah, I had something to talk to you about, brother."

He knew what she wanted to say, what kind of story she wanted to hear.

"It's morning now. Let's do it next time."

His own appearance, unable to let Smile go yet unable to hold onto her, was simply pathetic.

"Fine. But if you won't say it now, promise you'll never say it."

When he turned around, Smile was looking at him with angry eyes, unlike usual.

"You have something to say to me, right? The people from the Mountain Clan will come soon. If not now, you might regret it for life."

Probably so.

"I don't understand why you've been treating me coldly lately. It's definitely been since the marriage arrangement with the Mountain Clan was made."

"Smile, I..."

"Do you hate that I'm getting married?"

His heart sank.

"That can't be. The River Clan and Mountain Clan have lived cooperatively for generations. This is an important marriage."

"I'm talking about you as my brother right now. You have a lot of complaints about this wedding. Shall I guess?"

Ozent's face turned pale.

"Brother, by any chance..."

At that moment when he was so nervous his mind was going blank, Smile put her hand on her hip and said:

"Are you upset because you'll have no one to play with when I get married?"

"What?"

Cold sweat dried coldly.

"Brother, you lack social skills and have no friends. That's why you're upset about me leaving."

What replaced the vanished tension was disappointment.

'What was I expecting?'

Had he thought some devastating blow would come that would topple the precarious balance?

"It's not like that."

Just as words were about to burst out along with his rough breathing, Damian opened the training hall door.

"So you were here."

Ozent felt like he had committed a crime.

"Huh? Dad? You're up already?"

Damian, who had been looking at the siblings with complex emotions, sighed and turned around.

"The Mountain Clan people will arrive. We need to hold the pre-wedding ceremony, so come home quickly."

Smile, who had been watching Damian walk away, turned to look at Ozent and waited for a moment.

Her eyes said to speak quickly if he had something to say, but Ozent, who had heard Damian's sigh, just kept his mouth tightly shut.

"I'm going in."

After Smile left, Ozent closed the training hall door and shut his eyes tightly.

'Slowly. More slowly.'

If he became the best, if there was nowhere higher to climb, it seemed like miraculously Smile would understand his heart.

'Let's get stronger. That's all I need to do.'

It was the only way Ozent could fight against the world.

The Mountain Clan came to visit.

While there was no hierarchy among the clans, it was traditional protocol to stay for seven days at the bride's place to strengthen harmony. Since there were frequent exchanges of goods between river and mountain, most were acquainted.

However, Ozent, who had always been buried in the mountains training, was seeing Smile's fianc√© Leard for the first time.

A large build with a handsome face.

His hearty laughter with people he was meeting for the first time was typical of the Mountain Clan.

'Tch, what's so great about a guy like that?'

If he had been completely terrible, nothing would have come to mind, but Ozent attributed everything to political reasons.

'Smile is being sacrificed.'

Smile, with her calm and vast heart like the ocean, never wavers no matter what great events occur.

That was something Ozent could never possess, and perhaps he was in awe of her.

'This marriage is ridiculous.'

Seeing Smile smiling while talking with Leard made his insides twist even more.

"By the way, where is her brother?"

Leard, who had been looking around, discovered Ozent frowning and approached him.

"So you're Smile's brother I've only heard about. Nice to meet you. I'm Leard of the Mountain Clan."

He wanted to strike away the extended hand, but he couldn't deviate even one step in front of the watching clan.

"Nice to meet you."

"I heard you're the greatest warrior. When you have time, shall we test our skills against each other?"

Ozent replied coldly.

"That's unlikely to happen. I'm planning to travel far soon."

"Travel? Don't tell me you're going to Purgatory?"

"Excuse me first."

Leard looked at the River Clan with a blank expression, but they didn't seem to care at all.

"What? He's supposed to be her brother."

Leard defined Ozent like this:

"He's a total loser, isn't he?"

Except for Smile's black-haired brother being cold, the pre-wedding ceremony was warm and friendly.

With abundant food from mountain and river and continuous rounds of drinks, everyone was pleasantly drunk by early evening.

"Hahaha! So I took down three Mountain Kings at the same time!"

As the father sending away his daughter, Damian actively supported Leard's heroic tales.

"That's quite impressive. Truly worthy of the Mountain Clan's strongest warrior."

"That's true, but..."

Leard, who had gulped down a bowl full of alcohol, turned his gaze to Ozent sitting at the far end.

Whether he was listening or not, he just sat there pouting like a sulking woman, staring only at the ground.

'What an unpleasant personality. Well, he's not even a real son...'

If he was going to leave for Purgatory anyway, it might be fun to teach him what true manliness was about.

"Have you ever caught a Mountain King, brother?"

When Ozent didn't answer, Smile intervened.

"My brother is really strong. He's a genius. Just a few days ago, he even cut down dozens of Water Lords."

"Puhahaha! Miss Smile, you're praising your brother too much? It's impossible to catch dozens of Water Lords in the water."

No human could do such a thing.

"It's true. Brother, right? Remember when you showed me while we were swimming? That technique of flying in the sky."

"Flying in the sky?"

Since no one had reached that level, not only the Mountain Clan but even the River Clan paid attention.

"Is there such a technique?"

Ozent couldn't help but answer.

"What would you do if you knew?"

But it was still a cold reply, and the atmosphere rapidly sank.

"Brother, what's gotten into you since earlier..."

Leard raised his head and burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! I'm going to have a fearsome brother-in-law. Well, it's still better than a loser."

"Loser?"

Ozent glared with wide eyes, but Leard slipped away like a snake.

"That's how it is. Anyway, if you have such a wonderful technique, how about teaching it to me too?"

Without even waiting for an answer, Leard stood up from his seat, grabbed his wooden sword, and walked to the open space.

"Surely the brave River Clan wouldn't run away?"

Having driven a wedge into the clan's pride, Ozent finally realized his mistake.

'Damn it.'

As he grabbed his wooden sword and slowly stood up, Damian put down his drink and said:

"Ozent, come see me for a moment."

While everyone was waiting for the match of the century, Damian, who had gone into the shadows, said:

"He's the person who will spend his entire life with Smile."

"I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize directly and make it as if nothing happened."

"Just don't kill him."

"Pardon?"

When Ozent looked up, doubting his ears, Damian patted his shoulder.

"You can beat him up all you want. Until your anger is resolved, until there's nothing left in your heart."

It was the only consideration he could give his son.
