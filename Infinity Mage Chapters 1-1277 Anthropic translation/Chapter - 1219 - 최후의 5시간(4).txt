The Final 5 Hours (4)

The corrupt merchant asked.

"What's this? You're saying you'll try?"

"Of course. I'd rather go to prison than give points to trash like you."

They were flabbergasted.

"Kid, you don't seem to understand - do you know what happens when you go to prison?"

Though he didn't hear the details clearly, just looking at Curtis's condition was enough to imagine.

Nade smiled.

"Perfect. I was curious what kind of place it was. Not confident? Then stop whining and get lost."

"Hah."

The corrupt merchants' eyes changed.

"Acting tough because we're being nice? Want me to tell you one more thing? Even if we become worthless, we can still attack you. The higher the points, the more cruel crimes we can commit. I'll leave it to your imagination how far we can go."

"Try it. If you're confident."

When Nade raised his right hand and generated lightning, the corrupt merchants flinched back.

"M-mage?"

"That's right. Scum who wouldn't even be worth a punch in reality. Do you understand the situation now?"

After being stunned for a moment, they burst into laughter.

"Kahahaha! This guy's a complete newbie! Do you know where you are? This is Melkidu, man."

"So what?"

Attacks between users are impossible.

"Never mind."

The leader raised his hand and stepped forward.

"Alright, I acknowledge it. We definitely take care of our customers too. Let's do this. Ten million points. That's final."

Of course, his true intentions were different.

'A mage?'

The being who had sent him to prison day and night in reality.

'I see. He was planning to escape with teleportation. But you've met your match today.'

The distance narrowed a bit more.

"Fine, I lost. Then let's go lower than ten million..."

After making him let his guard down like that, he suddenly twisted his body and swung his longsword widely.

Nade leaned back, and a few strands of his bangs were cut by the sharp blade and scattered.

"Kahahaha! Got it! You're now bankrupt..."

Warning. System hostile act detected. Security forces are tracking the Brika team.

Even after hearing the message transmitted to all accomplices, they couldn't understand the situation.

"What? What does this mean?"

The next moment, armored security forces from all directions of the capital began converging on them.

"Huh? Huh?"

Even with his confused mind, he was certain they shouldn't stay here.

"Hey! Run!"

But the routes were already blocked, and the guards roughly arrested them.

"Let go! Aaaah! Let me go, you bastards!"

In about a minute, the Brika team was flat on the ground with handcuffs behind their backs.

"Damn it! Are you crazy? We never opposed the system! We attacked a user!"

Instead of answering, the security forces saluted Nade.

"Loyalty! All seven criminals have been arrested."

"Mm, good."

When Nade nodded with his hands behind his back, the Brika team's expressions turned bewildered.

"...Huh?"

Brika shouted.

"You, what kind of trick did you pull? How are you security? You're a user!"

"That's why I told you - get lost if you're not confident."

"You bastard!"

Brika's eyes were bloodshot, but the cold feeling of handcuffs made his heart sink.

'No. Like this, I'll really go to prison.'

They had neither the power to break the handcuffs nor the force to defeat the security forces.

"I'm sorry."

Brika pleaded.

"We were wrong. So please forgive us just once, okay? We'll do whatever you tell us."

"This is Melkidu."

Nade said with a smile.

"Do something about it with points. That's all there is, right?"

As he turned to his friends, the security captain approached and asked.

"What should we do with them?"

Nade made a stern expression and waved his index finger.

"Arrest them immediately!"

"Yes!"

The corrupt merchants being dragged away screamed.

"Let go! You son of a bitch! What crime did I commit? You guys! You're making a big mistake!"

Only Curtis, who had already experienced prison, looked at them with sympathetic eyes.

"How's that? My skills?"

When Nade made a V-sign with his hand, Eden said.

"You... seem to be secretly enjoying this?"

"So what? It's ending today anyway. Those who act up trusting in points need to be taught a lesson."

Curtis asked.

"Is that the item you mentioned earlier? If you have a registration certificate, users can become security too?"

"Yes. Let's get out of here first. I'll explain."

Shirone's group ordered a late lunch at an upscale restaurant where discount coupons applied.

"There are really a lot of people."

The spacious interior was so crowded it was booming.

The hungriest person would be Curtis, but he showed more interest in the items.

"Hmm, if I wear this necklace, I can penetrate physical barriers? Then I could go to the inner track too."

Iruki said.

"That's true, but it's over anyway, right? If we stayed in Melkidu longer, it would be fun."

"...That's true."

Pena asked.

"But even if we persuade the king, Curtis and I aren't accomplices. How do we enter the core?"

Indeed, that was the case.

"Parme allows point trading, so once we persuade them, we redistribute..."

As the discussion continued, a group leaving the restaurant stopped walking.

"Curtis?"

At the man's words, everyone turned their heads.

"Where?"

"That guy's definitely Curtis, right? Why does he look like that? He's not someone who'd get beaten up anywhere."

"That's not the problem. Block from the entrance. Go around the tables and catch him from behind."

As the group moved with trained movements, Curtis held his fork and said.

"How about this? Using this item to enter the castle. We don't have to wait until tomorrow, and we might find some solution there. If we can steal a registration certificate, core access would be possible too."

"Hmm, certainly that's the only way..." The moment a shadow fell over the table, Curtis instinctively turned his head.

"Curtis!"

The moment he saw his opponent, his pupils shook, and the man's fist directly hit his jaw.

"Ugh!"

Warning. System hostile act detected. Security forces are tracking the Ryver team.

"What? What is this..."

Curtis, who had rolled on the floor, flipped the table and charged toward the exit.

The man guarding the door shouted.

"Calm down! It's all over! Ugh!"

When the security forces opened the door and rushed in, the man fell and the restaurant became chaos.

"Don't let him escape! Catch him!"

Those not yet caught by the security forces were driving Curtis to one side.

"Hey, Curtis. It's me, Ryver. Let's talk."

Curtis, who had been looking left and right at the gradually closing encirclement, turned toward the wall.

When he charged with full force, covering his face with both arms and threw his body, he penetrated straight through the wall.

"Huh?"

The guards pressed down on those standing there in dismay from behind.

"Loyalty! Eight criminals arrested." Nade received the salute and approached Ryver.

"Who are you people?"

"Shut up! Do you know what you just did? You let the suspect we caught escape."

"Nonsense. Mr. Curtis is a detective."

"We're detectives too."

While Nade was at a loss for words, Shirone asked.

"If you're fellow detectives, why are you chasing him? Mr. Curtis is solving a cold case."

"Edrina, you mean?"

Ryver frowned and said.

"The prime suspect in that case is Curtis. He's a murder suspect who killed four 27-year-old women."

Pena said.

"I don't trust people. But I have an eye for them. Curtis may be unlucky, but he's not a psycho."

"I know what kind of guy he is too. He's my colleague and friend. But... there's evidence."

Shirone asked.

"Is it true that Curtis's daughter is among the four?"

"Yes."

"How did she die?"

"She was hanged."

"Then that's suicide..."

"That's why it's a cold case. Ryver and Curtis discovered Edrina in the basement storage of a villa. The rope tied to the ceiling pipeline had broken, and she had fallen to the floor."

Nade asked.

"That's suicide, isn't it?"

"The problem is, she couldn't have died like that alone. The ceiling height was 4 meters. There were no objects in the storage to step on and climb up, and it wasn't structured to climb the walls. The iron door had a manual lock and was locked from the inside. Did she fly through the air? No, Edrina was an ordinary person. She wasn't a mage."

It was truly strange.

"We can only see it as someone hanging her. The broken rope seemed like it might be a clue, but we couldn't find anything special about it in the end. Actually, it's not uncommon. The struggling right before death is truly tremendous, so if the tension is weak, it can break easily."

Ryver continued.

"Most importantly, there were three other deaths besides her. We were tracking the culprit, treating it as murder, when one day a letter arrived for us. A letter from dead Edrina."

"You deferred the delivery date."

"Right. She sent it before dying. It went through the international postal service. It traveled around the world before arriving."

"What did it say?"

"Just one sentence. 'It's not daddy's fault.'" "You understand? This isn't a cold case. Curtis definitely knows something. But before we could grasp the circumstances, he disappeared. And... he came to Melkidu."

Iruki, who had grasped the situation to some extent, asked.

"What will you do, Shirone?"

"Let's find Mr. Curtis first. He'll tell us. If we have to go to the core."

Nade gave instructions.

"Arrest them for now. Don't send them to prison."

"Yes!"

When the security forces took the Ryver team away, Shirone's group also left the restaurant.

Pena looked around.

"Where did he go? If he uses the quick recovery pass necklace, tracking is impossible."

"It's okay. There's only one place he can go anyway."

Eden turned her head.

"The castle."

Shirone said.

"Mr. Curtis probably guesses that we'll hear the truth from the detectives. Since he can't be with us, he'll try to enter the core alone."

"Is he really the culprit?"

Shirone didn't make a definitive judgment.

"Let's go to the castle first. The event opens tomorrow. Entering now could constitute system destruction. Don't be careless just because you have a security registration certificate."

The group that infiltrated the castle arrived at the Grand Hall through the quick recovery pass necklace and flight magic.

Curtis was kneeling, captured by knights.

"Mr. Curtis!"

The king turned his head.

"Hehe, to think the kingdom's laws would crumble like this. So, are you also villains threatening the king?"

'Nothing to lose.'

Shirone stepped forward.

"I am Shirone. I came to find Your Majesty because I want to go to Melkidu's core."

Since it wasn't yet time for the event to occur, the king probably couldn't read the recommendation letter.

"Hmm, Shirone..."

But perhaps because of that, the king showed interest in a different sense and raised the corners of his mouth.

"What business does the Compassion of the Age have in a murderer's sanctuary?"

"Huh?"

"To meet Yahweh here. Well, if this too is fate, then it's fate."

Shirone's expression turned cold.

"Who are you?"

Not a non-player character.

"Well. Wouldn't it be better to see directly rather than explain?"

Strange noise overlapped on the king's face, and his appearance began to change gradually.

A black-haired man, in his 40s but with a mischievous, beautiful appearance.

"Nice to meet you, Shirone."

Shirone's eyes, realizing through Omega, widened.

"Cain."

Humanity's first murderer.
