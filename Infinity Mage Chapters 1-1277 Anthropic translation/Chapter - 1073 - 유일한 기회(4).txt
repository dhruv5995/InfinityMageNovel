The Only Chance (4)

Ascension, the Western Nation's guild ranking number 1.

On the top floor of a 23-story building, seven guild members were preparing for a raid.

All of them were rankers.

"Is everyone here?"

A thick door like a hangar opened, and Operator walked across the vast runway that stretched out before them.

Yokai said:

"Eight members total. This is our first time taking on Arachne with this composition, but we need to push hard. The Solar War is coming soon."

Having chosen a monstrous form, he wore a cloak over his shield-like, flattened diamond-shaped face.

"Right."

As Operator walked with cat-like steps, the long sword on her back swayed left and right.

'So it's Yahweh 2.'

She had checked the hit news on the general bulletin board.

'I absolutely won't lose!'

The moment she clenched both fists, the high gear's cycle rapidly surged and the machine vibrated.

Full mobilization stance.

High gear, level 487.

With tremendous output transmitted, her machine shot forward like a cannon.

Leaping at speeds exceeding Mach, she passed through the entire city and landed in the wasteland.

The sprint began again, and users in the Western Nation turned their heads at the sonic boom.

"What's that? What machine is that fast?"

"Idiot, that's the Ascension guild. Operator, Little Witch, Yokai, Great Heavenly Emperor... they're all rankers."

Operator's AI showed the blue sea.

Switching to ultra-high-speed mode.

Rocket engines protruded from her deeply carved back and expelled tremendous pressure.

Four minutes later, the raid location of Skull Island was spotted by the guild members.

'Trap section.'

Lights turned on in the island's control tower, and a massive red laser net came rushing in.

Trap level: 467.

Though the AI could handle evasion, she shut off the function and entrusted herself to her senses.

Screech! Screech! Screech!

As the laser net barely grazed Operator, guild members whistled.

"Her combat sense really is the best."

Only after the trap section ended did Little Witch accelerate to catch up with Operator.

"What's wrong? You usually trust the system. If you left it to the AI, you'd save power too."

"...I don't like feeling my senses getting dull."

"Hmm."

She answered, but it wasn't the complete truth.

"Yahweh."

Operator spoke again.

"What kind of person is he? In reality, I mean."

"Surprising. You're actually saying the word 'reality.' Does it bother you that much? You're going to win anyway."

"A video was posted on the bulletin board. That guy supposedly bypassed space by riding the designer's code. Is that even possible?"

Little Witch seemed to be smiling.

"I wouldn't know. I'm just a regular user. What I can tell you is that in reality, there are people who can do that even more easily. He's the strongest magician in human history."

Operator replayed the video again.

'He defeated an enemy with a level difference of over 50. Of course, he was equipped with Grim Reaper, but...'

Since they had similar durability, penetration would have been possible.

'Conversely, it was a situation where he absolutely couldn't win with energy beams. Setting aside special abilities, he's a human with overwhelmingly more combat experience.'

Operator muttered:

"Even so, this is my world."

At that moment, the island shook greatly and a super-massive machine emerged through the forest.

"GRAAAHHH!"

Boss creature Arachne.

As the level 588 super-massive weapon appeared, the AI transmitted the creature's information.

â—†Durability: 78,000,000/78,000,000.

The hundreds-of-thousands-of-tons machine resembling a spider opened 8,000 gun ports to greet her.

"Everyone standby. I'll signal."

Flying alone, she saw 20,000 bullets that blackened the landscape.

Bullet hell level: 499.

It was beyond what could be left to AI.

'I won't lose.'

After breaking through the bullet hell with acrobatic flight and arriving at the island, small creatures pounced on her.

Though small in size, the speed from their average level of 500 couldn't be ignored.

"Haaah!"

Operator twisted her body.

Each time she changed direction as if torturing inertia, the machine seemed to scream in agony.

'Closer, get closer!'

The moment she made an emergency stop, 27 tons of load pressed on just her right knee and a warning message appeared.

"Machine durability instability detected."

Sliding while carving into the ground, Operator twisted her body just before the limit to distribute the force.

Little Witch made a bitter smile.

'A monster is a monster.'

With extreme combat nerves, Operator analyzed all the creatures' attack patterns.

'Shirone feels, but Operator calculates.'

Who is superior?

While sliding backward, Operator grabbed the ground with her left hand and braked.

Sparks flew from her fingers repeatedly.

Having reduced speed at close range to Arachne, she gripped the handle of the tachi Black Blade on her back.

'Physical attack from here.'

As Arachne raised its leg, a massive shadow fell over her.

"Collapse (Magnetic Force)."

A level 480 selective option that could currently only be activated with Black Blade.

'This timing is the only chance.'

The blade pierced the ground, and a black magnetic field swelled up in the form of a massive sphere.

"KRAAAHHH!"

Caught in the magnetic field, Arachne writhed, twisting hundreds of thousands of joints.

Grrrrrumble!

Finally, four legs were forcibly bent and the massive body was slammed into the ground.

Seven guild members launched simultaneous attacks.

"Let's make this flashy!"

A sun-like flash erupted over the island, and seawater was pushed away like castle walls.

That evening.

Atogram was packed with users who had flocked from all over the continent.

Their only interest was whether Yahweh 2's party would actually replace their Grim Reapers.

Reporters were stationed in front of the Amara shop, which was naturally expected to be chosen at level 70.

"This is RubyRuby, a user from the Eastern Nation. You've probably already seen many videos, but the burning question is whether Yahweh 2's party has actually reached level 70. As a personal reporter, I'll try to interview them."

The voices of users saying the same thing mixed together, making it noisier than a marketplace.

One man silenced their chatter.

"There, there they come!"

Yahweh 2's party, equipped with Grim Reapers, was entering the shopping district with quick steps.

Death Princess whined:

"Ah, this is hard. I'm tired."

"We're still far from done. We need to hit level 80 by dawn to make our promised time."

Then reporters gathered around them.

"Hello! This is RubyRuby! What's your current level? And why are you doing this? Is this a secret project of the Golden Ring?"

"Get out of the way! We're busy!"

Destruction God 707 pushed past RubyRuby, but the reporters followed like a tail.

"Just one word! Is this for the record?"

Ignoring the barrage of questions, the shop they entered wasn't Amara but Suicide Inc.

Death Princess asked:

"Aren't we switching to Amara?"

"Amara is best for hunting level 70 creatures at level 70. But now I'm raising the difficulty. We're going to level 100 hunting grounds, so speed is life. Most importantly..."

Destruction God 707 turned his head.

"Yahweh 2 has different abilities than us. If we just keep up with the output, he'll hunt level 100 creatures quickly too."

"Ah."

When they placed their order with the branch manager, goods were quickly moved and the party immediately replaced their parts.

With clear sounds, the Grim Reaper parts rolled around them.

A moment of silence fell.

'Should I throw that away too? They will, right?'

The parts were in a different league from the White Blade set - even intermediate users would covet them.

True to a company focused on speed, Suicide's part designs were sharp and cold.

They were also specialized for cold weapons, making them machines whose performance depended on the user's abilities.

'What a waste.'

For that reason, Destruction God 707 felt regret.

"Hey, should we keep the Grim Reaper? It's really top quality. If we leave it here..."

Users would swarm like bees.

"Let's just go. We'd have to go to another storage company. Anyway, we have credit cards, so we can buy them again later."

"That's true, but..."

The problem was the gazes of users waiting for Yahweh 2's party to leave.

"Right! Let's go, go!"

As soon as Shirone's party left after making their decision, the inside of the shop became noisy.

"Tsk! They're really excited."

Shirone comforted Destruction God 707.

"I feel bad about it too. But we can't solve problems without giving up anything. Every task has risks, so let's stick to our purpose."

"Hmph! Easy to say. When I look at you, you sound just like Bart. You really are alike."

"Bart?"

"My personal magic tutor. He doesn't teach me anything but makes boring comments every day."

Death Princess became interested.

"Huh? You're learning magic?"

"Learning my ass. Spirit Zone or whatever - no matter how much I try, I can't get the hang of it."

"Haha! Me too. My dad made me do it, but when I concentrated, I just got sleepy."

Shirone made a hollow expression.

'I thought they wouldn't be ordinary kids since they're good enough for Under Coder, but Bart as a private tutor...'

If it was Brian Bart, he was a first-class grand magician.

"Well, can't help what's happened. Let's just level up quickly. Suicide's main weapons are cold weapons. You have to stab through gaps in armor, and durability is weak, so be careful."

"Hmm, I see."

Upon entering the level 100 hunting ground, unlike before, medium-sized creatures were visible.

"Kiiieeeee!"

Looking at enemies charging with quadrupedal locomotion, Shirone raised one corner of his mouth.

'I can see them.'

Shirone's machine flowed like water between the fierce creatures, cutting down enemies.

The promised two days had passed.

"Huff! Huff!"

As they arrived in Atogram gasping for breath, users applauded and welcomed them.

"Level 100 in 48 hours! This is a record!"

Destruction God 707 collapsed to the ground.

"We did it. We really did it."

Just as he was feeling thrilled by results even he couldn't believe, Aegis approached.

"Congratulations. I was waiting for you."

"It's Aegis! Film this! Film this!"

Reporters swarmed over, but the moment they got close, each made a disgusted expression.

"Ugh!"

Radio interference - one of the few selective options that could be implemented in the city.

"I'm sorry. I'll exercise my right to refuse filming not approved by the operator."

Aegis, who made the polite announcement, bowed his head to Shirone.

"Let's go."

Arriving at the northern slums, she entered a tavern much shabbier than before.

A Golden Ring member was sitting there, and the bartender opened the door to a deep corridor.

Sensing the unusual atmosphere, Shirone asked:

"Is this the real beginning?"

"That's right. The boss will explain the details. Oh, and... there's one more guest."

"Guest?"

"Please go in."

Opening the iron door at the end of the corridor, Volga's son, sitting on the bed, raised his hand.

"Congratulations. Level 100 in two days. Precise."

Since they weren't close enough to shake hands, Shirone just raised an eyebrow and entered the room.

"Huh?"

There was an unfamiliar user at the tea table.

'Is this person that guest?'

Short legs floated above the chair, and both hands supported weight between the legs.

It was a face whose expression couldn't be read.

"Hello? It's been a while."

"Do you... know me?"

Shirone checked with the search function, but information was limited as they seemed to be a Western Nation user.

The user's code name was Little Witch.
