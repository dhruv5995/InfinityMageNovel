City of Magical Engineering (5)

Three thousand troops responsible for Raviet's security searched the city thoroughly.

"Damn it! Where the hell is she?" Even the security system operated by hidden codes couldn't detect Son Yu-jeong's location.

"Third squad, into the buildings! Kill on sight!"

As the security forces passed by, a human figure bulged out from a wall made of mucus.

"How brutal."

Among Son Yu-jeong's techniques was the ability to temporarily assimilate with objects.

The 'String' mechanism that changed laws through hair vibrations was a subset of Hexa.

"I can't hide forever. I need to either storm the Grand Duke's castle or find another way."

Richera, hanging from her waist, spoke up.

"You can stay hidden for 3 minutes, right? Can't you just keep plucking hair as you go?"

Son Yu-jeong looked down, grabbed Richera's head, and shoved it straight into the mucus wall.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

After making her unable to breathe for about a minute before pulling her out, the face with only a neck left looked pitiful.

"Why, why did you do that?"

"Just casually talking about someone else's hair? I absolutely refuse to become a bald monkey."

Actually, Richera's strategy was useful.

Still, the reason she couldn't readily go to the Grand Duke was because of the Gingoa around her neck.

'If I can dismantle the Gingoa, that means I could also activate it. If that happens...'

Just imagining it was horrifying.

'Absolutely not! I'd rather bite my tongue and die than be worked like a slave for life! Maybe I should just go back? There's probably no one in this hell who can use this thing anyway.'

Richera stared blankly at Son Yu-jeong, whose expression was changing in real time, and said:

"Decide quickly. Are you going or not? I don't want to get caught and become part of a wall for nothing."

Seeing humans embedded alive in Raviet's buildings made her desire for purification even stronger.

"I'm thinking, so shut up. Before I embed you in a wall right now."

As Richera closed her mouth, black shadows were rapidly engulfing the city.

Raviet Military Barracks.

"What? You still haven't found her?" A red demon sitting back in his chair let out a languid yawn.

Special Task Force Captain Croseid.

He had long horns like a sheep, and his skin bore the spiral patterns that symbolized the demon race.

"Hurry up already. Once you find her, I'll go finish her off immediately."

Execution Captain Itaka remained silent.

'Almost conquered.'

Centered around her sitting with fingers interlaced on the desk, black hair spread out like water.

'Black Miscarriage.'

Itaka's hair stretched enough to fill the city, each strand a delicate nerve.

"Northwest."

As she concentrated her nerves there, her eyelids trembled and Son Yu-jeong's location was pinpointed.

"Magol Street, Block 13 alley. Not fast. Moving at 23 kilometers per hour."

"How leisurely."

Croseid got down from his chair and bent his knees.

"I'll go cut off her head right now."

"Don't let your guard down."

Croseid's thighs swelled like balloons, generating explosive kinetic energy.

"Hmph! Just time me."

The moment he finished speaking, Croseid shot up into the sky with a bang.

Around the closed-eyed Itaka, black hair writhed like living creatures.

With Black Miscarriage taking control of the entire city, there was nowhere left to hide.

"What's this black stuff? It's really creepy."

"It might be the demons' tracking ability. How about using your stealth ability now?"

"At this rate, when will we ever..."

Son Yu-jeong stopped mid-sentence, her eyes widening as she twisted her upper body at tremendous speed.

The ground exploded with a bang.

"Oh, you dodged?" As Croseid appeared from the smoke, Son Yu-jeong drew two staffs.

The next moment, security forces arrived.

"There! Oh, Lord Croseid?"

Confirming that one of the Seven Generals was present, they spread out in all directions to block escape routes.

Croseid extended his index and middle fingers.

"Choose one of two options. Die from my beating here, or get beaten after you're dead."

Such things were possible in hell.

The Golden Eyes of Fire lit up in Son Yu-jeong's eyes, and her hands gripping the staffs made cracking sounds.

"A half-wit monster like you."

"Kekeke."

Croseid kicked off the ground with his shoulders shaking, and simultaneously Son Yu-jeong vanished.

A thunderous roar shook the city.

In front of the Grand Duke's castle, Lete turned her head.

"What was that?"

Armored Knight Gimara also sensed the ominous impact contained in the sound.

"It seems they've found the intruder. Croseid must have deployed, so don't worry."

"Really?"

Since he was the strongest among the Seven Generals in pure force, Lete didn't worry and opened the door.

All the demons working in the castle came out to greet them, but the Grand Duke was nowhere to be seen.

Of course, Magrit was an elder among elders who could have a drink with anyone in hell, but...

'There's definitely something going on.'

Ignoring even the president of the Flame Corporation was unusual.

"Where is the Grand Duke?"

Only Butler Bielman answered.

"He's in the laboratory. You know how it is - once he goes in, there's no telling when he'll come out."

"That's why I came personally. This is really important business. Could you guide me to the laboratory?"

"I haven't received such orders."

At this unexpected response, the demons working in the castle exchanged surprised glances.

"Bielman."

Killing intent flashed in Lete's eyes.

"Yes, President."

"Aren't you mistaken about something? Just because I treat you well, does it seem like the Grand Duke is on my level?"

"Who would dare ignore the Mother of Hell? However, I'm simply stating facts."

He was prepared for annihilation through his conviction, meaning the Grand Duke felt the same way about passing responsibility.

"Hah."

Lete's eyebrows curved into a frown.

"What's wrong with you, really? Are we enemies or something? Huh? Mr. Bielman, it's me, Lete. Why are you being so serious?"

"...I'm sorry."

From Bielman's appearance - looking down with not even the slightest movement - Lete had an intuition.

"Yahweh. You're here right now, aren't you? And Ryan too. Hasn't anyone seen them? At least the gatekeeper should know, right?"

As she looked around, the demons froze and gulped nervously.

There weren't many in hell who could deceive the Flame Corporation's president with just their eyes.

Yet Bielman remained calm, and Lete couldn't find lies in the demons' eyes.

'Yahweh really isn't here? No, that can't be. They've already made their move.'

Bielman's gaze sank coldly.

'I'm sorry, Lady Lete.'

Not a single demon in the castle where Magrit stayed knew of Shirone's whereabouts.

'I serve the Grand Duke.'

Because Bielman had killed them all.

'Such is the gravity of the situation. Before a matter where hell's fate hangs in the balance, no mistakes can be tolerated.'

Lete was frustrated and angry.

"Move aside."

It wasn't anger at insubordination, but disappointment about the years they had respected each other.

"If it's going to be like this, I don't need to be polite anymore either. I need to meet the Grand Duke."

Even seeing Lete approaching head-on deliberately, Bielman didn't move an inch.

"I said move. That's an order."

"You should know where the laboratory is. Is there really a need to take the long way around?"

"No, I refuse. You move aside." Lete spoke to someone behind her.

"Gimara."

With a clinking sound, Gimara bowed his head.

"Yes, Lady Lete."

"When a mere butler disobeys the Flame Corporation president's command, what does hell's law dictate?"

"...His head should be severed." Gimara was also the Grand Duke's loyal retainer; his voice carried a strained feeling.

'What's happening right now? Why is Mr. Bielman having a meaningless conflict with Lady Lete?'

When even the Grand Duke's Seven Generals didn't know what was happening, his judgment was...

Lete said:

"Last chance. Move aside."

Bielman gave no answer, and what remained was for Gimara's sword to strike his neck.

10 seconds.

That was the only time Lete would wait, recalling memories spanning eons.

Gimara made his choice.

'I am the Grand Duke's knight.'

Ten seconds passed fleeting, and Lete turned around coldly, grinding her teeth.

"Foolish things!"

Bielman followed with his gaze her retreating figure as she strode toward the laboratory.

Gimara didn't ask.

'If the Grand Duke wishes it... Gimara will ask nothing.'

A small succubus keeping watch on the middle floor, Mercedes, rushed in urgently.

"The Flame Corporation's president is coming."

Though it was bad news, Magrit's response, having anticipated this situation, was calm and swift.

"So it's come to this after all. This is a mountain we must cross eventually. For now, Yahweh, come this way."

When he tore up the laboratory floor, a deep hole that looked like intestines was writhing.

"Please hide for a moment. I don't know how long Lady Lete will stay, but I'll send word separately."

The hole was narrow and damp, but since Shirone had shrunk in his demon form, it seemed like it would fit.

"Wait. That's fine for me, but what about Ryan? The person Lete is looking for is actually Ryan."

"That's exactly why he needs to stay here. Those bound by Karma Chain are under the Flame Corporation's surveillance. In this city, the only place that can disrupt the Flame Corporation's hidden codes is here in the laboratory. Of course, this is also illegal, but the moment you go outside, you'll be trapped with no escape." Ryan said:

"Right, Shirone. You don't need to worry about me. It's an enemy I'll have to face eventually anyway."

"Got it. Then... be careful."

Mercedes said:

"Quickly, quickly! She's coming down now."

As Shirone entered the hole, the intestines repeated contractions and relaxations, rapidly lowering him down.

Magrit concealed the hole and opened the storage door, revealing all kinds of corpses piled like mountains.

"You go in here. It should mask the smell of living flesh. You absolutely must not make any sign of your presence."

Though it was a horrifying scene to behold, Ryan calmly burrowed between the corpses.

The storage door closed, and the laboratory door opened.

"Grand Duke."

As Lete turned the corner, she saw Magrit with his head buried in design blueprints.

"Oh? Isn't that Lady Lete? What brings you to such a humble place without notice?"

She didn't even listen with half an ear.

In the settling silence, her gaze began meticulously scanning the laboratory's scene.

The security forces were in a dazed state.

"This, this can't be..."

The physically strongest among demons, an evil demon who was also one of the Seven Generals, Croseid had been miserably defeated.

"Groooan..."

Croseid, with all the horns on his forehead broken, raised his head toward Son Yu-jeong.

"You bastard, how dare you do this to me..."

Son Yu-jeong, burning like the sun, approached while exhaling fierce smoke from her mouth.

"Are you done now? Acting tough when you're nothing special."

The entire block of Magol Street was devastated, and the encirclement's radius reached 500 meters.

"Don't think it's over. Every demon in hell will chase you. We'll tear you limb from limb. We'll rip out your guts while you're alive and stuff them in your mouth!"

Son Yu-jeong raised her staff.

"Yeah, yeah, if I lose I'll do whatever, right?"

"Kahaha! Foolish human! I can clearly see the hell that will unfold before you! Kahaha...!"

A bang sounded.

As Croseid's face was crushed in one blow, the security forces' eyes filled with tension.

"What?!"

Before the veteran's defeat, the already ferocious nature of the demons fully awakened.

"Graaaah!"

Richera's face went pale.

"We're finished! They won't stop until hell disappears."

Son Yu-jeong plucked her hair and laughed.

"Haha! That sounds fun too. I heard our great-great-grandfather almost destroyed the heavenly realm."

Her hair glowed and writhed.

"The Magic of Infinite Transformations."

Simultaneously, thousands of Son Yu-jeongs were born in the sky and began scattering in all directions.

"Kyahahaha! Try your best to catch me!"

The monkey's frivolous laughter echoed throughout the entire city.
