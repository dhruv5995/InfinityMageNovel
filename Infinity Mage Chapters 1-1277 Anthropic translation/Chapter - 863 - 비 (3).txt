Rain (3)

"The Terraforce existed before humans and achieved a civilization far superior to theirs."

As the Chief Justice walked around the Great Earth Temple, Taesung followed him with his gaze.

"They endlessly explored the essence of the world. Where is the end, where is the beginning. Whether such things actually exist. The conclusion we reached was..."

The Chief Justice stopped walking and turned to look at Taesung.

"This world is electricity."

It was true, but Taesung could say nothing.

"And we are already using electricity. The hypothesis we can derive from that reflection is..."

The Chief Justice raised his finger.

"Electricity was supplied from somewhere and the universe was born. Just as we supply power to machines."

The Chief Justice clasped his hands behind his back and turned around.

"What was before that? Nothing. Only void. A state where there was no existence, not even a reason to exist."

It's called the off state.

"We pondered. Then why was this world born? For what purpose does it exist?"

They dug endlessly deeper.

"What we discovered was the Akashic Records. The cosmic database, the existence of Ankera."

According to that definition.

"Ankera, who dreams of the universe, cannot criticize itself. Because the moment it realizes it's a dream, it's no longer a dream. Therefore, it thinks it is unique and cannot harbor suspicion that it was created by someone else."

"But it began to doubt."

"That's right. The result of the Gaians breaking through the Akashic Records and escaping the photon system put him in contradiction."

It was an event that cracked Ankera's uniqueness.

"Why was Ankera absorbed by you humans?"

The Chief Justice who posed the question answered it himself.

"Because Gaian blood flows in humans. The fact that Gaia escaped means that this place, which is the end for us, is not the end for humans."

"A world made for humans."

"Or a world made by humans. In fact, humans are gods, and that concept was borrowed into this world."

It was a painful assumption for everyone except humans.

"The Terraforce accepted it. It was surprisingly easy. Rather, it gave us a new role when everything had become meaningless after passing the technological singularity."

Though this too might have already been designed.

"The Terraforce dug into the reason for existence. And reached the conclusion of promoting world stability as judges of the universe. Something like a fault-tolerant system."

Taesung turned his gaze to the screen of the ground.

"Sending the ark to save humans was in the same context."

Now in the Gustav Empire, all life forms except humans had gone extinct.

"Humans have a unique code. Of course it transforms in real time, but the Terraforce's information gathering ability is the best in the universe. As long as they're trapped in the magnetic shield, they'll be safe."

Taesung asked about something he was curious about.

"What about Gai? Why didn't he receive the shield's protection? Was it because he reached Idea?"

The Chief Justice shook his head.

"I said humans have a unique code. That's a temporary code. But Idea is different. A perfect user code that never changes. Among the current survivors, Rian is the only one with that code."

Rian was being protected by the magnetic shield.

"Then what about Gai?"

"The activation condition for the magnetic shield is an inner voice generated by a specific code. Gai..."

The Chief Justice looked up and said.

"Didn't want it."

"Didn't want it means..."

"Well. It's difficult to express emotions in words. It's just that unlike other codes, he no longer had any desire for life. That's all."

"Are you saying... your anger has subsided?"

Shirone, who had been mulling over Gai's words, clenched his fists.

"How could that be? Think about what you did to humans! Countless innocent people died! Sungeum has to wander in hell forever! Why! Why did you lie!"

Even though Gai was dead, Shiok did not appear.

"I met Rian before fighting you."

Shirone's shoulders flinched.

If this situation was reality and not a dream, then Shirone had killed Rian's brother.

"When he was acting childish, I thought he was hopeless, but seeing him today, he really grew up magnificently. He became stronger than me."

"Rian is different from a human like you."

Shirone tried hard to separate Rian and Gai.

"Haha."

Gai acknowledged it with laughter.

A pleased emotion flickered through his eyes as he rested his chin on his hand, lost in thought for a moment.

Rian's retreating figure came to mind.

"...I thought I could do anything to become strong. Right and wrong didn't matter either."

Gai spread both arms as if seeking agreement.

"Honestly, isn't that right? In the end, the winner is right. I thought that if you became truly strong, things like moral conscience and justice didn't matter at all."

It sounded like a will, so Shirone couldn't interrupt.

"Live taking responsibility... I finally understand what Rian meant."

"I can't live like that. The moment I saw what that youngest one was carrying on his shoulders, I was disgusted. How can he live like that?"

That's why he ran away, but there was something he had to tell Shirone.

"Rian is the strong one."

The person who can take responsibility for the most things is the strongest.

"You said you were friends. Please take good care of my younger brother from now on."

"...What are you doing?"

Shirone gritted his teeth.

"What's going to change by saying such things now! Don't suddenly pretend to be family! Do you think I'll forgive you? You're a murderer!"

It had to be a dream.

"What about the dead! What about the lives of those who were sacrificed for no reason! If you die..."

Gai must not die.

"How am I supposed to explain this to Rian!"

Gai smiled brightly.

"No need to explain. Just dump it all on that stupid guy. Tell him to take responsibility himself."

"Is that what you say as an older brother!"

"He's the strong one."

Gai closed his eyes.

"That's what a knight is."

He wanted to become like Rian.

As the light connected to Gai gradually dimmed, Shirone's face turned pale.

"Wait! If it continues like this..."

Finally the light disappeared, and Gai's body became blurry before beginning to be buried in darkness.

Eternal annihilation.

"Nooooo!"

Shirone hastily reached out his hand, but no signal reached his senses.

Rumble rumble rumble.

The black clouds filling the sky began to turn gray, then finally became transparent.

"The rain, the rain..."

When the people hiding in the shield looked up, they could see a massive warship floating in the clear sky.

"Shirone."

Rian immediately swung his great sword toward the dome.

A tremendous roar erupted but the dome didn't break, and the shockwave swirled through the narrow space.

"Graaaah!"

The reason it couldn't be easily destroyed was that the realm of Idea was also a kind of electrical signal.

"Hyaaaah!"

Rian didn't care that his body was being destroyed and continuously swung his sword.

'Shirone! Shirone!'

Rian didn't understand why world-destroying torrential rain had poured down for some reason.

But whenever such phenomena approaching great catastrophe occurred, Shirone was always there.

'Wait!'

Woooooong!

As the great sword vibrated and struck the dome, finally with a tremendous explosion, the magnetic shield shattered.

"The Hexa program has terminated."

The faces of the Terraforce race were not suited for displaying emotions, but the Chief Justice was clearly confused.

"What happened?"

Taesung's eyes widened as he examined the ground.

"Shirone is..."

The Hexa particles shown on screen were gathering densely and reconstructing into Shirone's body.

"Impossible. Once already converted to signal state, it's impossible to regain physical form."

According to Terraforce doctrine, there was no generation code.

"No."

The Chief Justice jerked his head up.

"I see. What Idea is..."

"Shirone has returned!"

Taesung let out a cry of joy, but the Chief Justice's expression was unexpectedly serious.

"Isn't it not over yet?"

"What about the ark?"

"We're withdrawing it. The selection will also be canceled. However, I don't know if this situation is beneficial or harmful."

The Chief Justice's words were quite meaningful, but Taesung turned to the screen and smiled.

"Thank you."

That was all he could say to Shirone, who was awaiting terrible pain.

"Huh?"

As Shirone regained consciousness, what had just happened passed through his mind like dream memories.

"The wound...?"

When he examined his chest, the spot where Gai's sword had pierced through was perfectly healed.

But even more alien than that was the fact that the anger that had been growing without limits had disappeared.

"Where is this?"

As if he had come to a completely different planet, all that entered Shirone's eyes was an endlessly stretching horizon.

"Everything disappeared."

Gai had said.

Do you know what you've done?

"No."

He didn't know what disaster Yahweh's anger had brought to the world, but one thing was certain.

Gai's words were true.

"I, I..."

Shirone, who had collapsed powerlessly to his knees, searched for Gai's body, which hadn't even left a trace.

"This can't be. This can't be..."

So it wasn't a dream?

"I killed them all. People, Rian's brother, all life forms... animals, plants, literally not even a blade of grass remained."

"Shirone!"

At Rian's voice, Shirone's head snapped up.

"Rian...?"

Rian, who had rushed over in an instant, grabbed Shirone's shoulders and examined his body.

"Are you okay? What happened?"

"Rian, you... you're safe."

"The people are safe. Some kind of shield was deployed. It was probably that flying object."

While Shirone looked at the departing warship, Rian briefly explained what had happened.

"A rain of light fell..."

Though he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, since it was a phenomenon he had created, it was horrifying just to imagine.

'I tried to destroy the world.'

Rian patted his shoulder.

"It's okay. Anyway, we're safe. The demons were all wiped out too. Let's go back for now. I need to find my brother."

Shirone's heart sank with a thud.

"My brother was probably protected by the shield too. Tch, he should have listened when I told him to come with us."

"Rian..."

Rian, who hadn't heard Shirone's voice, continued looking around for Gai.

"Did he already run away? Did he get injured or something..."

"Rian!"

Shirone, who couldn't bear to watch Rian worry about his brother, looked up and shouted.

"What's wrong? Your face is pale."

Shirone's mouth opened and closed.

What came to mind in his blank state was self-destructive words.

"I killed him."

"Huh?"

"I said I killed Gai."

Rian's eyes calmly settled.

"I don't know. It feels like I had a dream, but no, it wasn't a dream. It seems like Gai saved me. So I..."

"Shirone."

As Rian approached with a subdued voice, Shirone cried out tearfully.

"Rian! I killed your family...!"

Rian embraced Shirone with his broad shoulders.

"It's okay."

Knowing it was sincere made it even more frightening.

"As long as you're alive, that's enough. No matter who you killed, as long as you're safe, it doesn't matter. I'll take responsibility for everything."

Tears flowed down Shirone's cheeks.

"You're very tired. You fought without rest. Rest a little. After you sleep, you'll feel better."

Rian was a caring child, so there was no way he'd be okay.

'He's saying he'll shoulder even that.'

Shirone's consciousness, who could only lean his very soul on Rian, began to drift away.

At the end, Gai's words suddenly came to mind.

'Whether it's the demon realm or Yahweh's anger...'

The strongest one is Rian.
