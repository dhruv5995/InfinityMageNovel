The Sin That Could Not Connect (4)

A soft light gathered above the unconscious Ikael's head, forming a sphere.

As the holy orb regained its original form, her eyelids mechanically lifted.

'Where is this?'

The first thing that entered her vision was Satiel's tearful face.

"Archangel, are you alright?"

Ikael straightened her upper body as if defying gravity and looked around.

It was Zebulon's chamber.

"What happened?"

"Well..."

Satiel told her about the events that had occurred after Ikael lost consciousness.

"That's how it concluded... The war has been postponed. Kariel isolated the Gaians with the Metagate. It seems fine for now, but..."

Heaven's atmosphere was still tense.

"I see."

"What happened, Archangel? What occurred during the meeting?"

Instead of answering, Ikael fell into thought.

'No one knows yet.'

That Ikael had opened the sanctuary's doors at will, or that she had disobeyed orders to stop the angels.

The lack of reaction from Ankera meant...

'He intends to cover it up.'

The Gaian's cry that she had heard before losing consciousness surfaced from the depths of her memory.

"What god would go back on their own words!"

"Haah."

Ikael touched her forehead at the throbbing sensation in her head.

"I need to meet Ankera."

As she rose from her seat and headed toward the door, Satiel called out.

"Orders have been given for all angels to stand by! No one can approach the sanctuary!"

"It's fine."

Ikael opened the door.

"He will be waiting for me."

Ikael flew up into Zebulon's skies and headed straight for Araboth's spire.

Arriving at the sanctuary, she paused upon seeing the door she had opened by her own will.

Where had such courage come from?

'No, it was my choice.'

While the heart can choose anything, one must also bear responsibility for those choices.

"Ankera, it is Ikael."

When there was no response, she extended her hand toward the door.

Just before her fingertips could touch it, the door slowly receded inward with a creaking sound.

Seeing Ankera pulsating as usual, Ikael took a deep breath.

Gurfin was still caught in Ankera's nerves, and her heart ached again.

"Enter, my daughter."

The moment Ikael stepped forward, the door closed.

Kuuuu kuuuu kuuuu kuuuu!

Though she had heard this sound countless times, now it somehow felt like her retreat was being blocked.

Ikael opened her mouth.

"Why..."

"Do you wish to ask why I have not punished you?"

"Yes. I also want to know exactly what happened during the meeting with Gurfin."

Ankera extended Gurfin's body toward Ikael.

She had to exert her utmost concentration to keep her holy orb from wavering.

"Gurfin made me a proposal. About who has the qualifications to be god. Staking everything we each possess."

Startled, Ikael looked up at Gurfin.

At the sight of his soul-drained face with only light emanating from his pupils, she ultimately could not hide her expression.

"Ikael."

Ankera asked.

"Have I done wrong?"

The moment she heard those words, Ikael felt her mind plummeting to the depths of an abyss.

God does not commit wrongs.

"...Oh Ankera."

"The world simply exists."

It was a majestic voice with none of the eerie sounds she had heard before mixed in.

"There are no good deeds or bad deeds. I simply exist perfectly and maintain that endlessly. Ankera judges solely for the world's sake."

Ikael listened silently.

"My daughter, though everything in this world exists under my justice, you are the most special."

"I know."

"Not simply because you are the first."

Ikael waited for the next words with puzzled eyes.

"When I was unaware of my own existence, an intense light exploded within me. Amplification. That is you. A concept existing at the boundary between non-existence and existence. That is why you are different from other angels."

"Different?"

"At the moment of amplification, the world split in two. The world of non-existence and existence. The reason you are the most pure angel in the universe is because another you took all of your turbid parts."

This was the first time she had heard this story.

"Satan Lucifer. The symmetrical point of law. Born on the same day at the same hour, but an existence of the reverse side who bore eternal darkness in your stead. In a sense, you could call him a twin."

Ikael's holy orb shook greatly.

"He is now..."

"Gone. He purified himself and vanished in the reverse world. Currently, only the concept of Satan remains."

"Why?"

Ankera lifted Gurfin high.

"Lucifer made a deal with Gurfin. Ikael, in exchange for protecting you, he agreed to be purified instead of Gurfin."

"Th-that's... No. That can't be..."

As Ikael shook her head in denial, a very old memory flashed through her mind.

'So that's why he did that to me then?'

There had been a time when he flew over to take a photon cannon aimed at Ikael with his back.

'No.'

Even their first kiss that had awakened her heart.

'That can't be!'

Even the countless moments of communion they had shared while fighting fiercely against the Gaians.

"It wasn't... me."

Tears of light flowed down Ikael's cheeks.

What had she been hoping for?

'How happy I was.'

Even the overwhelming joy she felt when Gurfin said he would remain in Heaven.

"It is merely delusion, Ikael."

Ankera's nerve endings approached and wiped away the tears flowing down her cheeks.

"The heart is nothing but a delusion created by the system. The error called Gurfin was trying to destroy the world. Why did I not punish you?"

Ikael felt Ankera's touch.

"Because there is no need. You were simply infected by the error called Gurfin."

"My God, I..."

"Do not fear. I have defined this world. And you are the beginning that defines that definition, the entirety of my thoughts."

If Ankera was the brain, then Ikael was the thought.

"Yes, I could not devour Hexa. But look. Even now I control Gurfin with my power. Perhaps this is perfection. Isolating with the system the errors that arose because of the system. And now the law is stable once again."

Gurfin's body approached Ikael again.

"My beloved daughter. If I were deceiving you, then I would not be God. But if I am God..."

Ankera declared firmly.

"This is right."

Ankera does not deceive.

Because he is cold.

"The Ultima System will soon be dismantled. I will give you humans. I will create humans who will not fear, will not be confused, who will only praise you."

"Huk... huk..."

Ikael's shoulders shook ceaselessly as she knelt with her head buried on the ground.

Satiel, who had been waiting for Ikael to return to Zebulon, spotted her and flew over quickly.

"Archangel!"

Though startled by Ikael's vacant expression, her concern for Gurfin was greater.

"Did you meet Ankera? Why did this happen? What became of Gurfin?"

The moment she heard Gurfin's name, Ikael's face contorted with rage.

"Do not speak that one's name in front of me."

"What?"

"He bared his fangs at Ankera under the pretense of a meeting. He's a fraud, nothing more and nothing less."

There was no lie in Ikael's words.

'And he humiliated me as well.'

If he had intended a life-or-death confrontation with Ankera, he hadn't even hinted at it to her.

'He used me. In his heart, there was never anything like me from the beginning.'

"But Archangel, Gurfin is..."

"Satiel."

Seeing Ikael's terrifying gaze, Satiel unconsciously closed her mouth.

"Don't make me say it twice."

As Ikael headed to her chamber, Satiel slowly cleared the way.

"Let no one approach Araboth's sanctuary. This is an order as your Archangel."

Ankera instructed the angels to find a way to dismantle the Ultima System.

Kariel found the answer.

"The Art of Unification. We integrate the Gaians. After the minor purification, there's more than enough Black Elixir. It's just difficult to extract. But if we send angels, there should be no problem."

Uriel asked.

"Integration? Wouldn't that make the enemy even stronger?"

"How simple-minded. The core of the Ultima System lies in diverse individualities pursuing one righteousness. We haven't been able to destroy that one thing so far. So we collapse the diverse individualities instead."

Satiel slammed the white council table and stood up.

"I oppose this! We cannot annihilate the Gaians when we don't even know whether Gurfin is alive or dead! All procedures should only proceed when the full truth is transparently revealed!"

"There's no need to worry about that. The giant created by the Art of Unification can be separated back into humans. This is the only way to remove the Ultima System."

"How is that different from murder?"

"You don't understand. It's not murder. Humanity will prosper more than before. Under our control."

Unable to contain herself, Satiel turned to Ikael.

"Archangel! Please say something!"

Though the angels' gazes focused on Ikael, no answer came.

She simply stared ahead with a vacant expression, a sight that had become familiar in the white council.

Though a long time had passed since the meeting, her condition had not improved at all.

"...Let's end here for today."

This too was a familiar phrase.

"Haah."

Ikael lay in bed and tossed and turned all night.

'Why am I like this? Everything is over. The world is stable and I am the Archangel.'

Though she had thought she would adapt with time, her anguish only grew each night.

'He used me! Liar!'

Even as rage surged and her teeth chattered.

'Is that really true?'

She found herself wondering if there might have been other reasons.

'All of it was lies? Everything?'

Having known each other for such a long time, even an angel's reason could not believe it.

"Gurfin..."

The moment she spoke his name aloud, a wave of emotion crashed over her.

"Huuk!"

Groaning as she sat up, Ikael flew toward Araboth's spire.

Arriving at the sanctuary, she panted as she glared at the door.

'Gurfin is in here.'

A distance that would take one second at her speed.

How many times had she come here, unable to overcome impulsive emotions?

Ikael desperately reached out her hand.

'I want to see him. No, if I could just see his face. Just once, one last time...'

Then she felt she could forget everything.

The heart is a delusion.

The moment Ankera's words came to mind, Ikael bit her lip and hastily withdrew her hand.

Squeezing her eyes shut and clenching her fists, she calmed her heart and looked at the sanctuary door.

It was quiet as if no one lived there.

'It's over.'

With a sad expression, she turned and spread her wings of light wide, returning to her quarters.

'Everything is over.'

Another night was passing by.
