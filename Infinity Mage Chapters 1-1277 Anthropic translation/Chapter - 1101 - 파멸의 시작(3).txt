The Beginning of Destruction (3)

A petite hooded woman arrived at the plaza where the Papal Palace could be seen.

Candler Eden.

Named after an ancient city, she was a Yora who practiced love.

Eden removed her hood and gazed up at the top of the tower that pierced the sky.

'Not there.' Slowly lowering her gaze, she passed the entrance of the Papal Palace and contemplated the invisible underground.

'Underground.'

So faint it couldn't be felt without concentration, yet there was definitely the scent of evil wafting up.

'My feeling was right. But why would such an aura be lurking in the Papal Palace?'

After hearing Harvits' inner voice through Nemesis, Eden had been plagued by nightmares.

Then one day, while pursuing demons with Dante, she heard a strange rumor.

'The Satanic Church.'

The founder was Giyorgi, who was surprisingly a demon made from emotions abandoned by Yahweh.

After parting with Dante, she investigated the Satanic Church, and following the trail of evil energy, she arrived at this very place.

"The Papal Palace."

The Rami Church upholds the will of good.

The Holy Knights had achieved distinguished service in the war against demons, and the priests had cared for those in need.

Setting aside countless questions, Eden pulled down her hood.

'I'll confirm it with my own eyes.'

She would annihilate the Satanic Church, Satan's spiritual foundation, and escape from the terrible nightmares.

'Lord Yora.'

She kissed the cross pendant within a circular border and headed toward the Papal Palace.

'Please protect me.'

"This is the place."

The expression of the High Priest who had guided Sirone's group to the papal chamber remained unpleasant.

'What are you really trying to do?' The world's three major religions: Rami Church, Yora Church, and Terapos Church.

'The Yora Church doesn't expand its organization, and the Terapos Church fell along with the Terapos Papal Palace. A few radical extremists commit terrorism, but it's not at a dangerous level.'

Only the Rami Church remained steadfast in these turbulent times.

'Isn't this proof that God Cria created the universe? But at some point...'

The name Yahweh began to be heard, and rumors spread so rapidly that nothing could be done to stop them.

'We should have nipped it in the bud from the beginning.' When the world's leading nation is decided in this holy war, the Pope of the Rami Church will provide certification.

'The opportunity to become the world's only religion.'

With that unprecedented achievement right before them, Yahweh had come to the Papal Palace.

"Let me say this again: behave reverently before His Holiness. If you speak carelessly just because you believe in a different god, the Rami Church will act according to its doctrine."

Nade flared up.

"Hmph! Anyway, you also have Holy Knights..."

"Nade."

Sirone stopped him.

"I understand. It will be a brief conversation. Once I hear the answer I want, I'll quietly leave."

The High Priest became even more anxious.

'What answer are you trying to hear?'

Since lingering in front of the papal chamber wasn't a good sight, he knocked politely.

"Your Holiness, guests have arrived."

"Let them enter."

Following the dignified voice, the door opened, revealing Constantine with his kindly appearance.

Sirone entered confidently, with the wary Iruki and tense Nade positioned on either side.

"Hmm."

Constantine, who had been observing Sirone for a while, smiled.

"So you're the Universal Love of this age, Yahweh. I'd heard rumors, but seeing you in person, you look much younger."

"I too have heard much of your reputation. You provided great help in the demon war. Thank you."

Constantine offered them seats.

"What is there to thank me for? Compared to what you've accomplished, I can only feel ashamed. Sit."

Sirone sat in the chair and thought.

'He doesn't seem to have a desire for fame. Well... he's been distant from such things since his youth.'

Through Omega, he knew about Constantine's younger days.

'The Pope of Power.'

Indeed, Constantine's divine power was strong enough to compete for the top rank even within the Papal Palace.

'He's not someone who would be swayed by evil energy. But then why...'

Why does this place smell of Satan?

"Well then, Yahweh."

The Pope spoke.

"You wanted to see me before the holy war begins. How is it? Do I not meet your standards?"

"I'm not qualified to evaluate others. I'm simply curious about something."

"Is that so? That's a bit disappointing."

Having lived his entire life without a single shameful act, Constantine found Sirone's response rather disappointing.

"Very well, ask me anything. As you know, I must depart for the holy war soon."

"What are you hiding?" At the direct question, the Pope closed his mouth, but his expression remained unchanged.

"Hmm. What am I hiding? From you? Let me see... what could I have hidden?"

The Pope walked around the room and turned back to Sirone.

"I once broke a close friend's toy in childhood. I couldn't tell the truth. Ah, that's right. It was during adolescence. I had a crush on the girl next door. Though it wasn't befitting a servant of God, I had impure thoughts. And..."

"That's not relevant."

Sirone said.

"All humans are swayed by desire. What I want to hear about is a more fundamental issue."

"I don't understand. Could you explain?"

"Sacred Martyrdom."

The Pope's eyebrows twitched.

"The Martyrdom Code. I heard that the Holy Knights of the Rami Church receive training from a very young age."

Constantine's face contorted.

"Yahweh, I tried to understand you. But why are you trying to debate doctrine?"

"I'm not debating, I'm asking. Don't you think it's wrong? You clearly remember breaking your childhood friend's toy, so why won't you speak about that?"

"Because there's nothing wrong with it."

Constantine was firm.

"The Rami Church has fought against evil. The Holy Knights are at the forefront of that fight. What's wrong with training them? I don't know why you're determined to find fault, but as the Pope of the Rami Church, I have no doubts about our doctrine."

"Then I cannot acknowledge the Rami Church either."

As the Pope's face grew more distorted, furniture shook as if an earthquake had occurred.

'Tremendous.'

Despite being energy that originally opposes evil, it wielded power that affected even inanimate objects.

'Any ordinary demon would simply be crushed.'

The Pope said:

"Creating a peaceful world - wasn't that a common task for you and me? What's the reason for this? Must even our methods of fighting follow your way?"

"I know all of history from before I was born. Of course, that history includes the Rami Church as well." "It doesn't matter what god you believe in. Religion fundamentally exists for humanity. But the Holy Knights are different. They're not religion. What the Rami Church did to them was..."

Sirone said:

"Brainwashing."

Perhaps the Pope was no exception.

"Harsh training, mental conditioning, and using the powerful divine force gained that way to defeat evil. Isn't that how the Rami Church has grown?"

"We saved countless people. We protected the world from evil. Is that such a wrong thing?"

"The greatest wrong is making them unable to even think that what they're doing might be wrong. That's brainwashing."

"Humans are weak!"

The Pope shouted.

"Evil swarms throughout the world, and their temptations are too sweet. To fight against that, don't we need some deadly weapon of our own? If we don't have the conviction and spirit to defeat evil, everything ends."

"That kind of thinking..."

Sirone pointed to the floor.

"Has brought evil to this place that's supposed to be God's holy ground."

"...What are you saying?"

Not understanding, the Pope felt as if he'd received the most terrible insult in the world.

"There's evil in the Papal Palace?"

"Humans are weak. They're easily swayed by desire. But when you try to suppress it by force, you end up falling to even greater evil temptations. You're actually nurturing evil."

"Now I understand."

The Pope became calm.

"It seems I was mistaken about you. So this was all it was? Did you gain recognition by tearing apart other religions' doctrines?"

"Don't go to the holy war."

Sirone was firm.

"Stay here and confirm the evil that the Rami Church has drawn in. That's the natural order."

"It's time."

As if he'd completely blocked his ears, Constantine showed no reaction to Sirone's words.

He stuffed his pocket watch back and turned his head just before opening the door.

"Your plan has failed. I'm going to the holy war to do work for the world. If you join my cause, we could become good friends. But if you think to profit by damaging the Rami Church, then I'll fight you with my honor and faith on the line."

The door slammed shut with a thud.

The three people left behind in the papal chamber tensed up without time to review their conversation.

"...This feels murderous."

It was killing intent felt from outside the door.

"If we stall, they'll break into the room. What do we do? Should we fight? Or run?"

"We can't leave now."

Sirone stood up.

"Now that I know the Pope's position, I need to confirm what's happening in the Papal Palace myself."

Nade asked:

"But is there really evil here? The Pope didn't seem to sense it."

"It's because it's the Papal Palace. Detecting evil is the Law's seesaw. You know, when you're in water for a long time you adapt to the temperature, but someone who just entered feels it's cold or hot."

Iruki said:

"Being outsiders makes us more sensitive."

"Yeah. Plus, the more powerful the evil, the fainter its aura becomes. Because it's clever. You can't even perceive Harvits."

There was a knock.

"Please come out now. Since His Holiness has also gone to the holy war, there's no reason to remain in the Holy Office."

Iruki expanded his Spirit Zone.

"Seven people."

The magic restriction device wasn't a problem for someone who had even hacked Shiok's hidden code.

"Don't make too big a scene. If rumors spread that Sirone caused trouble in someone else's religious order, public opinion at the holy war will deteriorate."

Nade sparked blue electricity in his hands.

"But we can't just take a beating. It's fine as long as we don't kill them, right?"

"...Well, for now."

Once permission was granted, Nade lowered his center of gravity and took a charging stance.

"Going? Really going?" Iruki shrugged his shoulders, and Sirone, having no other choice, moved his hands as if pushed.

"Here goes!"

The moment the door exploded with a bang, six blades came in simultaneously from all directions.

'I knew this would happen.'

As Nade's body was enveloped in lightning, he dodged the attacks with superhuman reflexes.

"Catch them!"

Among the Holy Knights on standby under special orders were Leon and Seina from the patrol unit.

"Execute the heretics!" At their killing intent, even Nade, who had been moderately controlling his power until now, could no longer hold back.

'These bastards...'

Kurururururu!

The lightning of Thunder God Transformation surged up, breaking through the ceiling and sweeping through the corridor.

"Gaaahhh!"

As powerful electricity whirled through the corridor, the Holy Knights trembled while still gripping their swords.

Sirone shouted:

"Nade!"

Coming to his senses, Nade hurriedly controlled his power.

'Oops.'

Thunder God Transformation was powerful, but had the drawback of causing loss of reason the longer it was maintained.

"Now's our chance! Let's go!"

While the Holy Knights couldn't recover from the shock, Sirone's group ran in the opposite direction.

"Damn it!"

Leon's fist struck the floor.

"Let's summon all the Paladins from the Oracle Management Department. We cannot let them leave the Papal Palace."

"Hehehe, no need for that."

At the sinister voice from behind, the seven Holy Knights quickly turned around.

"Hihihiha. Hihihihi."

A man with his lips torn to his ears was holding twin scythes in both hands, laughing emptily.

Seina's face turned deathly pale.

'The Laughing One.'

The most secretive organization in the Papal Palace.

'The Heresy Management Department.'
