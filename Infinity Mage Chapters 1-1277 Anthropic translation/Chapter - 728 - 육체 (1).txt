[728] Flesh (1)

Arriving at the summit where the white-black moon hung, Sirone emphasized to the man who had hidden Kai's corpse.

"If you try anything foolish, there won't be a second chance."

"I know. I don't want to die either."

The man named Jurak was quite capable in the Black district and had voluntarily participated in the survival test.

"I've had enough fun. I want to end this now."

The words seemed to embody the philosophy of the Black district entirely, piquing Sirone's curiosity.

"You can fight as much as you want in your district, can't you? What's your reason for participating in the survival test?"

"When I was first born, I scraped by at the bottom. Let's see... I was around eight years old when I first killed someone. I felt no guilt. They tried to kill me first. Anyway, as time passed and I grew stronger..."

Jurak smiled broadly.

"I wanted to see just how strong I was. Truth is, everyone's like that, right? No human just looks up and keeps going. We run like mad because there's something beneath us being crushed."

"So... you participated for such a trivial reason? Just to know how strong you'd become?"

"Fighting is daily life in Black. So routine that when you're hungry, you just break into any house, kill whoever's there, and eat their food. It's not fun anymore, you see. That's just life. Not some dangerous game. Think about it. If demons like that entered the competition, would White stand a chance?"

Jurak waved his hand dismissively.

"Absolutely not. We're gamblers who use our lives as chips to take others' lives. Whether gamblers participate or not determines the outcome of the Law battles."

"So the similar win rates are also..."

"Haha! Exactly. White needs hope to fight their best, right? We deliberately send weak ones to lose a few rounds, then when they're heated up, we take everything at once. And this time was supposed to be my turn to enjoy..."

Shadows fell across Jurak's face.

"But I got backstabbed. Because of you. How could they send a mage? There are only a few even in Black."

Sirone didn't want to hear more.

"Just lead me to Kai."

"Don't worry. I brought along a weak one to raise the difficulty. He's probably guarding like his lifeline."

Jurak descended east from the summit of Mount Anarchy, pushing through dense willow branches before speaking.

"Here we are."

The scene he confidently presented contained neither Kai's corpse nor even a living person.

"What, what?"

Jurak hurriedly turned to Sirone, waving his hands.

"No, no! I definitely told Russell to guard it! This absolutely wasn't my intention...!"

"Activate. Suicide Squad."

A card flashed from where the voice came.

Suicide Squad (Summon).

Description: Ancient Gilitians chose mutual destruction at life's end.

Effect: Summons an ancient Gilitain soul by destroying an S-rank card.

Special Note: Triggers critical strike.

"For Gilitia!"

Unlike commonly imagined spirits, the tattooed Gilitain appeared as vivid as reality.

"Gurk!"

A blade pierced through Jurak's back, and soon his clothes began staining with blood.

"How did you get Suicide Squad...?"

It was Russell's only card, but activation required an S-rank card.

"You bastard! Because of you..."

Russell appeared limping, his face pale as if diseased, with a familiar woman standing beside him.

"Breeze?"

The one who activated Suicide Squad was Breeze from the White district.

'How did she know to come here?'

Breeze looked at Sirone with resigned eyes.

"I'm sorry. I had no choice."

"Breeze! You traitor!"

Three White district participants who had chased her approached bleeding through the undergrowth.

Artria gritted her teeth and shouted.

"Sirone! Watch out for that woman! She stole all our cards and ran! Black... huh?"

Artria stopped mid-sentence upon seeing the man beside Breeze, and Ballard looked dazed.

"Russell? You participated too?"

Russell and Breeze were promised to each other.

But Breeze's parents couldn't accept him due to his congenitally weak heart, and ultimately their marriage was cancelled by vote.

Unable to control his anger, Russell had resorted to violence and was eventually exiled to Black. That was three years ago.

"But you were meeting? Behind our backs?"

Even Ballard, who handled White district security, didn't know the two had maintained their relationship.

'Come to think of it...'

Breeze had known detailed information about Weapon cards.

"Russell! How dare you deceive me!"

As Ballard raised his sword and charged, Breeze summoned the Magic Returners she'd received from Sirone.

"Kiaaaa!"

Ten skeletons in tattered armor rose from the ground and attacked Ballard with stumbling steps.

"D-damn...!"

Having already given up all his Weapon cards, he could only fight with pure physical ability.

"Breeze! I'll kill you!"

As he smashed skeleton skulls while hurling curses, Breeze grabbed Russell's hand and turned.

"Quickly! This way!"

The moment a sound of flesh tearing was heard, Breeze's shoulders jerked as her eyes widened.

"Damn bitch."

Jurak, his clothes already bloodstained, stood with a dagger precisely embedded in Breeze's heart.

"Detective."

By the time Russell realized the existence of the special ability Ambush, Breeze's heart had already stopped beating.

"Breeeze!"

Sirone checked on both Jurak and Breeze's conditions, but both had already become cold corpses.

"Serves you right, traitor!"

As Ballard approached after annihilating the Magic Returners, Russell gathered Breeze's cards.

"Don't try anything. Even with weapon cards, I can kill a weakling like you instantly."

Russell had also lost his reason before his lover's death.

"Shut up! You're no different from those who cast me out! What did Breeze do wrong to die in a place like this!"

"It was decided by vote! White maintains peace because we expelled violence! And Breeze betrayed us! Conspiring with you!"

"...Don't spout nonsense."

Russell pointed at Sirone.

"Breeze participated in the survival test to save me. To get the CPR card!"

Marco shouted.

"You think that excuse works? CPR can't cure heart disease."

"Of course not. But if you revive someone after death, their body becomes clean as new. It's common knowledge in Black."

Artria frowned.

"So she was trying to save her brother? He was exiled to Black anyway. One of you has to die, right?"

"In Black, I'm less than trash. It's no place for a sick person to live."

Russell was dying.

"The village chief told me to participate in this survival test and end my life gloriously. Even I had given up on life. But Breeze..."

Russell's gaze turned to dead Breeze.

"Breeze never gave up. She said we'd run away together once I was cured. If only this damn heart would beat properly! I was confident I could make her happy for life!"

Regardless of White and Black's victory, the two had planned to cure his illness and cross Mount Anarchy.

To somewhere that existed beyond white and black - a world entirely gray.

"But now it's all over."

Russell looked back at Sirone with desperate eyes.

"Kai is already dead. Please use CPR on Breeze. I'll die! Just save her!"

Sirone looked down at the card with a bitter expression.

'Whose card is this?'

Then Marco pounced on Russell from the side.

"Give me my card! Quickly!"

With two Black participants still remaining, weapon cards were essential.

Ballard and Artria, who rushed over as well, pressed down on Russell in a scramble.

"That's my card! Give it back!"

"Shut up! I have a family! I'll keep this, so you protect me!"

"I fought hardest here! Everything's mine!"

With his limbs pinned by White participants, Russell squeezed his eyes shut and screamed.

"Breeeze!"

As his cry of despair adorned the night sky, Sirone threw the CPR card to let it fly in the wind.

'This is human life.'

Even if White and Black achieved harmony, it was the fierce struggle of beings that could never be beautiful.

'So Law, do not mock.'

Isn't this how they must live?

"Mom! I'm going home! I'm... I'm!"

"Breeeze! Breeeze!"

Looking up at the white-black moon, Sirone slowly spread both arms and spoke.

"Do not mock human life."

His body, with Immortal Function activated, burst with light.

Jinseong-eum spoke.

"You're different from what I heard in rumors."

Indeed he was.

'I thought it would feel warmer.'

The boy had eyes cold enough to rival her own.

'Most of all...'

Watching him made her uneasy.

Like condensed light before explosion, he had a pale temperament that seemed ready to burst forth at any moment.

'He's nearly reached something.'

He might explode if touched, but having come this far, he might explode even untouched.

"Candidate of the Ivory Tower, Sirone, I am Princess Jinseong-eum of the Zhen Empire and a sorceress."

"I know. I've heard."

As Seong-eum stepped forward, Mungyeong's eyebrows twitched as he measured distance with a serious expression.

'Twenty paces.'

Seong-eum measured distance to everyone.

"I too have heard of you. I felt jealous, annoyed, and perhaps held some expectations..."

'Fifteen paces.'

Her approach speed remained constant.

"You seem quite precarious, but there must be reasons. I'm not disappointed by such things. Rather, it makes me realize anew that you are my rival."

'Ten paces.'

Now began the realm of superhuman.

"But I too didn't reach here through anyone's understanding. So looking at you now..."

'Five paces.'

Here Seong-eum's steps stopped.

"Honestly, I'm angry."

"..."

Frowning and grumbling, Seong-eum stepped toward Sirone again.

'Four paces.'

"The Ivory Tower ultimately means nothing to Ivory Tower candidates. What I truly expected was..."

'Three paces.'

Mungyeong's eyes widened.

"For the first time in my life, to meet someone who could walk alongside me."

'Two paces!'

Mungyeong despaired.

"Sirone, your comprehension is surely remarkable. But regrettably, you cannot walk alongside me."

As Seong-eum's steps finally stopped, the warriors opened their mouths in disbelief.

"I grant you one pace."

At close enough distance for breath to touch, Seong-eum's index finger aimed at Sirone's brow.

"I am one step ahead of you."

In the silence, Mungyeong cried out in his heart.

'Take pride! Revere the Princess! Being granted one pace is already tremendous!'

He couldn't dare imagine Sirone's view, looking directly at Jinseong-eum's face.

'So this is Jinseong-eum.'

Exactly as the Ivory Tower residents had said.

'What's so important about that?'

Before coming to Andre, he might have bristled at Seong-eum's words, but now he felt nothing.

"About comprehension and such..."

"Hm?"

As Seong-eum looked puzzled, Sirone smiled and stepped aside.

"If you must maintain that one step to the end..."

He looked back at the path ahead and said.

"Please go first."

"..."

Seong-eum's eyelids blinked rapidly.
