The First Yora (4)

Being strong.

Perhaps human intelligence and the systems we've created only came about because we were weak.

In front of Ymir.

"Keh keh keh."

The moment Ymir's fist struck the ground, the earth shamefully scattered in all directions.

"Is this what it's like when humans are annoyed by flies?"

Several tons of dirt piled up on the crater's edge exploded, revealing Kang Nan's form.

"Damn it..."

Spitting out the dirt that had gotten in her mouth, she tried to forget the fact that she had a Gaian body.

"Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara."

Miro's two arms moved, and the incarnation of the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara that filled the sky delivered a barrage of strikes.

When the giant palm struck the ground, all of Ymir's joints bent downward.

"Is this all?" It was merely impact. Bringing down Ymir was an entirely different matter.

"You entered my world with just this much?"

When Ymir put strength into both arms, the 1st layer of the Deep started shaking terrifyingly.

Miro gritted her teeth with a disgusted expression.

'What the hell is that thing?'

If everything in the world could be converted to numbers, it seemed like all stats had been maxed out.

"Mind Fist."

The moment Ymir threw his punch, it was already right in front of her face.

'Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara.'

Time slowed down, and afterimages of arms spread out for each minimum unit of time that Miro split.

And all those afterimages...

'Ten Thousand Palms.'

It was an incarnation technique where they became actual impacts.

"Keuuuu!"

Ymir's waist bent under the palm techniques pouring down with vibration-like intensity.

'This is pain?'

Since he had hardly ever felt pain, he had no definition for it.

'I understood it to be quite an unpleasant feeling.'

Ymir's lips curled up.

"Why do you hate something that feels this good?"

'That bastard.'

Power entered Miro's eyes.

'You need to know too.'

Even one ten-thousandth of the pain Gaold felt.

As she moved her two arms, the incarnation of the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara took the same action.

'Here it comes again.'

Ymir intuited.

'An unavoidable ability.'

For the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara who observes the world from the edge of the universe, blind spots cannot exist.

Ymir snorted.

"Hmph."

And he threw his fist toward where the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's Fifteen Thunder Palm technique was rushing in.

The moment impact hit the center of the palm techniques, which might have been layered who knows how many times.

Miro felt languid.

'Huh?'

The scenery twisted, and children with identical faces as if copied burst into laughter, while tens of thousands of puppies wagged their tails in the same way.

'Mental confusion.'

It was a characteristic of Ymir's attacks - what he destroyed wasn't only material things.

'No!'

When her ultimate state of mind restored her sanity, Ymir's massive body filled her field of vision.

"Die."

Time slowed again, but this time Miro wasn't confident she could match the timing.

'Keuuuu!'

Just when everything was happening in slow motion.

Bang!

Something flew at tremendous speed - the only thing moving that fast - and struck Ymir's temple.

The giant's head snapped to the side as if it might break, and he stopped his charge in that position.

Miro's group, barely escaping from the mental confusion, blinked in surprise.

Blood trickled down from Ymir's temple.

"...Pain."

Displeasure, definite pain.

He turned his head to where Gaold stood in the pose of having fired an Air Gun.

"Was it you?"

The one who opened the 1st layer of the Deep.

Gaold briefly checked Miro's condition, then turned his head again and took a step forward.

"What, feeling numb?"

At Gaold's words, Ymir's expression returned to normal.

"Keh keh, just because the skin got torn a bit. Well, I'll give you credit for being decent for a human."

Sein let out a groan.

'Ymir is right. The situation is still hopeless.'

From a situation where only sensation was transmitted, he had only inflicted slight pain.

'Combat is about completely destroying the target. Getting happy because someone bled a little only happens in children's fights.'

"Is that so?"

When Gaold charged, Ymir also took a stance to receive him with a pleased expression.

"Wait! Let's coordinate our attack...!"

Before Miro could finish speaking, they clashed and mental confusion occurred again.

'This is really annoying.'

Meanwhile, Ymir became interested in Gaold, whose magic power hadn't diminished at all.

"Mental strength?"

"No."

In tremendous pain, madness flickered in Gaold's eyes.

"I was already insane to begin with."

When the Air Gun burst like buckshot, Ymir's expression gradually began to crumple.

'This bastard...'

If only pain that couldn't be repeated twice could surpass limits, then the number of walls Gaold had overcome was...

"Air Press."

Equivalent to the pain of all humanity.

"Keuaaaa!"

The moment Ymir, unable to endure it, let out a scream, a clear cracking sound was heard.

Then the ground collapsed in a cylindrical shape and a tremendous explosion rushed through the underground.

It was fortunate this was a mental world - if it had been reality, it would have been a disaster comparable to a natural calamity.

"Ow!"

When Miro's group, blown away by the strong wind, brushed off the dust and returned, they couldn't believe the surreal scene and gaped.

"Th-that's..."

Ymir's right arm was broken.

"How's that?"

Gaold asked.

"Does it hurt a bit now?"

Ymir looked at his bizarrely twisted right arm.

'It hurts.'

It wasn't a level that could be expressed as displeasure.

'Similar to the sensation Augent gave me. No, perhaps even more.'

The moment he realized this, Ymir's temperament changed and he smiled at Gaold.

"Yes."

His pupils turned black, with only red pupils smaller than grains of rice embedded in that face.

"This is what being alive means."

It was so eerie and alien that it didn't feel like a being living in the same universe.

"Huuuu..."

Kang Nan couldn't suppress her groan.

'Scary.'

She could assert that nothing in the world was scarier than that, but Gaold was calm.

"Good, feeling alive then." Because there was nothing to fear for a philosopher who had reached humanity's deepest realm.

"You have to be alive for me to kill you."

"Hehe."

Ymir's body disappeared with a short laugh, and Gaold sharply twisted his waist back.

In that instant, Sein recalled.

'It's coming.'

An unprecedented collision.

A phenomenon close to the extreme of ominousness occurred, with no sound, sight, or impact to perceive.

The shock transcending the five senses brought dream time up to a level close to reality.

Within that tremendous amount of information, Shirone's body, receiving the Immortal Function, stirred.

Another massive data set.

The most intense event from the life of the first Yora, Yorahan, was being transmitted.

"Haha! That's also a valid point."

Yorahan, who had married Armand, went out to the plaza every day to preach love to the Fire Tribe.

"If someone hits me, should I hit them back too? It's a difficult question. But I think this way. If I retaliate, violence gains legitimacy. On the other hand, if I forgive that person, they will also forgive someone else, and eventually..."

The Fire Tribe shouted.

"It will become a world full of love!"

"Right. Of course, it's not easy. But if we can't reach this point, in the very distant future, there will be no life on this land."

Though Yorahan's lifespan was short, the ideology he created would last through eternal ages.

'We have to decide now, our final destination.'

"Teacher, I have a question."

"Yes. Ask me anything."

"Today's content was about love. So how do you love sister Armand?"

"Today's class is over."

When Yorahan closed his book and stood up, the Fire Tribe made crying expressions and fidgeted.

"Ahh! Please tell us, teacher!"

Leaving the children's voices behind, he returned home as if fleeing and shook his head.

"They're really incorrigible."

Armand sat on the floor of the hut, sharpening her sword on a flat whetstone.

"What's wrong? Did the kids cause trouble again?"

"Haha! It's nothing. But why the sudden sword maintenance? Preparing for hunting?"

"Yeah. We're out of the birds I caught. I think I need to move to a different hunting ground."

In just two years, human territory had expanded further, reaching even the Fire Tribe's domain.

"Let's go together."

"Not today. It's too late. If I go alone, an hour will be enough."

Even though he had gotten used to mountain travel, keeping up with the Fire Tribe's greatest warrior was beyond him.

Yorahan grumbled.

"I'm worried, that's why. Blue River region has already been developed. I heard it's called the Micas Kingdom."

"What kind of place is it?"

"I've only heard rumors, never been there. It was a local territory at the time but seems to have grown rapidly."

Rapid growth meant the leader's disposition was also aggressive.

"I think we'll have to move our settlement. Let me look for a suitable place tomorrow."

Armand's motion of sharpening her sword stopped abruptly.

"Actually, I'm not sure."

"Of course I know how strong you are. It's just that there's always that one-in-ten-thousand chance..."

"No, I mean that love you advocate. Do you really think it's possible?"

Armand turned her head.

"Look at me now. I'm trying to kill birds to get food. Isn't this also violence?"

Yorahan slumped into a chair.

"Probably... yes."

While it wasn't something to worry about in reality, immortal ideology must be free of contradictions.

'Absolute love. A world where everyone cares for each other ultimately gets blocked by the problems of feeding and reproduction.'

If this problem couldn't be solved, the logic of love would eventually collapse.

"How about going out into the human world?"

Yorahan doubted his ears.

"Huh? What did you say?"

"No one raises problems here. If we face it directly, wouldn't a better method emerge?"

Of course, that was natural.

That's why Yorahan initially hadn't planned to stay long with the Fire Tribe.

'But not anymore. Everyone is family now.'

Above all, he was worried about Armand.

"No. I won't leave. Here is enough. If I research just a little more, there will definitely be a solution..."

"Yorahan."

Armand approached.

"I didn't trust humans. I didn't inherit the previous generation's will either. But after meeting you, I realized. If all humans could become like you, I would have courage too."

"Armand..."

"Let's go together. We are one, aren't we? If it's what you want, naturally I should do it too."

She smiled and continued.

"Besides, I'm different from other Fire Tribe members. I have no passivity, and I can eat food. I can live like a human."

"H-honey."

Yorahan's eyes welled up with tears.

"Thank you. Really, thank you so much. I love you, honey."

"...Stop crying."

At this point.

Even while receiving the Immortal Function, Shirone's unconscious mind harbored doubts.

'Feeding and reproduction.'

Because even after so much time had passed, the contradictions inherent in living beings remained unresolved.

'But he is the first Yora.'

Indeed, what did Yorahan define as he faced the greatest challenge of living beings - feeding and reproduction?

'Love without a trace of evil, absolute love...'

How did he define it?
