[758] The Doctrine of Evil (5)

The other world that Sirone gazed upon seemed filled entirely with things that humans despised.

Following the intestines through fields of villi, grotesque statues that typically appeared in religious paintings came into view.

'This is unexpected...'

While it had been fine to tail Basseto through the other world, at some point the scenery of reality had become invisible.

'Miro...'

Zion's law to shrink the Psychic Realm was putting pressure on the entire world.

The thin boundary that could have been torn at any time had transformed into an iron barrier.

'I'm rooting for you.'

If it was a choice for humanity's sake, it was something that had to be endured, and her level of enlightenment was rather admirable.

'Following him any further is impossible.'

Having lost track of Basseto, Sirone was thinking of finding an exit as quickly as possible to return to the real world.

'This is strange. Really strange.'

The number of demons Sirone had identified just getting to this point easily exceeded a thousand.

'They can't escape to reality from here anyway. Most of their forces should be deployed within the Psychic Realm...'

It was puzzling since fierce wars were being waged near the Psychic Realm in every nation.

'The Psychic Realm is the front line between demons and humans. This would be impossible unless one of the two sides gave up...'

Perhaps it could apply to both.

Gurgle...

The sound of water flowing through the intestines could be heard, then the outer wall where Sirone stood shook violently.

"Damn...!"

Wind blew first from the places he had passed through so far, followed by a putrid stench.

Gwaaaah!

Making a disgusting sound, murky filth poured in like a flood, causing Sirone to hurriedly fly up into the sky.

"Urgh!"

"Save me! Save me!"

Skeletons carried along by the torrent of filth saw Sirone and raised their skeletal arms toward him.

Charity.

"Take my hand!"

The moment he grasped their hands, shoulders snapped and arms that fell from torsos quickly turned into black ash.

'Purification of souls.'

Though he had realized through sealing several altars that it was futile, he couldn't help but grasp the hands that reached out to him.

'But this is the worst case I've seen...'

The consciousness of the real world seeps into the other world and is recycled as an energy source for demons.

'Witches' covens and their sexual pleasures, gatherings of demon worshippers.'

The collective consciousness born in such places is powerful and stimulating enough to paralyze the brain.

But sometimes an individual's consciousness becomes just as powerful.

Namely, death.

'They're already dead.'

Unless one was a religious person certain of divine salvation or a seeker who had realized life's futility, not many could overcome the fear of death.

The moment that powerful fear explodes, consciousness gets sucked into the other world and falls into hell.

'I'm sorry.'

Thinking of their fate of falling into the place called the 'Frying Pan' and being melted by hellfire, Nane naturally came to mind.

'You might be right.'

Sirone prevented his eyes from growing hot and hurriedly came to his senses, shaking his head.

'I can't break down.'

While Yahweh's realm loves all that exists, the residents of the other world had no substance.

'It's just a hell we created.'

Rather than closing the world, having all humanity practice love to liberate them would be true salvation.

After the purification of souls, which was more horrific than other places, ended, Sirone descended to the ground again.

The woman's face attached to the grotesque statue had changed at some point and was laughing with her mouth wide open.

"..."

Her mouth was filled with soul dregs.

Suddenly the woman's eyes turned toward Sirone and she began laughing while chewing the dregs.

"Kyahahaha! Kyahahaha...!"

Bang!

The statue's face, hit by the Photon Cannon, fell off with a thud and rolled on the ground.

"Haaa..."

Who was he fighting for?

Sometimes - no, actually often - when looking at the world that humans had irresponsibly created, he couldn't control his anger.

"How dare you damage the statue of purification!"

Hearing the sound, fierce demons swarmed over, filling the interior of the rotting intestines.

"Answer me."

Heart of humanity.

"What must be done for you all to realize love?"

Since seekers who came to ask such questions in hell's history weren't entirely nonexistent, the demons chose their answer.

"There's exactly one way."

A demon with horns like a bull stepped forward and spread both arms wide.

"Submit to me and worship me. Then I'll love you."

Because only I am precious.

"Puhahaha! Brilliant answer! Correct! O seeker of the Way! Why do you agonize over such a simple matter?"

All the demons spread both arms.

"Worship me!"

Sirone squeezed both eyes shut, and when the eyelids heavy as the world opened again.

"Kill him! A seeker's flesh tastes amazing!"

Yahweh's light swept forth.

"Kahahaha! You must be dying of frustration! You're stupid for expecting compassion from humans! Your light is strong and burns us, but..."

Even amid the mixed voices of demons in the heart of hell, Sirone didn't stop his light.

"We're not afraid at all! That's why we won't submit! Until the moment just before complete annihilation, we will fight!"

Burning all the demons in that region with Yahweh's light was the only way to seal the altar.

"Truly pitiful! Foolish and foolish...!"

O Yahweh.

Where the scream-like shouts disappeared, a world of nothingness as vast as Yahweh's radiance opened up.

"Nothingness."

It was neither dark nor transparent.

The pure 'absence' that humans couldn't conceive was so strange that few besides Sirone could endure it.

Unable to bear that emptiness.

"Let there be light."

Sirone had developed the habit of filling the places where he sealed altars with something made of material.

'My skills are still insufficient, but...'

Just manifesting an archangel statue from his maternal psychology in the pure white space made him feel much more at ease.

'Ikael.'

The image of her clutching her chest and wailing in Hexa's memory came to mind.

'It must surely be a miserable sight.'

Why did recalling this memory make the anger in his heart feel washed away?

"Raktas Vera Imera! (Submit to fear!)"

Startled by the familiar voice for a moment, Sirone looked around at the hellish scenery outside the material realm.

"Igor."

Igor, the Lord of Fear riding an eyeless black horse, approached with his blue flame spear hanging down.

"This isn't your territory, is it?"

According to real world coordinates, he should have been in Radum.

"I came to retrieve the Mark of Submission."

Igor's words stopped in front of the pure white boundary newly filled with material.

Though it was irrelevant, emotionally he would find it terribly unpleasant to step foot there.

"Hand it over. I fight for Satan."

From within Sirone's bosom, Igor's necklace transformed into blue starlight and floated toward Igor.

"So you used this to find me."

Just before entering Igor's grasp, the starlight stopped abruptly and advanced no further.

"...Are you refusing?"

Sirone was still Igor's master.

"What happens if I refuse?"

"Satan would annihilate me. Though that would just result in a new fear with a different name appearing."

The more frequently humans feel an emotion, the faster it resurrects in the other world.

"A new name..."

The President of North Eymond was also named Igor.

"Is this connected to the current situation?"

"Not particularly. There are countless Igors in the human world. And some Igors use fear as a weapon."

That emotion combined with souls melted in hellfire gave birth to Igor, Lord of Fear.

"He came first, I came after. Don't be confused."

If it was an emotion powerful enough to become a corps commander in hell, Igor's character as a human was understandable.

"Tell me what's happening where I am."

Igor kept his mouth shut.

"That's the condition for releasing the oath of submission."

Since he still wanted to fight for Satan, Igor nodded heavily.

"Igor - the one who gave me individuality - currently doesn't exist in this world."

"You mean he's dead?"

"Absorbed. Currently, half the army of the kingdom you're staying in consists of demons, not humans."

"Demons?"

Changing form meant changing not just matter but function as well, so it wasn't easy even for demons.

Illusion magic would be different, but there was no way Sirone, who had reached Yahweh's realm, wouldn't notice.

"How could that be possible..."

Sirone suddenly realized.

"Garas?"

"Right. Hybrids of demons and Garas have taken control of the army. Garas - quite a remarkable race. Ever since they came to the kingdom, tremendous energy has been flowing into the other world. The demons born from that energy are currently pushing out existing corps commanders and taking over as new corps commanders. Even you couldn't guarantee victory in battle."

Since there had never been an opponent he could guarantee victory against, Sirone's heart just beat a little faster.

"You know demons are born from the energy source of the Frying Pan. The reason they're all different is because they inherit some aspect of Satan's individuality. Conversely speaking..."

"Satan is a collection of evil."

Demons call themselves evil, but just as humans see good as beautiful, they simply believe evil is the truth.

"How far have they infiltrated North Eymond?"

"Completely. The kingdom you're in has already been conquered by demons. It was Igor the human's own decision."

"His own?"

"He truly wanted to become fear itself. So he voluntarily offered his body to a greater being. Therefore, the one currently ruling that country is actually a demon, one of the few who can transform into human form."

"...A corps commander."

Considering that shape-changing was only possible for First-class Dragons among dragonkind, he could sense the corps commander's power.

"Under Satan's command, 72nd Legion's 24th Corps Commander, Maraduk."

Maraduk of Destruction.

"We are all aspects of Satan. Corps commanders especially inherit Satan's most powerful traits. If you think it's the same as subduing me, even Yahweh will lose his light."

To Sirone, lost in thought, Igor said:

"That's all I can tell you. If you want to know more, you'll have no choice but to annihilate me."

"...I'll return it, the necklace."

Finally, the blue starlight seeped into Igor.

"You could have just annihilated me."

"I know. But..."

Even being able to share something with a demon like this was too precious to Sirone.

"Because you helped me."

Igor turned his black horse around.

"That won't happen again."

As Sirone watched him disappearing into the hellish scenery, Igor suddenly stopped his horse.

Was this really the right thing to do?

Though it was brief, Sirone's emotions shared through Igor's necklace might have seeped in.

"It's not entirely nonexistent."

Igor seemed to be talking to himself, but...

"A demon who repented for his sins."

It sounded as loud as thunder to Sirone's ears.

"Heh, the problem is there are almost none."

Having drawn a clear line, Igor disappeared without looking back until the end.

Sirone couldn't move for a long time.

'There were some.'

Both fists clenched tight.

'I can keep fighting. I'm not wrong!'

His chest felt like it was on fire, making it hard to breathe, then hot tears flowed down his cheeks.

'I'll never give up. No matter how evil humans are...'

They weren't necessarily evil.
