[528] Helper (4)

The Northern Almond Republic.

The Northern Almond Republic, ruled by the iron dictator Igor, was infamous for its reign of terror.

Society was extremely closed off, the people were belligerent, and they had a tendency to not hesitate even at suicide attacks when it came to matters directly connected to their national interests, making them a global troublemaker that even major powers couldn't easily conquer.

Though they had harsh legal measures like cutting off hands for theft, crime never ceased.

Since the republic itself upheld the banner that a citizen's primary requirement was combat ability, it wasn't uncommon to see even street children carrying small knives.

The port city of Dormica, the only place that allowed openness to foreign countries, was a time bomb of the western continent where all kinds of war weapons were traded.

Mercenaries, pirates, discharged soldiers, and others had established themselves here, and public safety was virtually nonexistent.

The reason Igor's powerful authority couldn't sweep away the dark forces was that the security forces were no different from other factions.

They mainly received money in exchange for allowing other organizations' weapon trades, and in some cases, large-scale wars were fought between the security forces and other organizations.

Most ships entering the port were trading vessels loaded with weapons, and tourists were nowhere to be found no matter how hard you looked.

Therefore, it was only natural that all eyes focused on a blue-haired woman who had just disembarked at the port.

"Wow, so this is Northern Almond."

Miro was unmistakably a tourist by anyone's standards.

She had braided her long hair and wrapped it around her neck like a scarf, wearing light makeup.

She was adorned with accessories perfect for becoming a target, wore a long sweater with sleeves that extended below her wrists, and a skirt short enough to reveal her thighs, giving off an overall cheerful impression.

In Dormica, a woman dressed like this could only be either a prostitute or an idiot who had sold her mind somewhere.

"Whew! Miss, you've got some nerve, don't you? Walking around showing so much skin in a place crawling with hungry wolves—are you asking to be devoured?"

Workers who delivered fish approached her.

Their waterproof work clothes reeked of fish, and they had kitchen knives hanging from their belts.

A bald man put his arm around Miro's shoulder and brought his face close to hers.

"How about it? Want to have some fun with us? I know a really exciting place."

"Oh my, I was actually looking for a similar place. Where is it?"

"Where else? Right here."

The man brought Miro's hand to his crotch.

"Hahaha! How's that? Rivals a blue whale, doesn't it? Once I catch my prey, I never let... AAAAHHH!"

The man's eyes bulged as if they would pop out, then he grabbed his lower region and fell to his knees.

"My, my...!"

The workers who had been staring blankly at him writhing in pain unable to even speak pulled out their knives and surrounded Miro.

"Are you crazy! Do you know who we are? Cross James Fisheries and you'll become fish food that very day!"

Miro brushed her clothes as if something dirty had touched them, then held out her hand.

"Ah, whatever. Do you guys happen to know where the Ostos Tavern is?"

The men who had been approaching ready to start a knife fight suddenly stopped in their tracks.

The Ostos Tavern was where one of the three forces that enforced their own laws in the lawless zone of Dormica was located.

"What are you? If you're thinking of finding a way out, just imagine what will happen to you right here and now."

Sometimes there were such cases.

Those with no connections and no power would mention the Ostos Tavern to save their own lives.

They would use the rule established there: "No attacking outsiders."

"I'm not familiar with the geography here. I heard it's at the Ostos Tavern."

Seeing no trace of fear as Miro approached while looking around left and right, the worker also felt the need to verify.

"Who are you looking for there?"

Miro, who had been examining the commercial district, turned around with a smile.

"The Fallen Saint."

Following the directions given by the worker, Miro arrived in front of the Ostos Tavern and looked up at the four-story building.

The first and second floors were the tavern, the third floor was lodging, and the fourth floor was a gambling den.

But where Miro headed was a place not open to the general public but known to everyone—deep underground beneath the Ostos Tavern.

Going down to the second basement level, two swordsmen were guarding a large door.

She had felt a sense of wariness even above ground, but from here the very nature of their killing intent was different.

"Hmm, quite capable indeed."

To have swordsmen of this level as gatekeepers meant they had essentially brought a nearly ruined organization up to a level comparable to its heyday.

Most importantly, the fact that this was achieved in just one year made it all the more trustworthy.

"What are you? Who let you in?"

"No one ever let anyone in, right?"

The gatekeepers looked at each other, then immediately drew their swords.

"Reveal your identity. This isn't a place for word games."

"Oh my? But I'm serious."

Miro strode forward and held out both hands in front of the gatekeepers.

The Avalokitesvara Palm of Prajna swept in like wind, pushing the gatekeepers aside as the door creaked open.

In the 40-pyeong room, about ten figures were scattered around doing their own activities.

The room surrounded by stone walls was gloomy like an underground tomb, but the most impressive thing was that none of them showed any disturbance at the intruder's appearance.

The three men sitting at the table smoking and playing cards didn't even look toward the door.

"Ugh! It's, it's an attack."

The gatekeeper crawled in belatedly to report, but there was still no reaction.

A man lying in a hammock blowing into a bottle turned his head with a loud burp.

"I know, you bastard. We have brains too! Whose guest is it this time? Snyde, is it you?"

A large man with a thick cigar in his mouth drew a card and spoke.

"Don't know. There's no woman selling her body around here who looks that pretty."

A brief silence followed.

The man lying in the hammock shouted irritably.

"Ah, seriously! Someone step up and do something! It's an attack!"

"Then you can do it."

"Hahaha!"

Miro just watched the executives each doing their own thing.

Then a woman's voice was heard from behind the large man who was blocking the view.

"So, who are you?"

When the man opened up the view, a short-haired woman resembling a cat could be seen sitting at a table flicking an abacus.

Next to her stood a pale-looking man with no eyebrows, expressionless enough to look like a wax figure.

"Are you the Fallen Saint?"

"Some idiots do call me that. But who are you?"

Miro changed the subject as she moved forward.

"I thought you'd learned your lesson after what happened in Galliant. You still haven't escaped being a bandit."

Click! Click!

The moment she finished speaking, everyone in the room aimed their respective weapons at Miro.

The movement was so swift that from the victim's perspective, it felt like two pictures had been instantly switched.

Miro glanced to the right.

The eyebrowless man had somehow approached and was pressing a gun loaded with magic bullets to her temple.

"Last chance. Reveal your identity."

"Well. I wonder who it could be?"

Just as the finger on the magic bullet's trigger was bending, the woman spoke.

"Stop it, Freeman."

Miro gave a passing grade for now.

If they couldn't even gauge an opponent's capabilities, they wouldn't even qualify to enter The Abyss.

"Mentioning Galliant means you know who I am, right?"

"Of course. Clay Marsha, leader of the Parrot Bandit Group."

The head of the bandit group who had fought a fierce battle with Sirone's party on Galliant Island and was ultimately defeated.

According to intelligence from Tharase, she was an excellent strategist and an unorthodox fighter.

Due to trauma regarding her adoptive father, she had wielded the ability to extract others' magic, but currently, having experienced 'Catharsis' from Sirone, there was a possibility it had been replaced with a different ability.

Marsha, having cleared away the documents, finally turned to face Miro and crossed her legs.

As she took out a long pipe and put it in her mouth, Freeman quickly returned to light it for her.

"Yes, I'm Clay Marsha. So what, did you expect some winged angel to be sitting here?"

"Oh my, Sirone would be hurt to hear that."

At the mention of Sirone, Marsha's eyebrows trembled subtly, but she soon put the pipe back in her mouth with a composed expression.

"Ah, that kid? I don't know how you know Sirone, but reality isn't that easy. My trade is thievery, after all."

Some strength can be proven by discarding precious things.

Realizing she was dealing with a formidable woman, Miro got straight to the point.

"Sirone has run into a bit of trouble. If you came, it would be quite helpful in resolving it."

Marsha didn't even show a hint of consideration.

"Sorry. I'm busy these days. Find someone else."

"It's actually quite a serious problem. He might never wake up."

Even without knowing the full story, Marsha could picture it.

Probably this time too, he had thrown everything away for someone other than himself.

"That's unfortunate. But as you probably already guessed, Sirone isn't my type."

After leaving Galliant and wandering the world while building her forces.

She had powerful subordinates under her, and while settling in Northern Almond's port city and fighting fiercely, memories of Sirone had gradually faded.

"Fine. I came to the wrong place. Sorry for taking up your busy time."

Miro turned around without regret, patted the shoulder of the grinding gatekeeper, and left through the door.

Fermi wanted someone who had deep emotional exchanges with Sirone, and Marsha, who had experienced 'Catharsis', was the top candidate, but if her heart had already left, there was no need to waste more time.

"Wait."

At Marsha's call, Miro turned back around.

"Why me? If a master like you is going around looking for helpers, there should be plenty of others besides me."

"Well. I don't know the details either, but..."

Miro shrugged.

"Maybe it's because you're someone Sirone embraced with his heart?"

"..."

Marsha narrowed her eyes and blew out a long stream of smoke.

"Everyone get out."

All the executives flowed past Miro like water and disappeared outside the door in an instant.

A restaurant in the Baiден Kingdom.

Having left Rafne Village and finally arrived at a place that could be called a city, Rian was frantically chewing meat as if to compensate for all his previous hunger.

His sturdy build and the greatsword on his back aside, his voracious appetite immediately drew the attention of the restaurant patrons.

"Mister, one more steak here!"

The restaurant owner brought grilled meat to Rian's table with a terrified expression.

This was already his fourth steak.

Judging by his appearance, he definitely didn't seem to have much money, but the aura he gave off was seriously heavy, so the owner was only groaning inwardly.

"Ex, excuse me, customer."

"Yes?"

"I'm sorry, really sorry, but..."

The restaurant owner was almost in tears.

"You will pay, right?"

Rian, who had been staring blankly, finally realized and put down his utensils.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I can understand your suspicion given my appearance. Let me pay in advance."

When Rian emptied his travel money to pay, the owner finally looked relieved.

Perhaps his tension had eased a bit due to the customer's courtesy, as he mustered the courage to ask.

"But by any chance... aren't you the famous Knight of Maha?"

"Knight of Maha?"

Lamdas's followers had quickly spread rumors about Rian, but having just arrived in the city, this was news to him.

Most importantly, he didn't even know the name of Lamdas, the opponent he had cut down.

"Yes, the Knight of Maha. According to rumors, like you, he has a large build and possesses tremendous strength to wield an enormously large greatsword with one hand."

"Hmm."

Rian thought for a moment, then waved his hand.

"I'm just an unknown swordsman. The Knight of Maha must be someone else."

When Rian honestly confessed, several customers grumbled with annoyed expressions.

Rumors tend to be exaggerated, but they had been somewhat wary after seeing Rian's aura.

"Tch, what? He was a fake?"

"Right. Confusing people by carrying around a greatsword. And such an ridiculously large one too. Doesn't look like he could even swing it."

"How many guys like that are there in this business? When someone gains fame, everyone tries to impersonate them for a free ride."

"Still, how could he imitate the Knight of Maha? They say he single-handedly cut down an entire bandit group of over 100 people."

While various conversations were being heard, Rian's entire attention was focused only on his food.

Then the restaurant door creaked open and a hairy man a head taller than Rian entered.

On his back was a massive sword with saw teeth on both sides.

"Hey, where's the restaurant owner? Serve the finest steak and liquor to the Knight of Maha."

"Kn, Knight of Maha?"

Everyone's attention focused entirely on him.

Having heard about it now, Rian also observed the man while chewing his meat.

'So that person is the Knight of Maha. He's certainly big. Did he learn similar swordsmanship to mine?'

Satisfied with everyone's attention, the man arrogantly lifted his chin and pointed to himself with his thumb.

"That's right, I am the future great swordsman who cut down the entire Red Spear Bandit Group, the Knight of Maha!"

"Pffffff!"

Everything Rian had been chewing sprayed out of his mouth.
