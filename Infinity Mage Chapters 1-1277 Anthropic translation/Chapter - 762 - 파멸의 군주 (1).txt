[762] Lord of Destruction (1)

Minerva, flying toward the entrance of the palace, looked back at Sirone and said:

"I won, didn't I?"

Jet had arrived first, but Sirone was already completely focused on the battle.

"I'll take the leader."

"Suit yourself. But getting there won't be easy either."

Without answering, Sirone flapped his wings of light and flew toward the far end of the palace as Minerva landed at the entrance.

The moment she pulled out the diagonally embedded Jet, terrible poison spread from her body.

"Well, shall we start cleaning up?"

Breaking through the poison, demons boasting muscular 2-meter frames surrounded her.

"We'll chew you up alive!"

Even as their flesh rotted away, the demons showed no fear, which is why an army of 8 million was the strongest 8 million.

'Honestly, I'm a bit shaky.'

A stiff smile formed on Minerva's lips.

The area of the palace, thoroughly soaked in the dictator's greed, was among the largest in the world.

Ignoring all the demons swarming on the ground, Sirone headed for the leader's palace.

'I have to take out the leader.'

Eight million.

Easy to say aloud, but how many humans could truly imagine an army of 8 million?

Moreover, those currently on the ground were demons with martial prowess far superior to the average human.

'Maybe from the beginning...'

The thought suddenly occurred to him.

'This was an unwinnable war?'

Satan's army of 2 billion meant that if each demon killed just 2 humans, the entire world's population would be annihilated.

It was terrifying to think what would have happened if Zion hadn't reduced the spirit realm.

"What's that?"

In the sky along Sirone's flight path, ominous flames flickered.

"Grrrrrrrr."

Space opened and a face eaten away like by insects revealed itself in the real world.

Battalion Commander Reno.

A demon who transported hell's army, capable of holding 400 demons in his mouth.

"Yahweh...!"

Seeing the demons swarming inside the gaping mouth, Sirone's face contorted.

'Light Frenzy!'

As the curtain of light exploded and pulsed, boring into the mouth, the demons' screams deafened his eardrums.

"Kiyaaaaa!"

The vision filled with blood and flesh chunks suddenly burst open with a pop, and demons exploded out like fireworks.

Remaining forces: 7,999,231.

...It was endless.

Though he had instantly disintegrated 400 demons, none of the remaining demons felt any sense of loss.

'It's sickening...'

Yahweh loves all that exists and thus transcends good and evil, but...

There is no mercy for demons.

'Ataraxia!'

A massive halo was born and colorful information began pouring out madly.

Sirone aimed the magic circle completed simultaneously with activation toward the ground and fired a photon cannon.

Graaaaaaang!

The air howled as a flash dozens of meters in diameter struck diagonally downward and scraped across the ground in that state.

"Kuaaaaaa!"

Demons far stronger than humans were sent flying in all directions, but couldn't surpass Sirone's scale.

273, 398, 113, 198... The average number of demons dying per second reached roughly 200.

By the time the flash amplification ended, demon casualties exceeded 2,000, and Brigade Commander Sodas looked up at the sky.

"Beautiful..."

Remaining forces: 7,996,973.

"This is seriously driving me crazy."

Sirone wore a disgusted expression.

He didn't feel like the numbers had decreased, and experiencing the overwhelming power of such vast forces made him worry about Minerva.

He looked back toward the palace entrance, but all he could see were swarms of demons of varying heights.

Here and there he could see some over 10 meters tall.

'Can we really do this?'

Just as Sirone was lost in thought, the 44th Brigade of the 7th Division of the 24th Corps all looked up at the sky in unison.

"Yahweh is there! Fire!"

Hairless demons with crushed noses opened their mouths wide enough to dislocate their jaws, and filth shot out in a barrage.

'Destroy evil!'

As Yahweh's light expanded in the form of a Spirit Zone, the toxic filth turned to ash.

He was worried about Minerva.

'Just once, just once.'

The limit of Quantum Superposition that Sirone, having reached Yahweh's level, could deploy simultaneously was 100,000.

'This won't be nearly enough.'

But if they all cast Heaven's Punishment, then finally the army's strength would visibly weaken.

'Just for a moment.'

The problem was that he couldn't guarantee the safety of the main body performing Quantum Superposition, but Minerva wouldn't last long this way either.

'Quantum Superposition!'

100,000 overlaps.

His mind spun for a moment, then Sirone's body fell toward the ground at terrifying speed.

Blocking the impact of landing was about all the magic the main body could manage.

"Now!"

100,000 Sirones transformed into flashes of light, soaring into the sky and manifesting the incarnation of an archangel.

At the same time, Brigade Commander Sodas embraced Sirone's main body.

"Got you!"

Avatar Technique.

Heaven's Punishment.

Remaining forces: 5,668,227.

A spectacle like a shower of light adorned the palace as all the demons lost their hearing.

Remaining forces: 4,340,976.

The roar was so tremendous it was incomprehensible, and they only realized that a disaster-like impact had occurred on the ground.

Remaining forces: 3,365,763.

"Kuaaa!"

Though the death toll decreased with each cycle, circular bald patches of space had already formed in the plaza.

"Urgh!"

As Sodas strangled Sirone's neck with both hands, all 100,000 Sirones simultaneously stopped their bombardment.

'She aimed for the exact opening.'

It wasn't that he hadn't detected the approach with Spirit Zone, but his thinking speed couldn't keep up.

'Strong.'

And beautiful.

With a face so pure you couldn't think of her as a demon, her skin gave off a fresh fragrance like fruit.

"What are you doing? Continue."

Sirone frowned.

"...What?"

Sodas pressed her body completely against his, then moved one hand down to caress his chest.

"I'll protect you, so kill them all."

Though he was suspicious of her intentions this time, Sodas's eyes showed no wavering.

"Brigade-level demons won't be affected anyway, and the remaining ones can be reborn as much as they want."

As long as humans don't abandon evil, that would be the case.

"But they're your subordinates."

Tears flowed from Sodas's eyes.

"Actually, I... want to repent. Living as a demon is horrible now. So please... give me just one chance too..."

'They always say things like that.'

But Igor had said this:

There aren't absolutely no demons who repent.

"This is the last time. If you can purify my dirty body with your light, maybe I too..."

Sodas's pupils rolled upward.

"Ah, this is Yahweh's body..."

Contrary to lowering one hand, the side where Sodas put strength was her right hand gripping his neck.

'Die!'

Just as she tried to break Sirone's neck.

"Heok!"

Yahweh's light spread and starting from the hand gripping his neck, she began turning to ash and scattering.

"Huuuuk!"

Quantum Superposition had already been released.

"Again..."

At Sirone's voice, Sodas, who had been in agony, painfully lowered her gaze.

"You lied again."

Would anyone in the world believe a con artist with 20 prior convictions?

'A demon repenting?'

Parents believe.

When someone cries "Mom, I'll never do it again," whether they have 20 or 200 prior convictions, parents have no choice but to believe.

'That they can change, that this time is real...'

That's why Sirone felt sad even while annihilating demons—humanity's painful children who could never truly change.

"No."

Sodas, looking down at Sirone with pleading eyes, caressed his face with her hand turning to ash.

"I really tried to repent."

"Uaaaaa!"

Yahweh's light spread, and Sodas along with all the demons around her burned away.

"Heok! Heok!"

Even while stabilizing his mind with the Breathless breathing technique, enemies continued to surge endlessly.

"How's it going?"

As the kneeling Sirone turned around, Minerva had somehow arrived behind him.

She too looked clearly exhausted, her clothes torn to shreds by demon claws.

The Super Qualea sense could handle the mind like matter, and Sirone instantly regained his composure.

"So far so good. How about you, Minerva?"

"Me too... managing somehow."

This wasn't the time for a battle of wills.

"Please protect me. I'll activate Quantum Superposition again and sweep away the demons..."

"It's useless. Don't you understand yet? Yahweh's light is itself a powerful weapon against demons, but..."

Minerva aimed her pipe forward.

"That's because demons are non-corporeal. They'll take some damage, but it's ultimately just a matter of time—no matter how many you kill, there's no end."

"So you're saying to just leave them?"

"No."

Minerva said while exhaling green smoke.

"There's a more constructive method."

Sirone, blocking the incoming smoke, cast Heaven's Punishment on enemies in all directions.

"What are you planning?"

Remaining forces: 3,363,305.

"I'm going to use forbidden magic."

Sirone was already uneasy.

"If it's forbidden, you should abide by that. What kind of forbidden magic can be used so easily?"

"The Integrated Space-Time Management Department will take responsibility. Even if you don't trust me, Taeseong would be terrified if it were you. I'll give you three wish rejection vouchers instead."

"This isn't something to negotiate."

"Really?"

Minerva took a deep drag of smoke.

"Then I'll just get disciplined."

Disaster Magic.

Walking Dead.

As she puffed out her cheeks and moved her head from left to right while exhaling, green smoke billowed up like clouds.

"What are you even saying to people..."

"I already cast it."

At Minerva's words, Sirone, having assessed the situation, hurriedly looked around.

"Grrrrrr..."

Dozens of demons who inhaled the smoke stood for a moment with stupidly glazed pupils, then suddenly became violent.

But their targets weren't Minerva—they were the demons right next to them.

"What the hell is this..."

Minerva explained.

"Fratricidal magic, Walking Dead. Once infected, they only feel hostility toward their own kind. They lose consciousness, but won't die unless their heads are blown off."

"Walking Dead."

It was the name of a terrible disaster recorded in history books.

"Right. And the true terror of this masterpiece is..."

Minerva said, revealing killing intent.

"Infection."

Infected count: 48.

"Krrrrr... Kuaaaaa!"

A demon bitten by a demon rolled back its eyes and bit another demon nearby.

Infected count: 127.

"Follow me. We'll enter the leader's palace like this."

As demons began attacking their allies, the gaps in the clearing around Minerva gradually began to widen.

"You idiot! Why are you biting us!"

Infected count: 897.

Sirone stared blankly at the back of the great witch walking along the automatically widening path.

'Miracle Minerva.'

Though she was one of the five stars of the Human Safety Enforcement Department, perhaps she herself was a walking disaster.

"Those who side with humans are not demons!"

Infected count: 2,483.

"Hehe, will it be that easy?"

The higher the population density, the more the infection's power was maximized.

"Uaaa! No! Just kill me instead!"

Even before Nane, the worst fire that had once driven humanity to near extinction was spreading through the palace.

Infected count: 6,323.
