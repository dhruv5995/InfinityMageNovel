[670] Lord of Terror (1)

The 'Brain in a Vat' was La Enemy's unique ability that awakened human senses to perceive the reality of the hidden world.

A seventh sense phenomenon.

Under this overwhelmingly higher level of perception, the existing five senses had lost all meaning.

'Where are you?'

The wild dog that had lost its sense of smell was still wandering through hell.

'Come out. Show yourself before me.'

Dragging a bag full of daggers, Chagall walked endlessly down the blood-soaked path.

Though he had already slaughtered dozens of Gallopers, their flesh could not quench his thirst.

"La Enemy."

Chagall had killed La seven times.

He had undoubtedly cut off her breath, even mutilating the corpse until there was nothing left to stab.

'Why can't I kill her?'

The more times he killed La, the clearer the memory of that incident became, while the pleasure only grew duller.

By the seventh and final murder, he had lost his reason so completely that he could barely remember how he had killed her.

Because someone had already forgiven her.

Raiden's words came to mind.

'Because we are human, everyone makes mistakes. Then...'

Humanity itself is evil.

If even the possibility of choosing evil is itself evil, then no one in this world deserves to live.

'Kill, and kill, and kill again.'

When all possibilities for evil are eradicated, this world will achieve perfect stability.

Thus Chagall became a murderer.

Even knowing that he himself was the final target of his killing spree.

"What the hell is that?"

Quan turned his head at the sound of something being dragged.

For the first time, tension appeared on his face, which had remained calm even before the grotesque phenomena of the hidden world.

"Who are you?"

Chagall, who had stopped approaching with just one motion of a sword being pointed at him, was feeling something similar.

'He's like me.'

A genius, but also a twisted one.

"How many have you killed?"

When Chagall asked about the number of corpses accumulated to reach this level, Quan sneered and replied:

"One."

As always, the one person visible before his eyes was everything.

"So you're Chagall."

Chagall didn't respond.

"Consider it bad luck. I don't know how you ended up drifting here, but I can't let you go back like this."

Though Quan had never shared any special bond with Etela, if he had to choose sides, he'd be on hers.

"Huuuuu."

Chagall swayed his upper body left and right.

Within this motion that anyone could imitate lay deep principles of pendulum movement.

As the world seemed to sway, Quan felt bitter.

'Was this what it was like?'

Having always fought from the position of deceiver, he found himself intrigued even while falling victim to Chagall's technique.

"Sorry, but..."

Quan's body soared like a hawk.

"That's my technique."

Asymmetric Ultimate Art:
Clown Pierrot.

As his trajectory twisted mid-air, Chagall's body swayed from the illusion of the world tilting.

'What... is this?'

The bewilderment was brief, and sensing the chilling killing intent, he kicked off the ground and launched his body.

Quan's blade grazed his shoulder.

'Circus style. And the strongest acrobat at that.'

The cells controlled by his schema heated up.

How long had it been since he felt such intense desire to kill someone?

"Kekekeke."

Landing and simultaneously twisting his waist, Chagall threw his bag into the air, causing dozens of daggers to pour down like rain.

From the midst of that shower of blades, his two arms moved faster than insect wings.

Quan's eyebrows twitched at the vibration in the air.

'Folding.'

A technique that folded part of the schema to enhance specific functions.

More extreme versions included Creasing (Over Pace) and Tearing (abandoning physical feedback), but the aftereffects were considerable.

'This will be quite troublesome.'

Quan's trajectory, which had been infiltrating behind his opponent, warped and curved before circling around again.

Chagall grinned with a bloody smile and swung his arms.

"Come at me, acrobat."

The daggers dancing in mid-air moved simultaneously, spewing shells of rapid-fire swords in all directions.

'Tch, he has ranged techniques too?'

Judging that prolonging the fight was disadvantageous, Quan expelled twelve external gravitational forces and slithered into Chagall's domain like a snake.

'Here he comes.'

Chagall's eyes flashed open, and finally the strongest acrobat and the strongest juggler clashed in a contest of skills.

"A sense that breaks down the boundaries of space."

Having heard the explanation about spatial perception, Sirone asked:

"What kind of sense is that exactly?"

Mayray shook her head.

"There's no way to explain it. Temporal perception is completed through the integration of the five senses, so ordinary people can sometimes feel it too. But spatial perception is the integration of the sixth sense. For beings with only five senses, it's nearly impossible to even imagine."

Jane said:

"But technically speaking, Sirone should be capable of it, right? Since he's already perfectly integrated the sixth sense."

If ordinary people could receive help from the sixth sense, then Sirone also had a high probability of feeling the seventh sense under special conditions.

While this could be a major clue for escaping the hidden world, from the person in question's perspective, it was difficult to even grasp.

"Even if you say that, I need to know what it is to even try."

Sirone looked at Mayray with a glimmer of hope, but she seemed to have no particular memories about spatial perception either.

"What's certain is that the hidden world overlaps with the world we lived in. It's distinguished in the realm of senses, not that the existing world has disappeared."

If it was truly one world at the level of higher senses, then humanity couldn't have been unaffected by the hidden world's interference.

Sirone thought about times when he'd felt inexplicably chilled while alone.

Could the imagination of countless artists be definitively said to have come solely from their minds?

If they had been influenced by the hidden world in some way, then this place was truly the source from which human inspiration flowed.

'One space simultaneously contains past, present, and future.'
This is temporal perception.

'One time simultaneously contains existence and non-existence.'
This is spatial perception.

'Therefore, if I could simultaneously perceive both the existing world and the hidden world, I could escape from here. The problem is the method...'

As Sirone was lost in thought, the structure made of hearts suddenly began beating rapidly.

"What! What's happening!"

The members woke up with startled expressions, and the core members who sensed the change all stood up at once.

"What's that?"

A crack in space split vertically, revealing another master of the hidden world.

Three meters tall, clad in black iron armor, with the inside of his helmet dark as if empty.

He rode a black horse with its eyes gouged out, and blue flames flickered alive at the tip of his lowered spear.

"I remember now."

Mayray trembled as she spoke.

"Igor, Lord of Terror. The reason the terror-stricken members died was because this is his domain."

The Brain in a Vat transforms human five senses into vivid raw sensations, and Igor's terror strikes directly at that brain.

Lufist asked:

"Is he strong?"

"His rank is Division Commander. I haven't heard of his combat power through divine revelation."

If the hidden world's hierarchy was similar to the existing world, Division Commander was certainly not a low position.

"Lactas Vera Imera (Submit to terror)!"

Raising his right arm high, Igor drove his blue flame-burning spear into the ground.

"Huuu."

Kergoin exhaled cigarette smoke in a long stream.

"How about it? Not bad for an old man, right?"

Joshua, who had tidied his clothes and even meticulously adjusted his breastplate, snatched Kergoin's cigarette.

"Cut the nonsense and stay sharp. I couldn't even sleep because of this."

"One sleepless night won't kill you. My mood's pretty much settled now, so... huh?"

Kergoin, who was trying to snatch back his cigarette, was startled to see the burning butt at Joshua's fingertips.

"What are you doing? Doesn't that hurt?"

He slapped her hand to make her drop the cigarette, but she didn't even feel that and was staring intently at something.

"Leo..."

Her son who had died of heatstroke at age four was looking at Joshua from inside a narrow alley.

"Mom, I hurt so much. My body hurts so much."

"Leo!"

As Joshua jumped up and ran toward the alley, Kergoin threw on his robe and chased after her.

"Wait! Why are you suddenly..."

But he too froze upon seeing the woman standing in his path.

"Mariang?"

A woman he had met during his rookie years and promised a future with, but who had died in a monster ambush during a mission.

While she was being devoured, Kergoin had fled with all his might, realizing then that his remaining life would be nothing but despair.

"I was too... too young. Too scared! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Mariang!"

"Scared? More scared than me? See exactly what I went through then!"

The events of that day 40 years ago unfolded on Kergoin's retina, revealing the horrific scene.

"No, no!"

The terror hidden beyond oblivion activated.

"Nooooo!"

"No! I'm not a coward!"

Baikon, armed in heavy armor, crouched his bear-like massive frame and trembled.

Memories of being ostracized among friends in childhood were dyeing the prosecutor's mind with terror.

Memories of terrible mistakes everyone experiences at least once in life.

Only the core members maintained silence while observing the events unfolding on their retinas.

"What's this place now?"

Without analyzing the current phenomenon at all, Lian shouldered his great sword and moved forward.

"Murderer!"

From the endless sea of darkness, corpses rose above the surface.

"I... admitted defeat. I had absolutely no intention of stabbing you in the back. Yet you cut me down mercilessly."

That was true.

"To become stronger? You killed me for such a trivial reason? Do you know how many lives your ambition has claimed?"

That was true.

"My family starved to death. Because you killed me. It's all because of you! You're a murderer!"

As hundreds of corpses he had killed formed an encirclement and shouted, Lian remained silent.

"Die! Repent with death for your life full of mistakes, for the countless lives ruined by your mistakes!"

Rotting, tattered corpses rushed toward Lian with desperate movements.

"This is the tragedy you created!"

Simultaneously, Lian contorted his expression, bared his teeth, and swung his great sword in a wide arc.

The corpses, split in two by a single strike, fell to the ground and raised their hands with sorrowful expressions.

"Why..."

Bloody tears flowed from their festering eyes.

"Are you not ashamed as a human? Having taken so many lives, do you have no conscience at all?"

If Lian had truly been cold-blooded, he wouldn't have experienced such memories in the first place.

"It's conviction."

Not a subject for understanding or analysis.

"Whether nightmares, evil spirits, or truly resurrected ones."

As Lian trampled the face of the corpse shedding bloody tears, its brain exploded with a splat.

"If I've cut once, I can cut again countless times."

Whoooosh!

As corpses filling the space shrieked like demons and rushed at him, Lian entered the midst of the crowd and swung his sword.

"Die! Die! Repay with death!"

"Wait for me in hell, you idiots."

Lian's face contorted with rage as he butchered the already dead bodies again.

"I'll gladly die after establishing the Kingdom of Conviction."

Behind Lian, who was cutting straight through the tide of corpses, a great path was opening.
