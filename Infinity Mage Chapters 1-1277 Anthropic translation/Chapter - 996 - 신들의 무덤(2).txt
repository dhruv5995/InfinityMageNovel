Grave of the Gods (2)

Ymir had left.

He was probably waiting for Sirone's group in the deepest part of the maternal psyche, the first stage of the deep layers.

"But..."

Kang Nan's voice was heard.

"Is this really a nightmare? For something like that, Ymir seemed way too calm."

Arius answered.

"He wasn't calm. You can tell just from how he immediately left. Of course, he didn't cry in terror, but it does seem like the situation was unpleasant for him."

Miro asked.

"What could have been unpleasant?"

"There's something I need to mention first," Mong-a said.

"The dream is currently uncontrolled. It's because Ymir isn't defining us as anything. You could call it a kind of text state. It's an obstacle."

"Arius, isn't there a way?"

"We need to find a keyword connected to the 5th deep layer, the unconscious. The problem is that there are only eyeballs, and the bigger problem is that there are over 10 billion of them."

Gaold muttered.

"Isn't there some special eyeball?"

Everyone looked around, but at any given moment, only about a third of them would blink.

"Fear. Fear."

Arius examined the eyes again.

"In the end, this dream is the only hint. Why would 10 billion eyeballs make Ymir afraid? The dismantling of the Ultima System? The very fact of being defined?"

"Maybe it's not the eyes?" Sirone said.

"To be more precise, this dream doesn't only contain eyeballs. There's also the vacuum-like state, and us too. More precisely, us who haven't been defined."

"Hmm, I see."

Arius, who had been lost in thought, suddenly raised his head.

"Grave of the Gods."

As if receiving some revelation, he muttered and then spoke to everyone with an excited voice.

"Yes, this is a nightmare. Ymir said so himself, that his memories are the grave of the gods. It's actually impossible, so I was overlooking it, but if it's Ymir, it makes sense."

"Explain it so we can understand."

"Based on this 6th stage REM area, consciousness and unconsciousness are separated. Conversely, this place is a middle ground where consciousness and unconsciousness are mixed. But look at this dream. There's nothing. In other words, he's not conscious of anything."

Sein asked.

"Because he's too strong?"

"Yes. To Ymir, all matter is lighter than air. There are absolutely no special stimuli transmitted through the senses. This is exactly that vacuum-like state."

"So hearing is everything. But why does that become a nightmare? It's the same in reality."

"Because they exist in reality. Since his birth, Ymir has defeated countless powerful enemies. They would be beings revered as gods in any civilization. For Ymir, sensory experiences are at most that level. A handful of powerful enemies you could count on your fingers."

The faces of all the enemies Ymir had fought so far flashed through Sirone's mind.

"Usually, that kind gets placed in the realm of consciousness. You know, there are memories you can never forget in your lifetime, right? But Ymir is probably the opposite. His sensation-starved unconscious absorbs those stimuli like a sponge."

"Then what's in the realm of consciousness?"

"Only shells remain. In reality, there might not have been much on the surface. That's what makes it more serious. Probably from below the REM area, from the 5th deep stage onward..."

Arius spoke in a solemn voice.

"The powerful enemies who gave Ymir the greatest stimulation of his life will be holding their ground."

Grave of the Gods.

"They exist in reality. They'd be somewhere in the universe. But they're not in this dream. That's why it's a nightmare. He's dreaming of all his powerful enemies disappearing and not being able to feel any stimulation. That's probably why he provoked us."

Miro said.

"I understand. So how do we go down?"

"In the end, it's those eyes. The way to escape the nightmare is to give Ymir stimulation equivalent to the opponents he's fought. We'll be entering the grave of the gods."

Silence flowed.

Normally, volunteers would have been overflowing, but since the opponent was Ymir, they needed time to think.

Miro asked.

"So... who wants to do it? No, before that, what exactly are we supposed to do? Do we just hit really hard?"

Arius said.

"Those eyes don't even define our physical bodies in the first place. Kang Nan's schema might have some possibility, but magic would probably be better. Either Sirone or Gaold should do it."

"Hey, what about me?"

To Miro's words, Arius avoided giving a direct answer.

"Let's try attacking. Whoever has higher single destructive power between Sirone and Gaold should do it."

When neither of them answered, Miro chuckled.

"Right, well said. Gaold, if you and Sirone really went at it, who would be stronger?"

Gaold said halfheartedly.

"You're not a kid, how childish..."

Of course he said that, but the fact that Gaold didn't give a definitive answer was surprisingly noteworthy.

"Huh, what? Don't tell me even Gaold holds back in front of Sirone? Why? Not confident?"

"Are you Satan?"

Eventually Gaold decided to step up, and before long, Air Press was cast.

"Kuuuuugh!"

Tremendous pain rushed in, but the 10 billion eyes did not define the magic.

"...It's not working?"

Everyone who had been waiting with relief because it was Gaold finally realized the seriousness.

"Let me try."

When Sirone's voice was heard, Gaold said.

"Wait."

Kang Nan tried to persuade him.

"Don't let your pride get in the way. Ymir is the strongest enemy. Even if we combined our strength, it wouldn't be enough..."

"That's not the problem." Gaold's voice was serious.

"Even though it's magic I cast, I can't gauge its power. It'll be the same for Sirone."

Miro tried it herself.

"You're right. There's no sense of reality at all. I need to run with all my might, but it's like I'm only imagining it. I can't establish a standard like this."

"But I can establish one."

Gaold said.

"I can use pain as the standard. If I keep increasing the power like that, I'll reach the realistic optimum, my full strength."

Kang Nan was worried.

"Will you be okay? Even if you reach the realistic optimum, if the nightmare doesn't break..."

Only Gaold had a standard, and the Gaold she knew was not someone who would give up.

"A god, huh."

Gaold split his lips in a grin.

'Let's see your face.'

As Air Press was cast, Gaold's pain began to soar endlessly.

"Kuuuuugh!"

He had already reached full power, but the nightmare still wouldn't budge.

'Right, so you're the master here?'

As Kang Nan had worried, Gaold ran even faster toward the corridor of blades spread before his eyes.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

When Gaold's desperate scream was heard, Kang Nan activated her schema to the extreme.

"Gaold! Gaold!"

She seemed to feel some physical sensation, but it was still far from reality.

"Stop it! Are you planning to die before we even fight!"

"Be quiet, wait."

Miro said coldly.

"There's no way we can help anyway. Let Gaold handle it himself."

Kang Nan was dying of frustration that she couldn't grab Miro by the collar right now.

"Uaaaah!"

Gaold's screaming was truly a nightmare, and finally Sein spoke up.

"Miro, this is too long."

It was the first time Gaold, who usually subdued opponents in an instant, had prolonged Air Press for so long.

"He'll die at this rate."

Until Miro told him to stop, Gaold would absolutely never stop.

"If he dies, he dies. Are we going to live here?"

Sein also loved her, but as expected, at times like this he couldn't help but feel creeped out.

Finally Sirone stepped forward.

"I think we should first..."

At that moment, the eyeballs seemed to shake, and everyone felt a faint vibration in their bodies.

"Sensation..."

They were being defined.

The form of Gaold, howling like a beast, began to be reflected as the nerves running through their bodies.

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

Finally, with a thud, a crater hundreds of meters in radius was created in the floor of the nightmare.

Mong-a, who had taken form, said.

"The nightmare is over."

At the same time, Gaold collapsed to the floor with a thump and let out rough breaths.

"Haak! Haak!"

"Gaold!"

The moment Kang Nan threw herself forward, Miro approached first and patted his back.

"Wow, impressive! You did well. Really well."

Seeing Gaold's shoulders trembling, Kang Nan momentarily lost her reason.

"At least you accomplished something? As expected, it was worth bringing you..."

Before she could finish speaking, Kang Nan grabbed Miro by the collar and pulled her upright.

Not stopping there, she raised her arm, making Miro's toes stand on the ground like awls.

"Are you crazy?"

Miro's gaze looking down at Kang Nan, who was growling like a wolf, was terribly cold.

"What, all of a sudden?"

"I've known since before that you're a psychopath, but listen carefully. If you play with Gaold one more time, I'll smash you to pieces."

Miro glanced at Gaold for a moment.

"I've also known since before that you're stupid."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"We came here to fight for the world, didn't we? We broke through in the end. Do you think we would have gotten this result if I had stopped Gaold?"

"Is that... the optimal choice?"

"Yes. Because there are kids like you who get beaten by evil after being swayed by weak emotions, I fight. I carry everything and block it until the end."

Kang Nan pulled Miro up even higher.

"Say it. That you won't use Gaold again."

"I don't want to. Do you even have that right? Most importantly, Gaold says he'll do it."

Kang Nan raised her fist.

"You might really get hit if you keep this up."

When it looked like it might turn violent, the group approached, but Miro's killing intent came first.

"Let go."

The incarnation of Thousand-Armed Guanyin rose high, and thousands of arms pointed at Kang Nan.

"This is your last chance."

In an atmosphere where Thousand-Armed Guanyin seemed ready to move at any moment, Gaold stood up.

"Miro."

From his back, which felt larger than before, a hot energy like fire was emanating.

"You're right. We came here to fight. I won't fall from just this much. But..."

Power entered his quiet voice.

"Don't touch Kang Nan."

Kang Nan's head whipped around, and Miro's eyes shook for a brief moment.

'It was the same in Heaven.'

Even after sacrificing his life to save Miro, Gaold had headed into danger again to save Kang Nan.

"Uncle..."

Gaold gave a dry smile.

"Haha, I told you not to worry. We've come this far, so we need to go catch him, the god."

Miro doesn't know.

When Gaold fell into hell and lost consciousness, how a fourteen-year-old girl protected him.

'She'll never know forever.'

As human emotions dug into her heart, Miro desperately pulled herself together.

'I can't break. I can't break.'

Her eyes quickly cooled, and she smiled brightly as if nothing had happened, raising both arms.

"Alright. Sorry. Now will you let go of this?"

Kang Nan's anger wasn't resolved, but she was more worried about Gaold's condition.

She let go of the collar and moved away while supporting Gaold.

"Are you really okay?"

"I told you I'm fine. Seriously, such a bad temper. When are you going to fix that habit?"

"Who started it first? Why? Are you scared you might actually get hit?"

"Haha! You'd be lucky not to die. Well, you'd need at least that much guts to say something like that, wouldn't you?"

"Huh?"

Gaold, who was lying on Kang Nan's knee catching his breath, pointed at her with his index finger.

"You said you'd become the world's strongest woman, right?"

"Ah."

She definitely remembered, but had she ever told Gaold about that?

"Do you know how old you were then? When exactly was that story from..."

"You'll definitely become it."

His eyelids slowly closed and Gaold soon fell asleep, breathing evenly.

Miro watched Kang Nan, who was smiling while placing her hand on Gaold's forehead.

She thought she was a beautiful person.
