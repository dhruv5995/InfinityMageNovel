[748] Turbulent Times (4)

The Gustav Empire.

The Gustav Empire, which divided the world into three parts along with Kashan and the Jincheon Empire, was plunged into sorrow by the Emperor's death.

Black flags fluttered everywhere in the streets, and no one showed their teeth in a smile.

If anyone was caught smiling, not only they but their entire family would be beheaded that very day.

Forcing out tears was a natural refinement expected of imperial citizens, and many suffered nightmares from the wailing that could be heard from every household.

Thus, Habitz XVI quietly passed away at the age of 122 on a cold night when the stars shone brightly.

Officially, that is.

While the entire nation boiled with the fervor of grief, there was only one place where laughter and the ecstasy of pleasure never ceased.

It was Arcaba, at the empire's easternmost end, ruled by Habitz XVI's youngest son, Habitz XVII.

The expression of the official heading through the Grand Hall of Arcaba Palace toward Habitz XVII's villa was completely rigid.

'An absolute fact that must never be revealed. The Emperor...'

Had died mad with pleasure.

Habitz XVI's corpse was found with his eyes bulging blue-green, having expelled filth from every orifice.

The 17 women who had been in bed with him, along with the head maid who made the initial report, were beheaded on the spot.

'The only remaining bloodline of Gustav, Habitz XVII.'

Habitz XVI had sired 782 children over 122 years, but all of them were no longer of this world.

This was due to the unique succession system passed down in the Gustav imperial family—royals over the age of 20 received a license to kill relatives.

Any royal over 20 could kill anyone, and in unavoidable cases, a successor would be determined through special trials.

Habitz XVII had also become the final heir four years ago by brutally executing 17 royals.

'In other words...'

He had killed 781 siblings.

Despite the fact that he should have immediately rushed to the capital to hold the succession ceremony upon the Emperor's death, he still remained here because...

'Baseless confidence that was nonetheless absolute.'

Anyone who knew of Habitz XVII's conduct would unanimously say this:

An unanalyzable, unknown entity.

That's why even the empire's renowned nobles didn't dare attempt a coup.

The capital's envoy who had reached the massive golden door swallowed dry saliva and took a deep breath.

"..."

Moans of pleasure and ecstasy could be heard penetrating through the door.

"Your Majesty, Capital Interior Minister Darmov requests an audience."

Instead of an answer, screams of men and women could be heard, and as if that were a signal, the guards opened the door.

'This surpasses imagination.'

The smell of corruption hit his nose first, and in the vast space, 200 men and women were engaging in bestial acts.

Beautiful boys and girls, all lovely and young, but when seen as a mass, it was like looking at monsters with grotesque appendages.

"What are you?"

A completely naked middle-aged man sat on a golden chair, smoking a pipe.

'That one is...'

The Desire King, Gustav Habitz XVII.

His face was unattractively long with a horse-like nose, but his eyes were beautiful like a woman's, creating perfect discord.

'Indeed, just as I'd heard.'

In this place filled with the air of pleasure, only he alone did nothing and watched others' acts.

Rumor had it that what he was smoking was Askha.

It was a powerful drug banned even in the empire because forcing someone to stop even for a day would drive them to suicide.

'But Habitz XVII enjoys Askha.'

He smoked exactly 3 grams every 24 hours.

'The strongest restraint creates the greatest desire.'

This was a famous saying that represented Habitz's tendencies and the reason he survived among over 700 siblings.

"The empire is plunged in sorrow over the Emperor's death. You must hold the succession ceremony as soon as possible."

"How bothersome. There are no women or men I want to undress, no objects I want to possess, no ambitions there. I'll visit when I want to become Emperor, so give it to anyone for now."

Habitz let out a snicker and pointed at Darmov.

"How about you do it instead? It wouldn't be bad to fondle the beauty called the empire before you die."

'What kind of confidence is this?'

Feeling chills, Darmov hastily replied.

"This humble servant is too foolish to know how to receive Your Majesty's jest."

"Puhahahaha!"

Askha smoke poured out from Habitz's throat as he turned his head and laughed.

The laughter suddenly stopped.

"Just as one fears pain, one fears pleasure too."

Habitz put the pipe back in his mouth.

"Does just imagining great pleasure make your heart race? Are you afraid you won't be able to restrain yourself, that you'll lose yourself?"

It felt as if his airway was blocked—he couldn't breathe.

'Please, please let this end quickly.'

Darmov regretted becoming the empire's Interior Minister for the first time in his life.

"Father was like that."

Habitz XVI had tasted all the sweetness in the world, but there was one thing he couldn't have.

"Adrias Miro, wasn't it?"

Guffin's successor and humanity's greatest defender who blocked heaven's army with dimensional barriers.

From the moment he lost her before his eyes, Habitz XVI became obsessed with pleasure like someone whose thirst could never be quenched.

"He lost his self-control. I have no interest in being Emperor, but from that perspective, he was a pathetic human."

Having served the Emperor his entire life, Darmov couldn't help but speak up this time.

"Your Majesty, for one who will receive the Emperor's title to make disparaging remarks about the former Emperor is..."

"Not a problem at all."

Habitz XVII stood up from his chair.

"If this world, you see, is about some god fellow giving us problems to solve and receiving rewards for solving them..."

Swiish—a sword beside the chair was drawn.

"Everything would have been simple. No one would be wronged, and there'd be no worrying about living this way or that way. But you see,"

Habitz descended the stairs and kicked the men and women rolling around in front.

"There were no problems to begin with. This world is, how should I put it... like a plaza. Just gathering here and doing whatever."

Since there are no problems, there are no correct answers either.

"Whatever you do in it..."

The sword pierced through the bodies of the two people rolling on the floor and struck the ground with a thud, making Darmov flinch.

"Nothing happens."

The one pierced by the sword moaned, but those addicted to Askha paid no attention.

Habitz pulled out the sword with a swoosh, gazed at the blood-stained blade for a moment, then shrugged.

"There, I killed someone. What's your opinion? Do you think I did something bad?"

The sword blade touched Darmov's nape.

"The empire's subjects are all Your Majesty's possessions, so..."

"No, no! That's not it! What I mean is, there's nothing in this world that shouldn't be done! That doesn't mean there's anything that must be done either. Just...!"

Habitz shook his head looking for words, then turned to Darmov and shouted.

"It's nothing at all!"

The blood-stained sword pointed at the corpse.

"Dead! Must be painful. So what? What happens to me? They're just dead! I just killed them!"

"Huk. Huk."

Urine flowed down Darmov's pants.

"That's what makes the current world interesting."

If human emotions became reality and covered us, what form would Habitz's emotions take?

"I have no interest in being Emperor. If you came to tell boring stories, I'll make them interesting."

"The... the Holy War is opening."

Darmov desperately squeezed out his voice.

"It's the 420th conference. Since the empire has no master... Your Majesty must enter the Holy War... Huk!"

Suddenly the sword was withdrawn.

"Hmm, the Holy War."

Habitz's eyelids trembled as he closed his eyes in thought, showing the whites.

"Yes, it's much more interesting than the empire."

Woorin.

"Ah, this is really driving me crazy. This is truly hard to endure..."

Confirming that blood was rushing to Habitz's center, Darmov slowly backed away.

"Yes, that's exactly it. Finger by finger, snap... snap..."

He didn't want to think about what kind of imagination that was.

"But that's just intermission entertainment. True desire isn't like that. Do you know what I really want to violate, Interior Minister?"

"I wouldn't know..."

"The world. Everything that exists."

Holding the sword and spreading both arms, Habitz's center became completely vertical and stood erect above his navel.

'He's not human. Even if he is human, we must not categorize this one within the realm of humanity.'

The new Emperor, Gustav Habitz XVII.

"I will violate the entire world."

A single fly that had come from who knows where was flying around the ceiling.

Akaad Southern Desert.

In this place, the epicenter of Noscarta, the equatorial wind called the god of the desert, 3,000 demons who had escaped from the spirit realm gathered.

"Division Commander, there are no more places to occupy."

The murky, gloomy voice was directed toward a demon warrior wearing over a ton of armor.

4th Corps, 2nd Division Commander, Surga Gacias.

"..."

Ma魔 (Demon).

Though it has negative connotations for humans, it was originally a general term for phenomena manifesting from strong collective consciousness.

While humans' power was distributed among numerous countries, the demon race was unified under Satan's name.

The so-called 72 Corps directly under Satan.

The extreme fear generated when humans die flows intact into the other world as Ma魔.

The frequency of Ma魔 occurrence was almost identical to the number of deaths recorded in human history, a figure that starkly revealed what kind of lives most humans had lived.

And the 72 Corps commanders nurtured hell's army of over 2 billion using their fear as nourishment.

"What is occupation? Looking down from above at a state of perfect subjugation."

In that sense, the 2nd Division under the 4th Corps could not be said to have occupied the southern desert.

"Now we go to deal with the last remaining one."

Ultimately, demons could be said to be a race made from the dregs of information left behind by human extinction—that is, souls.

The furnace that melts Ma魔 is called the 'fire plate,' where 'hellfire' that melts human souls burns constantly.

When souls that fall into that hellfire are purified, they merge into one to become demons, with abilities determined by the characteristics of their combination.

"Let's go, my faithful subordinates."

In Satan's army, the position of division commander was equivalent to a national commander in human military ranks.

Though the spirit realm was reduced through the Zion Project, humanity had essentially left the worst Ma魔 abandoned in the desert.

"Kill the humans! Each time they scream, we will become stronger. Grant them the most horrific deaths!"

Therefore, humans define Ma like this:

Evil demons 惡魔.

"This world is ours!"

An army of 3,000 crossed the desert.

Their destination was the pyramid where Gaold and Gangnan were hiding—the dungeon of Zulu, the great mage of the Paras Kingdom.
