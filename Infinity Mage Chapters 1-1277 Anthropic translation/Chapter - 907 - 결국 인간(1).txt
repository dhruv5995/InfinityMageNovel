Eventually Human (1)

Amy and Nane had built a campfire.

Fish caught from a nearby stream were skewered on wooden sticks, slowly cooking to a golden brown.

'That looks delicious.'

Receiving signals from her brain, Amy's stomach growled.

"Oh."

Nane said with a laugh.

"I suppose the meal was rather modest."

For Amy, who was used to high-calorie military rations, Nane's diet was definitely lacking.

"Feel free to speak casually. We're about the same age anyway."

"I'm probably two years younger."

If she was the Buddha of this era, there was no need to question her talent, but hearing her actual age made Amy feel bitter inside.

"You've just become an adult? You really are a genius."

"It's not a matter of time."

"No, it is a matter of time. Having fast thinking speed means time flows that much slower for you."

When Nane utilized her brain functions to the fullest, time barely flowed, almost at a standstill.

"Please don't praise me too much. Shirone's insight is no less remarkable. His thinking transcends logic."

Amy's expression softened.

Hearing Nane acknowledge Shirone brought an inexplicable sense of relief washing over her.

"Do you really have to fight?"

The world was heading toward catastrophe, but perhaps the answer was closer than they thought.

"Can't you work things out with Shirone through dialogue? He's a reasonable person. I'm sure you could find another solution together."

"I know that."

Nane felt the same way.

"But there's no need for that. Even now, in this world, countless Shirones and countless Nanes are having debates."

It was a world overflowing with all kinds of opinions.

"In that process, countless people are suffering. Dialogue isn't necessary. It's time to push through."

"I don't really understand."

She understood it intellectually, but...

"The reason I fight for humanity is ultimately because I want to be happy. I can't understand why you and Shirone try to carry so much on your shoulders."

"Yes. That way of thinking is precisely what makes you human."

"You're human too."

Nane fell silent.

"You said you would love me to understand Shirone. I can't really understand even that, but I think I know one thing."

Amy spoke with a pitying expression.

"This person is truly lonely too."

Nane's eyes wavered.

"No one will be able to understand your enlightenment. That's why you carry everything on your shoulders, but...

Just like Shirone.

"At least I can acknowledge that you're fighting a lonely battle. So when things get hard, you can give up, and when you're sad, you can cry. You're human before you're Buddha."

In that moment.

A single tear rolled down Nane's cheek.

'Poor person.'

The reason Amy wasn't surprised to see Nane's tears was because she had already seen Shirone's tears.

These were the tears of Nane the human, not Buddha.

"I'm sorry. This is so..."

As Nane tried to wipe away her tears, Amy approached and slowly extended her hand.

"Really, I can't understand it."

Her thumb wiped beneath Nane's eyes.

"You're so different...

Two people who are truly different.

"But you look exactly the same when you cry."

The moment she saw Amy looking at her with the same eyes she used when looking at Shirone.

Nane's heart began to beat rapidly.

Gaold regained consciousness.

"Where am I?"

He was lying spread-eagle in the middle of a dense forest with no sign of human presence.

"How much time has passed?"

He questioned himself, but his brain, which had already lost its memories, gave no answer.

"Grraaaah!"

As another wave of agony struck, nerves rose grotesquely along Gaold's neck.

'Here it comes again.'

Life was assaulting him.

"Aaaaaaah!"

Because he was alive.

For that reason alone, the terrible pain he had to endure paralyzed his reason.

"Keke! Kekeke!"

Even while shedding tears of blood, laughter leaked from Gaold's lungs.

"Want me to tell you something interesting?"

No matter how much it hurt.

"I don't die."

What created the current Gaold wasn't the pain of his masochistic mutation, but the endurance to withstand it.

"Nngh."

As the pain gradually showed signs of subsiding, Gaold crawled on his belly and leaned his back against a tree.

"Haaaaah..."

Pleasure rushing in at the end of the pain made his vision hazy, and he saw inexplicable visions.

At some point, his brain had begun secreting endorphins far beyond normal levels to reduce the shock.

"Hehehehe."

Lost in pleasure, Gaold let out idiotic laughter while his limbs trembled.

The reason he had sent away even Kang Nan and Zulu to be alone was because he didn't want to show them his current state.

"Miro."

In the flickering scenery like electricity, he saw a vision of Miro crying with a sad face.

"Don't cry."

That's just how life is.

"Don't cry."

As Gaold's pupils dilated, his memories began to cross over to the other side of oblivion once again.

"That's the place."

Minerva, carrying Taeseong on her jet, pointed with her hand at the devastating scene spread across the ground.

"Good heavens..."

The traces left by Gaold while he had lost his memory.

As if meteors had fallen from the sky, craters were formed consecutively along a 100-kilometer stretch.

Freed, who was riding Armanta's World Wheel with them, muttered with a disgusted expression.

"Planet-level power. No wonder there's no way to withstand it."

Minerva turned her head toward Taeseong, whose face had turned pale as paper, and said.

"Please bear with it a little longer. We should be able to catch up soon."

Syng said.

"We lost time because of Gaold's rampage. If he won't cooperate, eliminating him is also an option."

The Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower, who had been heading directly to Lian, urgently changed direction due to the sudden destruction.

'Normally we'd ignore it and keep going, but...'

If they didn't stop the magic of the half-mad Gaold, the planet itself would be destroyed first.

"It ended there."

After passing through areas where forests and rivers had all become wasteland, dense woodlands spread out before them.

"Found him."

As Syng detected Gaold with the Law and changed direction, the others followed.

"Hah. Hah."

When they arrived at the forest, Gaold was trembling while covered in all kinds of filth.

"Damn it."

The destructive mage who had been wreaking havoc was nothing more than a piece of meat in human form, contrary to expectations.

"He's completely ruined."

"Kikiki."

Gaold, whose focus returned briefly, burst into laughter upon seeing Taeseong and the four Great Stars.

He didn't miss their imposing presence, but his mind was already pickled in endorphins.

"Hey, where's the Central Continent?"

No one answered Gaold's question.

"I need to get to the battlefield, but as you can see, my brain's gone to hell. Where exactly is this place?"

Gaold was actually heading toward the Central Continent, but Minerva didn't want to reveal that.

"Former President of the Tormia Magic Association, Mikea Gaold."

Even hearing the title after so long, Gaold only opened his eyes drowsily and coughed hollowly.

"We are the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower. And this person is the pinnacle of the Ivory Tower and avatar of the planet, Taeseong."

Gaold's gaze shifted to the pale Taeseong.

"Nice to meet you."

Taeseong tried his best to smile despite his difficulty, but Gaold's gaze turned away indifferently.

"So what do you want me to do about it?"

Freed grabbed his sword hilt and stepped forward, but Minerva stopped him.

"I respect you as one mage who has reached the level of destruction. But if you're already in an uncontrollable state, it's also true that you pose a threat to Taeseong."

Gaold listened silently.

"Going to the Central Continent means you still have the will to fight. So I'll ask: among good, evil, fairness, and love, what are you fighting for?"

"Kik."

Though he wanted to hold back as much as possible, Gaold couldn't suppress the sneer bursting from within.

"What bullshit."

Since Minerva had shown maximum courtesy, even she had to furrow her brow this time.

Gaold lifted his chin and said.

"Looking at you guys, you really love your convictions. Do you feel like you bastards become something great just by deciding on something and following it?"

Armanta spun his World Wheel.

"Watch your words."

It was a clear threat, but Gaold instead split his lips in a grin and compressed the air in front of him.

"How should one live?" When even breathing and living day by day was painfully difficult.

"Good, evil, fairness, love?"

As tremendous pressure was applied to a fist-sized air bullet, the atmosphere shook terrifyingly.

"What the hell do I care about that crap!"

KWAAAAAAAANG!

As the air gun fired with a roar, the four Great Stars leaped into action.

"Phew!"

Freed, who had drawn his sword before anyone knew it, pressed his hand to the ground dozens of meters away.

'That would've been fatal if it hit.'

A tunnel stretched along the trajectory as if a giant awl had pierced through nature.

"Hak. Hak."

Gaold's eyes rolled back as he breathed roughly.

"Aaaaaaah!"

As pain struck again and his nerves convulsed, his limbs shook violently up and down.

"Poor human."

Minerva, carrying Taeseong on her shoulder, returned to her original position and looked at Gaold.

"Don't struggle. You've already achieved enough, haven't you? It's also a world saved thanks to you. It means you can rest now. The woman you love anyway..."

Minerva hesitated for a moment.

"Has already forgotten you and become true ultimate good."

"Became... ultimate good?"

Since he had left thinking it would happen anyway, it wasn't particularly shocking.

But.

"You guys don't know Miro."

Gaold had no intention of stopping.

"Right, you absolutely don't know..."

As pleasure chemicals rushed in again, a vision of crying Miro flickered.

"Ah."

As filth leaked through Gaold's pants, Syng made a disgusted expression and covered his nose.

"Wouldn't it be better to handle this here? He seems to have lost his mind. He can't even be considered human anymore."

With an important battle ahead, they couldn't leave a madman who had reached the level of destruction.

"Can't be considered... human?"

Gaold grinned broadly as he looked at Syng.

"Eating."

His gaze moved to Freed.

"Sleeping."

And then to Minerva again.

"Shitting."

Gaold, whose legs were trembling from the pleasure hammering his brain, sneered and asked.

"Do you think you're any different?"

"Answer me, stars of the Ivory Tower. Do you feel like great beings just because you're playing around at the top of the world? Sitting on the toilet, shitting your brains out, talking about the universe and good and evil... Euhehe!"

Minerva's face crumpled.

'He's completely insane.'

Gaold's laughter stopped abruptly.

"That's enlightenment. What you think is furthest from you is sitting right in your bellies. Got it, you most expensive shit-making machines in the world?"

"I've decided."

Freed gripped his sword and stepped forward.

"We'll handle this here and go."

As if he had been hoping for it, Gaold weakly wiggled the back of his hand lying powerlessly on the ground.

"Keke, come at me."

Though his collapsed posture leaning against the tree suggested no combat ability whatsoever.

'...Is this really Gaold?'

None of the Five Great Stars could recklessly charge in.

"What are you doing? I said come at me."

Behind Gaold, who was wickedly splitting his lips in a grin, an endless infernal hell stretched out.
