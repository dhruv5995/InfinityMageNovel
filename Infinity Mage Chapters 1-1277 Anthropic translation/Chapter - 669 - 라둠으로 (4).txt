[669] To Radum (4)

A shockwave-type magic created by combining relatively minimal mass with relatively maximal speed.

Though it appeared to be explosive magic due to its tremendous destructive power, the true essence of Angel's Punishment was the shock wave generated at supersonic speeds.

As the torn and twisted structures stopped expanding and returned to their original positions, all that remained were fragments like the scattered remains of the burst Gallopers.

'They're being absorbed.'

Sirone watched as the creatures' debris seeped into the fibrous material of the floor.

The thought that perhaps all the structures in this place might be made from corpses sent chills down his spine.

"Is it... is it over?"

Amid the quiet surroundings, Cone muttered.

Beside the earth magic specialist stood two golems damaged by the Gallopers' attacks, which crumbled into dirt and vanished as he released the Spirit Zone.

His pride as a Veteran B-rank couldn't even begin to compare to the magic he'd just witnessed.

'Is that the magic of an Ivory Tower candidate?'

While Arkman had already acknowledged his defeat, the masters of the remaining two guilds were seeing Sirone's prowess for the first time.

No, even setting Sirone aside, they had never seen such extraordinary magic before.

'Perhaps...'

Maybe they could survive this hellish place after all.

While some saw a ray of hope, others were consumed by an atmosphere of terror and fell into despair.

"Huk, huu-uk."

Turning toward the sobbing sound, they saw Blood Rose guild member Elwi clenching both fists and trembling.

"Elwi, get a grip. You can't lose your courage."

Master Ibian tried to comfort her, but once emotions surge, they're not easily controlled.

"What do I do? The tears won't stop. I'm going to die now."

"That's not true. You're alive, even now!"

This was the first time poison mage Elwi, who had dominated battlefields spreading powerful nerve gas, had shown such vulnerability.

"You're wrong! No matter how hard I try, the fear won't go away! I'm going to die, I..."

Suddenly she began making choking sounds as she opened her mouth.

What's truly terrifying isn't fear itself, but being consumed by fear - once you lose control of your mind, you're endlessly pulled into darkness.

"Huh? Huuuh?"

Elwi's eyes began rolling back.

"Elwi! No! Hold on!"

Just as everyone sensed another death was imminent...

"It's okay."

Sirone embraced Elwi.

"Ah... ahhh..."

Feeling the warmth, Elwi's pupils gradually returned to normal, and death was postponed, if only temporarily.

"Don't worry. Whatever this place is, I won't let you die meaninglessly. Trust me and follow."

Relief briefly crossed Elwi's face, but soon her lips turned downward.

"Lies! You can say that because you're strong, leader! In the end, the weak die first! My nerve gas doesn't even work here!"

That was the root of the problem.

"You'll abandon me! In the end, you'll want me to die before the others!"

They could see with their own eyes how much fear could destroy a human mind.

"Poison is useless here."

Sirone looked directly into Elwi's startled eyes and explained gently.

"But once we leave this place, your magic will be a great help to our forces. If you weren't needed, I wouldn't have recruited you in the first place. So you can trust me."

"Really? I'm still needed?"

"Of course. And look, even now you're alive and well, not dead."

Only then did Elwi realize that death had passed her by.

"A mage of your caliber can definitely regain control of your mind. So let's hang in there a little longer, together."

Though unofficial, Elwi was still a mage.

"Thank you."

As Elwi finally smiled, Sirone smiled back.

But when he looked around and gave instructions, the smile had already faded.

"In biological time, it's dawn now. There's no point advancing in this state, so let's find a place to rest."

Given the tremendous fatigue from this horrific environment, there were no objections.

Avoiding ghouls as much as possible, they arrived at what seemed to be the inside of a massive heart that had once been a large warehouse.

"It's warm."

That was the only comfort, and the fact itself brought waves of disgust.

"What kind of world have we been living in?"

As the mood darkened at Cone's words, Sirone lightened it.

"Let's post guards. We have enough people, so let's set up shifts and rotate throughout the mission."

Kargin thought of the joke "What if someone dies in the meantime?" but didn't voice it.

"I'll go first."

Kuan, who was well-trained for this sort of thing, limped out of the heart.

"That person, at least..."

The members sighed in relief, making sure he couldn't hear.

His status as the finest among the mercenaries had already been proven in the battle with the Gallopers.

'How reassuring.'

The thought of being protected by diplomat Aria's bodyguard felt good, which was why Kuan had volunteered for the first watch.

"Get some rest. We'll depart in three hours."

It wouldn't be adequate rest, but in a battlefield like this, they slept to avoid death.

Even so, most members couldn't fall asleep.

As consciousness faded, the heartbeat of the structure seemed to grow louder.

'Neo...'

Archer Joshua rose from her spot and opened the pendant around her neck.

"A lover?"

At the sudden voice, she quickly turned to see Kargin grinning nastily.

"Mind your own business. I hate old men."

"Ever been interested in one?"

After thinking briefly, she spoke.

"What do you want?"

Kargin gestured toward the pendant with his chin.

"A lover?"

"No."

Inside the pendant was a drawing of a four-year-old child.

"My son."

"Hmm, didn't know you were married."

"I'm not. Don't even know who the father is. I was young and foolish then..."

In long mercenary life, you meet quite a few men willing to pay for a night's company.

Sometimes it paid better than missions, so when she felt like it, Joshua would agree - but failing to be careful about contraception was her mistake.

Kargin, understanding mercenary life, skipped the details and asked:

"Is that why you're so obsessed with money? Because of your son?"

"He's dead."

The pendant snapped shut with a click.

"Heat fever. Some kind of viral infection, they said. There was a cure. Just no money for it."

Joshua's words ended there.

"I'm sorry."

Perhaps because they were in hell, it sounded sincere.

"What about you? Do you have family?"

Kargin smiled bitterly.

"Unfortunately, I'm still a bachelor. A true bachelor. Though not a virgin, of course."

Joshua chuckled at the stale joke.

"I'm not kidding. Want to verify?"

As Kargin made to lower his pants, Joshua coldly turned away.

"Crazy old fool."

"Heh, what's the harm? Nothing beats this for overcoming fear. Plus, with changed senses, we might experience some new realm."

"Why me? There's a beautiful priestess over there, and a diplomat."

"Because you're the prettiest, obviously."

It was an obvious lie, but it didn't feel bad.

"How much will you pay?"

"What?"

"You said I'm pretty. Make an offer."

Kargin thought briefly, then pulled out top-grade gold coins from his cubic.

Though he'd objected when Joshua demanded payment in goods, he too had no family.

"This is my entire fortune."

One hundred thousand gold received from Lufist, all of it in his palm.

"Even a rotten fish has its worth."

The old man had a talent for moving people.

She snatched fifty thousand gold and put it in her cubic as she stood.

"I'll take half. Let's go out the back."

Kargin sheepishly pocketed the remaining coins and followed, asking:

"I really don't mind..."

"Don't throw your life away over something like this. We're definitely getting out alive, so enjoy yourself then, old man."

Some had fallen asleep, but core members including Sirone were lost in thought in corners, and Joshua looked to Sirone as if seeking permission.

When Lufist gestured for them to handle it themselves, the two left through the back door.

"Is this okay?"

"Why? You want to relax a bit too?"

Sirone wasn't in the mood for jokes.

"It's dangerous. Given this world's characteristics, any emotional changes might have effects..."

"Don't expect too much. They're desperately holding on too. Push them harder here and they'll really die."

Having commanded numerous subordinates, the Association President knew this fact.

While core members like Sirone possessed mental strength that ranked among the kingdom's finest, the stress on ordinary mercenaries in situations where they could die from mere fear was beyond imagination.

Considering Elwi's situation, it wasn't incomprehensible, so Sirone remained silent on that point.

"Um... Meirei."

"Ah, yes?"

She turned, having been continuously covering her ears to experiment with divine frequencies.

"Earlier you mentioned divine revelation, right? What exactly is that?"

While Jane was seeking escape methods without much success, Meirei's information was crucial.

"Ah, yes."

She sat beside Sirone and explained.

"Actually, it's ambiguous to call it memory. The divine revelation process is quite dreamlike. But after entering this place, it suddenly came to mind. Some information surfaces that way."

"You called it the reverse world?"

"Yes. But that's just my interpretation. They perceive the world through far more diverse senses than humans. They probably don't distinguish between our world and this place."

"Why didn't you tell us beforehand?"

"Actually... what I'm saying now just came to mind."

If it was like free association, they might draw out more through conversation.

"What does 'integrated' mean?"

Meirei blinked briefly, then spoke.

"Remember when I called you tactile before?"

"Yes. And you're auditory."

"When I first heard about the ability called Shibuhl-sangpokme, that was my first thought. You've probably opened your sixth sense."

"Me?"

"The Teraforce Order, or rather the Teraforce gods, classify senses into eleven types. Humans only have five senses, but some sensory beings understand the universe through more senses. Do you know what they call the pinnacle of senses, the eleventh sense?"

When Sirone shook his head, she pointed at him.

"Ultima Sense - the Ultima System."

"Ultima is... the eleventh and final sense?"

"I know that you possess the Gaians' ultimate sense. But interpreting signals isn't Ultima's true essence. Human sixth sense manifests through integration of the five senses. The seventh sense manifests through integration of the six senses. Through such integration, when you reach the eleventh level, everything finally becomes one. This was the knowledge of the Teraforce gods."

As more information seemed to pour out, Meirei's speech quickened.

"Humans are five-sense beings, so manifesting the sixth sense is temporary. But you've opened it completely. What they call the sixth sense - Temporal Explosion Sense. The vivid feeling that transcends time."

Before long, Lufist and even Jane had come to listen.

"If you truly want to open the eleventh sense, you must continue integrating to open new senses. I don't know if it's biologically possible, but at least they did it."

"How many senses do they have? Teraforce, I mean."

"I don't know exactly. They clearly haven't reached the eleventh sense, but it's not low either. Since they've opened the seventh sense, they know about this place."

Jane asked as if something had occurred to her.

"You said Temporal Explosion Sense transcends time. Then what about the seventh sense?"

"Yes. It breaks down spatial barriers. The sense that destroys the boundary between existence and non-existence."

Meirei spread both palms wide as if there were a wall before her.

"The seventh sense - Thin Knowledge."

Another sense required to reach the ultimate.
