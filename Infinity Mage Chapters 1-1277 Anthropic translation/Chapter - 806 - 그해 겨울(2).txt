That Winter (2)

'Reversing the World Wheel is certainly possible for Yahweh. But...'

If he was already trapped in the Prison of Balance, he should have been completely isolated. That would be normal.

'Not an error?'

A being free from the Lawâ€”even Terapos, who guards that very Law, couldn't define him.

'This isn't just about listing Yahweh's strength.'

What this incident told Amanta was that perhaps this world might not be a space meant 'merely for survival.'

In other words, it meant that whatever being designed this world had a specific intention.

"Why does Hexar exist?"

Sirone couldn't answer that question.

"In any case, fine."

When Amanta extended his hand, the wheel buried in the snow returned with the sound of cold wind.

Tiririririri!

The Law turning once again.

"Even if the Law acknowledges philanthropy, it doesn't change that your actions will cause massive murder."

Minerva said.

"But I can't just leave evil alone. Terapos destroys civilizations when evil taints the world, doesn't it?"

"That's exactly why I want to stop you."

Amanta stopped the World Wheel.

"There's currently no Buddha. If even philanthropy fails to destroy extreme evil, this world will become extremely tainted by evil."

Consequently, Sirone's philanthropy would bring countless casualties to the world.

"Just eliminate the extreme evil and be done with it."

"Even if the Ivory Tower and Gustav engage in full-scale war right now, it would be a difficult war. Would <Law Kill> make it possible? If I turn the World Wheel, both good and evil will subside to some degree."

Under the assumption that both Buddha and Yahweh were absent, Amanta could reduce the numbers of both good and evil to about 30 percent of current levels.

Then the world would be livable.

"Certainly there's also a method to neutralize both camps and postpone destruction. But that too is an extreme of the center."

Amanta looked back at Sirone.

"I don't think Yahweh can handle it. If you, Sirone, break the balance, I will fight you at any time."

"I might not be able to handle it." Sirone was resolute.

"But I will handle it."

Amanta slowly shook his head but knew it was meaningless to say more.

"Don't expect human emotions from me. I am one who has realized the center of the world. I merely maintain balance." The World Wheel spun rapidly in his hand, then absorbed Amanta's body and vanished.

Sirone let out a sigh.

"Phew, I really thought I was going to get trapped there."

Minerva approached Sirone while glaring at the spot where Amanta had disappeared.

"He's not someone to take lightly. In the World Wheel, only the center of rotation is intact. If momentum leans toward either side, Amanta will shave off the protruding part."

"Even if it's good."

Minerva nodded.

"That's the center. He's someone who knows that half-hearted good incites evil."

That was the philosophy of the Five Great Stars of the Department of Balance.

"Whatever Amanta thinks, we just need to do our job. We've recovered <Law Kill> too, so let's go back."

Half-hearted good incites evil.

'Am I half-hearted?'

If the day really comes when Yahweh cannot handle it, as Amanta said...

"Yes, let's go back."

Though Sirone had reached the top of the world, his doubts about extremes only grew larger.

Snow poured down heavily once every three days.

"Advance! It's an advance!"

All soldiers of the Gustav Empire, except for 70 percent of the forces fighting the Holy War, advanced toward Kotria Republic.

What was different from usual was that this time they truly intended to occupy Kotria Republic.

As if revealing Balkhan's will, the elite 1st Infantry Corps had joined the 30 percent army.

"We need to tear down the walls of Bashken, Kotria's capital."

At Balkhan's instruction, a man over 2 meters tall with spiky black hair prostrated himself.

"I will certainly capture it."

1st Commander, Ozent Gai.

Rian's older brother, he was originally a certified 6th-grade swordsman of Tormia, but had an awakening through long years of espionage work.

'A truly strong sword needs no miscellaneous beliefs.'

With single-minded devotion to the sword, he abandoned his homeland and settled in the Gustav Empire four years ago.

'The essence of the sword is only to cut.' His nickname was Berserker.

As a 1st-grade swordsman acknowledged by Gustav and commander of 600,000 troops, he was proving his sword.

Balkhan understood Gai.

'Even if it were family, there would be no mercy in the berserker's sword.'

He had no doubt that Bashken would fall.

While Kotria Republic fought its final defensive battle, Kashan secretly moved Exmachina.

The location was a small village 84 kilometers from Bashken, and the next day, people arrived to play card games with Iruki.

"<Law Kill> was properly delivered, right?"

Iruki answered.

"Sirone won't make mistakes. He's probably preparing to snipe from Haigang Hill."

Haigang was a low hill, 142 kilometers away from Bashken.

"It's the optimal location within Exmachina's range. Sirone and Minerva agreed to help with the detailed work."

Ness said.

"The real match starts the moment <Law Kill> passes the 80-kilometer point. There must not be even an inch of error."

"Havitz has advanced to capture Kotria Republic, but his defenses are still solid."

Normally, <Law Kill> wouldn't be able to pierce through countless obstacles to strike Havitz's heart.

"Sniper time is 7 days, 3 hours, 31 minutes, 28.463 seconds. These coordinates are the only gap we found."

The card game players nodded.

"We still have time. Let's check until the end to see if there's anything we missed."

"Pour more firepower! It's almost over! Can you see the terrified faces of those Kotria bastards!"

When winter's cold reached its peak, the Gustav Empire's 1st Infantry Corps was on the verge of capturing the castle.

Kotria Republic sent their nation's great swordsman to induce single combat, but his head was cut off by Ozent Gai in just 12 exchanges.

"Mo-monster!"

Gai's appearance, wearing iron armor heavier than his body and wielding a great sword, was like a demon.

A full 20 percent of the thousand-man army died by his hand, and eventually Kotria firmly locked their gates.

"Tch! Why are they stalling for time?" With the battle tide turned this far, they should normally be waving white flags already.

'Do they have another plan?' Since there was no report from Balkhan that Exmachina had been activated, he was even more puzzled.

"Doesn't matter."

Standing over a sea of corpses, Gai sheathed his sword and turned toward the garrison.

"Whatever it is, I'll just break through it."

Though he had abandoned everything for the sword, his swordsman's temperament was still that of the Ozent family.

Gustav Empire officials who had seized control of Bashken's noble district were busy recovering spoils of war.

"Kyaak! Please spare me!"

Whether expensive items broke or not, they swept everything into bundles, and young women became slaves on the spot.

While the highest nobles knelt gathered in the square, Havitz and Abella appeared.

"You wicked bastard! Do you think the world will go your way!"

A 1st-class noble glared and shouted, but immediately became a pincushion from the army's spears.

Abella's gaze watching that scene was calm.

'This is my fate.'

It was true that something had snapped in her head after receiving baptism from Havitz.

But even in such a grim scene, her heart's turbulence was minimal, probably due to her childhood experiences.

"Abella."

Havitz affectionately wrapped his arm around Abella's shoulder.

"When we capture the castle, I'll give you everything that comes from this country."

Since Havitz was everything in the world to her, Abella wanted nothing.

"It's fine. Just one pretty flower from this country will do."

"Good. Then..."

Havitz walked toward the dead noble.

"Daddy! Daddy!"

Young children were hugging their father's corpse and crying, but Havitz's expression didn't change.

"You evil bastard! I'll definitely... Keurk!"

Before the words could finish, a spear pierced his lungs.

"Hmm, what shall we play with now."

Though Havitz was happy after marrying Abella, his cruelty hadn't dulled one bit.

Balkhan raised the corners of his mouth.

'He doesn't kill out of anger.'

To Havitz, the world was just a square and playground that came and went.

"No! Let my daughter go! Take me instead...!"

As someone's family members died and became slaves, Havitz sang while watching the scene.

"My love's resting place..."

Such a beautiful voice.

"Become my flower and bloom in my heart."

Even the delicate vibration of his trembling lips seemed to mock the world...

"You're not human! You're a demon! A demon!"

The victims' families' eyes burst with blood vessels.

"Where do these insolent things come from!"

Spears flew again, and by the time the song ended, half the nobles were dead.

"Good."

Havitz, who had calmly finished his song, looked around the square and pointed to an alley.

"Bring that one."

A beggar with disabled legs who couldn't even escape was trembling against a wall.

"Waah! Please spare me!"

Havitz knelt and placed his hand on the beggar's head.

"From now on, you are the king of this country."

"Waah... waa..."

Then he personally fastened his own sword to the beggar's waist and gave instructions.

"A king is one who dominates everything. Prove your worth with this sword. Then everyone will worship you."

Though his life was hungry, he was quick-witted, so the beggar looked around at the nobles with terrified eyes.

'If I can't dominate, I'll die.' Limping along, he approached the nobles, and looks of disgust shot at him from all directions.

The beggar drew his sword and pointed the blade at the chin of a middle-aged woman.

"Wo-worship me. Kneel before me and swear you'll follow me."

"Ptui!"

The spit the middle-aged woman expelled hit the beggar's face.

"You!"

As his reason snapped, the sword came down vertically, splitting the woman's face exactly in half.

There were no screams, and the beggar, breathing roughly, looked around and shouted.

"Bow your heads! Submit to me!"

"We..."

Everyone bowed their heads toward the beggar.

"Our king!"

At the sight of the highest nobles worshipping him, the beggar felt pleasure to the point of losing his mind.

"Puhahaha! Yes! I am the king! I am now... Huk!"

Havitz, who had approached from behind, embraced his shoulders and patted him with his palm.

"How is it? Being king is fun too, right?"

"What? Ah, yes! It's the best! Your Majesty! I'll serve you for life!"

The beggar was excited.

"No, since you're the king, you don't need to serve me. You just need to have fun."

Havitz pointed to the nobles and said.

"They're all yours. Enjoy."

Returning to the soldiers, Havitz took off the emperor's cloak and threw it high into the sky.

Zetaro asked.

"What's wrong? Are you uncomfortable somewhere?"

"No, this seems like it would be fun too. I'm tired of playing emperor. From now on, I'll be a beggar."

"Uheheheh! That sounds fun!"

When Zetaro turned his head, Smodo and Natasha also showed pleased expressions and nodded.

Balkhan said.

"Don't get too absorbed. The war is still..."

"Let's go! It's a beggar's rebellion!"

As the three people, already deeply absorbed in the game, ran toward the residential area, Balkhan said to Abella.

"Why don't you try to stop them?"

Abella shook her head with a bitter smile.

"Who could stop that personality?"

The beggar, carried on a noble's back, swung his sword.

"From now on, women will wash my body. Men will find clothes suitable for me! Understood!"

"...Yes, understood."

It was the height of chaos.
