What Cannot Be Chosen (3)

"Sirone?"

After confirming that both of them were safe, Sirone smiled and said,

"Please wait just a moment."

The sound of Hand of God pouring building debris onto the clearing at the mountain peak could be heard all the way here.

"Huh? But..."

The position in which Alpheas and Olivia were lying seemed rather meaningful.

"What were you two doing?"

Realizing she was still being held in his arms, Olivia hastily pulled herself away.

"Ugh!"

Alpheas let out a pained groan.

"S-sorry. Are you okay?"

Still grimacing as the pain didn't easily subside, he winked at Sirone.

"Thanks for saving us, but couldn't you cover us back up? We were just getting to the important part."

Olivia's face flushed red.

"What nonsense are you spouting, you crazy old fool!"

Sirone laughed.

Seeing that both of them were full of energy, it seemed they had no internal injuries.

"I'll get you out now."

Hand of God passed through the ground and lifted the two of them up as if pulling them from water.

"Hmm, light."

Alpheas smiled.

Who could have known that the child who once asked what magic was would become the light that saves the world?

Upon reaching the surface, Olivia could confirm the power of the bomb that had exploded earlier.

"Good heavens..."

The entire radius had been blown away, and where they stood, a massive crater had formed.

Shiina came running.

"Vice Principal! Are you alright? What happened? The school exploded!"

Olivia gestured with her chin.

Alpheas, who was receiving emergency treatment from Sirone, was giving a thumbs up.

Reina said,

"His kneecap is shattered. Sirone provided magical treatment, but he'll need surgical intervention as well."

"We'll have to go to the military. That's the only place we can meet a surgeon in this situation."

Sade's voice was heard from outside the crater.

"Master! Are you safe?"

Arriving before the group through teleportation, he too was momentarily speechless upon seeing Sirone.

"What happened? The explosion?"

After hearing the whole story from Shiina, Sade let out a sigh of relief.

"Thank goodness. The others are hiding in the mountains. Sirone, your parents too."

After shooting a light spell into the sky, the students came down from the mountain 10 minutes later.

"Oh! Senior Sirone!"

Mark and Maria were the first to run over, but Sirone couldn't even properly receive their greetings.

Because he saw Vincent and Olina standing among the crowd of students, looking haggard.

"Mom."

Since they never expected their son to be there, Vincent and his wife also froze in place.

But nothing could overcome the burning warmth rising in their hearts.

"Sirone!"

"Mom!"

When Sirone roughly embraced Olina, Vincent wrapped them both up with tears flowing.

Countless questions that didn't wait for answers poured between them, and people watched warmly.

Sirone impulsively blurted out,

"I found my birth mother."

Why this timing?

The thought that he'd made a mistake briefly crossed his mind, but it seemed like if not now, there would never be any timing.

"Uh, well, I thought I should tell you first. Of course, Father and Mother are..."

"I see."

Olina, who had been making eye contact with her husband, caressed Sirone's cheek and said,

"That's really wonderful."

"...Yes."

In the end, Sirone shed tears.

The night streets of Bashka under martial law had become as desolate as a ghost town.

Occasionally, the screams of people afflicted with emotional sickness floated through the air like ghosts.

A loud impact sound echoed, and somewhere else, the crying of a terror-stricken woman could be heard.

Looking down at the city from the castle, Pony's face was already exhausted.

'I should be able to get through one day.'

After breaking two more fingers, she realized this wasn't a problem that could be solved through self-harm.

'The increase in threshold is much greater than expected. At this rate, I won't last even a few days. I have no choice but to endure.'

Eliminating the demon realm was key, and as soon as dawn broke tomorrow, Sirone and Lian would depart for the other world.

'Will they be okay?'

According to what Sirone had hinted, the process of going to hell in a living body was truly horrific.

One might become a demon.

Even if they maintained their sanity, Sirone's prediction was that they wouldn't be normal.

Looking down toward the garden, she saw Tess alone outside, looking up at the moon.

'Lian's lover, I suppose. She must be anxious.'

Since it wasn't a situation where anyone could pity anyone else, Pony withdrew her gaze and went inside.

"Sigh."

Tess let out a sigh.

'Is he really going?'

Having heard how one must cross the river of no return, her insides were burning up.

'I can't bear it. It's madness.'

If it weren't for a situation where all of humanity might perish, Sirone wouldn't have taken Lian with him either.

'That bastard.'

Even as she felt angry at Lian, thinking of the fear he must be feeling made her spine go cold.

'Right, I need to pull myself together too.'

Returning to the castle, Tess gathered some snacks and headed to the lodging where Lian was staying.

"Lian, it's me."

"...Come in."

His voice was trembling, as expected.

Taking a deep breath, she forced a bright expression and threw open the door.

"Hi? How about a beer..."

Tess's movement froze with the bottle raised.

"Huff! Huff!"

The room was hot with heat, and Lian was doing push-ups with his shirt off.

He only turned his head to say,

"What are you doing, not coming in?"

His expression was strained, but there was no trace of fear about tomorrow.

Closing the door helplessly, Tess sat on the bed.

"Are you okay?"

"The emotional sickness? No problem for now. I can be restored no matter what gets broken or torn off."

"No, not that. You know what you have to do tomorrow, right? You'll be constantly in flames..."

Tess hastily stopped speaking.

Even if it wasn't happening to her, it was horrific - how must the person who had to experience it feel?

"Right, setting my body on fire. That's how I can enter the other world."

"Aren't you afraid?"

Tess finally couldn't hold back and burst out,

"You don't know what kind of effect the fire on your body will have in the other world! Are you crazy? Or are you really stupid? You might not die. But that makes it even more horrific, you idiot!"

Lian stopped exercising and stood up.

"Tess."

Then he took the beer bottle Tess was holding, opened it, and said,

"Don't worry. I'll do well."

Staring blankly at Lian quenching his thirst with beer, Tess suddenly got goosebumps.

'He's not stupid.'

It's courage.

The courage to never surrender to anything - that was Lian's talent.

After finishing his workout, Lian drank beer with Tess.

Without any mention of tomorrow, time passed aimlessly and before they knew it, it was midnight.

During a brief silence, Tess, who had been fidgeting with her bottle, burst into laughter.

"Hahaha!"

Even though a man and woman were alone in a room, this was the atmosphere.

"What's with you, suddenly?"

When Lian asked, Tess's laughter turned into a self-deprecating smile as she continued,

"We're so cool."

She looked at Lian and asked,

"Or am I the only one being cool? Maybe you're actually not thinking about anything."

Lian remained silent.

"Want to sleep together?"

Even after mustering her greatest courage, when there was no answer, Tess hastily changed the mood.

"Hahaha! Just kidding! As if I would ever with you..."

Perhaps that made it even more heartbreaking.

Something hot gripped her heart, and tears began falling.

"Can't you just say it? I absolutely won't bother you, so can't you just say you love me once?"

"You're a good person."

"Why! Why!"

Tess stood up abruptly and faced Lian.

"You're leaving tomorrow anyway! I'm not asking for anything! What's so hard about just saying it once?"

"Why do you think Sirone chose me?"

Though she was angry at the unexpected question, she wouldn't be able to get anything out of him without going through Sirone anyway.

"Because only you can enter the other world, you're strong, and Sirone trusts you most."

"No."

Lian shook his head.

"If those were the only reasons, Sirone would have definitely gone alone."

Come to think of it, that made sense.

"I don't understand the principle, but anyway, Sirone seems to exist simultaneously in various places around the world. When I heard that, the first thought that came to mind was this: Then how do I protect him?"

Tess closed her mouth.

"If Sirone dies in one space, what happens to the Sirones in other spaces? Do they all die, or does only the Sirone in that space die?"

"So... did you ask Sirone?"

"No, I couldn't ask. If it were tactically necessary, he would have told us without being asked. But Sirone didn't reveal it. That means..."

Lian's eyes turned cold.

"If one Sirone in one space dies, all the Sirones around the world die."

Saliva went down Tess's throat.

"So he deliberately didn't say it. Because morale would drop if we knew this fact."

"B-but that's just speculation. If you ask Sirone tomorrow..."

"Do you really think so?"

Lian cut her off.

"Do you think Sirone would ask to do something together that he could do alone, knowing his friend would suffer terribly?"

No.

"I'm going to hell by any means necessary. And I'll protect Sirone there. Tess, I understand your feelings. But I don't want to take responsibility for anything other than Sirone. Because it would prevent me from making choices when it's truly important."

If judgment were delayed because of attachments left in reality, he had to cut everything off before leaving.

"So you can't take any responsibility for me? Not even saying one word? Not even 1 percent?"

Lian said firmly,

"Not even 0.1 percent."

"I'm sorry. You can resent me all you want. I'm already prepared for that. I absolutely must..."

"Hahaha! Hahahaha!"

Though Tess's laughter was mixed with tears, somehow her expression looked relieved.

"That's so like you. You know what? Among all the men I've met, you're the worst of the worst."

"Sorry."

"No, it's okay."

Tess grabbed Lian's head with both hands.

"I absolutely won't regret it. Now I finally understand why I like you."

Because he's a true knight.

'And I am too.'

Gripping Lian's head tightly with both hands, she said with a sharp expression,

"Go. Go and fight."

"Tess."

"Listen to me carefully. You must maintain your sanity. And if Sirone is in danger..."

Tess held back her tears.

'Don't cry, Tess. Smile. You have to smile.'

Somehow she managed not to show tears, but in the end, she couldn't manage to smile.

"If Sirone is in danger..."

Biting her lips, the words she forced up finally passed through her throat and burst out of her mouth.

"You absolutely must die. Promise me. That you won't hesitate for even a moment. Protect your lord."

Lian quietly bowed his head and closed his eyes.

"Yes."

Suddenly he had this thought.

If peace ever comes to this land someday, it might be nice to live together with Tess.
