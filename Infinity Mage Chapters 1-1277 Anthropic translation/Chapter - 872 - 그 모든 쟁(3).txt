All That Strife (3)

By the time Havitz had fully recovered, demons from all corners of the three worlds had gathered in the central continent.

Led by six legion commanders, Hell's army of 220 million troops assembled in the Kingdom of Galon.

220 million.

It was an unbelievable decrease compared to the original army.

"We underestimated the Law Breakers too much."

The ability to destroy the system was producing results beyond mere arithmetic calculations.

Gaold, who had devastated the south, and Shirone, who had destroyed Gustav.

"That guy Lian is also troublesome."

Natasha approached Vulcan, who was lost in thought while spreading out a world map.

"Is he that strong?"

"Strong? If being impossible to approach with such concepts counts as strength, then yes, but..."

When simply converted to numerical values, there would be no human who could surpass Natasha's combat ability.

"He's like a joker in a card game. Different rules apply than the existing ones. That makes him troublesome to deal with."

Smodo approached.

"Having a joker doesn't guarantee you'll win the game. Though it would certainly be advantageous."

"Right. And now we also have a joker."

In the commander's barracks, Havitz sat on the bed, feeding a bottle to Deris's child.

"Peek-a-boo."

Havitz seemed fascinated by the child.

'A being that connects to the law from outside the law. Havitz's Vanishing definitely belongs to the Law Breakers.'

Smodo asked.

"What will you do?"

Now that the Gustav Empire had fallen, they no longer had a place to return to.

"We advance. The central continent is the key. If we can break through here, we can reach Zion via the southern continent."

By then, the humans would also be mostly dealt with.

Hell's army of 220 million troops was newly reorganized into six legions and began the war.

Thanks to Havitz being temporarily immobilized, the Holy War had been able to buy time, but the situation was still urgent.

"General! The 13th Brigade has been annihilated! Hell's army is crossing the Argante Mountains and moving south!"

"8th Division destroyed! Casualties reach 30,000!"

With the continuous stream of bad news, the commanders were reconstructing the strategic situation board in real time.

Iruki bit his lip.

'There's no way.'

People often say that humans have no limits.

But Iruki was realizing how arrogant and trivial that logic was.

'There isn't! There really isn't!'

No matter where he looked, there was no place to sound the victory horn.

Even a fool could win any battle with 220,000 demons.

'Vulcan.'

And the enemy Iruki was facing was the best gambler who had beaten all the 'card players.'

"Heh heh heh, I can see it clearly, so clearly."

Though they hadn't faced each other yet, Vulcan felt he understood what kind of person Iruki was.

Smodo asked.

"Is this the limit for the Holy War's strategist too?"

"No. He's a genius. Honestly, if it weren't for the numerical advantage, we might have been defeated."

"You must be joking. The difference in troops is..."

Of course it was a joke since it wasn't reality, but honestly, Vulcan couldn't guarantee the outcome.

"He has a weakness."

Vulcan moved the armies on the map.

"He's calculating the efficiency of war using human values. That's why he can't win. 100,000 lives. Surely it would take a lifetime to recite their stories, but..."

The six legions formed a radial formation.

"In war, they're just 100,000. Just 100,000 lives that can be spoken of in one second."

Like putting chess pieces back in the box after a game ends, in war humans were merely tools.

"Now, I've moved like this. Then the other side will suffer without even being able to breathe."

The 3rd Legion advanced 100 kilometers.

Smodo shook his head at Vulcan's sick hobby.

"Heh heh heh. How about it, boy?"

Vulcan raised his head and aimed at Iruki.

"Isn't war fun?"

Iruki slammed the table with a bang.

"Damn it!"

Even while doing so, reports of the Holy War army's crushing defeats continued to arrive.

"The capital of Galon has fallen. Casualties are estimated to exceed 300,000 at most."

"300,000."

His mind grew hazy under the staggering weight of lives.

'I'm killing them.'

Gray hairs continued to grow, and now Iruki's hair looked almost completely gray.

"I'm, I'm..."

It was absolutely forbidden for a general to show despair, but Iruki was already in a dazed state.

"General."

A commander who had been assisting him approached Iruki and offered him strong liquor.

"Please drink. First, cool your head a bit."

Iruki let out a bitter laugh.

"You want me to drink? Don't you know that hundreds of thousands of lives hang on my orders?"

Who would follow the strategy of a drunk person?

"That's exactly why you should drink."

The commander thrust the bottle forward.

"If someone holding hundreds of thousands of lives gets drunk from a little alcohol, then they're not qualified to be a general."

Iruki looked back at the commander.

"Your strategies are excellent, General. No one in the Holy War can think like you. But... this is war."

The commander spoke his true thoughts.

"It doesn't matter how many die. If we don't win anyway, everyone dies. The reason the Valkyries follow you isn't to survive, but to win."

As Iruki slowly took the bottle, the commander bowed and pleaded.

"Please win."

Iruki stared at the commander, then uncapped the bottle and gulped it down.

"Whew."

He had to become a demon.

'If it's for victory...'

As his thinking expanded, various elements that hadn't been visible before began combining in his mind.

He still couldn't see a way to win, but at least he seemed able to get a chance for mutual destruction.

'The problem is time. If I don't make it as quickly as possible...'

He had no choice but to trust in Nade.

"It's been a while, Nade."

Ainca Foundation's chairman Richard greeted Nade as he stepped down from a luxury carriage.

Nade, dressed neatly in a suit, was assisted by secretaries from Nade Military Industries on both sides.

"Yeah. You've changed a lot, Richard the Alchemist."

Richard shrugged his shoulders.

"Ugh, that embarrassing school nickname. Anyway, let's go. I heard you're busy..."

It was a meeting Richard had arranged to receive investment from wealthy people around the world.

The funds needed just to develop the elemental bomb were astronomical, but currently the Holy War had no time.

A task that would normally take over three years to design properly had to be completed within a few months.

The only way to shorten the time was money.

"Everyone is waiting."

Entering the VIP room of an upscale bar, the world's tycoons sat arrogantly waiting for the two men.

"Sorry for being late. I'm Richard Ainca, chairman of the Ainca Alchemy Foundation."

Nade bowed his head.

"I'm West Nade, representative of Nade Military Industries. Please treat me well."

After individual introductions, Nade placed various documents on the table.

"As mentioned, the value of the elemental bomb is powerful enough to change humanity's future. If you invest in the Holy War—"

Nade, who had raised his head, stopped speaking.

"Heh heh! Wait a moment."

"Oh my, don't be too rough."

The tycoons, each with at least two high-class call girls by their sides, weren't even listening to Nade's words.

"If you invest in the Holy War, I guarantee a minimum return rate of 1,200 percent."

Nade calmly finished his statement.

Anyway, they would have already reviewed all the risks they could examine through their personal channels.

While they'd be interested in the investment value, they probably wouldn't be too pleased with the concept of an elemental bomb itself.

'Iruki's elemental collapse theory will become revolutionary technology that can change the future.'

A bomb with power transcending magic.

When commercialized, the established powers who control the world would inevitably experience upheaval.

A bald man spoke.

"Ah, are you finished? I listened to the briefing with great impression. So, you want investment from us?"

"Yes. The world is under threat. Please lend your strength, even for the greater good."

Of course, it was talk that wouldn't work at all.

"Right, right. I understand what you're saying. By the way, you're from Alpheas Magic School, right?"

"Ah, yes. That's correct, but..."

"There's a singer from there named Maya, right? You know, the one who's supposedly popular among young people these days."

A long-haired man sitting across interrupted.

"Oh? Mr. Todd, you also know Maya? I've seen her once before too, and she was really something."

"Haha! Isn't she currently the soldiers' number one idol? So, do you know her?"

Nade blinked and said.

"Yes, she's a school classmate. But why Maya?"

Todd pointed at Nade and winked.

"Could you bring her once? Just an entertainment company acting all high and mighty. They're probably getting cocky because of the Holy War's backing, but they need to know they'll go under like that."

"Well, Maya is..."

"Hey, why are you being like this? Good things are good things, right? Shouldn't we help each other for humanity? If you bring Maya, I won't treat you poorly either."

For a moment, Nade heard the sound of his reason snapping.

"You son of a—!"

Just as electricity began rising from his body, Richard suddenly stood up and approached Todd.

Without giving him a chance to speak, he grabbed a liquor bottle from the table and struck Todd's head.

"Aaaahhh!"

The heavy liquor bottle shattered as Todd grabbed his head and fell under the chair.

While Nade watched in a daze, Richard shook off his bleeding palm and said.

"Do you think Alpheas Magic School is a joke? How dare you try to touch my classmate?"

Todd pointed accusingly.

"You, you bastard! Do you know who I am? Ainca Foundation! Do you think you'll be safe after this?"

"You're the one who should understand the situation clearly. Do you look down on her because she's a singer? Do you know where Maya's classmates are and what they're doing now?"

The class Shirone graduated from is called the golden generation at Alpheas Magic School.

"You... you...!"

As several figures came to Todd's mind and he couldn't continue speaking, Richard headed for the door shouting.

"Nade! Let's go! Why should we entrust the future to such scum?"

"Huh? Oh, right."

After leaving the upscale bar, Nade grabbed the shoulder of Richard, who was walking ahead angrily.

"Hey, wait. What exactly are you trying to do?"

"What about you? That bald guy was lucky. If I hadn't hit him, you would have killed him."

Nade couldn't deny it.

"How's your hand? Let's disinfect it first."

"It's fine. Richard the Alchemist, you know my body, right? Anyway, let's drop this side. There aren't only those people among the rich in the world."

"Right. Let's look for other investors."

Since it was Maya of all people, Nade also cleanly gave up and walked toward the carriage.

"Excuse me."

Then a sharp-featured man wearing horn-rimmed glasses approached with precise steps.

"Are you Mr. West Nade?"

After glancing at Richard once, Nade answered.

"Yes. I'm Nade."

"I see. I heard you're recruiting investors."

"Who are you?"

Though it probably couldn't be kept secret anymore, very few knew about the elemental bomb.

"We might be able to provide funding. If you're interested, could you spare some time?"

Richard asked.

"You'll provide funding? I don't know what rumors you've heard, but it's not an amount one person can invest."

"It's possible. No matter how much it is."

The man smiled and took out a coin from his inner pocket, throwing it to Nade.

"This is my business card."

"This is...?"

As Nade examined the coin, his eyes sparkled, and Richard opened his mouth in surprise.

"Golden Wheel."

Fermi's face came to mind.
