Giant Dream (3)

Havitz's applause sent chills down the spines of certain individuals, making one thing crystal clear.

'That thing needs to die.'

The ability to read mental wavelengths was, in some ways, more irritating than Vanishing.

With the Holy War's opening statements concluded, it was time for each nation's representatives to speak.

'Tonight is what really matters anyway.' Assassinations, lobbying, bribes, secret deals—everything would happen unofficially.

"Zive has angels. This power is what can sustain the world. The strength to ensure all nations can prosper—" The speech was mundane.

'Damn it, I can't push hard when I'm worried about being overheard.'

If he provoked Havitz with aggressive tactics, he'd only make a fool of himself.

"Give Garto to Zive. Of course, if you give us Rom, we'll be steadfast allies."

Gis said with a smile.

"Ah, of course we'll politely decline Temica."

No one laughed.

The representatives of each nation, mindful of the divine frequency, employed strategies to hide their true thoughts as much as possible.

The twelve nations methodically explained why their respective countries should lead the world.

With the free discussion—the main event of the Holy War—still to come, they took a twenty-minute recess.

Gustav the 4th Knight, Smodo said:

"Everyone's too worried about Havitz. What does it matter what thoughts he harbors? If you're that kind of person, just push through with it. What's there to be so afraid of?"

Balkan said:

"Humans consider good to be beautiful. But there are also nations that strategically don't want to stand out."

Zetaro said:

"It's just a probing battle anyway. If some kind of collusion happens tonight, they'll start throwing punches tomorrow."

"So how is it? The balance of power?"

"Hmm."

Balkan read the crowd's energy.

Energy is relative—even if you cage two beasts together, the strong and weak will inevitably be divided.

In the psychological warfare unfolding among twelve nations and hundreds of minds, he sensed a particular flow.

"In terms of winning odds, roughly: Zive 86 percent, Kashan 92 percent, Tormia 78 percent, Jincheon 66 percent..."

Zetaro nodded.

"As expected, Havitz is the strongest. Though it's unusual for Tormia to be in the top three."

"Is it because of Yahweh? Even if he's the strongest mage, he's not really a troublesome opponent. Havitz doesn't seem to care much about him either."

Balkan said:

"From evil's standpoint, it's easy. He's like a sucker at a gambling table. The problem is that sucker has infinite wealth, so you can't easily backstab him..."

His gaze drifted sideways.

"What's important is that Tormia isn't actually third. The place where the crowd's energy flows most intensely is..."

Kitra appeared, with a viper coiled around his neck.

"The Paras Kingdom."

Kitra, who had been staring ahead indifferently, kissed the viper as it flicked out its tongue.

"*Smooch. Smooch.*"

Slowly turning his head, he met Balkan's eyes and gave a chilling smile.

Smodo asked quietly:

"What are his odds?"

"I don't know. It's abnormal. I've never seen a flow like this. If I were to calculate it numerically, probably..."

Balkan squinted one eye.

"128 percent?"

Zetaro blinked.

"That's over 100 percent. Do such odds even exist?"

"That's what's strange. Even if you rig the deck in a card game, you don't get odds like this. Therefore, there's only one scenario where you can exceed 100 percent."

Smodo said:

"When the system itself is rigged."

"Right. Odds are calculated under the same rules. But what if you have a low hand, yet the system is rigged so that low hand wins? To express it numerically, you'd have no choice but to exceed 100 percent."

Zetaro muttered:

"Hmm. 100 percent means the whole, and exceeding the whole is conceptually impossible. But if a new concept that transcends that whole opens up—" Something flashed through his mind.

"The outer world. Paras has approached that secret through some route."

Shirone was thinking the same thing.

'I can't figure out Kitra's intentions. I need to finish exploring the pyramid as quickly as possible.'

Currently, all contact with everyone in the pyramid—Canis, Arin, Zulu, and others—had been severed.

"We will resume the meeting. From now on, we'll have free discussion with minimal intervention from the chair."

The representatives' eyes changed, and Zive's Gis stood up to open the proceedings.

"Let us end the war. Cooperating with Archangel Satiel here to achieve peace as quickly as possible would be a great harvest for humanity."

Jincheon Empire's Jingang said:

"Stopping war doesn't end it. Currently, Jincheon's citizens suffer from radiation mutations. I don't think the angels can handle that problem."

Satiel snorted.

"Hmph, what am I supposed to do about humans being weak? To think your bodies change from mere radiation."

Cold sweat beaded on Gis's forehead, but controlling Satiel was no easy task.

Lampa said:

"From what I hear, Archangel, you seem to have no intention of coexisting with humanity. If Zive becomes the leading nation, wouldn't that bring another catastrophe?"

"That's not—"

Satiel cut off Gis's words.

"Don't worry. I have absolutely no intention of tormenting humans in some drawn-out way like someone else. Once I achieve what I want, I'll take my army and leave."

Moon Kingdom's Unryong asked:

"What do you want?"

"It's personal business. Of course, if you interfere with my work, disaster will befall you."

Having said that, Satiel looked at Shirone.

'Ikael. Where are you?'

The fact that he couldn't find Ikael despite scouring the entire planet with his divine sight meant...

'She's avoiding me.'

Ikael's hiding ability was so powerful that even Ankera couldn't find her.

However, the reason Ikael was hiding wasn't for herself, but to conceal the Wizard.

She couldn't openly summon humanity's hope for killing Havitz, could she?

Shirone checked on his other self's location.

'He'll arrive in Zive in two days.'

The problem was that Lampa knew.

Training the Wizard was itself part of the Ivory Tower project.

'Mr. Lampa wouldn't help Satan. But the current situation has become delicate.'

Syng had caused internal strife.

'An unexpected development. Depending on the Ivory Tower's outcome, there's a risk of information leaking.'

That was why he had no choice but to go to the Ivory Tower.

"The demon world—"

Havitz's voice was heard.

"Should I eliminate it?"

As everyone in the meeting hall's attention focused on him, Uorin frowned.

'He's acting on his own again.'

Contrary to her anxious feelings, the representatives of each nation held a glimmer of hope.

"Is such a thing possible?"

"It's possible. I'm the lord of hell, after all. I just need to tell Lethe. I can purify hell."

Pony said:

"Purifying hell means destroying your world. Are you mocking us?"

"No, I'm serious. I realized today that hell won't disappear. As long as you all are alive. But there's one condition. Hand over 10 percent of humanity to me."

"10 percent?"

"It's better than everyone dying. I'm Satan in name, so don't I need materials to rebuild hell? Just make the decision and the demon world will completely disappear."

Liberation from catastrophe.

However, the 10 percent of humanity caught in Satan's hands would suffer enough agony to rebuild hell.

"You call that a proposal?!" Gis shot to his feet.

"There's a limit to how much you can demean human dignity! Do you even know how large a number 10 percent of humanity is? Humanity will never make such a decision!"

"Hmm."

The divine frequency was:

*Shut up. I'm going to be king of the world.*

"If you don't like it, there's nothing I can do. I'm making a proposal. Then how about this? If 10 percent is too many, just hand over one person."

"Huh? One person?"

Havitz pointed at Shirone.

"Yahweh."

Even knowing that extreme killing intent was surging in Uorin's heart, he didn't stop.

"That's enough. Even without 10 percent of humanity. If you hand over that kid, the world will be peaceful. Right?"

"This—"

Just as Pony, Seriel, and others who shared a mental connection with Shirone shot to their feet...

"What the hell are you?"

Satiel said:

"Dirty, filthy beast, the Nephilim is not someone a creature like you can touch."

Though she said Nephilim as a euphemism, Shirone knew she was referring to him.

'Why?'

Satiel had driven the biological child born between Ikael and Garfin to death.

By human standards, it would be like an aunt sending her nephew to his doom.

'Are you feeling guilt?'

Even knowing Shirone was watching, Satiel deliberately avoided his gaze.

'Don't misunderstand. I'm only doing what needs to be done for heaven. Killing you is my pride.' But then why did she feel so bad?

'Probably...'

Because in Shirone's appearance, she saw both the angel she hated most and the human she loved most.

'Right, it's not because of guilt. I'm Archangel Satiel. Even if I have to kill, I'll be the one to kill.'

She declared:

"Satan, you may be able to deceive humans, but it won't work on angels. If you think you can put the Nephilim under you, I'll crush you with force."

"Keke."

The divine frequency activated.

'This one's quite something too.'

To think the day would come when he'd sense human wavelengths from a stuffy archangel's mind.

"There is a way to eliminate the demon world."

Jingang said:

"The Jincheon Space Nation has researched the demon world and reached a technological level with tangible results. Soon, the demon world will disappear not by angels, but by Jincheon."

"What method?"

"Photon Castle."

It was the space-time interceptor that Jinseong had used.

Anchal said:

"Photon Castle warps space. That the reverse world is no different was proven by Jincheon's princess, Jinseong. We also have the data the princess left behind."

As Anchal raised his index finger, a vision of Photon Castle unfolded in a large sphere.

"Thus, through development upon development, we created a weapon that can directly strike hell. Parma Photon Castle. By self-destructing Jincheon's princess, we will devastate the demon world."

Havitz blinked.

"Hmm."

The fact that Satan couldn't refute it proved Parma Photon Castle's feasibility.

"Listen well, Havitz."

Blood vessels bulged in Jingang's eyes.

"You will pay dearly for touching Jincheon. I will become an evil that transcends you and punish you."

'Tremendous resonance.'

The heart of a father who had to send his beloved daughter to hell reached Havitz clearly.

Shirone understood those feelings.

'He must have endured waiting only for this moment.'

He could feel the weight of countless words that had to be swallowed deep into his lungs to utter this single sentence.

"We will... recess briefly."

At the chairman's declaration, representatives and officials from each nation streamed out of the meeting hall.

'Today's meeting ends here.'

Everyone sensed it intuitively.
