[672] Lord of Terror (3)

Existence and non-existence.

Though defined separately like the front and back of a coin, Sirone perceived them as merely one coin through his enlightenment.

As the world of the small world creation technique lifted, the Lord of Terror Igor revealed himself once again.

"How are you still alive?"

The sight of Igor filling the horizon and speaking in unison was truly ominous.

But Sirone was looking at La Enemy, who had created this current situation.

'What could he be thinking?'

The fact that even Igor, a corps commander of the other world, was under his design meant La Enemy's long-cherished wish was far more massive than expected.

"Can you escape again this time?"

Blue flame spears once again filled the space and surged forward, but Sirone no longer dodged.

'So this is how it was.'

From the moment the first Igor had driven his spear into the ground, the coin had been flipped.

'I'll flip it back.'

As the spears passed through, they burst Sirone's face and pierced his torso and limbs.

But like the moon reflected on water, ripples spread and his body was quickly restored.

'This place is inside my mind.'

Of course he had expected it, but guessing something and accepting it through sensation were completely different matters.

Igor's true form felt through his seventh sense was as clear as grasping an object with his hand.

"Weak being!"

Igor threw his spears frantically, but they no longer reached Sirone.

The mind in the Diamond Buddha state was clearly in the realm of non-existence.

But Sirone could control his mind like his body, and the enhancement range of the Spirit Zone generated from that was unparalleled.

"Just disappear."

As Sirone extended his hand, a halo was born and brilliant flashes of five colors flew like daggers, instantly inserting 100% information.

"Graaaah!"

Overwhelmed by the presence of the perfect circle, Igor let out a tearing scream, and the photon cannon enhanced by the magic amplification device vibrated with a thud as it passed through Ataraxia.

As the world was dyed in white light, Igor's screams faded distantly.

Aaaaah...

The space they had occupied contracted and was endlessly sucked into Sirone's mind, and the events flowing from Sirone's retina in the other world also disappeared.

"......"

Sirone blinked briefly, looked down at his chest as if checking the battlefield where he had fought, then raised his head.

The blue flame spear was still stuck in the ground, and Igor sat on his horse in silence.

"Pull out the spear. You must remember that even you can be annihilated here."

"Kar de Suma (is unique)."

Igor's right hand slowly grasped the spear.

"Anke Ra (called)."

"He ordered you to instill fear in me, didn't he? To dominate my past."

Guffin had clearly said there was no cause in Hexa.

Then why was Sirone harboring memories of a past he had never experienced?

Igor spoke.

"La Enemy is merely an event that exists only in the past. But that event is dangerous enough to break down even the boundaries of the other world. We are companions of space, but also enemies who must never meet. If you disappear, La Enemy will disappear too."

This was why Igor had personally appeared to eliminate Sirone.

"That might be so. But if the realm of existence is dominated, this world won't remain safe either, will it?"

"...That would be so."

"Release my companions. I have no intention of giving up."

Igor studied Sirone's expression carefully.

"Is it possible to stop Ra?"

"It's not something I do because it's possible."

"La Enemy will eventually break down the boundaries of the world. Do you think you can handle it?"

Countless non-existences that could only interfere would become real and roam the world.

'Well, just looking at the current situation.'

Even the somewhat trained mercenaries were being forced to experience past traumas, weren't they?

If the boundaries collapsed and Igor was released into the world, he could guarantee that anywhere would become hell within a day.

"You know it can't be avoided, don't you? If we can't stop it, everything will end."

After careful consideration, Igor reached into his chest and pulled out a small glowing blue flame.

"O one who has conquered fear, receive this emblem."

As Igor extended his hand, the blue flame flew over like a seed and settled on Sirone's palm.

The blue flame perceived through his seventh sense was in the form of a necklace in the world of existence.

"Where there is fear, there I shall exist."

The necklace of Igor, Lord of Terror.

As Sirone put it around his neck through his enlightenment, Armand immediately sent a signal.

New brainwave detected. Paralysis of mental processes involving fear.

It was an effect that forcibly eliminated fear.

For Sirone, who had nearly had his past dominated by La Enemy, it was a necessary item.

"That will define the positions of you and me. When the time comes, seek me out."

Igor turned his dead horse and disappeared through a vertical opening in space, just as he had appeared.

As Igor's ability was released, the members who had escaped the terrible nightmare groaned and fainted.

On the other hand, the core members quickly grasped the situation from Igor's disappearance.

"Did you defeat him?"

"Well, that is..."

Just as Sirone was about to answer, Shagal's voice was heard from outside.

"Die!"

Immediately after, the sound of metal clashing against metal rang out at tremendous speed, and without anyone taking the lead, they rushed outside the structure.

"What's that?"

Quan and Shagal, freed from their memories of the past, were engaged in bloody combat, displaying tremendous martial prowess.

"It's Shagal."

At Rufist's words, Etela's eyes sharpened intensely.

'That bastard killed my master...'

Indeed, his actual skill was undeniably real.

His movements didn't fall behind even against Quan, who was among the top contenders among Heaven's members, and especially his juggling skills handling dozens of daggers simultaneously were overwhelming.

'That bastard killed my master!'

But that wasn't a reason to murder Karseas's archbishop.

"I'll capture him!"

Without asking for permission, Etela launched herself forward.

If her skills were mediocre, her head would fly off the moment she got caught between the two swordsmen, but she exquisitely penetrated the gaps in their superhuman movements.

'I won't seek revenge!'

Etela gritted her teeth and unleashed her Yin-Yang Wave Fist.

'But you'll have to explain yourself!'

Sensing the fighting spirit from the side, Shagal's gaze turned.

His hands moved faster than his eyes, and three daggers crossed up and down like teeth, driving rapid strikes into her forearm.

In that split second, seven shells embedded in her forearm, but no blood flowed backward, and Etela penetrated deeper to throw a straight punch.

'Resonance Strike Technique.'

As Shagal's eyes widened and he pulled his waist back, the fist grazed past.

The vibration of air struck his abdomen, compressing his lungs and making his eyes open wide.

"Urgh!"

To avoid Quan's follow-up attacks as well, he had no choice but to swallow his pride and increase the distance. As he retreated 10 meters, dozens of daggers he had pulled in advance followed.

'What's this, suddenly?'

He didn't think it was cowardly, but he was displeased to be interrupted just when his blood was boiling again after Igor's disappearance.

"I'll kill you first..."

Just as Shagal swept his hand to catch the daggers and turned to look at Etela, his face turned pale as if his soul had left his body.

Since it had been an all-out combat using all five senses, this was the first time he was properly looking at his opponent's face.

But the face that entered his vision was familiar in every way except for the glasses - it was from his memories.

"Tia?"

Shagal's expression was so bizarre that even Quan lowered his sword and looked back at Etela.

"Did you know this person?"

"No."

Etela shook her head firmly, but Shagal couldn't have the slightest doubt.

"Tia, why are you here?"

It wasn't just a matter of appearance.

Even if 100 people who looked exactly like her were standing there, Shagal was confident he could pick out the real one among them.

He couldn't deny what his heart, not his eyes, was telling him, but...

'That can't be. She's definitely dead.'

Hadn't he held her cold corpse in his arms and wailed?

Hadn't he felt it with all five senses!

"Sniff! Sniff!"

He breathed in to catch the scent of the incident, but his sense of smell didn't work properly while trapped in the brain in a vat.

'Come to think of it, what did Tia...'

Look like?

His head spun and he felt dizzy.

"Why is he acting like that?"

As Quan grumbled at his staggering alone, Etela charged again.

'I can't let him escape!'

She had to capture him and hear why he had killed Raphael.

"Surrender quietly! Murderer!"

"Uaaaah!"

As Shagal covered his face with his left hand and swung dozens of daggers with his right, Etela's movements came to an abrupt halt.

It felt like being trapped in vibration itself.

Not a single blade flew toward her, and doing nothing was the only way to avoid the attack.

Feeling trapped in a mold of death, Etela gulped.

Shagal denied everything.

'No! This can't be!'

Forgive me.

Raiden's voice was heard.

"Uaaaah!"

As Shagal twisted his body and fled, Etela tried to chase him, but he wasn't such an easy opponent to catch up with after giving him even a split second's advantage.

"Damn it...!"

As Etela ground her teeth in self-reproach, Rufist approached.

"Let him go for now. Something seems serious, and we don't have time to worry about others."

Igor had disappeared, but mission execution was impossible while trapped in the brain in a vat.

"I can release the brain in a vat."

At Sirone's words, Rufist turned his head.

"How?"

"I think I can remove the trap."

Sirone looked beyond the realm of existence through his enlightenment.

"It's over there."

Sirone led the group to a snake statue wedged between structures.

The 2-meter-tall snake with its hood spread wide like a king cobra was a man's corpse in his enlightened perception.

'I'm sorry.'

As he cast a small light explosion inside the man's skull with Elision, it made a thud sound and the face shook.

Meanwhile, to the group's eyes, it looked like the cobra's face simply fell off with a thunk.

"Oh?"

Gradually, a familiar landscape was revealed.

The structures that had been pulsing like hearts became solid stone, and the bright morning sun was shining in the sky.

Even so, only Sirone could sense something else.

'It was this complex.'

Countless spiritual beings that couldn't be felt by human senses were being clearly transmitted through his enlightenment.

'If this clear sensation were reduced to an extremely faint level, would it become supernatural sense?'

Sirone looked back at Rufist.

"Let's wake up the other members. They were shaken a bit, but they won't be easily fooled from now on."

Jane asked.

"What happened?"

Since explaining it in words would take more than a day, Sirone chose a simple method.

The necklace that had become an object in the realm of existence was transmitting its inherent mass to his neck.

'Ah, so this is how it's used.'

As Sirone extended his hand into the air, Igor's necklace blazed with blue flames.

Everyone watched in stunned amazement as the air scattered ashes and burned away around his palm.

"Did you open your enlightenment?"

Knowing what Meirei's words meant, the observers were simply dumbfounded.

'Come to think of it, your aura has definitely changed.'

Just as Rufist was lost in serious thought, a murky voice came from the other world.

"Raktas Sagaar Vero Dem (Do you need fear)."

"Don't tell me..."

The ground rumbled with thuds, and the Lord of Terror Igor appeared leading his dead horse.

As he approached Sirone and turned his head toward the people, Lian's eyes widened as he pointed.

"The Lord of Terror?"

Igor's figure behind Sirone, with blue flame spears hanging down, created a strange atmosphere contrasted against the morning sunlight.
