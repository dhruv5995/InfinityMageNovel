[583] In the Name of God (2)

The eyes of all Scramble participants were fixed on a single point in the sky.

Electricity generated from the ground was discharging through the atmosphere, causing lightning to strike down from the heavens once again.

"What is that?"

Hercy was so captivated by the spectacle that he postponed his analysis.

The only time he had seen lightning of that magnitude in actual combat was when the electric monster Lycon had faced a professional mage.

'That's where Nade is.'

The lightning was so violent that he didn't dare attempt sonar detection.

Finally, a massive light flashed as if tearing a crack in the world itself, and a thunderous roar exploded from the peak.

After that, silence.

'Nade! Wait!'

Sabina quickly retraced her path.

Even she hadn't anticipated that Nade possessed this level of magical power.

'The biggest problem is...'

Once magic is manifested, its effects become reality even for the caster.

If it was lightning powerful enough to devastate the mountaintop, there was no way Nade could have escaped unharmed.

"Na...!"

Returning to the battlefield, Sabina couldn't bring herself to call his name and stood frozen in place.

Everything had turned to ash and collapsed, leaving only Nade standing on the ground.

'It was the same back then...'

The terror she had felt when being beaten by Nade struck Sabina's heart once again.

It wasn't simply because her heart was weak.

What was happening to Nade right now was definitely some kind of 'phenomenon,' an aura of real and present danger.

Where Nade walked, Frings lay sprawled with his limbs spread out, his mustache singed and curled.

Just as Nade raised his right hand crackling with lightning to deliver the killing blow, Frings opened his mouth.

"...Please spare me."

The reason a lifetime's worth of sincerity was contained in those brief words was because Nade truly would kill him.

If killing intent had grades, Nade's position would be one of pure savagery without a speck of dust.

It was different from animals killing to eat or humans killing to possess.

'There's no purpose.'

That's why it could rightfully be called nature.

Just as typhoons, earthquakes, and lightning strikes hold no meaning when they kill living beings - he was a predator positioned at the apex of the pyramid of murderous intent.

"Why should I spare you?"

Looking at Nade, Frings immediately turned his gaze to the sky as if fleeing the moment he saw his face.

He couldn't bear to look for even a second.

Conversely, Nade was observing everything about Frings as if he had a prey's corpse before him.

The trembling of a terror-stricken body, the desperate breathing of a living creature.

Then, noticing the bandaged fingers, he lifted his foot and stepped on the hand.

"Aaaaah!"

"Don't make noise."

The sound disappeared as if cut by a blade.

"Hup! Hup! Hup!"

As Nade approached his face, Frings' terror-stricken nostrils collapsed with each breath.

"Don't breathe."

His breathing stopped.

"Yes. Die like that."

'I can't breathe!'

The reason he couldn't think that he would die anyway even without breathing was probably because Nade was more frightening than death itself.

'Am I going to die...?'

"Tell me. Why shouldn't I kill you?"

Just as consciousness was fading, Frings' eyes snapped open.

'There's still hope!'

What he sensed in the second question was a trace of humanity.

'He hasn't completely crossed the line. No, is he desperately holding back?'

He didn't know how that was possible, but it was clearly his last chance to live.

"If you kill me... you'll be expelled. You'll go to prison. The kingdom's powerhouses will kill you."

"I don't care."

The humanity disappeared from Nade's voice again.

"Huk! Huuk!"

Tears leaked between Frings' teeth.

"Think about it. Use your head. Because I don't know. So you convince me."

Nade declared.

"I'll give you 3 seconds."

"Huuu! Huuk!"

Frings squeezed his eyes shut and whimpered.

'Think! I have to think!'

The brain of a creature facing death sought answers at unprecedented speed.

His brain, the nerves connected to it, and every cell in his body began coordinating as all energy was released.

'There must be something, a reason not to kill.'

A unique neural pattern that had never appeared before flashed, and all his knowledge came flooding up at once.

When he couldn't find an answer there either, he finally began tracing back through all his past experiences.

The day he decided to become a pervert, overflow, infancy suckling at his mother's breast...

After rummaging through everything down to the fetus in the womb, the embryo, and even the two faint experiences separated into sperm and egg, what he reached was...

"Die."

'I found it!'

Frings' eyes snapped open.

"If you kill me!"

The afterimage of electricity flickering before his retinas.

"You can never come back."

"..."

Frings continued speaking while using up all the air in his lungs.

"You're desperately holding back. If you cross the line here, you... will never be able to come back. So..."

The squeezed-out sound crawled up his throat.

"Please spare meee..."

The electricity in Nade's hand went out with a crackle.

"Take out your Master Card."

Not knowing how his broken fingers were twisting, Frings fumbled through his pocket.

"Tear it."

With a ripping sound the card separated, and Nade stood up and left.

Frings' body convulsed with each sound of footsteps.

'Nade...'

Sabina reached out toward the departing Nade.

She was relieved that he hadn't crossed the line.

'But...'

What she realized today was that she couldn't approach him.

No one in the world would be able to handle being by his side.

Unless he chose to make room beside him.

"Hah."

Sitting on the burned rocks, Nade covered his cursed face with both hands and exhaled.

His original face had been revealed through Anchal's mental manifestation.

Thanks to venting freely, he had somewhat regained his reason, but what came flooding in was intense regret and self-loathing.

'This face. This face!'

Even without a mirror, his mother's image burned in his mind told him what he looked like now.

"Damn it!"

The two hands covering his face rose like awls.

Each time his nails scraped down his skin, blood-red lines were drawn across his face.

"Aaaaah!"

Just hearing Nade's scream was enough to make Frings feel like he was suffocating.

"Hup! Hup! Hup!"

Tears were welling up in his bloodshot eyes as he gasped for air.

Nade, Frings.

Retired.

The 6th day Scramble Royal ended, and Shirone's team gradually gathered at their hideout.

"Iruki, what happened? Why did Nade...?"

Shirone asked immediately upon arrival.

According to Lulu's signal, Nade had left the area and received an out-of-bounds ruling.

Iruki silently waited for the other team members.

Sabina appeared listlessly and shook her head at Iruki's wordless glance.

'Hmm, so that's what happened after all.'

They probably wouldn't see Nade for a while.

'It was the same before.'

The bloody battle on that rainy night flashed through his mind.

'Still, there were no deaths. He held out to the end. Well done, Nade.'

"Iruki, tell me. What happened to Nade?"

Iruki hesitated for a moment.

But if it were anyone else, he would want it kept from Shirone especially.

"Shirone, Nade likes you more than me."

"What are you suddenly talking about?"

"So trust me. Everyone has secrets they want to hide. You did too."

"But I..."

"Yes, you told us. So hear it directly from him. Nade will definitely return to us. Let's focus on the matches for now."

Shirone pressed his lips tightly together.

Shortly after, Dorothy arrived, and finally Amy came trudging through the bushes.

"Amy? What happened to you?"

Like Shirone after the first day of Scramble Royal, she was covered in dirt and dust.

"Cayden is seriously no joke."

Sitting down heavily, she stuck out her tongue and said.

"He chases like he has rabies... Shirone, how did you endure this?"

"Don't tell me the target changed to you? That's cowardly..."

Amy shook her head firmly.

"No. This is between us two. There are personal feelings that need to be resolved. Anyway, I'll handle Cayden exclusively tomorrow too. Is that okay?"

In a situation where Shirone had to stop Eden anyway, there was no one better suited than Amy.

"Yeah. Since we have the advantage in numbers, it would be good to tie up at least one person."

"Right, come to think of it, Anchal retired too. I was fighting Cayden and couldn't attend the mid-gathering, so what happened?"

"He negotiated with me."

"With you?"

Given Shirone's personality, he wouldn't have agreed to such negotiations.

"You must have had a reason?"

"Yeah. It's about Estas, but it's complicated to explain. Once we win the Scramble Royal, I'll be able to tell you for sure."

Iruki summarized.

"We currently have 28 Scrambles collected. The opponents have 30."

"Sorry. I wanted to at least match their numbers."

Iruki shook his head at Dorothy's words.

"Against insect magic, this much is good enough. There's only one day left now. It'll be a real sword fight between me and Hercy."

Sabina asked.

"What's the strategy?"

"Dorothy and I will team up and move together. Hercy will probably team up with Fisho. We'll fight using the Scrambles collected today, while simultaneously collecting tomorrow's summoned Scrambles to assemble the strongest hand."

"In other words, it really becomes a card game."

"That's the kind of match it is. But there are many external variables too. First, Amy will handle Cayden exclusively, and Shirone needs to destroy Eden's infinity."

"Should I break my current hand then?"

To face Eden, it would be better for Shirone to create an infinity as well.

"There's something to check first."

Iruki asked.

"You cast Ataraxia during the day, right? How was it?"

Everyone focused on Shirone.

"To be honest, it's a really strong barrier. Even if I had raised the output more, I probably couldn't have destroyed it."

Having experienced the power of Photon Cannon that passed through Ataraxia several times, his friends were shocked.

"To that extent..."

Iruki brought up a new idea.

"To give Shirone infinity, we'd have to use 12 of our current Scrambles right now."

They needed the ○○○○○○ (infinity) to break Shirone's ●○●●○● (annihilation) and a separate infinity that Shirone should possess.

"That's two infinities then? Isn't that fine?"

"Then the enemies will make two infinities too. From then it's war. But this is meaningless. As long as they hold Scrambles, infinity can be made anytime, and then the allied team with Fisho has the advantage."

"Then what are you thinking?"

"From now on, it depends on Shirone. Eden's barrier - can you really destroy it?"

As Shirone hesitated, Amy asked.

"What's the significance of that?"

"If Shirone can destroy the barrier, I won't break Shirone's hand."

"But then Eden could call Kong too, right? By bringing a Master Card."

"That's exactly why it's a one-time opportunity. We'll do it in the 6th round of Scramble, the very last one. If Eden doesn't have a Master Card, he can't call Kong anyway, and the match ends the moment the barrier is destroyed."

Dorothy said.

"Instead, we can save 12 Scrambles that way. Also, if Eden does have a Master Card, we can make 2 infinities then."

"Exactly. Tomorrow will definitely be a battle of combinations. It's too wasteful to use 12 Scrambles on Shirone right now. That's why I'm asking. Shirone, if you can break Eden's barrier, I'll use those 12 Scrambles in the card game against Hercy. Can you do it?"

"Hmm."

After careful consideration, Shirone raised his head.

"I can do it."

It was something he had to do.
