Participation (2)

A silence fell over the Ivory Tower's great cathedral. The movements of <Law Kill> illuminated by Gaia's ability were chilling enough to make even the Five Great Stars shudder.

"Is that <Law Kill>?"

It was piercing through the demons with movements so fast they could barely be seen even from high altitude.

"I thought it worked by twisting the laws."

"Of course it does."

Minerva, the original owner of <Law Kill>, smiled bitterly.

"The fuel is different. Since it can carry out killing in the most direct way possible, there's no need to change the laws."

"Yahweh's wrath..."

Freed checked the ground again.

Seeing Shirone racing along the path opened by <Law Kill>, he frowned.

'Fed up with it?'

The stars of the Ivory Tower don't have many opportunities to see each other's faces throughout their lifetimes.

They simply observe the world from high places and do what they want according to their own beliefs, and that's enough.

'How long has it been since the Grand Assembly was held...'

Shirone's action of feeling disgusted and rushing out of the Ivory Tower flickered in his mind.

"Looking down on people."

Freed stood up from his seat with a twisted smile.

"I'm going to Kashan."

Minerva turned her head.

"You mean to fight? Wasn't it the System Inspection Department's opinion that we wouldn't care which side wins?"

"No need to mock. Shirone got his way in this Grand Assembly. Perhaps it was the only way to break my conviction."

With Shirone pointing upward, the remaining members' beliefs lost their persuasive power.

'Damn brat. Can't he take it easy?'

Five members of the Five Great Stars who reached their destination by breaking through humanity's most fierce competition.

But if any one of them starts running again, the remaining four have no choice but to run as well.

Sein muttered quietly.

"Must we... climb again?"

Unable to tolerate the existence of an illusion higher than herself, she stood up from her seat.

"I'm going to Kashan too."

While the stars' emotions were stirred by this sudden development, Taeseong smiled knowingly.

'Thank you, Shirone.'

It's not a choice anyone can make.

It was like telling a mountaineer who had reached the peak of Mount Tai to now try flying through the sky.

'It will be difficult, but you must lead.'

When even Amanta joined the journey to Kashan, Minerva spun around with Zeta and approached them.

"Shall we jump down?"

Without Material's ability, even the world's Five Great Stars would find it difficult to fall from space.

"We'll jump from the Corona Kingdom."

"But Kashan's terminal must have been captured and sealed by the demons?"

"We can go to the Molton Kingdom. From there, we'll advance north to Kashan's capital. For us, two hours should be enough."

'It's cutting it close...'

Minerva, who had been observing Kashan's war situation, hid her inner thoughts and joked around.

"At this rate, won't Shirone finish everything?"

Freed snorted.

"It's an army of ten million. <Law Kill> is probably targeting Harvitz, but there are limits to its durability. And there's Amon, the 7th Corps Commander."

That was the most concerning part.

"The corps commanders from 1st to 10th are Satan's direct lineage. We should consider them equivalent to the Five Great Stars in any case. It's not a level that can be handled while cutting through an army of ten million."

The Ten Commandments of Chaos - they were the essence of illogical demons born from Satan.

<Law Kill> cried out.

Since its speed was so fast, the crying seemed to come from all directions, and the demons were stunned.

"What is this! This..."

A demon with a hole pierced through its chest, not even knowing how it was hit, collapsed to the ground with a thud.

Shirone's eyes, following behind, sparkled.

'I can see it.'

Kashan's imperial castle, Aganos.

But the problem was that the number of enemies was increasing even more as he approached.

'The dagger's durability is reaching its limit.'

Although he was attacking the weakest parts according to the laws, he had already penetrated over 100,000 layers of muscle.

"Ahhh! Save me, save..."

From within the ranks of demons retreating in groups, a thud was heard along with a shockwave that erupted.

"Krehehehe!"

As the demons were torn to shreds, dust clouds spread in a radius of dozens of meters.

"Pathetic creatures."

Division Commander Volcano.

He was a demon with lower fangs reaching up to his cheekbones and four thick arms.

"Don't run away! It's just a weapon made of metal! If you keep killing and killing, it will eventually break!"

The demons' confusion disappeared instantly.

"Die! Worship Satan with death! Show that detestable Yahweh what we're made of!"

As Volcano's demonic energy spread, 300,000 troops simultaneously glared at Shirone.

For an ordinary human, that hostility alone would have been enough to stop their breath.

'He's strong.'

Even now, <Law Kill> was killing demons, but there were no more who fled.

"That's right! To be afraid of Yahweh! This is a disgrace to demons! Attack!"

When the brigade commander shouted, the demons' switches were turned on in unison following the chain of command.

"Kill him!"

So many enemies rushed in that there was no gap for Shirone, who had been running without looking back, to slip through.

It looked like a swarm of mayflies, and the moment they clustered in a sphere around Shirone, a barrier of light spread out.

'Multiple Photon Cannon.'

The demons were crushed with a roar, but the number of enemies seemed infinite to perceive.

'There's no end!'

Fireballs flew from the sky, and ice spikes attacked Shirone, swirling around the ground like rapids.

Lightning and strong winds, heat and poison mixed together, and thousands of tridents and tens of thousands of arrows rained down.

The one-sided bombardment that didn't even allow for counterattacks was characteristic of demons who didn't care about the death of their own allies.

'Stop!'

Time stopped, and all demons within a 2-kilometer radius froze in motion.

'Where should I start?'

As soon as his thought ended, the scenery shook and twelve figures in black robes rose from the ground.

Time not bound by laws.

They were the priests of hell who had revealed themselves by squeezing through the gap of 0.666 seconds of each second.

"We are Shi-ok. We govern the prison of time. Yahweh, we have come to seek your forgiveness."

"Forgiveness?"

Shirone asked coldly.

"We will give you anything you desire. So how about calming your anger now?"

'So this is how it was.'

He recalled when Mortasinger, the terrorist from the World Beauty Contest, had disappeared before his eyes.

"What I want is for all demons to repent."

"That's possible."

"No."

It was with this kind of sweet whisper that they had dragged Mortasinger to hell.

"You need to be punished a bit."

Shi-ok spoke in a murky voice, different from before.

"Don't try, Yahweh. The world already belongs to evil."

The twelve priests who opened black booklets began to sing an ominous funeral song.

"Ahhhhhhh."

The twelve slid away, moving beyond the radius of the Stop magic.

The roar of enemies who had been suspended in mid-air erupted again, and attacks poured down despite the Stop magic.

"Damn!"

He had no choice but to cancel the magic to evade, and the flash of spatial movement shot up to the sky.

"There! Catch him!"

As he deviated from his trajectory toward Aganos for the first time, the demons gave chase.

'Block them for now!'

Yahweh's radiance flowed along his body, and the ground around Shirone crumpled in a whirlpool shape.

"Krehehehe!"

Demons with crushed legs flailed their arms with only their upper bodies sticking out.

Fire was extinguished with water, lightning with iron, and ice spikes were melted with flames.

'Split apart.'

When he commanded in Yahweh's name, the ground split in two and thousands of demons fell.

'Close.'

Kugugugugugu!

Hair-raising screams burst out from the gradually narrowing crack in the ground.

"Kiehehehe!"

Yahweh's defense was the only thing that had successfully blocked Nane's attack called sermon.

Over two hundred types of attacks were being launched, but none could wound Shirone.

'I can endure.'

Shirone, defending with Yahweh's ability, retrieved <Law Kill> which was ravaging all directions.

As expected, the blade's length had been reduced by half.

'If I pierce armor in this state, it will break.'

That was exactly what Volcano was aiming for, and having achieved his desired result, he charged forward.

"Yahweh! Is this all you amount to?"

Shirone gripped <Law Kill>'s handle tightly.

'Material!'

Black substance was synthesized and gathered on <Law Kill>, then transformed into the shape of a giant beast.

Its name was Beast of Slaughter.

'This should work.'

Even if the blade wore away to nothing, Shirone's anger wouldn't dull.

"Krahhhhhhh!"

The Beast of Slaughter, equipped with <Law Kill> as its engine, let out a roar and lunged at Volcano.

"By Satan's power!"

The moment he grabbed the Beast of Slaughter's head with his four arms, Volcano's eyes widened greatly.

"This, this is...!"

A shock so powerful it shook even the essence of demons crushed all the bones in his body.

"Uh, uahhhhh!"

Volcano's body exploded.

"Hah. Hah."

As Shirone breathed heavily and recovered his senses, 10,000 more troops gathered around him.

But before the black beast emanating an ominous aura, no one could approach.

'It really isn't easy.'

Shirone, mounted on the Beast of Slaughter's back, looked toward Aganos.

The Beast of Slaughter's face, having absorbed Yahweh's wrath, stretched long like a blade.

"Let's go."

The moment the Beast of Slaughter kicked off the ground, a hole was punched through the encirclement.

"Damn! Chase him!"

The demons belatedly prepared to follow, but Shirone was already passing through the outer castle gate of the capital.

'Wait for me, Harvitz!'

"This way!"

Kido, carrying Uorin on his back, ran down the complex path toward where the Wind General was guiding them.

'Just a little further and we can escape.'

Just when he thought hope was in sight, an tremendous killing intent seized both of them.

"Kugh!"

Risking injury to Uorin, he rolled on the ground just as a black afterimage slashed through the air.

'The killing intent alone could kill me.'

Kido looked back at Uorin.

"Are you okay?"

"...Yeah."

Still, since it was Uorin, her life was spared, but judging by her voice, it was a dangerous situation.

Where Kido looked up, a demon swordsman in black armor stood.

"What are you supposed to be now?"

His legs trembled on their own at the presence that was qualitatively different from any demon he had fought so far.

"7th Corps Commander Amon."

A light of despair rose in Uorin's eyes.

'Finally making his move.'

"Protect Her Majesty!"

The twenty Wind Generals who had been leading them converged from the sky and rushed at Amon.

Moving like a storm and creating a barrier of flesh, they swung their swords frantically.

The air vibrated, and as the darkness created by overlapping afterimages gradually became transparent, Amon's figure was revealed.

"Damn..."

The twenty Wind Generals had been cut into pieces and fallen to the ground.

"My weakness is,"

Amon approached while sheathing his sword.

"I don't particularly try to hide my killing intent."

That's why Kido lived, but the fate of the Wind Generals who approached Amon was miserable.

"Are you the Empress?"

Uorin glared at Amon.

"How did you find me?"

The answer came from behind Amon.

"Do you know why I followed to Kashan instead of Zetaro?"

Smodo walked over with a sneer, pointing to his own eyes.

"To find a fleeing rat, my eyes are necessary."

It was the ability of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

"How unfortunate. Even if you had to abandon your empire, you probably didn't want to be caught by us. What will you do now? Will you commit suicide here?"

"I won't die."

If she was going to die just from her body being broken, she wouldn't have abandoned a billion citizens either.

'Shirone, please...'

If only she could see him just once more.

"It's been a while, Empress."

As both Amon and Smodo simultaneously cleared the way, Harvitz, covered in blood, appeared.

'Harvitz!'

Uorin's teeth ground together audibly.
