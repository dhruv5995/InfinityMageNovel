[594] Time Cube (1)

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 57 minutes.
Space: Estas Warehouse 9.

'No one has come yet.'

Anchal, who had surveyed the interior, sat perched on Estas's control device, anxiously tapping her feet.

If time circulated infinitely, then the person who activated the mechanism would also come here again.

"Damn!"

Having thought that far, Anchal realized one fact she had overlooked.

If the current event in this room was already in the timeline where Estas had been moved, no one would be looking for this place.

'Because the event has already been twisted.'

Thinking that confirmation was needed, Anchal strode toward the entrance when Sirone roughly opened the door and entered.

"Sirone?"

"Anchal!"

Sirone ran over as soon as she saw her.

"Have you been waiting here all this time?"

"No, I just arrived. What happened?"

Sirone bit her lip and walked toward the control device.

"I failed. The events keep changing so I can't stop them at all."

"What are you talking about?"

Anchal, who had come straight here after parting with Sirone, understood nothing.

"Damn! What should I do? How on earth should I..."

The way she operated the mechanism without hesitation wasn't the skill of someone who had only done it once or twice.

As Estas vibrated, Anchal hastily stopped her.

"What are you doing? You said it was dangerous to twist events."

"Everyone's going to die anyway!"

Sirone shouted angrily.

"I have to turn it back. I..."

"Tell me what happened. I haven't encountered any events yet."

Sirone turned her head with a devastated expression.

"It's my mistake. I shouldn't have let Yolga meet Miro from the beginning."

"What?"

It was still incomprehensible to Anchal.

"Over there."

Sirone arrived at the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society using Estas's equations as reference.

When she opened the door and entered, Fermi's activated Guffin's Gate stood tall.

'Has Ms. Miro not come yet?'

"Sirone."

Then Miro's voice was heard from outside the door.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 48 minutes.
Space: Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society.

Before Sirone could speak, Yolga stepped forward.

"Miro, do you really have to go this far? What is there for you and me to fight about?"

"I thought our conversation was finished earlier? If you block my path once more, I'll have no choice but to take action even against my sister."

Yolga's companions snorted.

"Do we look like pushovers? If you're going to be stubborn, you're the one who'll die."

"Weaklings should stay out. I'm talking with Yolga."

At Miro's provocation, Edgar's face reddened and his mechanical arm roared as it moved pistons back and forth.

"You want to try it now?"

Edgar lunged forward.

"I never liked you anyway! I'll kill you right now!"

The moment Miro released her Thousand-Armed Guanyin avatar, Sirone intervened.

"Get lost, brat!"

Armand's robe fluttered as tentacles whipped at high speed.

"What!"

Clang clang clang clang clang!

Edgar's mechanical arm created afterimages as it covered his body like a shield.

Though he managed to block it, the 2-meter giant had been pushed back to where he was standing.

"Grrrr!"

The tremor was transmitted directly through his metallic arm.

"Edgar, are you okay?"

Mustang asked without taking his eyes off Sirone.

"That guy's no ordinary opponent."

Sirone pulled in her tentacles and spoke.

"Yolga, you promised."

"That's right. I will keep my promise."

Miro snorted.

"Sirone, don't listen to Yolga. You'll lose yourself."

Miro's words made sense from one perspective, but if she didn't do this, she would cease to exist.

"You know, don't you? The results are already twisted. If Ms. Miro can persuade Ms. Yolga, she says she'll take her own life."

Only then did Miro's expression become serious.

Since she knew Yolga's personality better than anyone, it was clear this wasn't a lie.

"Then may I join in as well?"

At the familiar voice, when Sirone turned toward the door, Fermi entered from beside Miro.

"You..."

The moment Sirone was about to speak, Yolga asked.

"Who are you?"

It was an instinctive attraction, and Fermi's eyes also wavered momentarily.

"I'm a merchant. There was a strong smell of money coming from this place."

But he didn't reveal his identity.

He hadn't opened the upper levels of Estas just to indulge in sentimental parent-child reunions.

What was truly important wasn't the past but the present, and the future.

He was the person who could most coldly confirm what had happened in this space, at this time.

'Coldly. Coolly.'

"Nice to meet you. I'm called Yolga."

"I'm well aware of your reputation."

After finishing the handshake, Fermi also nodded to Edgar, Nine, and Mustang, whom he had called uncle and aunt as a child.

"You resemble Fermi."

Though Mustang's muttering had an edge to it, Yolga only smiled.

"No need for idle chatter."

Miro firmly increased the distance as she spoke.

"I won't make any deals. If you interfere with my mission, I'll kill you."

"Miro, this isn't like you."

As Yolga approached, the Guanyin avatar extended dozens of arms to block her approach.

"Sister Yolga, you need to understand me. I regret that you followed me here, but I still can't stop."

"Your actions will ultimately lead everyone to destruction. Both the Adrias family and the Ardino family."

Yolga was already foreseeing future events.

"I told you I have good reason. I'll follow in Guffin's footsteps and protect the barrier. That's enough for now."

"No reason can take precedence over the consequences. I'll take responsibility. Whatever the problem is, I'll solve it."

"If it were a problem that could be solved, I wouldn't be doing this."

"Then tell me!"

Yolga shouted.

"What about that child? Why is Guffin trying to leave? Why won't you tell me?"

"I'm sorry."

Miro couldn't tell Yolga.

"Just die."

The Thousand-Armed Guanyin avatar swelled enormously and struck down at Yolga.

With a bang, the floor shook, and Yolga's companions scattered in all directions, each drawing their weapons.

"Attack Miro!"

"No, it's fine."

At Yolga's voice, Miro's eyebrows twitched.

Prajna
Holy Maria.

Yolga withstood the space-time-ignoring bombardment of the Thousand-Armed Guanyin without moving a single step.

'This is mother's...'

Fermi looked up at the avatar revealed above Yolga.

A beautiful woman with only a face and torso was tilting her head up toward the ceiling.

Her eyes were closed with bloody tears flowing, and her mouth was bound with iron chain gags. Seeing this, one could guess how far down she could accept the world.

'Annoying.'

To Miro, Yolga was also a good person.

But when met as an enemy, Holy Maria's avatar that absorbed any impact was arguably the most troublesome thing in the world.

"Miro."

Yolga spoke with sincerity.

"I'm begging you. Just this once, trust my judgment."

As Yolga put her hands on her knees and bowed her head deeply, Miro's expression grew even more wrinkled.

"This is why..."

The Guanyin avatar grew even larger.

'Sister won't allow it!'

Thousand-Armed Guanyin
Strike.

Under the violent attacks coming from all directions, Yolga's body swayed and thicker bloody tears flowed from Holy Maria's eyes.

"Look here!"

Nine gripped his sword and charged toward Miro.

"Hmph! You pathetic..."

Just as Miro was about to counterattack, Sirone flew over and struck Nine.

As four tentacles consecutively hammered his sword, Nine's body was slammed into the wall.

"Urgh!"

"I won't tolerate breaking promises."

Like a relay, Edgar leaped at Sirone.

"Idiot! Miro attacked first!"

The boxer's schema of charging while clashing metal fists was excellent, and Edgar's figure instantly disappeared from Sirone's sight.

'Armand can find him!'

As Armand transmitted the image captured in his retinal afterimage and he twisted his body, he saw the afterimage of dozens of fists flying simultaneously.

Clang clang clang clang clang!

When he struck with his robe and the metallic sound erupted, Edgar's eyes widened.

"What the hell is this!"

Sirone, who had protected his body with Ringer's armor, retreated while compressing photon cannons.

At the sphere of light that swelled explosively, before there was time to be surprised, flashes poured forth in succession.

"Wooooh!"

Edgar swung both arms to deflect the photon cannons, but the moment he faced the impact, he realized.

'This brute force...!'

Light had physical force.

And with enough power to shatter both his arms at that.

Rumble!

Edgar's body, pushed back to the wall, disappeared behind the smoke created by the flash bombardment.

"Grrrr!"

Edgar, who reappeared, was completely curled up, hiding his entire body behind his forearms.

Just seeing him trembling, one could gauge what level of power had hit him.

'Edgar was overpowered in terms of strength?'

That was Mustang's impression, but Yolga's reaction was slightly different.

"...Guffin?"

Miro was startled and made eye contact with Yolga.

Her outstanding insight quickly unraveled the clues by alternately looking at the child Miro carried and Sirone, who reminded her of Guffin, and for the first time, anger filled Yolga's eyes.

"Miro, you...!"

"It was an unavoidable choice."

"Miro!"

The moment Yolga shouted, Holy Maria's eyes snapped open and the iron chain gag broke.

Then two arms sprouted from the shoulders that had only a torso and began charging toward the Guanyin avatar.

Prajna
Destruction Maria.

As Maria and the Guanyin avatar collided, Estas shook.

"Abandon her! That child is a time bomb!"

"Sister, you're the one who should give up!"

Yolga was such a good person that she couldn't get angry without abandoning herself.

"Everyone get back!"

The moment Nine's words were uttered, Destruction Maria's surface began boiling like lava.

"It's going to explode! It'll blow everything away!"

The power of all the lies that Yolga had sincerely accepted throughout her life bursting out at once was equal to the intensity of the world's malice.

"Sister! You can't!"

That was why Yolga had entered this place.

'I have to end it. That child must not exist!'

"Sirone!"

Miro threw Hexar and strengthened the Guanyin avatar to its limit.

"Enter Guffin's Gate!"

"Urgh!"

Just as Sirone extended her tentacles to catch Hexar, light emanated from the child's body and it disappeared.

Depreciation Transaction
Reverse Teleport.

The highest-grade photon-type magic that instantly teleports a desired target to oneself.

The one who cast it was none other than Fermi, and Hexar was in his hands.

"Give me the child!"

"Hmm."

Fermi, who had been looking at the child, smiled meaningfully.

"Sirone, so this is you?"

Seeing his gaze, Sirone's heart pounded.

"You, don't tell me..."

But the aura of madness was brief, and he approached Yolga and held out Hexar.

"Here, you seem to need this."

"Ah..."

Prajna
Holy Maria.

Yolga's avatar closed its eyes, the iron chain gag was placed back in its mouth, and both arms disappeared from the shoulders.

Yolga, holding Hexar, knelt down.

'This child...'

Breaks the laws of the universe.

Whatever meaning that would have was beyond even the reach of ultimate insight, but the moment humans rely on something beyond human, the future disappears.

"Sister, you can't do that."

As everyone watched, forgetting time, Hexar scrunched up its face and burst into tears.

Yolga's sobbing mixed with the child's crying that spread through the silence.

"How could you... to a young child..."

Still, Yolga was a good person.

"Sister."

Just as Miro approached, a sharp chain scythe flew and struck Hexar's crown.
