[776] Chain Reaction (2)

Upon arriving in Zion, Meirey bolted upright from bed, covered one ear, and knelt down.

"Chief Justice."

Contact came from Terraforce, who was conducting a filibuster to prevent punishment for Shirone's violation of the absolute principles.

The situation had reversed.

"I've heard."

Nane's sermon, through the law of the heart and quantum transmission, was imprinted on all life forms throughout the universe.

Since it was a phenomenon acting on the heart, most couldn't even think they had received information, but those who knew of the violation realized it.

'Now violation is possible.'

Ankera—or more precisely, Nane who had devoured Ra's dream—had personally annulled the third clause of the absolute three principles.

"What happens to Shirone?"

The violation is approved. Of course, the same goes for Gaold. Of course, Terraforce's judgment will continue. However...

The Chief Justice chose his words carefully.

At that time, the judgment will have to proceed with the survival or extinction of the entire system at stake, not just the planet.

The end of the world was approaching.

"What should I do?"

Help Zion and stop evil. Miro will guide you. So that the day when Terraforce destroys the entire universe doesn't come...

The communication cut off.

"Nane survived."

Gaold's group had searched Jungcheon-dong for two days but couldn't find Nane and Shura.

Eventually, while heading to Antarctica on Kaidra, they only confirmed his survival after hearing the sermon.

"But Buddha no longer exists."

Miro sensed this was an opportunity.

"Finding Nane won't be easy, assuming Shura is alive. But now we can end the game. When we return to Zion, we'll launch a full offensive against evil."

If they sealed the altar and eliminated ultimate evil, brilliant flowers of good would bloom in the world once again.

Zulu, sitting in Kaidra's pilot seat, spoke.

"Yahweh will handle sealing the altar, but even apart from that, the demons are strong. It won't be an easy fight."

Everyone except Miro looked at Gaold.

'The demons are certainly strong. But if it's Gaold...'

A wizard who transcended ten thousand, one who defeated Buddha—they thought even hell's army of over two billion was manageable.

'The only problem would be...'

Sein alternately observed Gaold and Miro, who were keeping their distance with an invisible line between them.

They hadn't exchanged a single word since the battle ended, and now they wouldn't even make eye contact.

'It must be confusing.'

When Miro shouldered everything, it was actually simpler.

"But now the situation has changed."

Miro desperately needed Gaold, and Gaold still loved Miro.

What did it matter, he thought.

'You're not without feelings either, are you?'

Though she didn't want to admit it, ultimately the only human remaining in Miro's mind was Gaold.

Miro felt Sein's gaze but pretended not to notice until the end, tossing her hair back.

'This is really driving me crazy.'

Pushing someone else's back like it's none of my business.

Of course, if there was anyone who could be called a man to her, Gaold was the only one, but it was merely a speck of feeling smaller than dust.

That speck was so small she couldn't tell if it was love, friendship, or sympathy.

'I should have just dated a little back then and been done with it.'

During their Alpheas Magic School days.

It might have been possible to accept Gaold's confession during Inferno, the sixth stage of survival tests.

'Would the outcome have been different then?'

Perhaps.

'That's why it's complicated now.'

If Gaold had won Miro's love and then reached today's outcome, it would be bearable.

'But if I accept that guy now...'

What happens to Gaold?

When he finally achieves what he's endured for with only his feelings for Miro, the law that constitutes him will collapse.

'He might die. In any case...'

The strong mind that could even break Buddha would inevitably become dull, and in the worst case, he'd become a cripple.

'Does he know?'

Gaold probably knew.

'That's why he's also avoiding me.'

After breaking through hell twice and finally surpassing Miro, he still couldn't have anything.

'Still, he'll try to fight.'

Miro, momentarily thinking from Gaold's perspective, looked up at the sky with melancholy eyes.

'Whether the world ends or not, it doesn't matter to you.'

He was someone who could spend his remaining life with the woman he loved and leave this world anytime without regret.

'Still, it's okay. If you want it, I'll do that.'

Hasn't there been enough suffering?

'You've already done so much for the world. If you become a cripple, I'll take care of you, and if you die, I'll be buried beside you.'

But Gaold's choice was to stay by her side until the end and fight for Miro.

'But now you can't even love me?'

She had avoided Gaold precisely because she feared this situation would come, but now it was time to make a decision.

"Sigh."

At Miro's sigh, Arius shrugged his shoulders.

'That poor human...'

"Shirone! Time to move out! Get ready!"

When Minerva burst into Shirone's house, Shirone had already finished all preparations.

"What? That's fast?"

He already knew the situation from Taesung before realizing it through Nane's sermon.

'Mr. Gaold has returned.'

He had transcended ten thousand and defeated Buddha, and with Nane permitting violation, there was no longer a master of the world.

Gaold's shockwave caused a chain reaction in the law, eventually allowing Shirone to escape Terraforce's judgment as well.

"This isn't the end, is it?"

Minerva nodded.

"Buddha's disappearance is just the beginning. Without righteous ones, a chaotic world where anything is permitted will come."

"Ultimate evil will grow stronger."

Minerva handed over the <Legal Kill> documents.

"We have to stop it. Let's go to Kashan. Even using <Legal Kill>, we can't do it without the Holy See's help."

Since he was planning to visit Uorin anyway, Shirone followed Minerva outside without complaint.

Just as they were about to exit to the Corona Kingdom through the magic circle on the first floor of the Ivory Tower, four familiar figures approached.

'The card game players?'

Minerva's lips curled up.

"Oh my, what's this? Fossils who hadn't left the White Inn for 14 years coming here?"

The bald old man, Agaya, spoke.

"The game is over. We came to tell you the result."

"Oh ho, who's the winner?"

Gudio with the red beard replied.

"The one who tries to maintain the game."

Philanthropy.

Though it was just a card game, it wasn't an unwelcome result to hear before fierce battle.

"What will you do now?"

The gaunt man like a skeleton, Nes, spoke.

"Since reality has changed, we're going to run the simulation again. This time, the one who tries to end the game..."

"There's a more interesting game than that. Want to come along?"

For <Legal Kill>'s law to precisely target ultimate evil, the card game players were essential.

The man with slit eyes, Mais, asked.

"There's gambling more interesting than this?"

"No matter how interesting, it's still simulation, right? Now it's time to show our skills in a real game."

"What kind of game?"

"Making the one who absolutely tries to take everything go bankrupt."

"..."

As Myers looked around at his companions to gauge their intentions, Minerva already knew the result.

'Because these people are...'

Humans truly addicted to gambling.

"The stakes will be sufficient, right?"

All four spoke simultaneously.

Kashan's imperial capital, Aganos.

Uorin, who received word around midnight, had been running around the vast palace restlessly since dawn.

'Shirone is coming!'

With Minerva.

'Of all people, that woman.'

Uorin's eyes, which had been excited, narrowed.

'It doesn't matter. How long have I waited for this moment...'

It wasn't a waiting that could be done with a human lifespan.

'Finally I can meet you, Shirone!'

Though it was merely a change in memory, to her as the subject of those memories, it was no different from physical time.

"Gando!"

The door opened immediately.

"You called?"

"The preparations are proceeding without problems, right?"

"If you hadn't called me 30 seconds ago, I'd be checking on them right now."

He knew that as long as there were no mistakes in welcoming Shirone, Uorin wouldn't get angry today.

"Isn't 30 seconds too harsh? At least 5 minutes have passed."

"My steps aren't that slow."

True to his nickname Thunder, Gando had crossed the 200-meter corridor in an instant.

"Anyway, good."

Anyway, good.

"I need to do my makeup. Call a coordinator. Just light makeup. Lips a bit redder..."

Gando was worried.

"Your Majesty is the strongest and most beautiful person in the world. I don't think you need to do anything more."

"What does it matter if I'm beautiful? Shirone has to like it. Just call the coordinator."

"Your Majesty."

Gando risked his life.

"Are you really okay like this? I've never seen Your Majesty so shaken."

Uorin spoke while changing earrings.

"...I know too."

"Don't you know? Shirone is a tool needed for Your Majesty's daughter. If you love Shirone..."

Yes, let's die here.

"Will you become a daughter again and love your father?"

Having finally blurted it out, Gando closed his eyes, waiting for Uorin to call for execution.

"Gando."

The name she called was Gando.

"Yes, as you said, Theraze isn't an individual. She's history. But you know, don't you? Now Shirone has come with that history too."

Gando didn't want to hear it.

'Kill me! You must kill me, Your Majesty!'

When the vast history called Theraze is defined by the single human called Uorin, Kashan's future isn't guaranteed.

"At first, survival was the goal. But from the moment Shirone occupied the beginning of my memory, I've been waiting only for today while protecting history."

Gando screamed.

"Kill me! Just kill me...!"

"My son."

The moment Uorin's words fell, Gando couldn't think of anything, as if struck in the head with a hammer.

Son.

Since he thought it was a word that didn't exist in the world, he couldn't even tell what it felt like right now.

"Without Kashan, there's no Uorin either. It's true that I'm shaken, and I know I'll face the world's criticism. So..."

Uorin looked back at Gando with a sad smile.

"Can't you just cheer for your mother?"

His strength drained away as hot tears silently flowed down his cheeks.

"..."

Gando lowered his head, wiped his tears, and spoke in a trembling voice he tried hard to control.

"They'll arrive in the evening. Please get some rest. I'll proceed with the preparations without fail."

"...Thank you."

The door closed with a quiet sound.

Left alone in the room after Gando departed, Uorin placed her hands on the vanity and looked into the mirror.

"I know too."

Theraze, who rose to the position of Empress by endlessly analyzing the past based on underlying events.

"That's how I got here."

In a playtime as long as history, the moments of enjoying unexpected events were merely fleeting.

'Once is enough for a lifetime.'

The reason she endured repeating the same events, same dialogue, that boring play as many times as she reset was...

'The only unknown left to me.'

For the most brilliant event in Theraze's life.
