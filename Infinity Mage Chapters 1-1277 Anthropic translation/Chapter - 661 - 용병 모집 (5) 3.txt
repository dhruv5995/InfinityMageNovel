[661] Mercenary Recruitment (5)

'He was aiming for this from the beginning.'

Lufist's other strategy was to have Shirone form a mercenary group while he himself joined as a member of that group.

Since he couldn't use the Association now, the best choice was a small elite force, and in that case, it was the right decision for the strongest person, the Association President, to step forward directly.

'And here I thought I was the captain.'

Though he'd been caught off guard, having a strong ally was a good thing, so Shirone pretended not to know and let it slide.

"Uh, then..."

Looking at the documents, the name was confidential, and the specialty was listed as espionage and assassination missions.

'I decided to reject those with unknown identities, but...'

Since Aria was there as the document examiner, that wouldn't happen.

He probably calculated up to this point and included her in this operation.

"I'll test you for now. Since you're both mages, let's see your Spirit Zone."

"I'll go first."

Number 28, the man presumed to be Lufist, stepped forward.

Just as Shirone swallowed nervously at the tension of evaluating a certified First-Class Grand Mage's Spirit Zone, tremendous killing intent pierced through his synesthesia.

'What a shock!'

An offensive Spirit Zone shoots thorns in all directions, but currently all the thorns were focused on Shirone.

In a situation where he'd have to pass him even if he danced, Lufist seriously revealed his skills, making Shirone slightly irritated.

'Should I just fail him?'

Then Lufist's Spirit Zone trembled minutely, transmitting information through Shirone's synesthesia.

Like reading braille with his fingers, Shirone combined the stabbing hostile signals to complete a sentence.

Make sure to pass number 213.

'I'll handle it myself.'

Shirone grumbled internally as he passed the documents to Aria.

"Thank you for your effort. Next is number 29."

When Executive Secretary Jane entered the Spirit Zone, a liquid-like flexible synesthesia was transmitted, contrasting with Lufist's.

'A mental-type mage.'

He knew Arin, who was blessed by the gods in this field, but even compared to her, the mental fluidity was tremendous, not falling short at all.

'It feels like being submerged in the ocean.'

Shirone marked number 29's documents as passed and said:

"Thank you for your effort. Successful candidates will be announced after the first evaluation ends. I hope you get good results."

"Please take care of us."

Shirone stared intently as numbers 28 and 29 left the clearing and entered the building.

'Number 213? Is that a strong person?'

In any case, he'd find out by watching.

Moving on to number 30, skilled individuals began to mix in.

By the time they passed number 100, over 20 had passed the first test, and it was number 121's turn.

"Next person, please come in. Huh?"

Shirone tilted his head in disbelief after checking number 121's name.

"What? Why is this person...?"

As he slowly raised his head, someone he knew well was standing before him.

"We meet like this, Shirone."

"Teacher Etela?"

Though her appearance in shabby robes was completely different from what he'd seen at school, it was definitely Romy Etela from Alpheas Magic School.

"Why are you here, Teacher?"

"On my way here, I heard you were organizing a mercenary group. Please give me a favorable evaluation."

Etela bowed politely with the attitude of an applicant.

'She must have her circumstances.'

Since he'd graduated from magic school, it was right to follow society's principles, but meeting again like this felt quite strange.

He didn't want to evaluate his school teacher, so he was feeling anxious when she took a martial arts stance.

'Phew, she's going to be evaluated with schema. That's at least fortunate.'

This time, Rian's eyes became serious.

'So this person is Etela.'

She was someone Shirone had praised endlessly when talking about what happened in heaven, and her aura was certainly extraordinary.

Etela, who had been slowly rotating both arms, threw a straight punch that could be called the basic move of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist.

"Taha!"

The demonstration ended with that, and Shirone, feeling anticlimactic, turned to check Rian's expression.

His face, resting on his hand and lost in thought, was unreadable.

'Is this really okay? Her skills are certain, but...'

To someone ignorant of martial arts, he couldn't find any significant difference from other applicants' strikes.

"Yes, thank you for your effort."

In some sense, one might think she ignored the examiner, but Rian's tone was respectful, and he marked her documents as passed.

"I hope we can meet in the second round."

Leaving without saying anything special to Shirone showed her determination to seriously approach the mercenary group.

"Rian, was that some amazing technique?"

When Shirone asked about the reason for passing out of pure curiosity, Rian clicked his tongue as if troubled.

"Actually, I don't know either."

"What? You don't know?"

"I'm conducting the examination, but honestly, I don't really understand techniques or theories. My swordsmanship was also honed in real combat anyway."

Shirone belatedly remembered that Rian had been evaluated as so talentless that he even dropped out of sword school.

"Then what criteria did you use?"

"There's one method. I assume I'm directly receiving the attack. And when Ms. Etela threw that straight punch..."

Rian looked back at Shirone and said:

"My whole body got goosebumps. I don't know why. I don't know what technical excellence there was either. I just thought I wouldn't want to fight her if possible, so I decided to bring her to our side."

For Rian, who had no technical talent whatsoever, his combat-honed instincts were everything.

Therefore, if his instincts warned him like that, Shirone had no reason not to accept it.

"Yeah, I understand."

As capable successful candidates increased, his heart felt much lighter.

'From the Association President to Teacher Etela. Maybe I don't need to take responsibility for everything.'

By sunset, most applicants had finished their tests, and it was number 199's turn, the last of the 100s.

Aria, who had checked the documents, rested her chin on the table and smiled.

"Finally here, my secret weapon."

Hearing her words, the other two also checked the documents, and the moment he saw the name, Rian's face hardened.

"No way..."

The sound of footsteps that felt somehow off just from hearing approached.

A man limping with a long sword whose center of gravity was concentrated at the end hanging at his waist.

The sleeve covering his right arm, severed from the shoulder, fluttered with each movement.

'Parka Quan.'

Though he'd heard that Quan had voluntarily abandoned his right arm, the atmosphere was too different from before, so he checked the profile.

It clearly stated he was an instructor at Kaizen Sword School.

"It's been a long time, Rian."

"Ugh!"

Though he respected him as a swordsman, looking back at his memories, he couldn't find any good recollections.

Shirone was equally surprised and looked at Aria as if asking for an explanation.

"What's going on?"

"This is Mr. Quan, who will be my bodyguard this time. How about it, now you can feel at ease too?"

Shirone knew Quan's skills better than anyone.

"But how do you know Mr. Quan, Aria?"

"What are you talking about? How could I not know an instructor from Kaizen Sword School? Besides, he's currently working as a civilian investigator in the region where we'll be carrying out our mission. He's perfect for being my bodyguard in many ways."

'So he was in Radum.'

He'd heard that Quan was carrying out some kind of work with Miro since returning from heaven.

"Then perhaps Mr. Armin or Mr. Zain are also..."

"No. Currently, I'm the only one in Tormia."

"I see."

When Shirone showed disappointment, thinking he might be able to meet Miro, Quan frowned.

"Why? Don't you trust me?"

"No! It's absolutely not that..."

Rian interrupted.

"Enough, let's just proceed with the test. If you can't pass anyway, we won't be able to work together."

This was a chance to get back at him for what happened at Kaizen Sword School.

"You may have been an instructor once, but there's no special treatment. Please do your best."

Quan didn't even snort.

"Still as stupid as ever."

Rian's eyes flashed with anger.

"What's wrong with you! Did you forget who the examiner is now? I'm not the same person I used to be!"

'Hmm, certainly...'

He had become completely different from what Quan had seen at sword school.

Since he'd been helping Miro with work and had heard of Rian's achievements, he wanted to check his skills, but first he needed to pass the public test.

"Well then, try swinging your sword a bit."

Unlike Etela, his attitude showed no tension at all, and Rian watched with a bored expression, resting his chin on his hand.

As expected, Quan casually drew his sword and began his swordwork, limping on his right foot as he changed direction.

"..."

After a moment, Rian, who had been resting his chin on his hand, slowly removed it and unconsciously took a proper posture.

Watching the trajectory of the sword cutting through the air with a soft wind sound as if mesmerized, his expression held both amazement and sadness simultaneously.

'It's beautiful.'

A trajectory he knew was definitely there but could never clearly recall.

The trajectory that Rian had so desperately wanted to possess, swinging his sword without missing a single day, was right there.

'Is a genius's sword this beautiful?'

It was a level of swordsmanship that Rian could analyze because he too had grown.

After swinging his sword for about a minute, Quan skillfully sheathed it and grumbled.

"Is that enough?"

"Yes, thank you for your effort."

Even if Quan were his enemy, he would have had no choice but to pass him.

Aria added:

"Let's talk details after the test is over."

Quan nodded and left the evaluation site, and applicants in the 200s began entering.

Though fatigue had built up from the long examination, when number 213 that Lufist had mentioned came up, his mind was refreshed again.

'What?'

It was a girl in her mid-teens with a completely different atmosphere from all the veterans he'd seen so far.

Her hair was jet-black and cut short, and even her thick coat couldn't completely hide her gaunt figure.

Watching her stand demurely with her hands clasped together, Shirone checked her profile.

Her name was Meirei. She was a mage and from the Gallon Kingdom, not Tormia.

Gallon, which bordered the Kazra Kingdom to the north, was called a holy kingdom, but each country defined their god as an evil deity.

Unable to find any other special details, Shirone's gaze fixed on the last special remarks section.

'Unregulated.'

Though she didn't reveal what ability she had, there was no doubt it was necessary for this operation.

"Please begin."

Meirei deployed her Spirit Zone with an indifferent expression.

Befitting her age of fifteen, he couldn't feel anything particularly impressive, but he could sense the unique temperament of an unregulated.

'So this is why he told me.'

Even if she was unregulated, if her fundamentals weren't solid, she couldn't survive in Radum, so if he hadn't listened to Lufist, the probability of failing her would have been high.

Shirone checked pass on her documents and said as he handed them over:

"I saw well. I hope you get good results."

Meirei still didn't leave her spot and stared piercingly at Shirone.

"Is there something you want to say?"

"Are you Shirone, oppa?"

Her voice, heard for the first time, was as clear as a stream and addictive.

"Yes, but why?"

"He is afraid. Because oppa is Touch."

At the incomprehensible words, Shirone frowned.

"Who is afraid of me?"

"Ra Enemy."

Shirone's eyes widened greatly.

"How do you know that...?"

"I can hear it."

Meirei said, covering both ears.

"I can hear Ra's voice."

The person corresponding to Hearing in the Great Purification, Acet Meirei.

She was an unregulated who could eavesdrop on divine frequencies.
