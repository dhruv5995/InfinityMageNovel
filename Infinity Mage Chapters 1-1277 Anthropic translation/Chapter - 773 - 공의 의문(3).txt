[773] Kong's Doubt (3)

Beneath the monstrous bird Kaidra crossing the Pacific, countless starlight reflections from the sun rippled across the water.

Zulu sat in the cockpit guiding their path, while Kang Nan and Gaold sat facing each other in the hollowed depression of the creature's back.

Breaking the long silence, Kang Nan spoke up.

"Don't be too disappointed."

Zulu glanced back slightly, but Gaold remained with his eyes closed, deep in meditation.

Abandoning her clumsy attempt at comfort, Kang Nan revealed her true feelings.

"I mean, if they're monks, then they're monks, but how does it make sense for them to reject us?"

They had visited Zion only to be told access was denied, and ultimately had to turn back without even seeing Miro's face.

"If that is the balance of the law, then it cannot be helped."

"Hmph, then what about Mr. Armin or Mr. Kuan? Even Zion needs military forces."

With Gaold's group's abilities, Zion should have welcomed them with open arms.

'That's why it makes even less sense.'

Armin had deflected by saying Miro was away on business, but ultimately this couldn't have happened without her orders.

"It's not because of balance."

As Gaold opened his eyes, Kang Nan asked.

"Then what is it?"

"She finds it awkward to meet me."

Kang Nan's eyes narrowed.

"Are you joking? Even if you were dismissed, the former Tormia Magic Association President was turned away at the door?"

Gaold looked out over the vast ocean.

"It's uncomfortable for her to see my face. We fought so intensely in heaven. Plus, she owes me a debt."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

Zulu spoke up.

"Miro propositioned Gaold to sleep with her."

Kang Nan's head whipped around as if it might break.

"What? When on earth?"

"When you were captured crossing the drawbridge. The two of them had a huge fight. Even the great Miro was emotional then."

It was a life that Kang Nan had saved.

"So, so..."

"He didn't do it. Gaold went to rescue you, and Miro said she'd sleep with him when he returned safely. And now..."

Gaold had returned.

"Wait, does that make any sense? Humanity's greatest spiritual seeker rejecting us for such a petty reason?"

Zulu shrugged.

"Whether it's coincidence or not, it's true that Miro is avoiding Gaold. Otherwise..."

Kang Nan looked at Gaold.

'He still loves Miro...'

Whether hell or reality, to Gaold they were the same world filled with nothing but terrible pain.

Yet the reason he returned was singular - because Miro lived here.

Nane and Shura climbed the highest peak of Eastern Middle Heaven, hidden by clouds.

'There...'

Lies Guffin's door.

'Rally heaven's army and end the war.'

Terraforce protects the order of the universe, but that too is part of a system created by Ankera's will.

If Nane directly leads the angels to attack humanity, even Terraforce would have no justification to interfere.

'Ra is everything.'

After Beron's death, the Immortal Community has been acting independently, but heaven's army remains intact.

'Perhaps this is the end.'

Feeling the world's end approaching, Shura recalled the last words Beron left before dying.

Live on.

'I wonder. Is there anything eternal in this world?'

Eternity is necessarily unreachable, and thus belongs to the realm of faith, not fact.

Shura cannot understand faith.

'Anyway, I'll think about it a bit more.'

Resenting Beron for leaving such a difficult assignment, they arrived at a shrine with twelve gates erected.

At the end of the gates, a cave with a mysterious aura was visible, and Nane lit a fire as they entered.

"Guffin's door."

A massive iron sphere carved with Henna floated near the ceiling, as high as a mountain peak.

"Open, gate of heaven."

As Nane's sermon activated, an iron-colored sword shot vertically upward, piercing deep into the iron sphere.

The sphere separated into fragments, birthing a pitch-black orb that absorbed the iron pieces.

"Let's go, to heaven."

The cave shook violently.

"It's dangerous!"

Shura warned, but Nane looked up with interest at the dimensional passage rapidly distorting.

"They've blocked it."

"What?"

As Shura asked, the dimensional passage spat out the fragments and quickly reassembled into its original sphere.

"Blocking dimension with dimension."

Nane turned toward the exit and asked.

"Is this your doing?"

Shura frowned at the group now blocking the exit.

"Miro."

Miro sat atop Arius, who was crouched like a dog, with Zion's advisor Sein guarding her side.

"How are you here?"

Miro stood up and said.

"What's so surprising? You opened the other world, so naturally heaven would be next. But it won't be easy. I've studied this field quite extensively."

As Shura snorted and prepared to retort, Nane stepped forward first and asked.

"Seeker, do you oppose my will?"

Miro savored her first impression of Nane.

'This one is the current Buddha.'

One who mastered every righteous path and, after experiencing every opposing apostle, finally awakened to righteousness.

'Are eyes that pierce the universe like that?'

A gaunt figure in hooded rags, face and arms covered in intricate tattoos that likely covered the entire body.

'But...'

Was it strange that she felt he resembled Sirone?

"The word 'oppose' grates on my ears. Unless one side gives up, this fight won't end."

Nane's eyes filled with sadness.

"That's why I'm trying to end it."

"No."

The incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara blazed to life.

"You give up, Nane."

Just as the great mountain of the north becomes the lowest place in the south, to Miro the highest place was the whole without blind spots.

In the realm of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara that observed every place in the world, Arius willingly became a dog to heighten her majesty.

"Woof woof! Grrrrr!"

Shura embraced Nane's body from behind.

"Insignificant mortals."

As she revealed her serpentine nature, a blood-red tongue extended long to mock Miro's group.

"How dare you threaten the Buddha?"

Sein's Iron Wheel Eye spun rapidly.

'The God of Lies, Shura.'

Even she who denies the entire world cannot deny Nane's righteousness?

'Her level equals Miro's. Leave Nane to Miro and coordinate with Arius.'

Thinking the same, Arius stood up.

"Leave it to me."

Miro couldn't answer.

'No magic even scratches him. The standard would be to subdue quickly with powerful Axing.'

Even if Buddha was right, incarnation techniques that violated the law should be vulnerable to her fangs.

"We have things to discuss alone."

As Shura separated from Nane's body at his instruction and headed for the exit, Arius and Sein also turned.

"Miro, be careful."

Even if she couldn't win, if Miro died here, the world's balance would tilt drastically.

"I know."

Of course Miro knew, but this wasn't an opponent she could kill while considering her own survival.

'I have no choice but to risk my life.'

As Sein, Arius, and Shura left the cave, Nane approached a bit closer.

"Truly a virtuous incarnation."

Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara was also an aspect of Buddha.

"But the era that needed you has ended, so entrust everything to me now and awaken from the dream."

An explosion erupted outside the cave.

'They've started over there.'

At that moment, erasing all thoughts, numerical formulas expanded at tremendous speed in Miro's mind.

"Buddha, if you are truly compassionate..."

The incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara soared to the cave's ceiling, spreading thousands of arms like a fan.

"Could you not embrace even their dreams?"

Kong's doubt.

In the fleeting moment Nane's head tilted, Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's Axing activated.

'I cannot cry.'

The palms of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara flew in from Nane's left and right, tracing massive trajectories.

'I cannot weep for their dreams.'

The more time compressed, the more afterimages multiplied.

'Because they are dreams I created.'

Conversely, the more afterimages multiplied, the faster the approach to singular time.

'I must close them.'

Tremendous speed.

Ultimately, the reason all afterimages felt real was because a single impact's force was measured as the sum total of all counts.

'I hit!'

Such Axing.

'This is absolutely... impossible... to... dodge...'

Within time's fragmentation, further fragmentation occurred, slowing Miro's thoughts infinitely.

'It...'

The universe stopped.

Looking up at Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's palm without afterimages, Nane thought about Kong.

'Compassion for dreams...'

Thrummmmmm!

As Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara suddenly vibrated, Nane hurriedly emerged from thought, strangeness filling his eyes.

'It got faster.'

Boooooom!

The pressure from the clashing palms blew away the cave's ceiling.

Through the smoke, Miro clicked her tongue.

'Tch! He dodged!'

Nane, who had leaped away by a hair's breadth, flew outside the cave ceiling and looked down at Miro.

"Is that the spirit that protected the world?"

Nane's tongue moved.

"Sermon, Heart Net."

Thousands of swords formed a net, covering Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara as it burst from the cave.

'Incarnation technique sealing?'

As the law was neutralized and Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara struggled, Nane pointed his index finger at Miro.

"Bearer of Buddha's heart."

A sword born at his fingertip began spinning rapidly.

"I am Buddha."

The sword rotating at unimaginable speed crashed where Miro stood, and one second later, the peak twisted like a pretzel.

Rumbbbbbble!

As the mountain collapsed, the center exploded, and Miro appeared among the flying rocks.

"Yes! Let's settle this, you and I!"

As Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara grew endlessly large, tearing through the Heart Net, Nane's eyes flashed.

"Prajnaparamita."

Pure Land.

An incarnation larger than a planet created afterimages of over 200 million arms, pressing down on Nane.

'Can he dodge this too?'

It would be possible if he left the planet, but Nane, who inherited Ankera's system, doesn't tolerate breaking the precepts.

"Sermon. Open."

With arms crossed in an X, two swords were born from Nane's fingertips and rotated in a large circle.

Centered on that circle, the world expanded as Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's twin palms pressed from both sides.

"Graaaah!"

Like trying to burst a giant ball by crushing it with both hands, the air vibrated and the ground shook.

"I won't run away."

Miro resolved to die.

"I'll fight with everything I have."

Because she was one who must give everything, not one who maintains the game.

"Samadhi..."

境 (Boundary).

Miro's consciousness was sucked into the Void Kalpa, Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's speed soared, and the air compressed.

At the metallic crushing sound of wind, the three people fighting on the opposite peak turned their heads.

'Samadhi Boundary? How foolish.'

She had finally done it.

"No!"

The moment Shura screamed, Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara covering the sky clapped its palms together.

"...!"

Their ears couldn't process the sound, nerves went numb, and everything turned to darkness.

In the senseless state, consciousness gradually faded.

'Damn! It's shock!'

Being specialized in mental abilities, each used their expertise to protect their psyche.

'Miro...!'

Not knowing if he was standing or fallen, whether bones were broken or intact, Sein prayed.

'Just be alive.'

The echo of the thunderous sound shook Middle Heaven.
