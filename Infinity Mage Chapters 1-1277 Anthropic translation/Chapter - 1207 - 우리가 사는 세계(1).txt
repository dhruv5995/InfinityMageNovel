The World We Live In (1)

With fairly large fragments now falling before Sirone's eyes, Jet spoke.

"This world is made of particles."

It was an obvious statement.

"And the outer world is made of antiparticles."

"Of course, that's from this world's perspective. Matter and antimatter define each other through the concepts of existence and non-existence."

Jet continued calmly.

"Particles are classified into photon signals and quantum signals. Photon signals process laws, while quantum signals process the mind. Though of course, for me, that would be an error."

Sirone understood.

"If that's how we exist, then which existence has a higher phase? It would be how much proportion one occupies in the entire system. The measure of this standard is energy."

Existence is energy.

"Also, energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Therefore, energy can also be called mass."

Mass is...

"It's a matter of how fiercely one exists within the flow of time. Expressions like heavy or light are just definitions made by human senses, but in reality..."

Jet clenched his fist.

"It's simply existing."

The background warped around his fist as fragments and dust gathered toward it.

"It's called gravity. And when this gravity becomes too, too strong and exceeds the tolerance the universe can accept..."

When Jet opened his palm, a small point became a black sphere that sucked in the surrounding dust.

"It pierces through the world's barrier and goes to the outer world."

It was a black hole.

"You can create it, can't you? A singularity with zero volume and infinite density."

"...Yes."

Both Metatron, the Archangel of Existence, and Sirone could create singularities.

"It's not particularly a special property. It's just some matter reaching the universe's limit. It means nothing can become infinitely strong. When existence transcends its limits, the universe cannot handle that signal and spits it out beyond the barrier."

Jet annihilated the black hole.

"Therefore, while you can create it, you cannot enter it. More precisely, you cannot escape from it."

It was a space that trapped even light.

"Time ends at the singularity. And beyond that, the world of antiparticles unfolds. Therefore, the outer world comes to have imaginary time."

"God's perspective."

Jet nodded.

"If particles are the concept of existence, then antiparticles are the concept of non-existence. Therefore, it's normal for particles to exist, and their time of annihilation is merely an instant. Conversely, it's normal for antiparticles not to exist, and their time of birth is extremely short."

This was why antiparticles were difficult to observe in the universe.

"Through pair creation and pair annihilation of particles and antiparticles, matter and energy are created. This is the very mechanism by which our universe comes to be born."

Sirone pondered Jet's words.

"The means by which God can exert influence on this world is also antiparticles. Words like 'still' or 'even now' are useless. It's imaginary time. When time is imaginary, it means space is also less than zero. In other words, it acts faster than light speed. Put differently, it means changing laws by going back in time."

Sirone thought of the Pyramid of Truth.

"That's OOParts."

This was why relics of super-ancient civilizations seemed to be born without cause.

"Yes. God's will that applies transcending time and space. This signal is called a tachyon. It's an imaginary signal born from the world of nothingness."

Sirone let out a groan.

"The world of nothingness."

If the antiparticles that make up the outer world are the concept of nothingness, then our world as seen from there is...

Just a massive delusion.

"Do you wish to meet God?"

When Sirone raised his head again, Jet was taking a reverent posture like a high monk.

"To meet God, you must cross the world's barrier. That means you can never return."

In his school days, he had returned to reality through the spacetime of a maze.

Also, in High Gear, he had imitated God's thinking and returned to Under Coder.

But all of that was possible because reality was at the phase of the outer world.

'This time is different. To return to reality, I need to know the signal of antiparticles.'

Jet brought up the main point.

"I will teach you."

"What? But how..."

"I'm an error that has deviated from the main system. I can't exceed permissions, but I can access them. I can connect to the core and pass on the incantation about tachyons."

God's ability to turn all existence into delusion.

"It will be difficult to gain enlightenment from the incantation alone, but it will be absolutely necessary to meet God. Going to the outer world in this state would be crossing a river from which you cannot return."

Like Nane.

"Of course, the same applies to me. Accessing the outer world is an error that cannot be overlooked, and I will soon be discarded."

Sirone asked again.

"Why go this far? You live in this world."

"Well, perhaps because I'm an error."

Jet looked back toward the window.

"From the moment I realized that the countless 'me's outside and the 'me' here are different, I've had this thought. This miraculous error, this feeling that will never come again..."

He turned his head back.

"Shouldn't I pass it on to someone?"

Sirone felt a surge of emotion.

"But if that happens, you will..."

Though he didn't want to voice it, it was something that had to be confirmed.

"You'll die."

Different from the Jet outside.

The annihilation of the one and only 'me' who had realized the mind would be no different from human death.

"How shall I die?"

Jet, with one hand on his knee, made a half-bow and gently lowered his head.

"I believe I am ready."

Feeling his chest grow warm, Sirone struggled to compose himself and answered.

"Yes."

And he knelt before Jet.

"I will receive your teaching."

"...There will be only one chance."

Silence followed, and red Sanskrit began to appear on Jet's facial screen.

"Data output."

Ikael felt a thrilling exhilaration.

'It's moving. We're overcoming the laws.'

The seven archangels gathered now were almost all the concepts that had birthed the primordial universe.

'Just one more step.'

Ataraxia spread brilliantly.

'Rise!'

The moment their mental bodies blazed, the laws that had been distorted until now rapidly recovered.

That's how it felt.

Jet output data at tremendous speed, with shouts close to roars.

'I can't miss it. Not a single syllable.'

Sirone, kneeling before him, grasped his fading consciousness.

Massive entropy - in terms of information quality, it was equivalent to the universe's blueprint.

A groan escaped involuntarily.

"Uhhhh."

Jet's voice wasn't particularly grating, but the syllables were bizarre sounds that no civilization had ever created.

'I don't understand.'

Having reached the realm of Ultima, Sirone could decode all signals, so what he couldn't understand was not the form but the meaning.

'It's a completely different concept. It's not even a property that humans can remember.'

If he hadn't known how God thinks, information that would have evaporated after one second kept flooding in endlessly.

"Ahhhhh..."

Just as his pupils rolled upward as if he would lose consciousness at any moment, Jet's voice disappeared.

'It's over!'

Sirone hastily regained his senses and repeated the incantation he had heard at the speed of thought.

1 time, 2 times, 23 times, 328 times.

Having carved the syllable forms entirely into his brain, Sirone raised his head to look at Jet.

It might be an illusion, but he looked peaceful.

"Was it transmitted well?"

Sirone straightened his back and answered.

"Yes. Everything."

"That's fortunate. It was enjoyable."

Hearing the farewell, Sirone shook his head.

"You can't leave yet. You need to analyze the signal with me. Fortunately, the main system hasn't done anything..."

At that moment, the ceiling collapsed with a tremendous roar.

"It's dangerous!"

Sirone embraced Jet and rolled across the floor, then looked back at the rock that had fallen at his feet.

'Enormous size.'

The shaking of the world of laws meant that Ikael had succeeded.

Sirone checked on Jet again.

With the main system down, his body had no power either.

"Wake up, wake up."

All the Jets would be in the same state, but Sirone couldn't leave the room.

"I couldn't even say thank you."

"What? What is it?"

Marsha looked around frantically.

The Jets that had been fighting the Operator had all collapsed simultaneously, and the giant pillar had also lost its light.

"We did it! Sirone succeeded."

The full story was complicated, but it didn't matter anyway.

"Can you do it? You can do it now, right?"

As if there was no time to answer, Candy Mark equipped the Under Coder interface.

'I just need to know the code table.'

The hologram running on its own power picked up the main system's initialization signal.

"Got it! I don't understand what any of it means, but anyway, I can create something now."

If compared to human language, it would be like meaningless alphabet combinations, but knowing just the communication protocol allowed attacking the system with the data itself.

With the Jets rendered useless, the entire mining team rushed over to watch Candy's work.

"Hacking! Hacking!"

"Wait and see."

Candy Mark, who had infiltrated the database through various routes, gulped upon seeing the capacity.

"Um... how long will this miraculous situation last?"

"Well. 10 minutes? 1 hour? Why?"

"There's some interesting data, but it would take 2 hours and 14 minutes to download everything. If it reboots before then, our system will be attacked instead."

"No, no. Just take what we need."

"That's what I'm saying. The language system is different, so I don't know where the necessary information is. However..."

Candy rotated the hologram.

"I can read that this file here is titled Omega 999."

"What? That's our language?"

"Yes. I think records from before the future world changed strangely were preserved as they were. Anyway, the last readable file is Omega 999."

Records after that weren't written in human language.

"Hmm."

The Operator said, stroking his chin.

"It's a binary choice. Whether to risk downloading everything, or quickly take just what's urgent."

Knowing how valuable information from the future world was, Marsha made a pained expression.

'I want to take everything. It's really a shame.'

Candy said.

"The mining team leader should decide. Even as we speak, we don't know when the system might be restored."

"This is driving me crazy, really."

She sighed deeply and said.

"Take the urgent stuff first."

"Yes."

When Candy pressed the hologram button, the gauge began filling rapidly.

All the history happening in reality, the file of Omega 999, was being transmitted.
