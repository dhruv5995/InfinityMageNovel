[530] Under Coder (1)

The carriage that arrived in Bashka, the capital of the Tormia Kingdom, quickly changed direction and raced toward the Jijeo Mountain Range.

Miro and Rian were in the carriage, continuing their conversation while facing each other.

Though they had traveled without rest from Baiden to this place, listening to what Sirone had experienced through Miro's account left no time to feel fatigue.

It occurred to him that they might have fallen for a tremendous swindler on a completely different level from Alph, but Miro's skill in shattering Alph's sword was certainly not a technique created by humans.

And neither was his own technique.

'Divine Transcendence Yaksha...'

Rian, who had been lost in thought while looking at the scenery outside the window, asked.

"By any chance, do you know what the word 'Smille' means?"

"Huh? Smille?"

Rian finally brought up his own story.

From first reaching Divine Transcendence in heaven to the episode of eating Ymir's arm, and the story he heard when receiving <Idea> from his grandfather.

"When I hear the hallucination 'Smille,' wounds seem to regenerate quickly. I've already firmly decided not to worry about it, but I'd still like to know what it is."

"Hmm, I see..."

Intrigued by Rian's words, Miro searched through the knowledge in his head, but he had never heard the word Smille before.

'Theraze might know...'

In any case, since that person wasn't here, he could only make inferences based on what he'd heard.

"Ymir is said to be the pinnacle of creatures that reached the final stage of the Epic of Drinking. If you ate such a giant's arm, you might have gained regenerative abilities. But my thinking is a bit different."

Rian looked up.

"Rather, I think it might be related to <Idea>."

"You mean the sword's ability?"

"More like an action that involves deeper places, I'd say? Your grandfather probably extracted the object called <Idea> from a dream. But as far as I know, objects aren't extracted that simply. According to the guy I carry around, it requires very complex and difficult stages."

"Then how did grandfather..."

"The village where your grandfather briefly stayed seems to be a hint. And it's probably connected to the 80 million gold he paid there. In other words, <Idea> was already extracted, and grandfather only paid the price and brought it back."

"But it doesn't seem like he would have carried such a fortune while subjugating bandits."

"The person involved couldn't know exactly where the dream began. The inevitability of dreams probably intervened. Above all, if grandfather didn't know about the world called Drimo, it would be something he'd have to accept, right?"

"Hmm, I see."

Miro raised his index finger for emphasis.

"What's important here is, if not grandfather, then who exactly did the extraction? First, the possibility of others intervening in the dream is slim, so there's only one remaining possibility."

Rian swallowed and waited for the words to follow.

"Bloodline, or lineage. Thoughts accumulated from generation to generation created <Idea>, someone in some generation extracted it, and grandfather paid the price and brought it to reality. For now, this is probably the closest guess to the truth."

"Bloodline..."

"I heard that both blue and black hair traits are passed down in the Ogent family? Perhaps the truth is hidden there?"

Hearing Miro's words felt like discovering a ray of light in a pitch-black cave.

"Also, the reason I said regenerative ability is connected to <Idea> is for that reason. Think about it, isn't it strange? A sword that can never be destroyed."

"Strange?"

"No matter how I look at it, it's not in the realm of durability. Therefore, it's in the realm of concepts. In other words, <Idea>'s ability is precisely this: the information that constitutes the sword can never be destroyed."

Miro pointed at Rian.

"If perfect integrity was the will of ancestors, it would also be embedded in the traits of descendants. When physical information is damaged, it quickly returns to its original state. Therefore, it also explains why grandfather heard the hallucination 'Smille.'"

Rian nodded with genuine admiration.

The fact that he had approached this far with only a small amount of information made him think that he was indeed a magician.

"I think I understand something. Thank you."

Miro's face remained serious.

"You need to be careful, Rian."

"Yes?"

"<Idea> aside, your body isn't an object. If the action that happened only once when grandfather extracted <Idea> continues to happen to you, Ymir's arm might have had some effect. But even Ymir is ultimately a living being, and living beings inevitably have limits."

This was the part Rian was most concerned about.

"The Axing called Denai negates laws. Therefore, transcendent movement is possible without using the limit of physical strength, but if you get greedy, your body will still break. And if such things repeat..."

Eventually, the body would be destroyed beyond recovery.

Since living with such a terrible outcome in one's heart was something only the person involved could feel, Miro cut his words short.

"Sorry. It would only be disturbing to hear."

"It's okay."

Rian smiled.

"There were times when I was terrified, but I'm fine now. Even if that limit is next, I will swing with all my might. Because it's the path I chose."

Miro nodded with a reverent heart.

'A great straight path.'

The family tradition of the Ogent family—to break through any obstacle that blocks the way—seemed to be fully embedded in Rian.

"We've arrived at our destination."

The coachman announced at the middle of the mountain range where the road ended.

From then on, they traveled on foot, and when they arrived at the Ardino family, it was already around lunchtime.

Miro knocked on the door, but no one came to greet them.

Raising his eyebrows at the sounds coming from inside, Miro turned the door handle, and the unlocked door opened with a sound.

"Puhaha! So you see, when I was young, I was incredibly handsome. When I went into town, women couldn't take their eyes off my face and sometimes got hit by carriages."

"Oh my, the looks that even gods are jealous of, which I've only heard rumors about?"

"Huh? Ah, yes! That's right! Hahahaha!"

Miro looked at Enrique and Marsha laughing and chattering excitedly with hollow eyes.

Only then realizing that Miro had arrived, Enrique suddenly straightened his face and cleared his throat.

"Ahem, you're here? I thought you'd be very late."

Miro ignored Enrique and approached Marsha.

"When did you arrive? You're much faster than expected?"

"Huh? No. I also arrived just an hour ago."

"..."

The scene of them having eaten and slept together for at least three days flashed through his mind.

No matter what, her sociability could indeed be called outstanding.

"When you want to make a good impression on someone, win over the parents first. It's the basics of socializing."

Marsha, who whispered this, waved at Rian.

"It's been a while. But you've grown tremendously compared to before?"

"Thank you for helping Sirone."

Rian delivered the words he had prepared in advance.

Seeing how he thought of Sirone's affairs as his own, Marsha thought that only his size had changed.

"What thanks. It's not like I'm doing it for free."

Following Miro to the second-floor room, Fermi, who had been talking with Arius, stood up.

"You're fast. As expected of aunt."

There wouldn't be many people in the world who could find two people of unclear identity this quickly.

"I'm also busy, so here, the contract."

Miro placed the depreciation trade contract on the table.

The name of the great magician Millward was written in the buyer's signature section.

Once sold, chips could be transferred to others, but Theraze wasn't foolish enough to put his signature on someone else's irregular formula.

"Good. Now only Sirone's signature remains."

As Fermi picked up the contract, Marsha intervened.

"Wait, let me see it too."

Since Marsha had once used irregular formulas that extracted others' magic, it was natural for her to be curious.

After carefully examining the depreciation trade contract, she nodded.

"Well made. Activating omniscience and omnipotence by digesting the chip. You've twisted the concept of intake into acquisition."

Since there might be cases where depreciation trading would need to be used, Fermi made a chip himself and threw it to Marsha.

"It's a clay chip according to Tormia's official specifications. The picture engraved on the central inlay represents the type of omniscience, and the outer mold pattern contains omnipotence. Once you take out the chip, the expiration date is 3 days, after which it corrodes."

"Oho."

If it applied from the moment the chip was taken out, it could be said that Fermi had no expiration date.

He could just take it out and use it when needed.

On the other hand, sellers and buyers must be able to contact Fermi within 3 days.

"Do you just swallow it?"

"Yes. The omniscience and omnipotence contained in the chip are digested in the stomach during the contract period and eventually disappear. However, as digestion progresses, the balance between omniscience and omnipotence becomes subtly distorted."

"So efficiency decreases."

"That's right. When 30 percent is digested, you need 1.03 times the concentration compared to the beginning. 60 percent requires 1.07 times, and when 90 percent is digested, it takes 1.12 times."

"The performance doesn't drop significantly?"

"You can hardly feel it with a single casting. However, looking at the entire period, it's not a level to ignore. Also, there will be some difference in fatigue when casting continuously for long periods."

Compared to learning magic just by intake without any special restrictions, it wasn't even a problem that could be called a disadvantage.

"Now, now! That aside, it's your turn, Fermi. You've prepared everything, so tell us how to enter Under Coder."

"Ah, that was the condition."

Fermi picked up a glass bottle placed on the experiment table.

It contained dozens of red pills shaped like beans.

"<Under Coder> is a realm that exists outside of dreams. The reason you can't go there normally is because you wake up from the dream the moment you try to escape. Therefore, you need a drug that has a special effect on the brain."

"Is what's in the glass bottle that drug?"

"Yes. It's a stimulant called 'Dream Star.' When the drug takes effect, the brain awakens just enough not to wake from the dream and connects with real sensations. Therefore, you can escape the dream without waking from it."

Miro snatched the glass bottle and shook it.

"Ridiculous. To think such a drug exists."

"It's extremely difficult to prepare because you have to awaken just enough to precariously ride the boundary between reality and dreams. It's quite expensive, and it's not something you can obtain just by having money."

"Are there no side effects?"

"Since it forcibly awakens the brain, there can't be none. It would be difficult if you become addicted. But doing it a few times shouldn't be a problem."

"Good. What's the detailed plan?"

Fermi looked back at Arius and said.

"For four people to carry out the operation, we need to have the same dream. This is called 'address matching,' and we've agreed that Arius will play the role of tuning mental frequencies."

Arius, who was well-versed in human minds, could be trusted with this task.

After all, he wouldn't put Miro in danger.

"Good, then preparations are complete."

"I'm warning you in advance, but the final destination is The Abyss. <Under Coder> is just a passage to get there. If your avatar is destroyed, you might never wake up."

Since they had already come this far with that level of resolve, no one wavered even at the life-threatening warning.

"It doesn't matter, if we can save Sirone."

Hearing Rian's solemn resolve, Fermi smiled.

'This will be an interesting journey.'
