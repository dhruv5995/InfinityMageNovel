The Presence of Absence (3)

? ?

After Shirone annihilated Ionas, Ikael's luminous body no longer wavered.

It was simply illuminating the sky with light more brilliant than anything else in the world.

'Guffin.'

Pain and ecstasy mixed together like pouring cold and hot water simultaneously onto her chest.

'Truly, truly...'

In Shirone, Ikael saw.

'Our child.'

The image of the one man she had loved most in the world.

Shirone, who was looking down at her, seemed right before her eyes as she reached out her hand.

"Ah."

Just as Ikael raised her arm as if to grasp his hand.

"Show restraint."

The archangels surrounded her.

Even Uriel, who had unknowingly supported Ikael, now only revealed quiet hostility.

"Don't you know? If you go to Shirone here and now, there will be no turning back."

Uriel on the left, Rayel on the right, and Satiel guarding Ikael's rear.

As Ikael turned her gaze left and right, sensing them, then returned her sight forward, the Maras were blocking the path.

Satiel spoke.

"Give up. Even you can't stop all of us. And we won't show mercy."

For a long while, Ikael felt the archangels' killing intent piercing into her like thorns.

"Hehe."

One corner of Ikael's mouth rose.

Uriel, Rayel, and Satiel couldn't react in the face of this unfamiliar sense of unease.

They could only wonder if there had ever been a time throughout history when an archangel had sneered at someone.

Ikael asked.

"I can't stop all of you?"

They had already said as much.

Ikael turned her body to look around at the archangels.

"Answer me. That I cannot stop all of you. Were you truly thinking that with all your heart?"

Though they had already said so, the archangels found themselves reconsidering as if entranced by something.

Was that really the case?

Could they... subdue Ikael?

"Shirone is my son."

Having kept it in her heart for such a long time, just speaking the words sent shivers through her.

'I'm not afraid.'

Guffin had departed, but wasn't his son, who resembled him so much, reaching out his hand?

"Though many years have passed, I will no longer retreat. If you would block my path as I command as an archangel..."

Ikael spoke coldly.

"No longer expect respect from me."

Satiel deployed the Judicial Halo Nostalgear and shot back.

"Respect? That's what we should be saying. You're not an archangel. You're a cancerous existence that fights for humans and betrays Heaven's army."

Before Heaven's clear regulations, Uriel could not reveal personal preferences.

'...Is there no choice but to fight?'

The Judicial Halo Ragnarok unfolded, and Rayel also activated Accelerator.

"Since you have laid down your authority yourself, do not resent us."

"My authority is given only because I am myself."

Ikael burst into hollow laughter.

"It is something you need neither speak of, nor concern yourselves with, nor can you break."

The moment her words ended, the three archangels and the Maras ahead charged simultaneously.

It was a truly cosmic force, but Ikael's eyes rather sank into a deep abyss.

She said.

"Increase."

In that moment, countless life forms on earth saw another sun floating in the sky.

Ymir, caught in the law of <Legal Kill>, writhed his body as if in agony.

Shirone's group could only watch while calming their rapidly beating hearts.

Though they didn't know how Ymir could be killed, the law was trying to draw in everything that existed in the universe to create that event.

It was beyond the realm of human imagination, and all they could confirm with their eyes was the occasional brilliant multicolored light flashing on the surface of the black space surrounding Ymir.

"Graaaah!"

A killing intent that could kill every living being in the universe and still have more began to squeeze Ymir's heart.

'Die, please die.'

The reason even those who don't believe in God naturally join hands is because, honestly, they never want to fight again.

'You just need to disappear.'

Must the universe be sacrificed?

As the black space rose to his neck and was about to cover his entire body, Ymir glared at Shirone and said.

"To do this to me in such a way..."

His mouth was blocked by the space, cutting off his voice, and finally it covered even Ymir's face.

What Shirone's group could see was probably just a black sphere containing the entire universe.

"Is it over?"

Moments later, the black sphere vibrated ominously, foretelling destruction.

Rumble rumble rumble!

The ground shook up and down as if an earthquake had occurred, and buildings swayed left and right.

'It doesn't matter. As long as we can catch him here.'

At that moment, white cracks began to appear in the black space.

The cracks accelerated, and golden light burst fiercely from the hideously split gaps.

"Kyaaaah!"

Ymir spread his limbs wide and roared, and the black space clinging like a shell burned away without a trace.

Even after witnessing this sight with their own eyes, it took Shirone a long time to utter the word failure.

'That can't be.'

<Legal Kill> absolutely never disappears until it kills its target.

If it cannot eliminate through a specific event, it's a legal weapon that will artificially manipulate the situation to take the opponent's life no matter what.

It doesn't mean it's powerful - that's simply its original function.

'Yet the fact that it couldn't kill Ymir means...'

Those who knew <Legal Kill> and even those who didn't all intuited one fact.

"There's no way to kill him."

At least not in this universe.

Chills rose at the eerie truth.

"Good attempt."

Ymir moved with a slightly tired expression.

"I don't know what it was, but it was decent. However..."

Ymir, who had burst out a shockwave, lunged at everyone suffering from mental confusion.

"It's not the way I want."

"Dodge!"

The incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara created an iron wall with countless palms.

"Hiyaaah!"

When Ymir charged straight through, Miro's pupil shook momentarily.

"Whooooo!"

Having quickly regained her composure, she exhaled long and swept both arms.

Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara

Twin Thunder Palm.

The moment Ymir was caught in the joined palms, hundreds of millions of strikes rushed in at the ultimate moment.

"Hehehehe!"

The fact that he was laughing even in this situation made Ymir feel terrifying.

"Weak."

When Ymir stamped his foot, the earth trembled.

"So weak!"

Simultaneously, riding on the earth's rumble, came a sharp sound that made teeth ache.

"...!"

It was probably instinct.

That Ymir, who had been throwing a straight punch at Miro's face, turned his head.

'What?'

It was a fist-sized air bullet flying through the air.

The moment he moved his other hand to block it, there was a bang and Ymir's body was pushed back.

"Graaah!"

The bullet caught in his hand burst, tearing the skin.

'It hurts.'

The shock penetrated his bones and passed through.

The group, who had been staring blankly at Ymir pushed back dozens of meters, slowly turned their heads.

"Ugh..."

A dying sound. Someone stepped out from the shadows of an alley.

At first they thought it was a corpse.

His hair was disheveled, and his gaunt face resembled a skull.

"Ah, ugh..."

Even speaking was difficult and his legs were stiff as if frozen, but Kang Nan recognized him at a glance.

"Gaold."

Rather than joy, she couldn't understand how he had managed to come here in such a state.

Looking around like a lost person, he caught sight of Miro, who had just escaped from the moment before death.

A spark of life briefly returned to his dead, blackened pupils.

"Don't cry."

Gaold spoke with a dazed expression.

"Smile."

Seine approached.

"Gaold, you..."

As he got closer, a foul smell wafted over, but even that seemed trivial compared to how serious his condition was.

Miro said.

"Why did you come?"

When Shirone's group turned their heads, she had an emotionless expression.

"You should just die instead. What are you planning to do, appearing before us in such a state?"

Kang Nan's eyes widened.

"Is that what you should be saying right now? Whose life did you save?"

Miro held out her hand as if to say don't interfere.

Even if it weren't for maintaining the perfect mentality of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara, she would have said the same thing.

"Go back. Your role is over now."

"I can't go back."

"Why?"

Miro gritted her teeth.

"Why are you being so pathetically persistent? I said I liked it. I said I'd become your woman if you wanted. You were the one who rejected that. And now I'm sick of someone like you too."

"...Right."

"If you understand, get lost! Disappear from my sight!"

"I understand, Miro. So..."

Gaold lifted his chin and smiled faintly.

"Smile."

Though it was still incomprehensible, Miro bit her lips while putting strength in her eyes.

As Gaold began walking, Ymir, who had been examining his torn palm, raised his head.

A skeletal human was approaching with a limp, but strangely, he didn't seem weak.

'The pinnacle of something.'

Ymir intuited.

'If I am infinitely distant from sensation...'

Ymir revealed his killing intent again and straightened his torso.

"The existence closest to sensation."

"What are you babbling about?"

When Gaold, with one eye half-closed, spoke, Ymir's mouth corners rose.

"...You did well to come."

Destroy everything and become the universe's dignity.

"I am the strongest!"

At the same time Ymir launched his heavy body, Gaold's face contorted like a demon.

'Vacuum Press.'

With a thud, Ymir's charge stopped and his waist bent sharply.

"Hehe! Not bad? But..."

As Ymir trembled and slowly raised his head, Gaold's nerves began jumping all at once.

"Hehe, hehehehehe!"

But his expression was also wickedly smiling just like Ymir's.

"Something like you calls itself the Giant King?"

At Gaold's characteristic mockery, Seine, sensing something ominous, reached out.

"No! If you break the precepts here...!"

All humans in the city would die.

"Haaah!"

Gaold's pupils rolled upward, not even pretending to listen.

'Pain?'

In the lightless space of the mind, an endless single pathway stretched out.

'What is pain?'

Standing at the starting point, Gaold walked toward the blade extending from the destination.

The blade pierced his abdomen.

'This is pain.'

Even while feeling the sensation of the blade continuously cutting through his body, he didn't stop.

As he advanced, another blade waited at a position to pierce his shoulder.

'I advance.'

The number of blades increased as he went - piercing his forehead, his heart, his thigh...

Finally, countless blades that would pierce his entire body and more waited before Gaold's eyes.

'To advance is everything.'

Even in the burning pain throughout his body, his legs didn't stop.

If he stopped here, the pain would lessen, but if that meant death...

'Graaah!'

Gaold charged with all his might.

'Uaaaah!'

Even as thousands of blades cut through his body, not knowing where the end was, or even if there might be no end at all.

'I won't stop.'

Throwing his body toward the pain visible before his eyes, that was precisely...

"My life!"

As Gaold's mind compressed to unfathomable depths, Shirone's group's eyes shook with shock.

"Crazy bastard..."

Simultaneously, an immeasurable Air Press crushed down on Ymir's body.
