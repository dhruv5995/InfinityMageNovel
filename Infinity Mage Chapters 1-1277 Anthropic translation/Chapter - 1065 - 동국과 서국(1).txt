**East Country and West Country (1)**

Shirone grasped the situation.

Destroyer God 707's party had slightly twisted Crainer's trajectory with their concentrated fire.

'They came back to save me.'

The angle was only around 10 degrees, but for Shirone in his ultra-focused state, it was his only way out.

"Thanks. Thanks to you—"

"You idiot!"

Suddenly Destroyer God 707's eyes went wide, then he immediately turned around and ran.

"What are you doing? Hurry up and get out of here!"

When Shirone turned around, he saw the Ten Men who had returned to the starting point firing their rifles in rapid succession.

"Ugh!"

Dragging his numb leg, Shirone threw himself toward the rope area.

Once he crossed the boundary line, the gunfire stopped.

"That's it. We're good now."

As Death Princess let out a sigh of relief, Shirone looked back at Iron Hometown.

Ten Man 10 was approaching the exit with his subordinates supporting him.

Top Code Name said:

"It's useless. The starting point has already been changed. Even if you kill us, we'll just come back to life."

"Hey, Yahweh 2."

Ten Man 10, who had stopped in front of the boundary line, asked:

"East Country or West Country? I don't know which one you belong to, but come over to our guild. We'll support you all the way to Magnan level, and after that we guarantee 10 percent of the profits."

Destroyer God 707's eyes changed.

'Magnan means level 260. Are these guys serious? Supporting from level 1 would cost a massive amount of galaxies.'

The highest level he had reached before laundering his code name was 183.

"I'm not interested in Ten Man."

Ten Man 10 frowned.

"What are you talking about? Of course I mean the main base. Ten Man activities are just... no, never mind. You'd better think carefully. Our guild's influence in the mainland is among the top five."

Destroyer God 707's party's expressions darkened.

'This is a threat.'

Of course, even large guilds rarely issue death warrants against specific users.

There's such a thing as justification, and if public opinion turns bad, it becomes difficult to maintain the guild.

'But justification can be twisted however you want. Especially in cases like Yahweh 2, it's even easier.'

Just dodging bullets with bio alone was enough to cause controversy in the mainland.

"No."

Shirone was firm.

"If you have a separate main base, then you guys are even more vicious. That's probably why you won't tell us the guild name either. Do whatever you want. I'll smash you to pieces."

"...You'll regret it."

Ten Man 10 had more to say, but his High Gear stopped before that.

As his body turned into a corpse and disappeared to the starting point, his subordinates pointed fingers and retreated.

"Be careful. I'll remember your code name."

Only after the Ten Men disappeared from view did Shirone turn toward the Electronic Wasteland.

"Let's go too. We need to reach Atogram by tomorrow at least. You'll take me there, right?"

"Huh? Oh, yeah."

The fact that Yahweh 2 had boldly stood up to Ten Man 10's threat was shocking to them.

'I thought he had an innocent personality, but he's surprisingly aggressive.'

Iron Hometown, starting point.

When Ten Man 10 opened his eyes, Sancho was beside him with a twisted expression.

"Boss."

"...How did it go?"

"They left. I offered to scout him but he didn't bite at all. He's not afraid of death warrants either. Must belong to a major guild."

"Damn, how could we get breached by just one person? The rumors will spread soon, this is so embarrassing."

It was a comment that completely ignored Destroyer God 707's party.

"But it was kind of strange. Dodging bullets in bio state..."

"AAAHHHHH! AAAHHHHH!"

Sancho couldn't contain his rage.

"This bastard gave me a headshot? Hey, you recorded everything, right? Report it to the administrators right now."

"Will that be okay? The video can't be edited. All our voices will be in there too."

"Hmph! What can they do about it? But using system errors for gameplay is on a different level. That's a permanent ban. I'll make sure he can never set foot here again."

"...Okay."

Ten Man 10 opened the administrator suggestion page located at the top of Middle Reality.

The video file was uploaded.

Shirone asked:

"We have to spend the night in the Electronic Wasteland? Is Atogram really that far?"

Death Princess tapped her chin with her index finger.

"Hmm, should I say it's far? If you run, it takes about 3 hours, but if you're over level 100, it's a 30-minute cut. And it's not so much about distance as it is about level."

Top Code Name explained:

"It's more about height than distance. The end of the Electronic Wasteland is surrounded by walls. To jump over them, your High Gear's output needs to be at least level 10."

"Ah, so we need to level up as we go. But are there hunting targets here too?"

"Of course. Parts are hard to get, but in the early stages you can earn quite a decent amount of galaxies. The standard is to save money here and buy the beginner package in Atogram."

"I see. The beginner package."

Destroyer God 707 frowned.

"I really don't get you. Are you really a beginner? Then what gave you the guts to stand up to Ten Man 10? If their main base puts you on the kill list, we're all finished."

While Shirone wasn't particularly afraid, he didn't want his companions to suffer because of him either.

"I told you a friend is waiting for me in Atogram. He'll probably solve it."

"That merchant? What's his code name? If he's capable, I'd know him too."

"Son of Olga."

All three turned their heads simultaneously.

"What! Son of Yolga?"

"Yeah. We don't really get along personality-wise, but he's reliable in this kind of situation. Don't worry too much—"

"What are you talking about! He's an East Country ranker! And he's 4th in the overall duel rankings! That Yolga is really your friend?"

"I guess...? Well, we're classmates anyway."

Death Princess asked with sparkling eyes:

"Then we can meet him too when we get to Atogram? Right? You'll introduce us, won't you?"

"Of course. With the Ten Men situation and everything, I can't let you guys suffer because of me."

"Suffer? This is actually..."

Destroyer God 707 thought:

'Not just any ranker in the top 100, but Son of Yolga. This is really jackpot. I definitely have to go East Country.'

When he searched for Son of Yolga, the rankings by category appeared followed by his affiliated guild's emblem taking up space.

'East Country guild ranking 1st. Golden Wheel.'

Imagining the Golden Wheel emblem that would be engraved next to the code name, his lips naturally curved upward.

Shirone asked:

"What? Why are you all grinning?"

Destroyer God 707 shook his head and said:

"Huh? It's nothing. Anyway, now I understand. Are you aiming to be a ranker too? You better not ignore me later."

"Actually, I didn't come here to play seriously. It's personal business, but I need to beat someone."

"Those cases exist. Having a showdown in High Gear. Then your opponent must be from West Country. What's the code name? I'll search for it."

"Operator."

Silence fell.

There was no need to search, but on the other hand, their minds became jumbled.

"Maybe a fake..."

"No, it's that Operator. From what I heard, he's the strongest in High Gear."

'This guy really knows nothing.'

Otherwise, such a common expression like "he's the strongest I heard" couldn't have come out.

"Alright. Speaking from a veteran's perspective, the probability of you beating Operator solo is zero. I'm not disrespecting you, it's just how High Gear's system works."

Death Princess said:

"When level increases, engine output increases too. But that's the most basic thing. When AI level rises, combat convenience improves tremendously."

Shirone had already felt this firsthand.

"Even if levels are the same, power varies tremendously depending on parts performance. And depending on how you set selective options, you can get completely different results. Now do you see? When do you think you'll be able to match all these factors? Operator is an early user. That means he has one of the best mechs that can be implemented in High Gear."

Top Code Name added:

"His combat sense must be top-tier too. Being undefeated 1st in duel rankings means exactly that."

This wasn't a world where determination alone would suffice.

"But I can't give up. I will definitely win. How can I meet Operator?"

Reading the sincerity in Shirone's eyes, Destroyer God 707 let out a deep sigh.

"Fine, if you're really going to try..."

After discarding the empty magazine, he loaded a new one into his rifle and cocked it with a sharp sound.

"We'll have to hunt like crazy."

Administrator meeting room.

On 12 screens arranged around a round table, marks symbolizing each department appeared.

Since they too were mavericks of Under Coder, they never showed their real faces.

"A system-related suggestion has come in..."

It was a modulated voice.

"It's about something that happened in Iron Hometown. I'll play the recorded video first, so let's watch and then discuss."

The video was simultaneously output to all 12 screens.

"Eliminate blind spots! Don't aim at the target, do predictive shooting into the space!"

Shirone, recorded from Ten Man 10's perspective, was fighting desperately.

The administrators remained silent.

Even after Sancho was taken down with a headshot and the conversation at the Iron District boundary line ended.

"Alright."

The mark labeled Number Seven (NO.7) spoke first.

"It's not my specialty, but I thought Incarnation Arts were blocked. Did the firewall get breached?"

The mark labeled "妖" (Yao) said:

"No. There's no trace of infiltration, let alone attack. Same with meta processes."

"Then what's that? That's a person, right? But how does he dodge something exceeding Mach speed?"

The Smile mark said:

"Looking at the logs, it appears extreme time distortion occurred in a state of ultimate concentration. That is, neural transmission speed exceeded bullet speed..."

"So!"

Number Seven shouted.

"We blocked magic and schema and everything, so how is that possible! Is he a god or what?"

The black circle mark said:

"The fact that the user's code name is Yahweh 2 is also meaningful. Is this the Yahweh I know?"

The gear mark said:

"As tutorial administrator, I have no obligation to answer. However, on my honor as administrator, I guarantee he's not someone who would exploit system loopholes."

Number Seven said:

"What's with you being so serious, that's not like you. What's Yahweh? Is that a person's name? Is he handsome?"

"Don't you know how the world works? Stop eating Dream Stars and go outside for a walk."

"Are you picking a fight with me right now?"

The lollipop mark said:

"Hey, hey, stop it! Review results show it's not a system error. However, there's room for interpretation depending on judgment criteria. All users receive equal opportunities in High Gear - isn't that our design motto?"

The 妖 mark said:

"But we can't interfere with individual sensations. Even in identical situations, reactions vary completely depending on sensory differences. Denying Yahweh 2's senses would be denying the individuality of all existing users."

The Smile mark agreed:

"I think it's fine as long as it doesn't deviate from design intent. Actually, the Ten Men stationed in Iron Hometown can't really be considered in line with High Gear's motto either, right?"

"That's interesting though. That's what makes it interesting."

The Number Seven mark said:

"Anyway, since design intent was mentioned, what does our Lady think?"

While everyone remained silent, a signal came to the screen with the High Gear mark.

"Got something to say, Number Seven?"

It was Operator's voice.
