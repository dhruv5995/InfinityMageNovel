Iron Will (1)

Is one living life, or is life living itself?

Can humans truly change the future?

Shirone opened his eyes.

What remained in his severed consciousness was perhaps only the hallucination he had desperately hoped for.

'Am I alive?'

His senses gradually returned.

He thought he was in a very noisy and chaotic place, but even those sounds felt distant.

"Shirone."

The door opened and Nade entered.

"Na—"

Shirone's mouth moved wordlessly as he realized his voice was hoarse, and he frowned.

How much had he screamed?

"You're awake. You were unconscious for three days. Here, drink some water. Miro said we could only watch over you, but we've been too busy to take proper care of you. Sorry."

Nade talked a lot.

After taking a sip of the water he offered, Shirone's dry throat felt somewhat moistened.

"Nade."

Shirone asked with his still-painful throat.

"Where's Amy?"

There was no answer, and realizing this wasn't a dream, Shirone closed his eyes again.

"Shirone."

"No."

He didn't know what he was denying.

He just felt that if he didn't say that, the anger that had been temporarily subdued would explode again.

"Where are we?"

Shirone changed the subject.

"The Kingdom of Iron."

"Iron?"

It was an unexpected location.

"Previously, Nane—no, Ankera built altars to open the spirit realm. By giving orders to the Council of Ten. There are over 200 such places."

"...And?"

"There are shelters built underground as a precaution. Well, calling it a precaution might be understating it. Anyway, it's safe here. Don't be tense and rest."

He was relieved that there was no immediate fighting, but many questions remained.

"Who on earth? Who built a place like this?"

"Well—"

He entered through the open door.

"Are you feeling better?"

It was Fermi.

Shirone, lying down and making eye contact with him, couldn't hold back and asked first.

"Amy..."

"I knew."

Shirone caught his breath for a moment and spoke again.

"The memory..."

"I erased it."

This time too, Fermi cut him off.

"Of course, with your consent. The shock you would receive, your current state—you anticipated it all back then."

That would be so.

"Why?"

But one thing was certain: he would never sacrifice Amy under any circumstances.

"Why did I agree? What did you say to me that made me agree to the deal?"

After thinking, Fermi asked.

"Can you move?"

Shirone nodded, but Nade stopped him.

"Your mind and body are still weak. Getting excited already might make it worse."

"There's no time. You know that."

After a staring contest with Fermi, Nade sighed and helped Shirone up.

"Fine. I'll take him."

Shirone couldn't understand their conversation but didn't bother to argue now.

It was true that his stamina had declined.

As he left the room with support, Liz, who had come with Nade, was waiting.

"Ah..."

When she awkwardly bowed after making eye contact with Shirone, he also nodded briefly and passed by.

He sensed emotions that were difficult to deal with, and most people passing by felt the same way.

Passing through the corridor into the plaza, medical staff moved among the wounded.

In the chaotic scene, Shirone spotted Rian sitting in a corner.

As Nade guided him over, Rian, who had been talking with Tess, smiled bitterly.

"Hey."

Shirone's gaze turned to Rian's right arm.

"Oh, this?"

Something crude but mechanical with an iron frame structure was attached.

"It's quite useful. I don't know how she did it, but Alice took care of it. She's apparently a friend of Master Quan."

That wasn't what mattered.

Why Rian's right arm had ended up like this, why it couldn't be healed...

Knowing he would be curious, Tess spoke.

"Rian brought you here. If it hadn't been this bad, he wouldn't have managed it."

Though she couldn't completely hide her resentment.

"Rian thinks he's fortunate, being able to save you. So... it's okay."

Tess forced a bright expression and smiled.

"Ah."

Shirone wanted to say something, anything, but no words came to mind.

"Go on. You must have a lot you want to hear."

He felt sincerity in her gentle tone, but somehow felt like an outsider.

Leaving the plaza, another long corridor continued with rooms installed along every wall.

"Damn it! How long do I have to stay in this filthy place? You want me to eat food that doesn't even come with appetizers? Am I a dog? I'm the Interior Minister!"

Shirone paused and looked back.

Of course, in urgent situations, they wouldn't have been selective about who to save, but his associates would think differently.

"We're sorry! We're currently requesting from headquarters..."

"I am headquarters! Who here ranks higher than me!"

As Shirone watched with indifferent eyes, a sharp voice came from the end of the corridor.

"What's all this noise?"

It was headquarters.

'Ms. Sirano.'

International Tribunal Chief Judge Mito Sirano and Bebeto Socrates walked side by side.

She paused briefly upon spotting Shirone, but then ignored him and entered the room.

"Please be quiet. Don't you know there are wounded people here?"

"You! How can you treat me like this! Don't you know who I am? Shouldn't I at least get a bigger room!"

Sirano let out a hollow laugh.

"Crazy bastard."

"What, what?"

"You're greatly mistaken—you're no longer a minister. Because your country has disappeared. Forever."

"And you're no longer nobility either. Ninety-nine percent of humanity is dead. The people remaining here are the entire world. There are no more policies for you to make, no more documents for you to approve."

'Ninety-nine percent.'

Shirone felt dizzy.

'What have I done?'

It was too devastating a result to call it the price for losing his reason and charging at Buddha.

The Interior Minister shed tears.

"Still... it's so cold. Couldn't you give me just one more blanket? Please?"

Sirano sighed and turned away.

"Give him one more."

"Yes!"

As she headed to the plaza, leaving her aide's salute behind, Socrates asked.

"Weren't we not supposed to make exceptions?"

"Who cares? The world's ended, and whining about being cold means you don't deserve to live. Rather than crying all night, it's better for others if we appease him moderately."

"Hmm, so we need 'someone who knows how to fight'?"

"Yahweh has awakened, so we need to move too. The world leadership will be decided tonight. Rome, Garto, Temica. The rules remain the same."

"It seems easy but won't be. Even with just two people, one will try to dominate the other. Even if the world has ended, politicians won't give up their vested interests. It's instinct."

"It's fine."

Sirano didn't care.

"Now might makes right."

Arriving at the plaza, the thugs she mentioned—the heads of each nation's magic associations—were in meeting.

"Everyone."

Everyone showed courtesy at Sirano's appearance.

"Thank you for making the difficult journey. There's no time. To make use of our last chance, we must gather all remaining strength as one. For that, we need a representative."

Lufist stepped forward.

"We were just discussing that. We've already settled on Tormia."

By the standard of 'someone who knows how to fight,' it was a nation with strong cohesion.

"Good. Voting will proceed tonight. Everyone go back and persuade your national representatives."

Flu interjected.

"If I may dare to say, will it be alright? If there are rejections, things will get more complicated."

Sirano's solution was simple.

"Then kill them. Create a new king who will vote for Tormia and bring them."

Flu, convinced, shrugged his shoulders.

'Well...'

Having already sent Gis away, it was absurd to present counterarguments now.

Albino spoke.

"The voting results don't matter. What matters is the fact that we voted. For instance... giving the illusion that we're still civilized."

This was somewhat cynical.

"Mr. Albino, you're safe."

"Heh heh! I feel sorry. At an age where I could die tripping over a pebble, the world ends before I do."

"No, I'm serious. We're severely short on military personnel right now. Please continue providing good strategies."

"What am I... My son is here too."

Currently, Iruki was investigating the military situation of each nation as head of the Valkyries.

Then Socrates gestured toward the plaza with his chin.

"Hey, look over there."

Sirano looked disgusted.

"Ugh."

Gaold, with his hair disheveled like a vagrant, walked over lost in thought.

One of the association heads muttered.

"...Mikea Gaold."

He had attended meetings a few times during his days as association head, but was always treated as a madman.

Of course, it wasn't different now, but his achievements absolutely couldn't be disparaged.

"Move. That's my spot."

As the intimidated association heads cleared a path, Sirano stood her ground.

'Ugh, that lunatic.'

They had constantly clashed during his association head days.

'But his skills are solid.'

Given the current situation, she should set aside the past and maintain good relations.

Gaold stopped in front of Sirano, who blocked his path.

An awkwardly long time passed, and finally Gaold spoke.

"What?"

"...What?"

"Whaaaat?"

So much for good relations.

As the irritated Sirano stepped aside, Gaold passed by and headed toward the wall.

Lufist asked.

"What will you do?"

There was no answer.

"Decide clearly. We need to determine whether to include you in our forces or exclude you."

"Exclude."

After spitting that out briefly, he suddenly turned around.

"I'll just tell you this."

A flash of madness flickered in eyes that had reached the end of philosophy.

"When I fight, absolutely do not stand next to me."

The association heads who understood the true meaning of those words gulped, and Gaold slumped down in a corner.

Flu, who had once followed him, looked sad.

'I still respect him. But...'

He seemed too broken now for anyone to do anything for him.

Meanwhile, Shirone entered a spacious room, leaning on Nade for support.

The neat arrangement made with limited resources showed the importance of this room.

"Shirone."

Seriel stood up first, and Jinseong, who had been lying in bed, lifted his eyelids.

"...You came."

Shirone was shocked by his appearance, much more gaunt than when he had returned from hell.

Fermi explained.

"There are roughly 200 altars built in Iron. King Basak—or rather, Shu—built 147 shelters beneath them. We evacuated all of the last humans there. Using ether waves."

It was an enormous undertaking just to imagine.

"Currently, we can't go above ground. Everything burned, and buildings turned to dust. We had to gather the scattered commanders from each shelter into one place. Here, Jinseong made another effort. Simple coordination can be conveyed through Chong's communication magic, but..."

"Wait."

Shirone asked.

"You're going to fight again?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

The eyes of Seriel and Jinseong filled with pity.

"We're not the ones fighting."

"Then?"

"You."

Shirone.

"This is a fight solely for you."

For Yahweh, who had given everything for the world, this was the only thing Fermi could do for him.
