[729] Body (2)

Labyrinth Andre

World No. 19,000.

The final world of Andre that Guffin had sealed was a place that defied Sirone's common sense.

"Uuuuuuu."

Countless naked humans were tangled together, making grotesque moaning sounds.

'Damn it! Where the hell is this place?'

He had been pushing through the mass of people for six days now, but it was filled with nothing but human, human, human bodies.

He was on the verge of losing his mind.

"Uaaaang! Uaaaang!"

There were men and women, children and elderly, even newborn babies, but there was nothing to learn in this world.

'They're not human.'

Indeed, the humans in this place had no thoughts.

'If they could think, they would have gone insane.'

They just writhed around like creatures with paralyzed brains, living by repeating only feeding and reproduction.

'I need to find an exit.'

The most serious problem was that even after crawling between people for days, there were only steel walls everywhere.

'That can't be right. Living things can survive because nutrients are supplied from somewhere.'

When cold water dripped on his head, Sirone cast Shining magic to illuminate his surroundings.

'This again?'

This was presumably the only sustenance for the people in this world, and when tasted, it was far more nutritious than water.

Sirone, who had been watching people receive the liquid, flipped his body and headed toward where the ceiling was.

'The liquid supply lasts about a minute. I need to escape during that time.'

It was probably the only way.

"Keuueu!"

Sirone, who found a gap where limbs were tangled and pushed his head in first, climbed up while pushing through the swamp of bodies.

'Quickly! Quickly!'

Finally, light came through the gap of the iron door in the ceiling.

"Whoa!"

As he tasted fresh air for the first time in days and his focus wavered, the iron door began to close again.

Sirone threw his body and rolled on the floor, then confirmed the identity of the place where he had been staying.

"That's..."

It was a steel structure connected underground like a waterway, and an old engraved sign remained faintly visible.

Human Storage. Building D, Unit 274

"Human storage?"

Above the steel structures protruding every 100 meters, spherical objects flew around spraying water.

"Drones?"

It was an object he had never seen before, but strangely familiar.

'Have I been here before?'

No ground creatures were visible, and the sky was covered with electric clouds.

It's been a while, Sirone.

One drone flew over and opened its lens in front of Sirone.

"How do you know me?"

Because we've met. It's been about 600,000 years.

The drone's surface was heavily rusted, and the voice leaking from its broken lens was mixed with noise, making it eerie.

As if reading Sirone's emotions, the drone pulled out a thin hose and made gestures as if cleaning itself.

Don't worry. Repairs are still possible. I've realized the concept of sloth. It's efficient.

Sirone pointed at the human storage.

"Did you trap people in there?"

I'm managing them efficiently. I maintain the specimens in a way that minimizes waste of power. I only have 100 million years of power left.

The drone looked up at the electric clouds and said.

I like that sky. From a human perspective, you probably don't find it appealing, but it doesn't matter. No one tries to come out of the containers anymore.

"Are there no normal people?"

Everyone is normal.

The drone's hose pointed at Sirone.

If you mean people like you, well, I can't calculate that either. The Utopia Project was perfect. They still enjoy immortality.

The drone shook its body and malfunctioned.

There's no one in Utopia. They're enjoying immortality. But why is no one there? Kalpa? Infinity?

Utopia's administrator Argo, trying to compute the contradiction between kalpa and infinity, went insane.

The population kept decreasing.

For people endlessly diving into virtual worlds, leaving behind descendants wasn't an important matter.

The project was perfect. Death cannot exist. Why is it decreasing? Must prevent species extinction.

The drone hurriedly turned to Sirone.

They just need to not think. They need to not realize they're alive. I'm working hard.

Sirone took in the ruined gray landscape.

'This is the last world...'

The end of consciousness.

There would be no one left in this place who knew that the universe existed.

'And this is...'

The final point that the concept of kalpa could reach.

Go.

The drone said.

Do the same thing as last time. I will no longer perform new calculations. Sloth is efficient.

Argo would not seek a better solution.

"The same thing as last time..."

He had an idea of what it was.

'Liberation.'

Sirone's eyes filled with sorrow as he thought of the people in the human storage.

As Sirone slowly closed his eyes and spread his arms wide, Argo bid farewell.

The Utopia Project is perfect.

"Hah! Hah!"

Lian, leaning against a building, desperately lifted his wobbling, buckling knees.

'I can't fall asleep.'

He hadn't slept a wink for six days.

Smille. Smille.

The fact that he was hearing hallucinations of Smille even though he was just breathing meant his physical condition had already reached death.

A building collapsed with a thunderous roar, and Parnie approached, naked and dragging her sword.

'How is she enduring this?'

Lian's eyes were indifferent as he examined her female body.

As Zuo'i's theory went, when the mind is unified, things like panties become invisible.

"Krrrrrr."

A rough moaning sound leaked from Parnie's mouth.

'She's not normal.'

Taking this as his only consolation, Lian bounced off the wall just as Parnie charged.

'My legs won't move.'

Lian, who shot out at frightening speed, struck her sword head-on.

'My arms won't move.'

The Straight Sword descended like lightning toward Parnie's crown.

"Iyaaaaa!"

Before the illusion of the world splitting in two, Parnie rolled her eyes back and slipped behind Lian.

"Kkeuk!"

Without even jumping, she flipped her body upside down and brought Lian down by hooking his neck with her knee.

'Suffocation!'

This was the strategy Parnie had found after six days of battle.

"Keuueu!"

Parnie, who had buried Lian's face between her legs and was choking him, curled up like a cat.

"Krrr! Krrrrr!"

Then she raised her elbow and began frantically striking Lian's crown.

Hearing the sound of his skull cracking, Lian felt his consciousness drifting far away.

'No! If I lose consciousness, it's over.'

If he couldn't breathe for a long time in a comatose state, he might never wake up.

'I need to break free now!'

As Lian got up and charged forward with his head, numerous obstacles struck Parnie.

"Krrrrr...!"

Even so, Parnie locked her legs like a clasp and continued striking Lian's crown.

Finally, Lian's consciousness was severed.

Smille.

For the first time, the hallucinated voice was heard clearly.

'What?'

What Lian was looking at, with his brain crushed, was an ancient man with long black hair.

"Brother?"

His appearance was reminiscent of Ogent Lye, but with even colder eyes.

"Who are you? Where is this?"

"Body."

As the man reached behind his back, a Straight Sword identical to Lian's appeared and descended in an arc.

'That's... an Idea?'

He wondered how the man could possess an object that was unique in the world.

'No, where did he even appear from?'

"Mind."

The man who spoke thus approached with large steps and swung the Straight Sword before Lian's eyes.

"The body wields the mind."

A vertical flash penetrated Lian's brow, then expanded left and right as the world opened.

The moment Lian's eyes snapped open, Parnie's monstrous senses warned of danger.

'What?'

She immediately distanced herself as the Straight Sword was drawn diagonally and Lian bolted upright.

"Heok! Heok!"

As Lian's shattered brain regenerated, his consciousness returned as if connecting film strips.

'She's been cut.'

Parnie's right eyelid was torn diagonally as blood spurted out.

'How?'

Before Lian had even swung his sword, Parnie was already certain of the danger.

But as if time had slowed down, even seeing the sword flying toward her, her body wouldn't move.

"It's not the sword."

Lian, recalling what had happened in his comatose state, muttered with enlightened eyes.

"What the body wields is the mind."

Understand?

The true meaning contained in the one sword that Quan had shown in Radum flooded in entirely, causing a thrill.

"Heart Sword?"

As Parnie, who had been in a beast's posture, stood up, a V-shaped incarnation was explosively born.

"You came... to the very end."

Parnie's form evaporated and disappeared, and Lian's mind moved faster than perception.

'I cut!'

His heart cut Parnie first.

'Death.'

Lian's arm hadn't even moved yet, but that was merely a moment of time stretched to its limit.

Seeing Lian's sword starting late, she tried to twist her upper body as much as possible, but couldn't move even a millimeter.

'How fast is it?'

Probably the speed of thought.

A flash containing countless changes split the world as Lian's arms burst with a thud.

"Keuuuuuk!"

The Straight Sword clattered to the ground, and Lian, whose arms had disappeared from the shoulders, grimaced.

"Is that your unique sword?"

The moment he raised his head, a line was drawn from Parnie's solar plexus to her navel, and blood gushed out.

Even as her 11,200 years of life was ending, her eyes waiting for death were calm.

"Polish it well. It's a good technique."

"...Do you have any last words?"

Though they had met as enemies and fought with their lives on the line, he thought he could at least listen to her dying words.

Parnie's mouth, gazing at the sky, opened softly.

"I think I had a son..."

It was a story from very long ago.

"Really? What happened to him?"

"What happened..."

Parnie's eyes slowly closed.

"He died."

Lian prayed for Parnie's soul.

'Living, then facing death.'

Even the long life of an immortal, when looking back upon reaching the finish line, was this simple, wasn't it?

"Sirone."

Since the battle wasn't over yet, Lian picked up the Straight Sword as soon as his arms regenerated.

"Please don't let me be too late."

As he ran toward Andre's entrance with his exhausted body, he saw Kido with his face buried in the dirt.

"Kido!"

Lian hurriedly turned Kido's body over, brushed the dust from his face, and patted his cheeks.

"Snap out of it! Kido!"

"Uh..."

His trembling eyelids opened softly as Kido's pupils moved left and right.

"Lian?"

Kido, who had regained consciousness, quickly sat up.

"What about Sirone? What happened?"

"I don't know. My battle just ended too. What about the Maga Bandits?"

Before Kido could answer, Lian confirmed the corpse of the sub-leader fallen at the entrance and nodded.

"Stay here. I'll go look for Sirone."

"What are you talking about? Of course I have to go too."

Just as he stood up gripping the broken spear with both hands, a scream was heard from inside Andre.

"What? The Maga Bandits were annihilated..."

Before Kido could finish speaking, Lian kicked off the ground and rushed into the labyrinth.
