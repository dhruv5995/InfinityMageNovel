Full Armament (2)

The end of probability.

When rolling dice infinitely, what exists beyond those numbers is...

'Now!'

It was a firm, clear conviction like the entire world converging into a single point.

'Michelan Gun!'

The sphere of light stretched into a flash and shot straight into Maginus's gaping mouth.

"Kaaaaah...!"

Just when the time until the next change felt like an eternity, Maginus suddenly convulsed violently.

It was 10 meters in front of Yahweh2.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Chain explosions occurred inside as the machine began writhing unrealistically.

While the Mafia party watched in disgust, Maginus suddenly changed direction.

"Follow it! This is the final pattern!"

Creating ice tunnels as it dove underwater, Maginus finally disintegrated.

Cold air sprayed in all directions, creating a massive ice cavern where an item dropped.

"Hii-eek!"

The Mafia party that arrived at the cavern felt their hair stand on end after checking the augmented reality.

Unidentified Item Drop: Legendary Grade.

"It, it appeared again!"

The legendary item obtainable from hunting Maginus was undoubtedly Donatello.

Knowing the priority system, Shirone turned away instead of taking the box.

"Well, shall we do cards again this time?"

The Mafia party had a gut feeling.

'This isn't coincidence.'

Though they couldn't even guess the method, Yahweh2 could clearly control probability.

This meant if he put his mind to it, he could pull legendary grade items indefinitely.

'Since they can't be traded once equipped, price fluctuations would be minimal too. He could sweep up the galaxy.'

Having finished his thoughts, Mafia spoke.

"The priority system is meaningless anyway. You take it. But we need to change the conditions."

Since trading would be impossible once the event ended, this was their last chance.

"Change the conditions?"

"You don't need to give us a settlement. Instead, let's go one more round. You can pull legendary grade items, right?"

"We could each get one too, couldn't we? Since we've been together this whole time, wouldn't that be fair?"

"Sorry. That won't work."

Sona asked.

"Wh, why? It's super easy for you! It's actually easier than giving us the galaxy."

"I'm an outsider. I don't want to break this world's balance. I'll return once the Solar War ends."

Dexsensibility snapped back.

"That's ridiculous. We're doing this because of that Solar War. Do you know how much the charging fees differ?"

The Western Nation wouldn't lose this Solar War, but there was no need to reveal that in advance.

"I'll provide sufficient compensation. That would be more helpful for you all too. It becomes problematic if we get too deeply entangled."

Too many factions were already involved in the confrontation between Shirone and the Operators.

'Tch! So it's because of the Eastern Nation after all?'

The pretense of worrying about the Solar War was obvious, but it was better to endure until the settlement was complete.

"Fine. Then contact Golden Wheel Ring as soon as we get out of here. Tell them to settle immediately."

"I don't have long-distance communication options. How about we go to neutral territory first and make contact there?"

"Are you kidding me! How can you say that now?"

Was there really a need to mention it?

"No, you all know my level. So I naturally thought you were assuming that."

"Ugh..."

If they didn't know, that was damaging to their pride too.

Sona suggested.

"Then we'll make the contact. Meeting in neutral territory is too risky. If a major guild like Golden Wheel Ring makes a move, we'd be helplessly caught. That's too disadvantageous."

"Got it. Then let's go out and try contacting them. You can reach out to Olga's Son or Aegis."

Of course they knew the rankers' code names.

When the Mafia party designated Yahweh2 as priority, Shirone acquired the box.

Everyone gathered around.

"Let's see."

The box opened, and a smooth ceramic bottle was placed in Yahweh2's hands.

"Ooh! This is exactly..."

The event has ended.

The sound of waves could be heard.

The starting point wasn't the freshwater lake but a beautiful white sand beach on the outskirts of Moon Island.

Shirone breathed a sigh of relief.

"Phew, finally over."

Regardless of difficulty, the journey of hunting in the Western Nation itself had been burdensome.

Sona approached.

"Congratulations. Are you going to equip it right away this time too?"

Shirone looked at the bottle in his hand.

"Yeah, I should."

Unlike other users, equipping it first gave him peace of mind.

"Equip."

The ceramic shook on its own and shattered, with liquid metal as clear as mercury swirling in the air.

"Whoa..."

Just as everyone was admiring it, the liquid metal rushed toward Yahweh2's mouth with fierce momentum.

It was an irresistible system, and his entire body became cold as if entering ice water.

Of course, it wasn't an unpleasant feeling.

Installing new program.

A message appeared in augmented reality, and the existing scenery felt completely different.

"Huh? This?"

It was a familiar sensation to Shirone.

'It's Spirit Zone.'

There were no blind spots in his vision, as if all the surrounding light was bending inward.

Sona asked.

"Are you okay? I couldn't tell much from videos. But it was incredibly dizzying at first."

'That makes sense.'

The brain, not the eyes, needed to adapt.

'Recorded videos just output what the eyes see. It would probably be fragmented scenery overlapping in multiple layers. If such images kept moving in real-time, I'd get motion sickness too but...'

In Shirone's brain, it was organized and displayed as a perfect spherical landscape.

Of course, this was also far from what would normally be called "seeing."

Sona asked.

"Can you move? In the videos, they staggered like they were drunk and collapsed. Even someone over level 300."

Dexsensibility added.

"I saw that too. That's why Donatello's price dropped temporarily. Originally legendary items have vastly different efficiency depending on skill, but this was pretty extreme."

Shirone understood.

It was like giving Spirit Zone to an ordinary person whose concentration couldn't keep up.

"But there are people who handle it skillfully, right?"

Sona said.

"Anyway, the released quantity is countable on fingers. The representative user in the Western Nation would be Demon. I saw him dodging bullets in the Solar War, and he was truly amazing."

'Demon.'

A member of Ascension.

'A real-world mage perhaps? Well, someone with high concentration could adapt.'

Mafia sneered.

"You've just been standing still this whole time? Don't tell me you're dizzy? That's why you shouldn't equip things carelessly."

"Hmm."

When Shirone took a big step forward, the Mafia party who had been secretly mocking him were startled.

"Let me try..."

Kicking off the ground into a sprint, the machine raced across the white sand at high speed.

An incredible amount of visual information.

But for Shirone, who could handle not just Spirit Zone but even Elysion, it wasn't a hindrance.

'This is fine? With this, I should be able to offset some of the output difference with the Operators.'

At minimum, he wouldn't lose his blind spots.

Turning around again, Shirone tested precise movements beyond just running.

As circus-like dazzling movements unfolded, the Mafia party was momentarily mesmerized.

"What? He's running incredibly well? Is this really the same scenery we saw in the videos?"

"Probably. Demon does it like this too."

Amid the continuing silence, Shirone braked urgently and stopped in front of the party.

"Phew, test complete. This is really good."

It was somewhat irritating.

"Well, I don't know about you, but Donatello is a difficult part to handle. The reason people go crazy trying to get it despite that is because it has a special function."

"Special function?"

"It can detect stealth states."

"Ah..."

"Of course, you can't see them clearly. They say it feels like the form shimmers."

Even stealth couldn't be perfect in front of light-refracting devices.

"But even that is tremendous. You don't need low-frequency detection options. You save a slot."

"How do they look when using that option?"

"You can't see them. Only coordinates are displayed as dots. That's why stealth option users are tricky to deal with."

"Then wouldn't everyone use stealth?"

"Specific selective options are limited to predetermined parts. To use stealth options, you need parts suited for that option, but combat performance drops extremely. At high levels, getting caught once means immediate death."

"Kill or be killed. A binary choice."

"Exactly. That's why Donatello is incredible. Not only does it save slots, but it actually detects forms. Now, explanation's over. Should we contact them as promised?"

When Shirone nodded, Mafia attempted communication with Olga's Son.

"Will he answer?"

Rankers generally blocked communication except from specific users.

While the party waited anxiously, Mafia's expression gradually darkened.

Then suddenly his eyes widened.

"Huh? He answered."

The party gathered around.

"He answered? Really?"

Extending his hand to keep them from getting too close, Mafia bent his waist awkwardly and spoke.

"Hello? Hello?"

"Speak."

"I, I'm a Western Nation user, Mafia..."

"I know. Saw the news. The Donatello?"

The dismissive tone was unpleasant, but the other party was a ranker and, more importantly, from an enemy nation.

"We just acquired it. We want to receive settlement. Yahweh2 promised. The settlement amount is..."

"Confirmation first."

Mafia relayed Fermi's words exactly.

"Hey, Yahweh2, they want to confirm first. They'll take a video and send it, so put your eye close."

Shirone brought his right eye close.

"Zoom in. Zoom in."

When his pupil filled the screen, letters were inscribed in a circle along the iris.

"Authentication complete. Next, they want to see if you're really safe, so strike a victory pose..."

"That's enough, just send it quickly."

While Shirone wouldn't fall for Fermi's prank, Mafia couldn't get his bearings.

"Hey, just send it now! Sending it now."

The recorded video was transmitted, and after about 30 seconds, Fermi's voice was heard.

"Seven people. Settled."

The communication ended.

Standing dumbfounded for a moment, Mafia shouted as if the communication were still connected.

"Hey! We haven't even adjusted the price yet! If you're going to be this unreasonable, we'll also...!"

"Ma, Mafia."

While his companions stared into space as if entranced, a message appeared in Mafia's augmented reality.

Galaxy has been deposited.

Following the link, an unprecedented amount was blinking in his personal vault.

"Huh? Huh?"

As he followed the zeros upward and trembled, Sona raised both arms and shouted.

"Yahoo! We did it! We really did it!"

Even while his companions high-fived and celebrated, Mafia couldn't believe it.

'Crazy bastards.'

Faced with an amount that ignored market value concepts, he couldn't even feel greedy for more.

Sona shook Mafia.

"Hey, hey! Let's go to the shop! I want to buy so much stuff! I'm going to buy out all the limited editions."

Watching them celebrate, Shirone smiled but felt somewhat bitter.

'Fermi.'

It probably wasn't bluffing.

Based on perfect understanding of humans, the exact amount to handle things most cleanly.

There were many strong people in the world, but including both allies and enemies, he was among the top 10 he didn't want to fight.

'I don't know what he's thinking. If he becomes an enemy, I'll eventually have to defeat him.'

Suddenly this thought occurred to him.

'Why did Fermi...'

Choose "Olga's Son" as his code name?
