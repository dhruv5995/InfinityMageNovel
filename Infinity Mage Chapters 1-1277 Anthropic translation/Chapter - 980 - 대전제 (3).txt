**The Great Premise (3)**

While riding in the carriage to Alogue Street, Sirone kept his gaze fixed on the scenery outside the window.

Lufist stared at Sirone intently, while Flu, sitting beside him, swallowed nervously.

'This is no easy task either.'

Though they were comrades who had fought together, from now on he had to speak as a representative of Tormia.

Lufist spoke.

"The Holy War will be reorganized soon."

"...I see."

Sirone didn't turn his head.

"It means the power structure of the Three Kingdoms will change. Tormia will monopolize the elemental bomb technology. Of course, this is already agreed upon with the Holy War's General Commander."

'Iruki...'

Originally, it was a contract to hand over the elemental bomb secrets in exchange for providing the flower garden.

"But your protection of Bashka has made the situation subtly complicated. Anyway, if you don't agree, the General Commander won't fulfill the contract either."

That was the problem.

Flu waited demurely with her hands folded until Sirone's answer came.

'I can't exactly beg her to do it.'

Though they were close like siblings, personal feelings didn't matter when it came to humanity's safety and their homeland's future.

Sirone opened his mouth.

"The elemental bomb technology should be possible. Kashan, Jincheon, and Gustav won't be able to exert as much power as before. Are you thinking of pushing out one of them?"

"No."

Lufist leaned forward.

"That's only when the balance of power was tight. I'm thinking of elevating Tormia to the position of the number one nation."

It might be called ambition, but from Tormia's standpoint, they wouldn't want to miss such an opportunity.

"Of course, only if the Ivory Tower recognizes it."

With approval from the Five Stars of the Integrated Space Management Department, other planets would have no choice but to feel the weight.

"I'll entrust you with the elemental bomb. If Iruki decided that way, I have no intention of opposing it."

Though it seemed like easy consent, Flu realized that Sirone had quickly drawn a line.

'She means she won't lend any more power to the kingdom beyond that. Well, even this much is an achievement, but...'

The disappointment was unavoidable.

Above all, the fairy and dragon tribes that Sirone had as subordinates were once military forces positioned as the Holy War's Second Army.

"Sister."

When Flu, awakened from her thoughts, looked up, Sirone was smiling.

"I'm sorry."

Flu also smiled and shook her head.

"No, I'm the one who's sorry."

When you become obsessed with one thing, you sometimes forget what's truly important.

Sirone was Sirone.

She had been a good younger sister who had never disappointed since they first met at the Magic Association.

"Come to think of it, you've grown a lot. It feels like yesterday when you were struggling because you couldn't even do Force."

"Haha! You were pretty strict yourself, sister. Now you're the Chief Secretary though."

Memories flowed back and forth endlessly.

"Hmm."

Though it wasn't a satisfactory result, Lufist closed his eyes without making any further demands.

"Oh, right! The Five Great Families assembly day?"

"Yes, do you remember? That's why we were passing by and you secretly gave us a high five..."

What was truly important was already in their possession.

The crossroads extending in four directions—north, south, east, and west—around Alogue Square were packed with crowds.

"Long live Tormia! Long live Tormia!"

Though it was unusual for a king to change in a single day, surprisingly, the citizens weren't greatly flustered.

Perhaps it was because the rapid pursuit of change amidst the complex gaps in world politics gave them a sense of stability.

Most of the procedures were finished, and only the final task remained: Adolf XIII handing over the crown.

As Pony knelt and bowed her head, Adolf XIII approached, removing his crown.

'I am, I am...'

Though he thought he had already resigned himself, something hot surged up again from deep within his heart.

'Why me?'

The decades he had to wait to become king flashed through his mind like a revolving lantern.

He had finally become king, and now he had to hand everything over to Pony, the lowest in the direct line of succession, after just one day.

"Your Majesty?"

The crown hovered above Pony's head for a long time, trembling slightly.

"Your Majesty."

There was killing intent in the administrator's second words.

The longer he delayed, the greater people's suspicions would grow, and that wasn't the picture Lufist wanted.

Adolf XIII relaxed the strength in both hands, and the crown grazed past Pony's face and fell to the ground.

The clear sound, amplified by the silence, echoed all the way to the end of Alogue Street.

"Nonsense..."

Adolf XIII gritted his teeth tightly.

"Don't spout nonsense!"

As the citizens gathered in the square looked on in surprise, he shouted, having lost his reason.

"This is a fraud! I am the most noble royalty! Why should I be manipulated by such people?"

The atmosphere was stirring even among Sirone's group watching from below the platform.

Nade said, "He's going to get himself killed at this rate."

Iruki said, "This is what they call the king's rage, I suppose. He seems to have held out in his own way, but this is ultimately his limit."

Adolf XIII pointed accusingly at Sirone's team.

"Don't be fooled, citizens! These are the ones who dropped bombs over Bashka! You're being toyed with!"

Lufist, who had been watching the situation from behind the platform, nodded to Flu.

"Handle it."

It was the promised sequence, and Flu gripped the Phoenix Tablet while filling her eyes with killing intent.

"This crown is mine! A human born to be king, that's exactly what I, Adolf... Aaaaah!"

Adolf XIII, who had been trying to put the crown that fell to the ground on his head, suddenly let out a scream.

Flu, who had been about to spring into action, stopped her movement, and Sirone's eyes changed to a puzzled look.

'What's this?'

At first he thought it was an ambush, but there shouldn't be any magic that could fool his eyes.

"It hurts! Aaaah! My head, my head...!"

Forgetting his dignity as king, Adolf XIII rolled around clutching his head, then this time grabbed his chest.

"A blade, a blade! It feels like a blade is coming in!"

With the feeling of watching a play rather than something happening in reality, people were left speechless.

And the next moment.

"Aaaaah!"

Along with someone's ear-piercing scream, everyone began collapsing and rolling on the ground.

"Ah, it hurts! My whole body hurts!"

The moment they instinctively felt something was wrong, the same pain came to Sirone's group.

"Ugh!"

Sirone finally realized.

The moment he inhaled, his throat felt like it was tearing apart and his lungs felt like they were on fire.

'It's not magic. It's something more fundamental...'

A kind of system.

Looking around, not only his friends but also Miro, Sein, and even Gashan were suffering.

Among everyone in the square rolling on the ground, there was one person who caught his eye still standing.

'Mr. Gaold.'

Only Gaold seemed not to feel pain, wearing a serious expression.

Along with the roaring sound of a jet, Minerva landed in front of Sirone.

Her face, supporting Taeseong, was also slightly contorted in pain.

"You've awakened."

As Sirone approached, Taeseong broke free from Minerva's support and walked forward.

"Sirone, it's a demon realm. Paimon's demon realm has opened."

"Paimon?"

Hadn't he been dissolved and destroyed by Agape's light?

"He recovered by a hair's breadth. It's my oversight. If only I hadn't lost consciousness..."

Sirone shook his head.

"It's not your fault, Taeseong. Even if you had been conscious, it would have been difficult to detect."

It was the same dilemma as the angel's 'looking down.'

"Please gather everyone, Rian and all our companions. I'll tell you how to remove the demon realm."

Though that's what should be done, currently all of Sirone's companions were writhing in pain.

"What kind of demon realm is this?"

"Paimon's demon realm is a hospital. It's a type of disease that doesn't exist on this planet. The disease name is emotional sickness. It's a terrible disease where pain perception is controlled according to the scale of emotions."

"The scale of emotions?"

Taeseong looked around at the people and said, "The human body undergoes special actions according to the mind. Heartbeat, brain waves, hormones—everything changes. Emotional sickness lurks in the pituitary gland and then activates when the body reaches a specific state. Simply put, pain perception skyrockets when you love something, and it stabilizes when that object is removed."

The moment she finished speaking, Sirone's contorted face returned to a calm state.

"...I see."

"How did you do it, Sirone?"

"I killed it."

Sirone looked around at his friends and said, "A bit of air."

"But this is probably only possible for me. Because I can love even trivial air with equal weight."

It was the realm of absolute universal love.

Even the act of breathing and eliminating air carried the same weight as killing a person for Sirone.

"Someone on life support with an oxygen concentrator might be able to use the same method as me. But even that, if it's not universal love..."

"So we can't keep breathing. We have to cut out the air itself from our hearts."

"Right. It'll be difficult, but for now, kill something. Something you hold dear."

The moment he spoke those words, Sirone felt chills.

'That's it.'

It was truly a terrible disease.

Meanwhile, getting hints from Sirone's words, his friends began devising their own methods.

"Done."

The first person to solve it was Iruki.

"What did you kill?"

"The Holy War's General Commander."

It was a kind of mental murder.

"Ah."

The things humans consider precious in life would be quite numerous if you look back.

Choosing the Holy War's General Commander among them was typical of Iruki, but...

'Even if it weren't Iruki.'

What else could they possibly kill?

Having the same thought, determination entered Nade and Amy's eyes as well.

"Phew, I'm done too."

What the two of them abandoned were respectively the position of Nade Group's president and the Valkyrie First Corps commander.

As they escaped from pain one by one, Adolf XIII cried out with tears flowing.

"Aaaaah! Save me! It hurts! It hurts!"

Though he wasn't thrashing about, the pain Pony felt wasn't much different from his.

'I can't give up being king. I can't abandon it.'

Though she had heard the method to alleviate emotional sickness, her circumstances were different from Sirone's friends.

'If I give up being king, Sirone will lose one means of leading the nation.'

Then what exactly should she kill?

"Your Majesty! Please lay down the authority of kingship! Then the pain will disappear!"

Most of the administrators used Iruki's method.

Honestly, it was easy.

If you had to keep swallowing glass shards instead of air, anyone could give up things like careers.

However, the weight of kingship seemed a bit different.

"Fine, I give up! I'm not a king anymore! I'll give up! So please..."

Adolf XIII's eyes widened, then he grabbed his throat with his hands.

"Gaaaah! It hurts! It hurts even more!"

"Just shouting with words won't work! You must truly, truly give it up!"

"Aaaaah!"

Watching that miserable scene, Sirone's group realized another terror of emotional sickness.

'You have to cut it out completely.'

That meant as emotional sickness progressed, personalities would inevitably change.

What would remain at the end?

"Hnnngh!"

Miro, down on one knee, gritted her teeth and endured.

'I won't give up anything.'

She had already cast aside everything except the ultimate good, so there was nothing left to abandon.

'The pain level keeps rising.'

Every time her heart beat, her chest felt like it would tear, and her lungs were so hot that she was afraid to even take the next breath.

"Miss Miro, give up at least one thing!"

Gashan's voice faded distantly, and cold sweat formed droplets that fell drip by drip.

'This isn't just a pain level. Being alive itself is hell...'

Miro finally came to realize.

'This is just like...'

The face of one man flashed through her mind.

"Is it very difficult?"

Looking at the shadow cast on the ground, Miro struggled to lift her head and look up.

The only human not suffering from emotional sickness.

No, someone who was already living in more terrible pain than anyone else, so it didn't even register.

"You..."

Gaold was looking at Miro with pitying eyes.
