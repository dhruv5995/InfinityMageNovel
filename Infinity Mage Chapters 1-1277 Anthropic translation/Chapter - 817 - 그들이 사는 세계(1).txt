The World They Live In (1)

"The usage is simple. When you press the button, the iron core generates heat. This heat vaporizes the blood."

Zenia, holding the Blood Cue, pressed the button with her thumb, and a tube rose from the tip.

"You inhale this."

She put the tube in her mouth and inhaled. Several strands of her silver hair stood up, and her eyes became intensely focused.

"So you're consuming blood."

No matter how you change the form, the truth doesn't change.

"That's right. I'm also half vampire."

Smoke mixed with the cool scent of menthol poured from her mouth.

Grain said:

"Drinking blood is rather disgusting, so it was designed to be inhaled as vapor. It also has the advantage of being fast-acting. It seeps directly through the capillaries."

"Where do you get the blood?"

"From humans. Through illegal methods."

He didn't use the word "criminal."

"I won't make excuses like 'we had no choice.' But when Zenia inhales the Blood Cue, her sensitivity is enhanced over 100 times. She can track all vampires within a 2-kilometer radius."

When Zenia inhaled the Blood Cue again, her hair stood up even more, and several strands trembled.

"Seven vampires 700 meters to the northwest. Three at 900 meters to the south. There are some to the east too."

Pourer ground his teeth.

"What a breeding ground for bats."

"Their numbers have been increasing lately. We've already confirmed four Almas. Do you know what this means?"

Rian answered:

"A Lord."

"Right. One of the three Lords, the rulers of vampires, is here in Rodenin. In other words, the chance has come to end this damn war."

To completely exterminate the vampires who multiply through injection, the root must be eliminated.

Grain said:

"Fight with us. I can't really call it compensation, but we'll actively cooperate in uncovering your secret."

"Don't worry. I've already sworn to take responsibility for the deaths I've caused."

The Knight of Maha was someone who appeared on the candidate list for Grand Swordmaster among enthusiasts.

The expressions of the Genocide party brightened at gaining such a powerful ally, but Zenia was the exception.

"I need to talk to you."

When Zenia went up to the first floor, Grain said:

"She seems to have something to say as the team's leader. Just remember this - she's not a vampire."

He added:

"And she's not human either."

Zenia is a Silver Born.

"I know."

The Blood Cue, which vaporizes and inhales disgusting blood, was surely a tool that showed her true identity.

Leaving his companions in the medical room, Rian followed Zenia up to the cabin.

The door was open, and she was looking up at the moon while holding her sword mixed with Obscura B.

"What did you want to say?"

Zenia turned around.

"What's your reason for fighting demons? Hatred? Revenge? Or is there some other reason?"

It was an appropriate question from a half-demon.

"To protect the person I love."

Zenia fell into thought.

"What about you? Why do you fight vampires? If you're going to hate someone, shouldn't it be humans?"

Humans are the most exclusive species.

"That's not wrong. Both my parents were half-demons. I'm not ignorant of human hostility, but..."

Zenia smiled mockingly.

"Are humans even worth hating?"

"As you know, even though we're half-demons, humans are no match for us. They're just prey. What killed my parents wasn't humans - it was vampires."

The moonlight was cold.

"I lived an ordinary life. Sucking human blood with mom and dad, sometimes looking at the moon..."

Zenia asked:

"Does it sound strange when I say ordinary?"

"No. Humans are the same anyway."

They live ordinary lives while devouring countless species.

"But they brought us tragedy."

"Purebloods?"

"They call us mongrels. They don't know love. They can't even reproduce. They're viruses."

Her sword, Dark Blade, trembled with a whoosh.

"To purebloods, if humans are food, then mongrels are bugs not even worth eating. Eventually my parents were captured..."

Zenia grabbed both sides of her collar and tore them apart, revealing a lightning-shaped scar carved into her solar plexus.

"I was subjected to all kinds of experiments too. Even when I inhale the Blood Cue, this scar doesn't disappear. It's not my skin tissue. They kneaded my insides as they pleased. Do you know how that feels?"

Because it was Rian, he seemed to understand.

"All the Genocide members lost someone precious to vampires. Pourer lost his wife, Grain his daughter..."

Zenia looked back at Rian.

"What did you lose? You say you fight to protect someone precious? Then you're taking this business too lightly. You're also a special case. If you fall into their hands, you'll suffer the same fate as me. You won't be able to endure it."

What Zenia couldn't trust wasn't Rian, but all selfish humans.

"If you can comfort yourself no matter how hard things get, then you're not ready to fight. To me, every maxim in the world, every poem, is just disgusting."

This was the world of vampire hunters.

"I wanted to become strong."

Rian spoke for the first time.

"There's someone I truly want to protect. But that person is much stronger than me."

Is Sirone still fighting the world right now?

"I think about how to become strong. But when such questions arise, then I wonder what strength really is. There are many answers, but none of them resonate."

Zenia listened silently.

"So I decided to just walk. With each step I took, I felt like I was getting one step closer, so I just kept walking."

That's how he slayed 10,000 demons.

"Continuously from the northern edge of the land toward home... and then I arrived here. Am I stronger now? Can I protect my precious person?"

It was an unbelievably simple and crude method for someone considered a candidate for Grand Swordmaster.

"I don't know yet. But even now, I'm walking straight. Maybe I'll know when I reach home."

"What if you still don't know what strength is then?"

"I'll walk again."

He spoke of something so vast far too easily.

"Strength, you know - you're also a swordsman - whether you develop some sword technique, increase your muscle strength, or even read books or refer to famous swordsmen's sayings..."

This was the only truth he had realized while crossing the desert.

"It's probably not that complicated. Feeling it's complicated is because we don't understand it. If I can walk the entire world, if I can break through whatever lies ahead..."

Rian drew his great straight sword.

"It means I can go anywhere."

Zenia flew backward as if floating and held Dark Blade diagonally.

"From that point, there's only one place I need to go."

Sirone.

"I return to my lord."

Dinai activated in Rian's body as he charged toward Zenia with movements that ignored inertia.

"Taha!"

Zenia dodged the attack while spinning and swung her thin sword toward the back of Rian's neck.

'What?'

As if the front and back of his body had switched, Rian had somehow turned around and was swinging his great sword upward.

A clear metallic sound rang out as Dark Blade shot high into the sky.

Zenia stared blankly upward, watching the direction of the black sword reflected in the moonlight.

"Your situation and mine - neither is really complicated. Everything becomes simple when you break through."

Things only become complicated when you lack the courage to do so.

"I have no intention of stopping. So don't you stop either."

Rian caught the falling Dark Blade and with a graceful motion reversed the blade, extending the hilt toward her.

"Ah..."

"If I try to stop, then you can use this sword to cut my throat yourself."

Zenia stared at the extended hilt for a long time before snatching Dark Blade back.

"Hmph, not bad. But remember this - I don't trust humans or vampires. I only trust the people I believe in."

Since he couldn't soothe her wounds every night, Rian also felt lighter at heart.

"Let's go. We need to sweep away the vampires."

When they returned to the underground facility of the cabin, the Genocide party was eating an early morning meal.

"Welcome back. Did your talk go well?"

Zenia threw Dark Blade, and it stuck to the wide magnet on the wall with a clang.

"We reached an agreement on fighting together."

Though the words left room for interpretation, the fact that he had persuaded Zenia made Rian appear different.

"Come sit here. Eating is important if you're going to fight."

A meeting proceeded with a spread of boiled meat and fresh vegetables.

"Even with the Blood Cue inhaled, the Lord's location hasn't been identified."

Facet said:

"To find that out, we first need to capture an Almas-class. But didn't you say the blood bank was shut down?"

Rian said:

"Maybe vampires have infiltrated the royal castle. Almas can withstand sunlight. I have someone I know in the security force, so I'll go ask."

He needed to meet Benoff anyway.

"Will you be okay? It's already morning."

"One day should be fine."

Zenia stretched and yawned.

"It won't be just one day from now on. You'd better adapt to the time difference quickly too."

For vampire hunters, morning was sleeping time.

"I will."

When he went outside the cabin, it was morning with sunlight pouring through the tree branches.

'Is Irene safe?'

The memories of last night were dark like a dream.

"My Lord, I have brought blood."

Masker, an Almas-class vampire, arrived at the vampire hideout in the deep underground of Rodenin.

With Tempest, who had been in charge of the blood bank, destroyed, he had to wander around all night to meet the quota.

From a chair carved with hideous bat sculptures, an old man who seemed unable to age any further turned his gaze.

It was the vampire Lord, Benedict.

"Kugh!"

The reason he felt chills just from making eye contact was because Benedict had created him.

"You're too late. That person is very angry."

"I'm sorry! The hunters interfered..."

"I don't want to hear excuses."

When his voice echoed through the dome-shaped space made of bricks, all the Almas nearby knelt down.

"For immortal beings to be swayed by mere humans. It's a disgrace to vampires."

Masker had something to say too.

"However, the opponent is a Silver Born. And among the humans I encountered was also a Knight of Maha."

"A Knight of Maha?"

"You may not know, my Lord, but he's classified as Class One among humans."

"Class One."

Vampires ruled the human night, but there were exceptionally strong individuals among humans too.

Class One was the highest in vampire classification, a level too much for one Almas to handle.

"Please organize a unit. I'll take other Almas and sweep them away."

Benedict shook his head.

"There's something more important now. Awakening the remaining two Lords from their slumber."

This would be the first time in 2,000 years that three Lords appeared in the world simultaneously.

"For now, don't worry about the hunters and focus on gathering much more blood."

Just as Masker was about to bow his head, a cold voice came from behind.

"If it's a Knight of Maha, that's a different story. He's a human who even defeated Baknyeo, my comrade."

Benedict shot up from his seat.

"H-how did you come to such a humble place..."

The origin of vampires and 3rd in the Council of Ten, Faust, revealed himself with a beautiful smile.

"We greet the True Demon!"

Among dozens of kneeling vampires, he looked up at the ceiling and muttered:

"That fellow will be our final puzzle piece."
