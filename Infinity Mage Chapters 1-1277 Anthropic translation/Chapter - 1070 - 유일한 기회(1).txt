The Only Chance (1)

The endless silence that seemed like it would continue forever suddenly transformed into noisy murmuring.

"What, what? Why is Aegis...?"

It was extremely rare for a user to actually take that posture in High Gear.

Even when threatened by rankers, they would rather wash their code names than sell their pride.

"Who is Yahweh2? Have you heard of him?"

"No, this is the first time. His parts are a mess too. A basic Maron Corp package with a bolt gun..."

While people were dazed by the scrap metal-like appearance, Shirone asked.

"I thought that guy would come directly."

He had suspected Aegis's identity from the moment he addressed Fermi as "boss."

'It's the Golden Wheel from reality.'

Aegis bowed his head again.

"I apologize. He said it would be better to keep things quiet when resolving Yahweh2's problem."

Shirone understood.

"Alright. Let's head out now."

Aegis turned around military-style and walked toward the northern exit of the plaza.

Shirone didn't care about people's stares, but Destroyer707's group was different.

'Ugh, this is the first time getting this much attention. But seriously, what is this Yahweh2 guy?'

He had thought from the beginning that he wasn't an ordinary user, but that was within High Gear.

'What's happening? And what's this about a boss? Maybe we've gotten caught up in some massive incident that transcends the virtual world.'

'Is it okay to keep going like this?'

When Destroyer707 turned his head, he could see the same emotion in his friends' expressions.

"Auuu. Aeu..."

When he came to his senses from the moaning sounds, they were already in the slum alleyways north of the city.

Drug-addicted junkies were rolling around on the ground like it was their own home, making strange noises.

Shirone asked.

"What about them?"

"They're addicted to drug programs. High Gear is basically a battle simulation, but being in the under-coder, the range of applications is vast. There's also the advantage that pursuit is difficult since it's a floor coder. The boss conducted clinical trials here too."

Angel's Tears - Angel.

"Kiyaaaaa!"

A bald couple collapsed against the wall stuck their tongues out long toward Shirone and screamed.

Electricity flickered in the seven mechanical eyes.

'Here, reactions to drugs can be converted into numerical values. More effective than biological experiments.'

He could guess why Fermi had chosen High Gear.

Soon a shabby motel with half-flickering neon signs came into view, and Aegis headed straight up to room 307.

"Boss, I've brought him."

Opening the door, they saw a sinister-looking man sitting on the bed.

"Fermi?"

User code name: Son of Yolga.

His red hair was half-shaved and tattooed with black dye to look like a monster's face.

His eyes were white without pupils, and he wore a leather fur coat that only devil worshippers would wear.

"...What kind of villain boss is this?"

In reality, Fermi acted like a refined businessman, but his inner self seemed different.

"It's, it's really the Son of Yolga?"

Unlike the bewildered Shirone, Destroyer707's group couldn't believe their eyes even seeing it.

'Killer. Xenosa's flawless ATX ocular implants. And matte finish too.'

While his appearance itself was threatening, not being able to see his pupils was excellent in close combat.

Fermi gestured to the table.

"Sit. By the way... you have companions?"

Having forgotten even the fact that this was a virtual world, Destroyer707 was at a loss.

"Ah, hello. We are..."

Shirone said briefly.

"They're my friends."

As if that was sufficient, Fermi nodded and offered them seats as well.

"I see, nice to meet you. Sit down for now."

"Ah, yes."

Even sitting far from the bed, Destroyer707's group was mentally dazed.

'What exactly is their relationship?'

Code names could be washed. Therefore, meeting new users in major guilds was a matter requiring caution.

'How can they not ask anything?'

Though he couldn't define it clearly, the balance of power seemed to actually lie with Yahweh2.

Fermi began.

"Well, then..."

"Hey! You!"

Shirone pointed accusingly.

"You didn't tell me anything! The Ten Men too, and the Electronic Wasteland was incredibly vast! You did that on purpose, didn't you?"

"Come on, why would pros get angry over something like that? Honestly, it wasn't that big a deal, right?"

Looking back, that was true.

"You have to do at least this much to be called Yahweh. Listen up. I wasn't just playing around either. About breaking the Operator - your mind hasn't changed, has it?"

Destroyer707's group looked at each other.

'Were they serious about that?'

Of course, they had heard as much, but Yahweh2 knew nothing about High Gear.

'Now the head of the Golden Wheel is speaking.'

The weight was completely different, and they couldn't even imagine how such a thing was possible.

Shirone said.

"Regardless of what I think, I have no choice but to do it. I have to beat the Operator for things to work out."

"Just checking. Now that you understand the system to some degree, you know how difficult this is, right?"

"Yeah."

Shirone couldn't deny it.

"Then this will be easier to discuss. That's why I didn't tell you. Your insight is much faster than my explanations. Have you heard of the Ascension Guild?"

"No."

"It's the number one ranked guild in the Western Nation with the Operator as its leader. They have multiple rankers and, like me, are celebrities. They hardly do any external activities. They hunt at the highest difficulty levels that ordinary users can't access."

Fermi pointed west.

"Eccentric personality, presumed to be female. She probably won't come to meet you. So you'd have to go find her at her hunting grounds, but I think you'd die instantly to the creatures, never mind the Ascension Guild members. I'm not saying this to hurt your pride..."

"I'm not hurt."

Shirone interrupted.

"Just tell me the method. How can I meet her?"

"The Solar War."

Destroyer707's group groaned.

"Ah..."

"You could say it's High Gear's most core event. You roughly know the worldview, right?"

"Dr. Martin stole the sun."

"Right. More precisely, the Solar Palace. It's the location of the only Low Gear that exists in this world."

"Low Gear?"

"A device that converts solar energy into electrical energy. The electricity produced there flows into Mid Gears throughout the entire continent. Mid Gears are capsule-shaped devices where High Gear energy is charged."

Fermi pointed at Shirone.

"You can't feel it now because your level is low, but once you pass level 100, energy management becomes difficult. You have to charge at charging stations with Mid Gears installed, or purchase separate auxiliary devices. Think about it. Every user in High Gear uses that."

Shirone understood.

"And the country that wins the Solar War..."

"Right, takes everything. Especially the guild that captures the Solar Palace can charge High Gear for free until the next Solar War. Conversely, other nations have to pay fees to buy energy. As you know, High Gear is the users' heart. In real terms, it's a fight where they stake their lives."

"The Operator will definitely participate."

"Every guild participates. This is the only way for you to meet the Operator."

"Excuse me..."

Death Princess raised her hand.

"May I ask a question?"

"The Princess's interest is always welcome."

She laughed softly.

"I've watched a lot of Solar War broadcasts. The tactics and strategies are incredibly intense. The Operator will naturally participate, but Yahweh2 won't be able to meet her. Honestly... unless you're at least around ranker level, you can't even enter the Solar Palace interior."

"That's our problem too."

Fermi nodded.

"The Solar War win rate is neck and neck between the Eastern and Western Nations, but coincidentally, the Western Nation won the last Solar War. Meaning we're on offense, they're on defense. Ultimately, to enter the Solar Palace interior, you have to break through countless crowds and face rankers too. Especially Ascension Guild's first string - you won't be able to break through them."

Strongest Code Name added.

"Not only inter-guild member tactics but also command centers for inter-guild strategies are operated. In a fight where the sun can be lost with one mistake, performing a personal mission is impossible. I don't think it's a good method either."

"I can do it."

Shirone didn't give up.

"Solving problems is your job, isn't it? You came up with a method, right? How do I do it?"

Fermi dropped his shoulders, sighed, then lifted his head and spoke.

"Abandon the Solar War."

Destroyer707's group's expressions hardened.

"Honestly, it's impossible to transport you while also worrying about winning the war. So we abandon it. We'll use all the Eastern Nation's guilds to transport you near the Solar Palace. After that..."

Fermi glanced at Aegis once.

"Golden Wheel guild members will mobilize in full force to disrupt Ascension Guild's first string. If it's a fight we don't need to win, we can do it. The key is keeping them as far away from you as possible."

Destroyer707 made a bewildered expression.

"But that's betraying the Eastern Nation's guilds. Forget the Solar War - the guild will be ruined."

Fermi didn't budge, and neither did Shirone.

"What are the odds?"

"100 percent. Or 0 percent. We'll continuously mark Ascension's first string with our bodies. Even if we lose everything, we'll transport you inside the Solar Palace. Up to here is my responsibility. What comes next is your part. Catch the Operator by any means necessary."

Destroyer707's mouth gaped.

"No, I mean..."

His first thought was this:

'Why go that far?'

He glanced at Aegis, but she too had a murderous expression.

Shirone asked.

"How high do I need to get? The odds can be low. At minimum, to make it not impossible, how much stronger do I need to become?"

"Hmm. Have you noticed anything strange since coming here? For example, if your senses feel a bit different?"

"My sixth sense is still there. It's not the same as reality, but the signal system is identical."

"Keke, I see."

As if he had already expected this, Fermi calculated immediately.

"Minimum level 300. Of course, higher is better, but it'll be hard to match by the Solar War. You wouldn't want it to take longer either."

In reality, even one day was critical.

"From level 300 and above, the experience needed for leveling up is ridiculous. Therefore, 300 is best, and the rest has to be settled with parts."

"But parts are affected by level too. Even this bolt gun was said to be excessive for my output."

"Prototypes are like that. Energy efficiency has to be supplemented with special legendary or artisan parts. Whatever you do, your win rate will never exceed 5 percent. It's a fight of how close you can get."

Fermi stood up.

"In the same sense, there's a limit to what I can give you now. I'll leave getting to level 100 to your friends. Get it done in 2 days."

Destroyer707's eyes widened.

"What? Level 100 in 2 days?"

"Equip top-grade parts and hunt high-level creatures. The strongest creatures aren't always the answer, but you're more knowledgeable than me in this section anyway, right?"

Of course, that was true.

"B-but if we do it that way, we'll have to keep buying new parts even with slight level increases. What about the existing parts?"

"Throw them away. I'll transmit a credit card approved by Golden Wheel. Buy everything you need. You can spend unlimited currency, so make Yahweh2 level 100 within 2 days. Can you do it?"

Destroyer707 looked around at his friends with a blank expression, then nodded.

"...Yes."
