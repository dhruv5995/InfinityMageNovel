Tomb of Information (3)

Marsha returned to the main topic.

"Anyway, mining in this state is impossible. Even if we drill down 480 meters, finding evidence from a specific time period would be nearly impossible."

Sirone rested his chin on his hand.

'Fermi is right. This really is a gamble worth trying. If we could predict the future...'

A thought suddenly occurred to him.

"What about that drug called Angel? Is there another way to treat emotional disease?"

Fermi said, "According to the evidence I've collected, the World Health Organization never released a cure for emotional disease."

It was a hopeless story.

"But..."

Sirone looked around and gestured with his arms.

"Cell Buster happened. If humanity was wiped out by emotional disease, why would such a disaster be necessary?"

"Listen to the end. It appears humanity didn't go extinct from emotional disease. In other words, it's not that they couldn't develop a cure, but that they no longer needed to."

Sirone finally understood.

"They... gave up emotions?"

"Right. Future humanity will have a completely different emotional system from us now. You know about Giyorgi, right?"

Sirone nodded.

"What's stolen from others isn't precious. Therefore, if you live with plundered goods, emotional disease won't manifest. Future humanity owns nothing and simply takes. In this state, human unification is absolutely impossible."

"That's just being beasts."

Wild dogs.

"But they're free from emotional disease. That's what pain is like. And this is the apocalyptic landscape humanity will reach."

Fermi continued, "The drug made based on that information is Angel's tears, Angel. It's a type of hallucinogen. Why is it a drug? Because we need to lower current humanity's minds to beast level."

Sirone fell silent.

"We went through countless trials and errors to find the golden balance. Just building the distribution network in the southern continent cost astronomical amounts of money. Accept it. This is reality."

"But... I can't report it like that."

The World Health Organization couldn't announce that all humanity should become wild dogs.

'No, even if they announced it, it wouldn't go as planned. It's thorough natural selection. Just a process where those with emotions are gradually weeded out over time.'

Fermi was stopping that process.

'Angel's tears.'

Sirone imagined an angel shedding tears while injecting drugs into a human's arm.

Was that angel Fermi?

Or was it just the naming sense of a genius businessman who could probably sell sand in the desert?

Sirone couldn't tell.

"There has to be a way. It's not an incurable disease anyway. Let's go down. We'll mine everything."

Marsha shrugged, and after exchanging glances with her, Fermi said, "I knew you'd like that. But how do we go down? The mucus keeps regenerating."

Sirone cast Hand of God.

"We'll excavate the exploration point. While I handle the mucus, you can explore, right?"

"Mucus isn't a simple substance. It's operated by Digital Ra, a quantum computer capable of thought. If you remove 1 ton of mucus, it'll instantly fill back 1 ton. No, maybe 10 times, 100 times that amount."

Fermi raised his index finger.

"And one more thing. This is a world of information. It's impossible to deploy massive manpower like in reality, or set up large-scale construction facilities. Even this mining equipment was barely procured by commissioning Under Coder specialists."

Marsha interjected, "We were just talking about that. As long as the mucus regenerates with will, succeeding at mining through external factors is difficult and dangerous."

"External factors..."

As Sirone bit his lip in thought, Fermi also crossed his arms and rested his chin.

"A way to deceive the mucus..."

Having said that, Fermi suddenly raised his head, and Sirone hurriedly turned to look at him.

Simultaneously, the word burst out:

"Virus."

Marsha blinked.

"Huh? Virus? Like a cold?"

It wasn't wrong, but Sirone knew another usage of virus.

"It's a type of program. It infiltrates the main system and disrupts data. If we could somehow plant a virus in Digital Ra, mining would be possible."

"Hmm, attack from the inside? But is it possible? I heard it's an incredibly capable machine."

Fermi said, "We'd just need to change a few minor pieces of data. For example, slowing down the mucus regeneration speed..."

"Aha."

Sirone added, "There are also ways to freeze or harden it. We don't even hope for complete system paralysis. Just minor errors that Digital Ra won't notice."

Freeman asked, "Is it really possible? This place is the end of the world, but that's exactly why it's technologically superior. Who could possibly create a program to disrupt Digital Ra?"

Fermi squinted one eye.

"There is one person who comes to mind. But this is a bit tricky. It's not a personal friendship."

Sirone jumped at this.

"Is that what matters now? Who is it? Let me meet them. I'll convince them somehow."

"You?"

After staring at Sirone for a long time, Fermi suddenly puffed his cheeks and burst into laughter.

"Pff!"

Sirone's ears turned red.

"What's with that mocking laugh? I'm trying to help."

"No, sorry. I couldn't help it thinking of you, who's 100% serious about everything, doing that."

"What are you talking about? What is it?"

"Hmm."

Calming his tickled lungs, Fermi smiled and spoke.

"Have you ever heard of... High Gear?"

Virtual memory zone.

Two bluish circles appeared in the dark space, then light shot up in cylindrical forms.

Sirone and Fermi emerged from their respective circles.

"Where is this...?"

As Sirone looked around, Fermi stepped into the darkness.

"It's an exit exclusive to Abyss Walkers. If I'd known about this earlier, we wouldn't have had to suffer so much back then."

"This is an exit?"

Sirone had only quickly pressed the button on the pocket watch Fermi gave him twice.

"It's one of Dream Star's new functions. Press the button and you're transmitted to Under Coder's virtual memory. In reality terms, it's like recalling a memory, but it's not an actual memory. It's just a false memory created by the hallucinogen's effects."

"So I'm currently in a hallucination. And the person who developed all this is..."

"The Operator. The original designer and operator of High Gear, and also the rank 1 user. Actually, I don't even know if they're human. Under Coder can be accessed through Drimo, and with mental transmission, they could come from the edge of the universe."

"But you said it was a person?"

'Sharp kid.'

It wasn't information that particularly needed hiding, but he didn't like having his thoughts read this way.

"There are a few clues to speculate. Most importantly, High Gear's combat base is human-shaped. Non-logical forms are possible too, but the balance is uniquely immature, you could say. Of course, as a trade-off, certain stats can rise tremendously, so it's popular with enthusiasts."

"What exactly is High Gear?"

All Sirone had heard explained was that it involved modifying bodies to fight in a virtual world.

"It's better to go see for yourself. Even if I explained it to you, the essential parts wouldn't get across."

Though the condescending remark made Sirone puff his cheeks, Fermi currently held the initiative.

Having emerged to Under Coder's middle layer, Fermi turned to Sirone and said, "High Gear content isn't in the middle layer. We need to go much deeper."

"Deeper? The Abyss?"

"Not that kind of meaning - illegal. We call that place Floor Coder."

The fact that it wasn't in Omega's memories meant it was created after Sirone was born.

"Illegal? Who cares about this place?"

"The Dream People."

"Ah..."

"All of Floor Coder's content uses Drimo's modules. It's tremendous convenience for developers. Not only can you feel sensations identical to reality, but difficult-to-implement parts are automatically corrected."

It was the mystery of dreams.

"Actually, many of Floor Coder's contents are stimulating, decadent, and poorly finished. In contrast, High Gear is a masterpiece with all of Floor Coder's advantages. Entry is also tricky - you need to take Dream Star exclusive to Under Coder. If synchronization isn't done properly, your brain gets shocked."

Fermi brought his hand to a gap between mirrors installed in the middle layer.

"Information magic, Information."

As the magic circle rotated, a rectangular gap formed in the wall surface and a red door appeared.

Sirone watched from a step behind.

'It's not a mirror.'

Just the different communication protocol gave him an idea of what kind of place Floor Coder was.

Going inside, there was a corridor with various doors installed, branching paths extending haphazardly.

"But is it okay to just go? You said High Gear needs special Dream Star."

"It's fine. What I gave you was that."

Sirone's eyes narrowed.

"You knew from the beginning this would happen?"

"Isn't it obvious? You came with me to The Abyss before too. You gave passionate speeches just like today. Of course, Floor Code is your first time."

Fermi stopped walking and puffed his cheek muscles.

"Aren't you curious? Should I just tell you?"

Sirone snorted and turned his head away.

"Never mind. I'd rather trust myself, even with no memory of it, than trust you."

"Haha."

Fermi stopped in front of a sliding door that looked like something from a castle in the real world.

"Here it is."

He opened the door, but there was only darkness. Sirone followed Fermi inside.

As the door closed, a scene of a castle interior that had been renovated unfolded before their eyes.

Welcome! Welcome to the battlefield of High Gear, the playground of the entire universe!

Sirone looked around.

Except for someone sitting at a counter in the distance, it was cold and empty.

"There's nobody here but us? You said it was a totally amazing simulation."

"It's because it's your first time. People linking to High Gear for the first time can use tutorial content. Usually people go to battlefields they've saved before."

"I'm telling you again, I didn't come here to do this."

"I know. But it's good to know about it. Talking to the Operator is like plucking stars from the sky. Unless it's system-related suggestions, they absolutely won't have personal conversations."

"They're a ranker, right? Number 1 too. Then I could just talk to them on a battlefield or something."

"I'd like to, but they're on the opposing faction."

Sirone didn't understand why that mattered.

"See, I told you the essential parts wouldn't get across. Anyway, I don't know them privately either."

"Then how do you know them?"

"Under Coder's conditional auction market. You can't just operate such a precise world for free, right? I've bought the Operator's goods in bulk before."

"How much?"

"Hmm, in real world value, about 2,000 trillion gold?"

Sirone's eyes widened.

"What? 2,000 trillion?"

"Haha! Why are you so surprised? Don't tell me you still believe money actually exists?"

"That's not it, but..."

"Anyway, the reason we took a beginner link was to meet the tutorial administrator. This is also a transaction, so maybe they'll connect us to the Operator."

Fermi's work was swift in everything, but Sirone was still puzzled.

'...Why does being on the opposing faction matter?'
