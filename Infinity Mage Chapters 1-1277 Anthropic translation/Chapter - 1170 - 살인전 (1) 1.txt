Murder War (1)

While everyone in the conference hall mulled over Havitz's words, only Uorin knew the truth.

'Havitz kills one person randomly every hour. Until Shirone dies, of course. But why suddenly? Until now, Satan has avoided direct confrontation with Yahweh.'

Such was the law, such was the incident.

'Benevolence and absolute evil. They oppose each other over the world but dislike getting directly entangled. Like a divorced couple. They hate each other but don't want to face each other.'

If there was a case where they had to clash directly.

'A child... something like that?'

Yesterday afternoon, Havitz said he met a girl at the capital's casino.

'The few hours from when he met that child - that's the key. There was something that drove him crazy enough to abandon History Search.'

Who could it be?

Uorin put aside her thoughts and stood up.

"This is unacceptable! Havitz's statement violates the peace treaty and is a provocation against the 12 nations! Kashan will not back down, and we formally declare that we will henceforth regard Havitz as a public enemy!"

There was no applause, and Albino stroked his beard.

"...The Empress has lit the fire."

Lufist agreed.

"A bloody storm will blow through the holy war."

"Havitz is serious. As long as Shirone is alive, he'll kill one person every hour. It could be a low-level official, but it could also be the head of a holy war participating nation. The biggest problem is..."

"Vanishing."

"Right. Even if Havitz kills someone, we have no way of knowing that fact. In this situation, even if other nations commit assassinations, they can just pin it on Havitz."

Everything would be innocent.

"In other words, this isn't a threat. Rather, Havitz has given us something."

Albino's eyes narrowed.

"A license to kill."

Satan's will - that he would take all the blame himself, so they should kill to their hearts' content...

Silenced the minds of the 12 nations' intellectuals.

"We'll... we'll take a brief recess."

As the officials filed out, Albino looked at Uorin, who had just stood up.

'Did you calculate this far? You must have. But you know this isn't a perfect strategy, don't you?'

It's self-defeating.

'Tormia will take your head.'

Smoodo and Zetaro, who participated in the holy war in place of Vulcan who had taken sick leave, also had much to think about.

Smoodo said.

"So there was this method. It's genius."

"He's mastered breaking the rules. Anyway, new rules have been set, so we'll have to do something with this."

Zetaro's expression was dark.

"What's wrong? Can't think of anything?"

"I have thoughts. Honestly speaking, a very good idea did come to mind..."

Havitz would like it too.

"I know how you feel. You wanted to kill him yourself, didn't you?"

Zetaro's only wish was for Havitz to be in his happiest state.

"Vulcan and Natasha think you're qualified too. That you're Havitz's closest friend. Not Wizard."

The contradiction of being able to kill because you love.

This was precisely why Satan possessed the emotional symmetry of Yahweh.

"Yeah, thanks. Let's tell Vulcan for now. It's a strategy that won't work without that brat."

Both sincerely hoped Vulcan would stay alive until Havitz died.

The holy war general assembly declared a recess, but the subordinate departments continued working without rest.

Seriel headed to the small conference room.

'Assassination?'

The heads of each nation had dealt with incidents large and small, including Kesia among them.

'So that's why Fermi...'

She should have treated him a little more kindly.

"Excuse me."

Upon entering the small conference room, approximately 200 officials filled the seats.

The small assembly, also known as the working-level meeting.

While the general assembly handled the largest proposals, the small assembly coordinated specific opinions.

The heads of four of the holy war's five major departments gathered, excluding the general assembly: Military, Economic and Social Affairs, Religious Affairs, and International Court.

Experts from holy war subsidiary organizations such as World Climate, Communications, Health, Heritage, and Education also attended.

"Pope Constantine, who attended the general assembly, will be about 10 minutes late. Please wait a moment."

Seriel took in the familiar faces.

'Military Deputy Dorothy, Nade Group co-founder Liz, Alpheas Magic School...'

Alpheas, Olivia, and Shiina were there too.

"Sorry for being late."

As Pope Constantine entered, the Anti-Magic Department's holy knights followed behind in full armor.

'Armed forces at a working meeting. He must be late from going through legal procedures for guards.'

Due to Havitz's declaration, the Pope had no choice but to maintain thorough vigilance.

The meeting began.

"Before continuing from yesterday, let's organize the agenda from today's general assembly and move on. Last night, the Moon Kingdom attempted assassinations targeting specific countries."

The air grew cold.

"Several countries suffered serious damage, and the unprecedented situation occurred where even a king died. As you can see from the report distributed in advance, there are legal procedures regarding the Moon Kingdom's charges and suspicions about Kashan's involvement. I think it would be good to first hear the International Court's position and then express opinions."

Socrates and Shirano, who resigned simultaneously with the opening of the holy war, sat side by side.

The contrast between Socrates, weighing over 150 kilograms, and the skeletal Shirano was bizarre, but...

"Why are you looking at me? I quit ages ago."

This was the problem.

"No, I understand that Mr. Shirano's paperwork hasn't been processed. Therefore, officially, Mr. Mito Shirano is correctly the International Court's director."

Sparks flew from Shirano's eyes as she glared at Socrates.

"You, you pig bastard..."

"Heh heh! Can't be helped! The director position has been held by Red Line Association presidents for generations. There's no one but you and me. If you don't like it, you should have become director first!"

"I'll kill you."

True to her nickname as the Swamp-Colored Witch, long claws extended from Shirano's right hand.

"Oh? Want to have a go? Let me be clear - there's no mercy in my explosion magic."

Socrates' eyes narrowed.

"Kuk!"

The Anti-Magic Department's holy knights grew alert, and killing intent rose to a level even ordinary people could feel.

'This is bad! I need to stop them quickly...'

Second-class or higher great mages could bypass even the highest-level magic devices.

In the explosion that seemed about to erupt at any moment, Socrates burst into loud laughter.

"Puhahaha! Just joking! As if I'd do such a thing? Just indulging an old maid's hysteria for a moment...!"

When Shirano struck Socrates' face, a sound that defied common sense rang out with a "THUNK."

Not only had she used violence, but the sight of the giant falling in one blow was truly bizarre.

Shirano dusted off her wrist.

"Tsk. I treat you nicely, but you have to be hit before you listen. What are you doing, pig? Aren't you getting up quickly?"

As Socrates sprang up and sat in his chair, Shirano addressed the assembly.

"The paperwork will be processed by today. I won't get involved in this matter."

"You knew from the beginning, didn't you?"

Everyone's gaze turned to where Dorothy stood.

"That this situation would arise from the moment the holy war opened - you knew and resigned?"

"...Hmm."

Shirano crossed her legs.

"That's right, Military Director. The International Court is an organization representing Red Line, and retired association presidents have traditionally held the director position. Do you know why it's specifically 'retired' presidents?"

Dorothy closed her mouth.

"Active ones don't know when to step back. If you're a mage, that's natural. What kind of judgment do you want me to make? Should I side with Kashan since the Moon Kingdom has weakened?"

"Hey, Shirano..."

Socrates' expression grew serious for the first time, but she raised her hand to cut him off.

"The holy war is a snake pit. First they swallow, then think about digestion. Not one person here knows exactly what's happening. In such a situation, if I make the wrong judgment, that impact will go straight to our juniors."

Dorothy was also Red Line.

"Anyway, aren't all of you here trying to dump everything on the International Court because you don't want responsibility? So I'll take responsibility. Dismiss me or arrest me, do as you please."

The hall fell silent.

"Among the snakes that control the world, cleaning up shit for our juniors - this is what elders do. The International Court will not make judgments for the time being."

There were no objections.

"What the hell is going on!"

Gis's daughter Rebecca entered Delta headquarters under escort from the guard captain.

"I was just about to win big! I only lost money because of you people!"

She had been gambling all night.

"We apologize. This is a Class 1 Zive alert. You must refrain from going out for the time being."

"Hmph! I thought so. I thought Dad called for me."

"Since it's an alert only the supreme military commander can issue, your father did call for you."

Though the result was the same, the feeling was different.

'Fine! I'm sick of it all now. I should eat some Dream Star and play to my heart's content in Under Coder.'

High Gear was still operating, but it had become much less fun since Yahweh left.

'Huh? Come to think of it...'

Isn't Shirone at Delta headquarters?

'That's it!'

As Rebecca's pace quickened, the captain maintained precise steps to guard her left and right.

'She seems to have made up her mind.'

Reaching the corridor where the general assembly room was located, Rebecca saw Shirone walking in the distance.

'There he is!'

A man fighting for the world. And she was the daughter of Gis, King of Zive.

'If I capture Yahweh...'

She wasn't interested in world affairs, but wondered if some great event might occur.

"Shirone!"

Rebecca called out loudly.

"Huh?"

Rather than the name, the code name came to Shirone's mind first.

'Death Princess.'

Since connections in Under Coder were as precious as those in reality, he smiled and waved.

"Well, look who it is?"

Under the captain's escort, Rebecca strode toward Shirone.

"Haha! We're really meeting in person? This is totally... gack!"

The next moment, Rebecca's neck was cleanly severed from her torso.

"Awesome... gurgle!"

Her face bounced on the floor, and Havitz, passing by, shook the blood off his long sword.

"That's one."

59 minutes and 59 seconds until the next death.

Even as Havitz left the corridor, the captain failed to recognize the VIP's death, but...

"Huh?"

A tear fell from one of Shirone's eyes.

'Why am I crying?'

Since all human misfortune was his own, Yahweh felt dead at this very moment.

The only reason Yahweh cannot kill Satan is...

'What just happened?'

Ironically, because Satan absolutely refuses to face Yahweh.

Killing intent appeared in Shirone's eyes.

"Ha-

vitz!"

As the corridor rang with his voice, the hair on Havitz's neck stood on end as he turned the corner.

'That was close.'

The moment he exceeded the approach limit allowed by law, it felt like being struck by lightning.

But what about Wizard?

'Now it begins. All humans will come running to kill you. Look forward to it.'

The curtain rose on the murder war.
