Forbidden Territory (2)

While Yorahan struggled with his conflict, Areon showed off his abilities before the Fire Tribe.

"Behold. I conquered this forest with a cavalry of 100 men. And I have an army of over 10,000. Soon, this world will lie beneath my feet."

In that gaze where no trace of fear toward the world could be found, Armang thought:

'How captivating.'

Young, beautiful, and that proactive attitude as if born solely for domination...

'This must be what humans call royal bloodline.'

It wouldn't be strange to feel as if light emanated from Areon's body.

'But I despise it.'

That light was unpleasant to Armang.

'If one is a being who must shine alone, that light is never beautiful. Yorahan is...'

He was someone who would become a light that embraces the world.

Chief Rutia asked:

"What do you intend to do with us?"

"I am magnanimous."

Contrary to his words, Areon's ice-cold longsword dug into the space beneath Rutia's chin.

"But only to my people."

Areon withdrew his sword and looked around at the Fire Tribe.

"You will soon become citizens of a great kingdom. You'll be entrusted with the very important duty of assisting the king. Good homes, good food, all kinds of treasures will be given to you."

Rutia said:

"We desire nothing. We only wish to live peacefully in this forest."

"How unfortunate."

Areon's eyes turned cold.

"You don't need to be good at anything. Because I am good at everything. What do you think this means?"

"I don't know."

"It means the only thing you can do is obey."

Just as Areon was about to behead Rutia, Armang blocked his path and raised her sword.

A sharp metallic sound rang out, and the cavalry charged at her with displeased expressions.

Areon raised his hand.

"Stop."

As the cavalry retreated, Pisk spoke:

"She's a carnivore. It seems she needs some taming. Please leave her to me."

When it came to killing children, it would be better for him to do it personally rather than the soldiers.

"No, that won't be necessary."

Areon stepped back, brimming with confidence.

"Woman, what is your name?"

"Armang."

"I like you."

That was all that mattered.

"You won't be a slave. You're strong and proactive. Come to me. I'll save you from hell."

Having lived with Yorahan for over two years, she now understood the language of men.

"I am a married woman. I cannot do that."

"Haha! Didn't I tell you? I am magnanimous. I won't mind what happened before you met me. But refusing me now is a crime for which all the Fire Tribe could die without complaint."

Armang remained silent.

'I'm sorry, children.'

Because she couldn't betray Yorahan, the Fire Tribe would be massacred, but when that time came, she too would take up her sword.

"Hmm. Indeed..."

Areon looked at Armang, who had expressed her refusal through silence, with eyes of madness.

"Kill them all."

"Wait, wait just a moment!"

When Yorahan rushed out from the storage, emotion showed on Armang's face for the first time.

Relief flooded through her so intensely that she forgot even the current situation, but soon her brow furrowed.

'Why did you come? You fool.'

Areon asked:

"Who are you? Is there a traitor among the Fire Tribe too?"

"I-I am human. A wandering philosopher. I was captured by the Fire Tribe and suffered humiliation for two years."

"Captured?"

By this gentle tribe?

"Armang here is my wife. For two years, I've been imparting knowledge and skills in this place. I was constantly monitored to prevent me from harming other Fire Tribe members."

Since clumsy lies would waste their only opportunity, he wove his words with only facts.

When Areon looked back, Pisk said:

"It's possible. The carnivores recorded in ancient texts are described as cruel and savage."

The scholar would have written the truth.

They simply turned a blind eye to why carnivores had to be cruel and savage toward humans.

"So that's it."

Looking at Yorahan with interested eyes, he glanced at Armang's expression and asked:

"If you were forcibly captured, I suppose it wouldn't particularly matter if I took your wife?"

"Th-that's..."

"Why? Does it upset you?"

"N-no! How could I harbor such feelings toward the Prince of Micas! However, I have one request."

"A request?"

Yorahan prostrated himself flat.

"Please take me to Micas. If you give me any task, I will do my utmost!"

Being beseeched by talent from all corners of the world, Areon was in good spirits.

"Haha! You call yourself a philosopher, but you have quite an eye for reading the times. Good. I'll keep you by my side and put you to use."

"Thank you!"

Since humans cannot know others' truths, the Fire Tribe's sense of betrayal would be natural, but...

'Why?'

Armang knew Yorahan's truth.

'There should be no way.'

Knowing he wasn't the kind of man who would abandon his wife even if it meant death, her confusion deepened.

"Well, that settles it. Your husband has also knelt before me. So why don't you choose as well?"

Because she trusted Yorahan, Armang lowered her sword, but Areon interpreted it as submission.

"Yes, this is the way of the world. You can get up now too. You'll have much work to do for me from now on."

Yorahan looked up at the world from the lowest place, while Areon faced the sky with both feet planted on the ground.

Did he know?

'I can see it.'

That gap between those extremes was precisely the position where a human's vital point was most visible...

In an instant, Yorahan's expression vanished as he naturally rose and swung the dagger from his breast.

"Huh?"

Not from hatred or resentment, but with a motion so smooth it seemed to swing at nothing in particular...

"Wh-what?"

A fountain of blood erupted from Areon's nape.

"Your Highness!"

Having precisely cut with his blade the area that armor couldn't cover, Yorahan turned around and shouted:

"Run!"

The Fire Tribe was shocked.

'Teacher...'

Because they had never thought of him as someone who could harm anyone.

"What are you all doing! Do you want to die?"

Even if the entire world gave orders, the only person they would follow was Yorahan.

"Children! Go to the forest! Now!"

The Fire Tribe members who had regained their senses ran with all their might.

The cavalry captain, knowing there would be no way to catch them once they entered the forest, mounted his horse.

"Chase them! Don't leave a single one alive!"

"Wait!"

At Pisk's shout, the cavalry reared up.

"Your Highness."

Areon's condition was serious.

Though he tried pressing on the neck wound, hot blood poured between his palms.

'He avoided the spinal cord and only cut the artery. Don't tell me it was to buy time for escape? This bastard knows anatomy.'

At that time, few people possessed such knowledge.

"P-Pisk."

Areon, his face swollen like a balloon, grabbed Pisk's shoulder and squeezed out his words.

"Save... save me. Save... me."

'Damn it!'

Fire Tribe or not, if the prince died, their lives would end here too.

Pisk raised his head.

"We return to the main camp with His Highness immediately! Hurry! We can't waste even a second!"

To traverse the maze-like forest by the shortest route, sacrificing cavalry members was essential.

"Your Highness! Please hold on just a little longer, Your Highness!"

Even while transporting Areon, Pisk mobilized all his knowledge to stop the bleeding.

'Clay stops wounds, but this bleeding is too severe. Then with the power of water...'

Couldn't he create blood?

Humans would come to understand all things in the distant future, but that would be after many more wars.

"Hnnngh!"

Pisk's face, covered in cold sweat, was despairing.

"I don't know!"

No matter how he combined the four elements of air, earth, water, and fire, he couldn't create blood.

"Iron?"

Or some other something.

"Pisk."

Perhaps because he was concentrating intensely, Areon's voice was irritating this time.

"Your Highness."

Areon's condition, already pale as death, was clearly at death's door even to a non-expert.

"I don't... want to die."

With those final words, the Prince of the Kingdom of Micas departed from this world without even being able to close his eyes.

"It's all over."

Even if he returned to the kingdom like this, the King of Micas would kill him.

"Blood."

It didn't matter anymore.

"Blood, I say."

If it had ruined his life, wouldn't it be worth betting his life on?

"Hmph."

Jumping from the moving carriage, he watched as the prince's corpse headed toward the Kingdom of Micas.

According to Omega's records, Pisk devoted his entire life but failed to create blood.

Though he did complete a work called "The Composition and Components of Blood," that too was a story unrelated to the Transcendent Dream.

Shirone's unconscious mind, deep in slumber, was drawn to Yorahan's anguish.

"Hah! Hah!"

Leading the Fire Tribe as he frantically ran through the forest, he felt his vision going dark.

Only when he fell to his knees did he realize his breath had reached his chin, and pain came flooding in.

"Yorahan."

Armang couldn't continue her words.

"I, I..."

Trembling, Yorahan muttered with soul-empty eyes.

"I cut... I cut a person."

The beliefs that had preached love and shunned violence had become bubbles in an instant.

No, even that was just a matter of reason.

"Hnnngh."

He was simply afraid, and his heart churned as if a poisoned frog was thrashing about in his stomach.

"Armang, I, I..."

"Get a hold of yourself. You protected the Fire Tribe. That's enough. If it weren't for you, they would all be dead."

"Small World Creation. Honey, I... can't... endure..."

Seeing Yorahan's eyes half-rolling back, Armang hastily connected their minds.

The moment they became one, she shed tears.

'What a tender heart this is.'

He was so kind that he wouldn't even kick a rolling pebble for no reason.

Armang whispered:

"I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I failed to protect you. I should have protected you..."

She had wanted to help him achieve his dream.

They say shared sorrow becomes half, and this time it truly was so, and Yorahan calmed down.

"No, that's not right."

Had he been wandering in a dream all this time?

"I was foolish. Having never lost anything, I was ignorant of reality while my ideals were too lofty."

"Yorahan."

"Let's hide. Let's hide and never come out into the world again. Let's live with the Fire Tribe in a place without violence or selfishness."

"What about your dream? You said you wanted to save humanity."

"Many Fire Tribe members have already been sacrificed. I don't want to lose anyone else. Most of all, without you, I..."

Being already of one mind, she felt equally that there wasn't an ounce of regret.

"Yes, I understand."

If her husband wanted it, that was enough.

"Let's leave. To the depths of the forest where no one can find us, to a place where no one can disturb us."

"...Yes."

Thus Yorahan broke his convictions.

Even so, the Transcendent Dream was still in progress, and Shirone rather found it understandable.

'I see.'

Knowing better than anyone how difficult it was to practice love, if there was something that could be carried through...

'What remains for him now is...'

The first Yora.

Through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, his final event that had finally arrived was about to unfold.
