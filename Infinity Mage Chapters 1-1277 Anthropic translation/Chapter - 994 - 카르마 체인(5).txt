Karma Chain (5)

Ethella saw hundreds of chains extending from Seongeum's heart, connected in all directions.

Even without knowing much about the other world, those chains revealed her identity.

'Jin Seongeum.'

The woman who sealed the spirit zone for humanity's sake.

She had clearly entered in her living flesh, and what emotions she felt could be understood by comparing them to the chains connected to herself and Shagal.

"Are you... Jin Seongeum?"

Ethella took another step forward and asked.

"Uuuu..."

Seongeum's body trembled, and chains rippled from the end of the Valley of Wailing.

Some force pressed toward her from all directions.

"Aaaaaaah!"

She never made a sound with her mouth, but her soul's scream was carried on the wind.

"How annoying."

Shagal watched Seongeum while gripping his quick sword.

He didn't care who she was, but it was natural for him to think much about the chains.

"D-don't come..."

A hoarse, broken voice leaked from Seongeum's mouth, bound by chains.

Ethella said, "Don't worry. I too am a guardian of good, and I won't leave your suffering unattended."

Clank, clank!

Seongeum, who had been struggling briefly, shook her head.

"Shirone."

"Shirone?"

Ethella's eyebrows rose, and Seongeum trembled as she looked down.

"Tell Shirone my words. He must never come here. Go back."

"I don't understand what you're saying. Where exactly is this place? And the chains? Why shouldn't Shirone come here?"

As the second wave of pain was transmitted, Seongeum spread her limbs and lifted her head.

"Aaaaaaah!"

Hearing the screams of one called the Iron Lady was itself terrifying.

Seongeum spoke, "This is the Valley of Wailing. The source river where reality's evil flows in and hellfire flows. But I dried it up. Though I became like this instead."

Ethella looked around.

If hellfire had flowed here, it would have been too hot to approach.

Seongeum continued, "I don't know what happened to you, but chains represent human karma, attachments to reality. Chains are hell itself. And they bind those who enter hell while alive, making them suffer eternally. Until they're purified."

Ethella examined her own chains.

"But I—no, we—aren't bound to hell. We're connected to each other."

"I don't know the reason either. But perhaps... it means you two are hell to each other."

While Ethella was lost in thought, Shagal snorted and stepped forward.

"Nonsense. I don't know about this woman, but these pathetic chains can't cause me any pain. Well, they are a bit annoying, but if this is the extent of it, hell seems like a livable place."

Though Seongeum showed no expression, for a moment she looked at Shagal with pitying eyes.

"Everything follows natural order, evildoer. Because there is attachment, there is anguish. No being here can avoid suffering. You will eventually curse those chains. Like all the living flesh, including myself, you will shed tears of blood."

During her words, waves of pain struck several times, but Seongeum only briefly closed her mouth.

'Superhuman mental strength.'

Right now she couldn't understand what the chains connecting her and Shagal meant, but at least Seongeum needed liberation as quickly as possible.

"Is there anything I can do to help?"

"Go back."

Seongeum repeated the same words.

"There's no way to escape the Karma Chain. No one can break it. No, it must not be broken. Destruction will occur in the real world. Tell Shirone to go back."

"I cannot do that."

If Shirone had truly come to the other world, he must surely possess some possibility.

"I will liberate you. Please wait. I'll find a way somehow."

Seongeum said nothing more.

Being in hell and suffering was her everything, but there was something she felt in that process.

'Perhaps this too is natural order?'

Watching the Karma Chain connected between the two people, Seongeum spoke.

"Whatever you do is your freedom. But remember this. This place... is not somewhere that allows you to worry about others' suffering. Someday your Karma Chain will bind you."

"I will overcome it."

Just as Seongeum was doing.

Turning around, Ethella looked up above the Valley of Wailing and said, "Let's go. First we need to escape here and gather information."

Shagal sneered.

"You think I'd let that happen? First, I don't care what happens to that woman. And... if it's something you want, I won't do anything."

For the first time, Ethella opened cold eyes and glared at Shagal's face.

It was a gaze of hatred and resentment that couldn't be seen despite countless battles in reality.

Perhaps it was Ethella's personal emotions, not those of good's representative.

"You're not the only one who can bind me. I can bind you too. If you want to see who wins, let's do it by all means."

Shagal clenched his mouth shut.

Of course he wasn't scared, but looking at Ethella's gaze filled him with an inexplicable unease.

'What is this?'

A stimulus that made a corner of his heart flinch was transmitted through the Karma Chain.

It resembled the emotion that had completely changed his life in the real world.

'Tia.'

The face of a woman—whom he no longer knew was real or not—naturally came to mind.

"Kekeke."

Shagal shrugged his shoulders.

"Fine, since I have nothing else to do, let's go. But remember this. I'll never let you smile."

Ethella made an ugly expression again, but satisfied with this, approached the wall.

Like that, still connected by chains, the two people bound by the chain of yin-yang began climbing the rock face.

"Kugh!"

Ryan, who had been walking, stopped abruptly.

Once again, Gehenna's chains shot out from his heart and struck into the ground.

"Hup!"

As he tried to break them with the power of Divine Transcendence, second and third chains emerged.

"Ryan."

When Shirone looked back, Ryan, feeling urgency in that gaze, put in more strength.

The three chains broke with a clang, and the source of evil seeped into his body.

"Hnghhh!"

"Are you okay?"

Ryan nodded.

"I've roughly adapted. I figured out the trick too. But this is really inconvenient. They come out constantly."

"Probably in the living flesh state, you can't move freely in hell. You must be a special case."

Was he really a special case?

'Ryan's chains burn hellfire.'

By his guess, it might be an error that shook the fundamental system of the other world.

'According to Guffin's experience, there was definitely an upper level in the other world besides Satan's army.'

Then there was a high possibility they were currently being watched.

'Eventually some movement will be revealed. We need to find something like a city within that.'

Though the spirit zone was sealed, evil from the real world was endlessly flowing into the other world.

No, now that the demon world was opened, hell would be saturated with unprecedented visitors.

'Even if we completely extinguish all the hellfire, the other world itself won't be purified.'

What Shirone aimed for was meeting whoever managed hell's system.

"Let's go, Shirone."

Ryan, not wanting to cause worry, moved first, and Shirone followed without complaint.

The reason he didn't feel too lonely even fallen into hell was probably because Ryan was beside him.

Climbing to the top of the steep mountain peak, they heard enormous screams that would have been strange not to hear until now.

"What's that?"

Countless humans were walking toward where a massive river of fire flowed.

The reason they couldn't escape was because countless demons swarmed around them.

"Tremendous numbers."

There were so many demons that the hellish army that invaded reality was nothing in comparison.

"Uwaaah! Uwaaah!"

Demons attacked from all directions, tearing apart and eating humans, while those at the front were whipped by masked demons and falling into the river of fire.

"Those bastards!"

Ryan gripped his great sword, but Shirone spoke with a calm expression.

"Stay calm. They're not humans living in reality. Just emotions from the moment of death manifested in human form."

"But... they're suffering."

Ryan didn't understand complicated things.

"If chains represent attachments to the present world, those people have no chains. Though emotions entered the other world, their spirits have already escaped elsewhere."

"By elsewhere, do you mean the outer world?"

"...Anywhere. Since no one knows. What I want to say is, it's not exactly judgment. It's a system where real-world emotions flow into the other world and get purified."

"A cold world."

If there was neither salvation nor hell from the beginning.

The two quickly descended the peak and went to where the procession of people was.

All were naked, and demons that had been watching for opportunities were pouncing on people.

"Uwaaaah! Save me!"

When one demon dragged over a human, dozens more rushed around it to tear flesh.

A masked demon swung a whip, driving away the demons.

"Get lost! Do you know how short resources are right now? Demons are a problem everywhere."

Shirone read the letters on the armbands on their arms with Ultima.

'Fire Resource Management Corporation.'

While moving mixed in with the crowd, countless people were devoured by demons.

"Scary. Scary."

A woman walking beside them looked at Ryan.

"Where are we going? Are we going to disappear like this? I don't want to. I don't want to disappear."

He knew it was a system. But even if it were false, Ryan couldn't turn away from those suffering.

"Shirone, I don't understand well."

Shirone nodded.

"Yeah."

And that would be exactly the reason humans must fight in this cold world.

"How can we save them?"

"Hellfire."

Shirone pointed forward.

"If we eliminate the river of fire, it should work. But even with Yahweh's light, to completely eliminate all that..."

"Hey, you two there."

A Fire Corporation employee noticed something strange and approached.

"What are you?"

The biggest evidence was that no fear could be felt from Shirone and Ryan.

"Why are you here? This isn't where you belong. Get lost back to your original world."

At that moment, several more chains shot out from Ryan's heart and struck into the ground.

The startled Fire Corporation employee watched silently, then slowly raised his head.

"Gehenna. Could it be..."

The Fire Corporation had already received instructions regarding whoever broke Gehenna's chains.

"Kill him! This is the one!"

The procession became chaos, and not only employees but even demons rushed at Ryan.

"I'll block them. Eliminate the hellfire."

Shirone stepped forward and emitted Yahweh's light, instantly burning up the demons.

Meanwhile, Ryan broke the chains and ran toward the river of fire.

'Can I do it?'

Without time to devise methods, he jumped into the river before the chains could enter.

"N-no!"

The Fire Corporation employee screamed, but Ryan's body had already fallen into the flames.

"Uwaaaaaaah!"

Hundreds of chains shot out from Ryan's heart and began absorbing the hellfire.

"S-such a thing..."

At this unprecedented event in the other world, the employees stopped fighting and watched the scene.

Violent bubbles formed in the middle of the river, then gradually calmed down.

"Ryan..."

Shirone looked back with a tense expression, and the Fire Corporation employee faintly smiled.

"Of course, as if hellfire could be—"

"KWAAAAAAANG!"

A streak of light pierced through the flames and shot toward the sky.

The great sword <Idea> connected to the chains rose endlessly, punching a huge hole in the clouds of fire.

Following those chains, planet-scale flames twisted like pretzels as they ascended, and the river of fire began exposing its bottom.

Shirone, the employees, demons and humans—all stopped moving, entranced.

"Uwaaaaaaah!"

Ryan, extending a single chain from his heart, was roaring with his limbs spread wide.
