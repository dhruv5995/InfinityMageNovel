The Final 5 Hours (1)

Green Ocean.

The racial war intensified even further with the angels joining the fray.

"Damn it!"

With the 12 Apostles scattered, the apostle facing Uriel was the Fire Dragon Infercus.

The Extreme Paradise Rod spun with a thunderous roar as Uriel dissolved like wind and flew in.

"The war is over."

Taking the archangel's physical attack, Infercus clutched her thick chest.

"Nonsense."

The battle configuration changed, and half of Infercus's face began to contort like a monster.

Finally, with the upper part of her neck transformed into a dragon, she fired a small breath attack at Uriel's face.

"Kuooooo!"

Kicking the steaming-faced Uriel, she sent him flying dozens of meters to crash into the ground.

"You're getting on my nerves."

Spotting this from the sky, Machine Dragon Argan and Black Dragon Aviris landed beside her.

Argan wore a troubled expression.

"What are you doing using breath attacks? At this rate, the elven forest will burn. Did you forget what the Messiah said? Don't break taboos unless you're protecting someone..."

"Are you kidding? Can't you see all the angels have invaded? This isn't the time to worry about consequences. We have to win to protect the elves too."

Aviris slowly stood up.

"What."

The black-skinned female warrior's intense eyes began to glow with amber fire.

"So that's how it is?"

Releasing her polymorph, she became a 20-meter-long black dragon and soared into the sky.

"Grrrrrr."

The moment she looked down at the ground with terrifying eyes, both apostles and angels simultaneously raised their heads.

"Th-that..."

The apostles were more shocked than the angels.

"That crazy...!"

The moment the apostles desperately threw themselves away, Aviris opened her jaws and cast her breath attack.

'Shadow of the Abyss.'

A point smaller than a fingernail appeared on the ground, then spread at terrifying speed, engulfing the forest.

Darkness has no substance.

Therefore, there was nothing, and all living creatures on the ground experienced a perfect realm of nothingness.

Unable to even feel where their limbs were attached, their mobility was reduced to zero.

'Completely immobilized.'

Aviris's breath attack that manifested the bottomless pit of the shadow world wherever desired - Shadow of the Abyss.

The charging time was 12 hours, which was the fifth longest delay among the 12 Apostles.

Aviris laughed.

"Kahahaha! Experience the terrible void! I am the Black King Berserker Dragon Aviris!"

Phaeton shouted.

"How ridiculous! You're just a crazy dragon! What if we had gotten caught up in it too?"

As the other apostles arrived in the sky one by one, Aviris pulled up the corners of her long mouth.

"Keke, this is good. Now it finally feels like a real fight. What are you doing? You guys do it too."

"But won't the Messiah scold us? He's negative about uncontrollable power."

Machine Dragon Argan said, raising his index finger.

"Ah, that's fine. Infercus agreed to take responsibility. We're not at fault."

"Hey! How can you say that..."

Just as Infercus was about to argue, Thunder Dragon Blitz spoke.

"One didn't come."

The apostles' gazes turned toward the abyssal darkness completely covering Green Ocean.

"Who's that hopeless apostle?"

Quickly checking the eleven members present, they couldn't blame the apostle remaining on the ground.

"Soul Dragon."

In the vast abyss where even oneself could be lost, White Dragon Asraiker knelt on her knees.

Though she possessed the highest ego and was an object of extreme favor for all living creatures...

"The abyss, is it."

In the realm of nothingness, she shone beautifully enough to render even that meaningless.

"What a pointless act."

As an apostle who feared earning the Messiah's displeasure, great courage was needed for this decision.

As her gaze grew hazy staring into the darkness, her body dispersed into white light.

Asraiker's true form after releasing polymorph was a pure white dragon composed of spiritual essence.

"Whiiiiiii!"

Though she had a fox-like sharp impression, it was eerie with nothing but blank space except for her massive eyes.

Breath attack.

Wrath of White Bones.

Skeletal spirits that shone even in the abyss scattered in all directions, screaming shrilly.

The charging time was only 6 hours.

The soul of any being pierced by the Wrath of White Bones perceives itself as being in a perfect state of death.

'It doesn't work on immortals, those with transcendent will, or inanimate objects, but...'

When activated together with Shadow of the Abyss, it was an ability that caused mass destruction.

As the forest, already feeling dead, withered black, the angels collapsed to the ground.

"Huuuuu!"

Though their eternal lifespans meant no annihilation, the terror of death shook their minds.

"That place shall be your grave."

Casting polymorph again, Asraiker sat demurely, savoring the abyss.

Poine smiled with her eyes.

"What a spectacle. A spectacle indeed."

The forest looked like a massive hole.

And within that darkness, countless skeletal spirits wandered chaotically.

"In the end, she did it. Asraiker is an accomplice too."

Ignoring Infercus's words as she persisted to the end, Poine turned to look at Blitz.

"How many hours are left?"

Thunder Dragon Blitz remained silent.

"Don't pretend not to know. With Lord Karatosa's extinction, we lost our core. If there was something to convey, it would have been to you. Omega 999. How much time is left until the end?"

The dragon was the apostle of time.

A Neutron Dragon who had passed through Omega years 1 to 999 should be able to roughly calculate.

"From now..."

Blitz opened his mouth.

"5 hours."

Silence flowed.

"According to Lord Karatosa, today is the last day of history ordained by God. But it's only an estimate."

Light Dragon Phaeton spoke.

"The Messiah must have some idea too, having received the Omega. Anyway, we just need to protect the elves for 5 hours, right? The Shadow of the Abyss will be maintained for a while too. Easy, isn't it?"

If all 12 Apostles broke their taboos, 5 hours should be more than manageable.

"There will be variables."

Poine didn't let her guard down.

"Did we anticipate the angels' support? This isn't a battle of strength. It's a war we lose if the elves are annihilated."

"So how do they kill them? We're blocking them."

"Well..."

Poine's eyes narrowed.

'What kind of scheme are those little things plotting?'

Middle layer of Melkidu.

With Pena, who wasn't an accomplice, in hiding, Sirone's group wandered around the port warehouses.

Of course, security was tight, and to open a single warehouse, they had to bribe the guards.

"Halt. Who goes there?"

When first caught by a patrol, Sirone grasped the conditions for disabling security.

"Ah, well, we got lost."

"Lost? Do you know what time it is? And you users..."

"Please give us a chance to persuade you."

The patrol immediately changed their tune.

"Ah, right. My personality is timid. The points needed for one persuasion attempt are 1 million points."

'Surprisingly cheap.'

However, once they entered the dice battle, the difficulty was incomparable to the shop clerks.

Of course, difficulty was irrelevant to Sirone.

"Quantum Collapse!"

Succeeding in one try, the patrol chuckled and said,

"What? You're a decent guy. But be careful. If we meet again, I won't forgive you then."

'And it's a one-time persuasion.'

After exploring for roughly 3 hours in Melkidu time, the group realized something.

"Most of the warehouse goods are food used in the royal castle or users' items. If we keep searching like this, there'll be no end."

Eden added,

"Even if the money for persuasion is cheap, we can't keep bribing indefinitely. Little strokes fell great oaks, as they say."

They had investigated roughly twenty warehouses.

"We could earn points by selling items, but we'd have to leave the middle layer for that. They're useless here."

Iruki said,

"We only have points for about three more attempts. I want to keep around 7,000. Even if persuading the security captain costs 50 million, there might be some middle ground."

"Then let's try exactly three more times."

Turning around, Nade pointed to a small warehouse that immediately caught his eye.

"How about that one?"

"There are 2 guards? That's inefficient."

"It's a gamble now. We have to try something we haven't done. Follow me. I'll do the talking."

As they walked boldly forward, the two guards stuck their heads out and shouted fiercely.

"Halt! Owl! Give the password!"

"Uh, let's negotiate a bribe."

Taken aback by such a brazen attitude, the guards looked at each other with stunned expressions before lowering their spears.

"Fine. My personality is..."

After the bribery was complete, the guards gave them 10 minutes and left the warehouse door.

"Found it."

The moment he opened the door, Nade had a hunch.

"Royal castle supply materials."

Since they were used by those who managed the system, their grade was naturally the highest.

"If users get stronger items, they become uncontrollable. But more than these..."

Iruki pointed to a medium-sized box that had probably arrived tonight and remained unsealed.

"Don't you think this would be more interesting?"

"Agreed."

When they all gathered to examine the box lid, there was a sticker saying 'Subject to Censorship.'

'It's not an officially registered item.'

Prying off the nails and looking inside, they found various goods neatly wrapped in plastic.

What they obtained was...

"Look at this. Quick Recovery Pass Necklace. The description is written in some strange code, so I can't understand it."

"Let me see."

Sirone checked.

"It's a hidden code. This is an item that can pierce through Melkidu's physical barriers. It seems to be used when buildings are destroyed or there are problems with underground facilities. According to the description, it says bug fix for existing inability to penetrate groundwater, capability enhancement to pass through iron walls over 3 meters thick."

Eden said,

"Being subject to censorship probably means it goes through testing before being applied to the system. In other words... it's an item that even the administrators don't have yet."

Nade was already collecting them.

"How many should we take? 5?"

"6."

"Ah, right. There's Curtis too."

Iruki pushed Nade, who was holding an armful of jeweled necklaces, aside.

"Move over. Let me look."

What Iruki found was a security registration card.

"Security was a kind of option. With this, we become security too. Systematically speaking."

Everyone who understood Iruki's words lit up.

"Aha."

And 10 minutes later.

"What, you guys! I clearly said 10 minutes...! Huh?"

The two guards who had been shouting at Sirone's group blinked for a moment.

"Salute! All clear on patrol!"

Nade, wearing an officer's nameplate, cleared his throat and walked toward them.

"Ahem! Yes, good work. Nothing unusual?"

"No sir! Nothing!"

"You're working hard late at night."

"Not at all! Sacrificing for the kingdom is my calling!"

"Haha! Hearing you say that makes me proud too. Then please continue your good work. Well, let's go."

As Sirone's group followed with military precision, the guards raised their weapons and shouted.

"Safe travels, sir! Salute!"

After leaving the warehouse, Sirone's group giggled, and Nade turned around waving the registration card.

"Sorry."

The box was completely empty.
