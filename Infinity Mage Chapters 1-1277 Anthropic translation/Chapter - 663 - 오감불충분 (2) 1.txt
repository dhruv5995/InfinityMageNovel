[663] Insufficient Five Senses (2)

"Tch, stubborn as a mule."

Jane laughed as Rufist, seated at the table, grumbled.

"How about making an offer even now? He seemed quite disappointed."

Rufist had been the one who cursed the kingdom most harshly when he realized they had lost Shirone to the Ivory Tower.

"If he were the type to accept offers, I would have made one long ago."

The scene of Shirone tearing up his acceptance letter when the five prestigious magic schools gathered at the association still lingered in his mind.

"It's actually better this way. As long as other countries don't steal him away."

That was the only reason Rufist hadn't taken action.

Meanwhile, even after the evaluations of candidates 28 and 29 ended, Shirone couldn't call the next participant.

Rian and Aria were similarly mesmerized by the magical demonstration they had just witnessed.

"This is..."

Though Rian couldn't even finish his words, Shirone nodded as if he had heard them.

"That's the magic of a First-Class Grand Mage."

The situation where no trace remained despite power strong enough to shake the building revealed both his destructive force and delicate control simultaneously.

'Besides, Jane's magic was incredible too.'

Since it was a specialty evaluation, some magic had to be demonstrated directly on the examiners, and Shirone clearly realized what heights her mental magic had reached.

Aria said, "Let's move on to the next one for now. We still have 52 people left."

Coming to his senses, Shirone turned toward the door and said, "Next person, please come in."

Shortly after, the door opened and a bald man with a build as impressive as Rian's entered.

"Greetings! I'm candidate number 59, Maghardt!"

He was 43 years old, had trained in martial arts for 20 years, and was currently a veteran making his living as a mercenary in the Fighter's Guild.

He hadn't particularly stood out in the first evaluation, but his solid fundamentals and monstrous strength had impressed Shirone enough to pass him.

"Yes. I hope you get good results. Please show us your specialty."

Maghardt set down the enormous backpack from his shoulders and pulled out solid bricks from inside.

'A breaking demonstration.'

Usually, breaking demonstrations involved setting up supports for better shock transmission, but he stacked fifteen bricks in a neat pile.

Looking down arrogantly at the tower of bricks that reached his waist, Maghardt nodded and said, "The most powerful technique of Tiger Style martial arts - the Fierce Tiger Headbutt. I'll break through these bricks in one strike."

Breaking things - a boy's romance.

Setting aside his duties as an examiner for a moment, Shirone's eyes sparkled as he nodded.

"Huuuuuu!"

As Maghardt took a horse stance and circled his arms, not even the sound of breathing could be heard, and finally he thrust his lower jaw forward and let out a battle cry.

"Uracha-cha!"

Leaping high into the air, he dove down headfirst as if falling upside down, striking the tower of bricks with his forehead.

The sound of breaking stone rang out repeatedly as his face broke through the bricks all the way to the ground.

"Wow! They're all broken!"

Standing up from his seat, Shirone applauded Maghardt, who was buried in dust and appeared to be bowing.

"Amazing! But are you okay? Your head must hurt."

There was no response.

"Um... Mr. Maghardt?"

As he remained motionless with his forehead planted in the ground, Shirone's voice grew louder with growing anxiety.

"Mr. Maghardt, can you hear my voice?"

Then Maghardt's waist gave way as he collapsed to the ground, his limbs convulsing and bouncing.

"This is terrible! He must have lost consciousness!"

Aria jumped up and shouted toward the door.

"Master! Master! We have an emergency patient!"

A Silverling Guild member rushed into the clearing, hoisted Maghardt on his back, and ran outside.

The venue was cleared in an instant, but Shirone still stared with a dazed expression at the scene of them leaving.

"...What? What just happened?"

Rian clicked his tongue and said, "He was too nervous. His body was stiffer than usual, so the force was dispersed. He lost consciousness the moment he did the headbutt."

Shirone quietly sat back down and said, "Next person, please come in."

Despite the incident, most candidates who had passed the first evaluation showed satisfactory specialties.

'Hmm, this is ambiguous. I'll have to apply a pending judgment.'

Since it was difficult to establish clear standards, making premature judgments about pass or fail would be disadvantageous.

Number 73 was Arkman, the master of Silverling Guild, who demonstrated his specialty Fire Snake magic without holding back.

'That magic is certainly convenient.'

Though it was magic that greatly benefited from magical equipment like the Flame Robe and Fire Prison, this was real combat, and equipment could certainly be an advantage.

'I'm wearing Armand too.'

After confirming the flame serpent coiling and settling down, the three applauded, and Arkman gave an awkward bow.

Since it was an ability that had already been defeated in battle, demonstrating it was embarrassing, but from Shirone's perspective, it was difficult to find practitioners of Arkman's caliber.

'Let's tentatively put him in the pass category.'

After Arkman left, Yordic, the master of War Chariot Guild, entered as if taking the baton.

Unlike during the first evaluation, he was equipped with magical gear - large gloves with crystal spheres embedded in the palms like Armand.

"Number 74, Yordic."

Though he had the status of a candidate, his attitude of never fully bowing his head to anyone remained unchanged.

"Yes. Please show us your specialty."

Yordic introduced his equipment first.

"These are magical equipment called Ice Gloves. Combined with my freezing magic, I can do various things. For example..."

When Yordic extended his palm, the crystal sphere emitted a blue light and instantly froze the air.

"I can absorb energy."

Then when he clenched his fist, the ice rippled like a stream of water and transformed into a whip with sharp thorns.

"Or slice the throats of attacking fools like this."

As he swung his arm in a large arc, the ice whip whooshed past Shirone's eyes and snapped back.

'Ah, so the form isn't fixed.'

While ice-type magic excelled in sculpting ability, its weakness was poor fluidity.

However, while wearing the Ice Gloves, he could absorb energy in real-time, allowing him to wield even solid ice like a whip.

"Well... shall I leave it at this? The real techniques for killing people are difficult to show here."

Yordic raised the corner of his mouth coldly while expecting Shirone's reaction, but Shirone's gaze was already fixed on the documents.

"Thank you for your effort. Pass or fail results will be notified individually."

"..."

After standing awkwardly for a moment, Yordic clicked his tongue and turned around as Aria called the next person.

'Tch, kids these days.'

The next turn, number 75, was Evian, the master of Blood Rose Guild.

Setting aside her skills for the moment, her outfit clearly showed she had paid attention to other aspects.

"Hello, I'm candidate number 75, Evian."

Holding the hem of her skirt with her fingertips and spreading it left and right, she stepped one leg back and curtsied modestly.

"Yes, hello. You look pretty today."

"Oh my, do I really look that way? How strange, I just came out dressed as usual. Ho ho ho!"

As Evian's chest bounced up and down with her exaggerated laughter, Shirone returned to his original demeanor.

"Shall we get started then?"

Having achieved her intended effect of making a first impression, Evian also dropped her smile and demonstrated her specialty.

"Magnetic Control."

Evian's specialty was electrical magic, specifically the magnetic field category, and her skill at controlling metal was excellent.

She threw a black iron sphere called 'Dragon's Eye' which dissolved into iron powder in mid-air, revealing the form of a magnetic field around her.

"Ooh."

As Shirone made an interested expression while watching the iron powder flow like the Milky Way, she gained confidence and sculpted a rose from the iron powder, sending it toward Shirone.

The rose floating before his eyes was so detailed it could be mistaken for real except for its black color, and when he slowly tried to grasp it with his hand, it dissolved back into smoke and returned to Evian.

"That's wonderful."

"My specialty is sculpting, but I hope you won't underestimate its power. When I concentrate, I can overcome up to 200 kilograms of gravity."

That was enough force to move dozens of swords simultaneously.

'This magic would be useful. Let's put Evian in the pass category too.'

Rufist, Jane, Arkman, Yordic, Evian.

With this level of lineup from the beginning, he could say the framework was taking shape.

The numbers jumped significantly to candidate 121, Ethella's turn, and what she had prepared for evaluation was, like Maghardt, a breaking demonstration.

'Well, there's not much else with greater impact than this.'

Though she was skilled enough to battle Satan in heaven, preparing props for evaluation showed respect for the examiners.

"I will demonstrate a secret technique of Yin-Yang Wave Fist."

"Yes. Please go ahead."

Shirone showed courtesy to his school teacher, and Rian, still unsettled by the eeriness of the first evaluation, watched carefully.

What she pulled from her bag was an iron sphere the size of a human face, and when she dropped it from eye level to check its hardness, it embedded in the floor with a thud.

"Breaking... iron?"

As Aria made an incredulous expression, Ethella bent her waist and aimed her fist.

"Huuuuu."

After just a moment of deep breathing, Ethella's fist struck the iron sphere at tremendous speed.

THUDDDDDDDDDING!

Sounds unbelievable for a human fist rang out in succession, and as many waves as the number of sounds stormed through the interior of the iron sphere.

'Thunder Palm!'

Ethella spread her palm wide and pushed in the final wave.

Then the trembling iron sphere shattered into pieces as if an explosion had occurred inside.

"Woooooow!"

Shirone exclaimed in admiration at the impressive skill he always enjoyed seeing.

It was unbelievable that she had accomplished with the human body what even considerable magic couldn't destroy.

After crouching down to clean up the fragments, Ethella assumed her posture again and bowed politely.

"Please take good care of me."

As Ethella left the clearing with her usual gentle smile, Shirone turned to Rian.

"How about it? Pass?"

"Huh? Oh, of course."

It was skill beyond argument, and the reason Rian couldn't readily evaluate was due to his own issues.

During his knight training, only winning mattered, but thinking about how technically advanced today's candidates had become made him feel unsettled.

Whether aware of these feelings or not, Shirone called the next participant.

"Number 147, please come in."

Only after calling did Shirone realize and check the documents.

'Ah, it was this person.'

Wig the Gale.

The man with twin swords mounted in an X-shape behind his left shoulder entered with a broad grin.

"Hello. I'm number 147. People I know also call me Wig the Gale."

"Hmm."

Rian clamped his mouth shut and crossed his arms.

Wig had been sending provocative vibes since the first evaluation.

"Then please show us your specialty. Twin swordsmanship, I assume?"

"Well, honestly, weapons aren't important. I just fight with whatever comes to hand. What's really important is..."

Drawing both swords from behind his shoulder simultaneously, Wig closed one eye and aimed at Rian.

"Who you can defeat, don't you think?"

Without changing his expression, Rian asked, "So... who can you defeat?"

As expected, he was a character who knew no retreat, and Wig made his proposal as if he had been waiting for this.

"You, right there. I challenge you to a real sword duel, Knight of Maha."
