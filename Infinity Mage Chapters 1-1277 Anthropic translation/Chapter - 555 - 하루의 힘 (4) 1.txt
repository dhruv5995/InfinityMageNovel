[555] The Power of a Day (4)

Shirone's sequence formula finally approached the realm of enlightenment.

As it did, the vortex of light spread viciously, and the surrounding scenery became grotesquely distorted.

The texture of the vortex was nothing more than the movement of countless particles, as if dotted with points, but those watching could sense the flow through their brain's imagination.

'So what the hell is that thing anyway?'

As they approached the singularity, Miro's words became fewer.

The training hall was filled with currents of light that blazed as if on fire.

'Just a little more! Just a little more!'

As the experience accumulated day by day began to show signs of explosion, Shirone whipped his mind.

'I believe in the power of a day!'

The acceleration he could achieve because he had devoted his best effort to progress every moment.

What he would gain at the end of burning through the experience called failure would be joy so immense it would blow away all the pain he had endured so far.

'It's coming! It's coming!'

Far away, the realm of enlightenment was waiting for Shirone.

"Uooooh!"

Screamer's consecutive strikes hit the sandbag so fast they were invisible to the eye.

Once he got within range, the accurate, fast, and strong consecutive attacks that would leave opponents helpless were mastery achieved through countless repetitions.

'This ends it!'

When he struck with all his might, the wire holding the sandbag snapped with a clang.

As the sandbag flew a full 3 meters and crashed down with a thud, unable to control its heavy body, Pyroker's eyes widened.

"You...!"

He knew it was childish to show his feelings, but he couldn't stop the explosion of emotions that had been suppressed.

"Uaaaah!"

Screamer clenched both fists and spread his arms, his upper body muscles splitting grotesquely.

It was an intense pleasure he had never felt from any victory.

'It's complete!'

The moment Iruki's eyes, flashing with electricity, snapped open, the earthquake he had longed for so desperately finally began.

"I did it!"

As the bunker that had remained in Mercodyne's underground for so long exploded, the hall was in chaos.

The ground shook, all the dishes crashed to the floor, and the maids screamed and ran around clutching their heads.

"......"

Family head Albino, who had been leaning against the wall watching the scene calmly, turned his gaze to the second-floor stairs.

Iruki was coming down.

"Congratulations. You've finally destroyed the family's legacy."

Iruki shrugged nonchalantly, but couldn't hide the joy in his eyes.

"I'll apologize to our ancestors when I go to the afterlife later."

Iruki briefly spoke and left the mansion to prepare to return to school.

"Apologize..."

Albino muttered while watching his son's retreating figure.

"It would be quite the opposite."

"I can do it! Perfectly!"

Fire Strike spread out with Amy at the center.

The flames that burst forth like blooming flowers shot down all 58 targets without exception.

100 percent accuracy.

Amy's body trembled as she precisely extracted 58 sound waves from the overlapping explosive sounds rushing in.

But the moment of emotion was brief, and soon she stared into the air with sharp eyes.

'I will definitely graduate.'

Her red eyes blazed as she recalled the humiliation she had received last year.

The water in the pool prepared in the royal castle's annex was caught in two rapids, creating a bizarre whirlpool.

As Pony, submerged in the water, raised her water power to its limit, a water column shot up with a bang, spilling all the pool water outside.

"Kyaak!"

The maids waiting with spare clothes screamed shrilly and retreated.

The water that hit the walls on all sides flowed back along the floor, gradually raising the pool's water level.

'Success.'

Though Pony calmly closed her eyes, she was desperately holding back to avoid damaging royal dignity.

"Miss, congratulations! It's truly wonderful!"

Though it was probably flattery from maids who knew little about magic, since it wasn't authority named by others, a gentle smile appeared on her ice-cold face.

'The future belongs only to me.'

Dorothy, covered by her blanket, suddenly sat up and trembled.

After entrusting her mind to convulsions for a while, she immediately collapsed face-first into her pillow as if her strength had left her.

"Haaaaah..."

As she turned her head, her glasses were completely crooked, and her face looking at the floor was deeply satisfied.

Zing! Zing!

Her alter ego Hickory was dancing, rotating her neck and limb joints in different directions.

Day 4.

In the training hall where candles burned, Shirone was devoted to his sequence formula, going beyond even sleeping time.

Miro also waited persistently, like a midwife delivering a difficult birth.

Both were determined to finish it today.

'9,200 trillion! 9,400 trillion!'

The enlightenment of unity between self and object had already been achieved days ago, and all that remained was strengthening the Avatar's law.

And finally, even that came to an end.

Enlightenment.

Shock filled Shirone's eyes.

"Huk!"

Mental Transcendence.

Unity of self and object.

The heat haze rising from Shirone's body ascended and transformed into the form of a giant angel.

Archangel.

Temporal Destruction.

Miro opened her eyes wide and examined the avatar.

It somewhat resembled Ikael but was male with distinct features.

The avatar's body, which had been looking down at Miro briefly, rapidly collapsed and began to be absorbed into Shirone's body.

'What's this now?'

The avatar of Prajna was a phenomenon revealed through mental transcendence.

The stronger the avatar's power, the larger or clearer the aura would become.

"Huk! Huk!"

Shirone, breathing roughly with an expression of disbelief at what he had accomplished, suddenly raised his head.

"I did it! I really did it!"

'It didn't disappear. It's integration.'

Though the vicious vortex of light had subsided, a serene aura of light still swirled around Shirone's body.

When Shirone tried to approach Miro, light afterimages that seemed to trace his physical outline overlapped around his body.

"Wait."

Miro raised her hand to stop his movement.

"Why?"

"Don't you feel anything different? Like the scenery looks different?"

"No. I can't really feel anything like that."

Though Shirone said this, Miro clearly confirmed that light afterimages vibrated every time he turned his head.

'He can't feel it? Then indeed...'

Having finished her primary analysis, Miro pointed to the end of the training hall and gave instructions.

"Try walking over there."

As Shirone moved, the rebound of overlapping increased, and the afterimages extended far enough to separate from his body.

'Time is vibrating. Judging by the gap between the real body and afterimages, roughly 1 second before and after.'

Frustrated, Shirone asked as soon as he reached the wall.

"Why? Is there some problem?"

"There is. As you know, when you reach the realm of unity between self and object, the avatar's law affects the world's law. And your law..."

Miro found the clearest definition.

"Breaks the wall of time."

"What? The wall of time?"

"Let's check first. Try walking back to me."

As Shirone turned toward Miro, light afterimages vibrated in all directions.

Each afterimage was Shirone's past and the possibilities of the future he would reach.

"Stop."

When Shirone stopped walking, a gasp of admiration escaped Miro's lips.

As if he had returned to the past one second ago, he had stopped one step behind where she had seen him.

"Did you feel that just now? You just moved about half a step back from where I was watching."

"No, I didn't feel it. I just stopped."

"That's exactly it. It's neither teleportation nor time reversal. You've become able to perceive time much more fluidly than other people."

"I don't really understand what you mean."

Miro raised both hands as if catching a ball.

"Listen carefully from now on. All matter is trapped in time's mold. Humans can only feel 1 second per 1 second."

Shirone understood this much.

"But your avatar broke that. Like an explosion occurred inside, the mold's space has expanded."

"Uh, so that's... exactly what?"

"Simply put, you don't live 1 second per 1 second. One second of the past and one second of the future are both included in the present. In other words, you perceive 3 seconds of time in 1 second."

Miro approached Shirone.

"Let's prove it. From now on, I'll punch your chest. But don't block it in advance. Block it after you're hit."

Miro waited so Shirone couldn't time it, then threw her punch at an unexpected moment.

Shirone's face turned pale as he stepped back and grabbed her wrist.

"...How did this happen?"

"You blocked it after being hit, right?"

"Yes, I was definitely hit... I'm not sure. It feels like I just imagined being hit. I have the memory, but it doesn't feel real."

"That's exactly it. To conclude, I couldn't hit you. Because your past self erased the event of being hit."

Shirone released her wrist and asked.

"How is that possible?"

Miro drew a graph in the air as she spoke.

"Let's say the time coordinate when I struck your chest was 23 seconds. Normally, a person couldn't escape the event at 23 seconds. But you're living 22 seconds and 23 seconds simultaneously. You're also living 23 seconds and 24 seconds simultaneously."

Miro quietly told him not to dodge this time and placed her fist against Shirone's chest.

"Now, I struck at 23 seconds. And your avatar perceives 22, 23, and 24 seconds simultaneously. In other words, what's already a decided result for others is still not decided for you."

"Because 22 seconds is also the present for me."

"Right. Because everything from 22 to 24 seconds is entirely the present, the result at 23 seconds also becomes fluid."

Miro stepped back and said.

"Then let's try the opposite. You hit me."

Shirone took a deep breath and composed himself.

As his will to act disappeared, the light vibrations ceased and the angel avatar appeared above his head again.

'So that's what it was. The Archangel that destroys time.'

That was Temporal Destruction.

'Now!'

The moment Shirone's eyes flashed open, the angel form collapsed and was absorbed back into his body.

Then it immediately burst out as dozens of afterimages, taking positions to strike Miro.

'Probability of future events.'

She could only think this because each light had different brightness.

'The clearest one would have the highest probability.'

Thinking this, Miro ducked to avoid, but somehow Shirone's fist was already touching her cheek.

It was as expected, and Miro felt the trembling fist's touch as she looked up.

"Do you understand?"

"...Yes."

From Shirone's perspective, it was incredibly easy.

Miro had ducked, and he simply had to extend his fist toward where Miro's face was.

"What happens 1 second later for ordinary people becomes the same as a present event for you."

Miro straightened up and adjusted her clothes.

"Your avatar technique fundamentally deals with temporal energy. Because you perceive 3 seconds in 1 second, your actions can only appear as probabilities to ordinary people."

"That's the light afterimages you saw."

"Right. The light afterimages flowing along your body's boundaries show events that will happen within 3 seconds as probabilities. But since perceiving 3 seconds is natural for you, you can't see them."

Shirone listened with a blank expression.

Of course, it was his own unique ability manifesting, but it was still a singularity that transcended common sense.

"Now for the final test."

Miro slowly increased the distance.

"From now on, I'll attack you with my avatar. I'll control it, of course, but there might still be mental shock. If you can avoid that, you can say you've grasped the basics of avatar techniques."

The Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara avatar he had seen before starting training.

When all the candles in the training hall were extinguished, it moved at a speed that couldn't even be caught by the eye.

"Yes, I'll try."

Shirone, recalling that scene, focused his eyes.

In the realm of unity between self and object, light heat haze swirled and began forming the angel figure spreading light wings again.

Archangel and Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara.

Two avatars manifested by the two Prajna faced each other at ceiling height.
