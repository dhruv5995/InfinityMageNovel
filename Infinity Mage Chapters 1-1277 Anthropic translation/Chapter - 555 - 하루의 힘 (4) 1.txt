[555] The Power of a Day (4)

Shirone's sequence formula finally approached the Mirror stage.

The more it did, the more viciously the swirls of light spread, and the surrounding scenery became grotesquely distorted.

The texture of the swirls was nothing more than the movement of countless particles, as if dotted with points, but those watching could perceive the flow through their brain's imagination.

'So what the hell is that supposed to be?'

As they approached the singularity, Miro's words became fewer.

The currents of light filling the training hall were blazing as if on fire.

'Just a little more! Just a little more!'

As the experience accumulated day by day began to show signs of explosion, Shirone whipped his mind.

'I believe in the power of a day!'

The acceleration he could obtain because he had devoted his best effort to progress every moment.

What he would gain at the end of running by burning the experience points called failure would be joy so great it would blow away all the pain he had endured so far.

'It's coming! It's coming!'

Far away, the realm of the Mirror was waiting for Shirone.

"Uooooh!"

Screamer's rapid strikes hit the sandbag so fast they couldn't even be seen.

The precise, fast, and strong consecutive attacks that would leave opponents helpless once the distance was established were skills achieved through countless repetitions.

'This is the end!'

When he put all his strength into one strike, the wire holding the sandbag snapped with a clang.

As the sandbag that flew a full 3 meters couldn't support its heavy body and crashed down with a thud, Pirocker's eyes widened.

"You...!"

He knew that showing his feelings was childish, but even so, he couldn't stop the explosion of suppressed emotions.

"Uaaaaah!"

Screamer clenched both fists and spread his arms, his upper body muscles splitting grotesquely.

It was an intense pleasure he couldn't feel from any victory.

'It's complete!'

The moment Iruki's eyes, sparkling with electricity, snapped open, the earthquake he had longed and longed for finally began to occur.

"I did it!"

As the bunker that had been staying underground in Mercodain for so long exploded, the hall was in chaos.

The ground shook, causing all the dishes to spill onto the floor, and the maids screamed while running around frantically, clutching their heads.

"......"

Family head Albino, who had been leaning against the wall and calmly watching the scene, turned his gaze to the second-floor stairs.

Iruki was coming down.

"Congratulations. You've finally destroyed the family's legacy."

Iruki shrugged nonchalantly, but couldn't hide the joy in his eyes.

"I'll apologize to our ancestors when I go to the afterlife later."

Iruki briefly spoke and left the mansion to prepare to return to school.

"Apologize..."

Albino muttered while watching his son's retreating figure.

"It would be quite the opposite."

"I can do it! Perfectly!"

Fire Strike spread out with Amy at the center.

The flames that burst forth like blooming flowers shot down all 58 targets without exception.

100 percent accuracy.

Amy's body trembled as she precisely extracted 58 sound waves from the overlapping explosive sounds rushing in.

But the moment of emotion was brief, and soon she stared into the air with sharp eyes.

'I will definitely graduate.'

Her red eyes blazed as she recalled the humiliation she had received last year.

The water in the pool prepared in the royal castle's annex was caught in two rapids, creating a bizarre whirlpool.

As Pony, submerged in the water, pulled her water power to its limit, a water column shot up with a splash, and all the water in the pool was poured outside.

"Kyaak!"

The maids who had been waiting with spare clothes screamed shrilly and retreated.

The water that hit the walls on all sides flowed back along the floor, gradually raising the water level in the pool.

'Success.'

Though Pony calmly closed her eyes, she was desperately holding back to avoid damaging royal dignity.

"Miss, congratulations! You're truly wonderful!"

Though it was probably lip service from maids who didn't know much about magic, since it wasn't authority named by others, a gentle smile appeared on her ice-cold face.

'The future belongs only to me.'

Dorothy, covered by her blanket, suddenly sat up and trembled.

After entrusting her mind to convulsions for a while, she immediately collapsed as if her strength had left her, burying her face in the pillow.

"Haaaaah..."

As she turned her head, her glasses were completely crooked, and her face looking at the floor was deeply filled with satisfaction.

Zing! Zing!

Her alter ego Hickory was dancing, rotating her neck and limb joints separately.

Day 4.

In the training hall where candles were burning, Shirone was devoted to his sequence formula, going beyond even sleeping time.

Miro also waited persistently, like a midwife delivering a child through difficult labor.

Both were determined to finish it today.

'9,200 trillion! 9,400 trillion!'

He had already achieved the enlightenment of unity between self and object several days ago, and all that remained was to strengthen the Avatar's laws.

And finally, even that came to an end.

Mirror.

Shock filled Shirone's eyes.

"Huk!"

Mental Transcendence.

Unity between self and object.

The heat haze rising from Shirone's body ascended and transformed into the form of a giant angel.

Archangel.

Shirone's Buddha Image.

Miro opened her eyes wide and examined the avatar.

It looked somewhat like Ikael, but it was male with distinct features.

The avatar's body, which had been looking down at Miro for a moment, rapidly collapsed and began to be absorbed into Shirone's body.

'What's this now?'

The Avatar of Prajna was a phenomenon revealed through Mental Transcendence.

The stronger the avatar's power, the larger or clearer the aura would become.

"Huk! Huk!"

Shirone, who had been breathing roughly with an expression of disbelief at his own results, suddenly raised his head.

"I did it! I really did it!"

'It didn't disappear. It's integration.'

Though the vicious swirls of light had subsided, a serene aura of light was still swirling around Shirone's body.

When Shirone tried to approach Miro, afterimages of light that seemed to trace his physical form overlapped around Shirone's body.

"Wait."

Miro raised her hand to stop his movement.

"Why?"

"Don't you feel anything different? Like the scenery looks different?"

"No. I can't really feel anything like that."

Though Shirone said that, Miro clearly confirmed that afterimages of light vibrated every time he turned his head.

'He can't feel it? Then indeed...'

Having finished her primary analysis, Miro pointed to the end of the training hall and gave instructions.

"Try walking over there."

As Shirone moved, the backlash of overlapping increased, and the afterimages extended to the point of separating from his body.

'Time is vibrating. Based on the gap between reality and afterimage, roughly 1 second before and after.'

When Shirone reached the wall, feeling frustrated, he immediately asked.

"Why? Is there some problem?"

"There is. As you know, when you reach the state of unity between self and object, the Avatar's laws affect the world's laws. And your law..."

Miro found the clearest definition.

"Breaks the wall of time."

"What? The wall of time?"

"Let's check first. Try walking back to me."

As Shirone turned toward Miro, afterimages made of light vibrated in all directions.

Each afterimage was Shirone's past and the possibilities of the future he would reach.

"Stop."

When Shirone stopped walking, a gasp of admiration escaped from Miro's mouth.

As if he had returned to the past one second ago, he had stopped one step behind where she had visually confirmed.

"Did you just feel that? You just moved about half a step back from where I was watching."

"No, I didn't feel it. I just stopped."

"That's exactly it. It's neither teleportation nor time reversal. You've become able to perceive time much more fluidly than other people."

"I don't really understand what you mean."

Miro raised both hands as if catching a ball.

"Listen carefully from now on. All matter is trapped in time's mold. Humans also can only feel 1 second per second."

Shirone understood up to this point.

"But your avatar broke that. Like an explosion occurred inside, the mold's space has expanded."

"Uh, so that's... what exactly?"

"Simply put, you don't live 1 second per second. The past 1 second and future 1 second are both included in the present. In other words, you perceive 3 seconds of time in 1 second."

Miro approached Shirone.

"Let's prove it. From now on, I'm going to punch your chest with my fist. But don't block it in advance. Block it after being hit."

Miro waited so Shirone couldn't time it, then threw her punch at an unexpected moment.

Shirone's face turned pale as he stepped back and grabbed her wrist.

"...What happened?"

"You blocked it after being hit, right?"

"Yes, I was definitely hit... I'm not sure. It feels like I just imagined being hit. I have the memory, but it feels like it wasn't reality."

"That's exactly it. To conclude, I couldn't hit you. Because your past self erased the event of being hit."

Shirone released her wrist and asked.

"How is that possible?"

Miro drew a graph in the air and said.

"Let's say the time coordinate when I struck your chest was 23 seconds. Normally, a person couldn't escape the event at 23 seconds. But you're living 22 and 23 seconds simultaneously. You're also living 23 and 24 seconds simultaneously."

Miro quietly said not to dodge this time and placed her fist on Shirone's chest.

"Now, I struck at 23 seconds. And your avatar perceives 22, 23, and 24 seconds simultaneously. In other words, results that are already decided for others are not yet decided for you."

"Because 22 seconds is also the present for me."

"Right. Because everything from 22 to 24 seconds is all present, the result at 23 seconds also becomes fluid."

Miro stepped back and said.

"Then let's try the opposite. You try hitting me."

Shirone took a deep breath and calmed his mind.

As his will to act disappeared, the light vibrations ceased and the angel avatar appeared above his head again.

'So that's what it was. The Archangel that destroys time.'

That was precisely Shirone's Buddha Image.

'Now!'

The moment Shirone's eyes flashed open, the angel form collapsed and was absorbed back into his body.

Then it immediately burst out as dozens of afterimages, taking positions to strike Miro.

'Probabilities of events that will occur in the future.'

She had to think that way because each light afterimage had different brightness levels.

'The clearest one would have the highest probability.'

Thinking this, Miro ducked her upper body to evade, but Shirone's fist was already touching her cheek.

It was as expected, and Miro felt the trembling fist's touch as she raised her gaze.

"Do you understand?"

"...Yes."

From Shirone's perspective, it was all too easy.

Miro had ducked her upper body, and he simply had to extend his fist toward where Miro's face was.

"Events that will happen 1 second later for normal people become the same as present events for you."

Miro straightened her upper body and adjusted her clothes.

"Your avatar technique fundamentally handles time energy. Because you perceive 3 seconds in 1 second, your actions can only appear as probabilities to ordinary people."

"That's the light afterimages you saw."

"Right. The light afterimages flowing along your physical boundaries reveal events that will occur within 3 seconds as probabilities. But since perceiving 3 seconds is natural for you, you can't see them."

Shirone just listened with a dazed expression.

Of course, it was his own individuality manifesting, but it was still a singularity that transcended common sense.

"Now for the final test."

Miro slowly increased the distance.

"From now on, I'm going to attack you with my avatar. I'll control it, of course, but there might still be mental shock. If you can avoid that, I'd say you've grasped the basics of avatar techniques."

The Thousand-Armed Guanyin avatar he had seen before starting training.

When all the candles in the training hall were extinguished, it was so fast it couldn't even be caught by the eye.

"Yes, I'll try."

Recalling that scene, Shirone focused his eyes.

In the state of unity between self and object, the heat haze of light intertwined and began to form the angelic figure with wings of light again.

The Archangel and Thousand-Armed Guanyin.

Two avatars manifested by the two Prajna faced each other at ceiling height.
