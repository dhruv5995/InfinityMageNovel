[714] What is Gained? (3)

Imperial Palace Aganos.

Uorin visited the secret space called Floor 3.8 of Aganos, accompanied by Gando.

Opening the door, they entered a 20-pyeong room with a bed, where an archmage whose name alone would shock anyone lay sleeping.

The manager of Floor 3.8 walked over with a hunched back, waddling as he bowed to Uorin.

"You've arrived, Your Majesty."

"How is it?"

The manager checked the color of light appearing in the magic crystal orb and bowed respectfully again.

The crystal orb, which had been black initially, was gradually becoming clearer.

"Much faster than expected."

The archmage was currently repaying Sirone's debt through Fermi's depreciation contract.

A debt spanning 127 years was impossible for a human lifespan, but Uorin didn't doubt it.

If such a thing had already happened, then it was simply the way of the world.

'The key lies in Hexa.'

If Valhalla Action's debt was time rather than lifespan, then the time Hexa had to experience might differ from ordinary humans.

'Time Reversal, perhaps Andre, and perhaps...'

Uorin avoided hasty assumptions.

"When will the debt repayment be complete?"

"It's true that it's faster than expected, but we can't measure exactly how much it's being shortened."

"The relativity of time."

Even if the archmage paid the debt, its size would be as elastic as rubber depending on Sirone's growth rate.

This meant that the time Sirone experienced in Andre transcended the realm of ordinary people.

"Understood. Let's move to the next stage. Report immediately if there are any special changes."

"Without question. I'll monitor 24 hours a day without eating, sleeping, or drinking water."

"Of course you should."

As Uorin turned to leave the room, Gando followed behind and asked cautiously.

"Aren't you giving too much? When Valhalla Action's debt ends, Sirone will become even stronger. The synergy effect with Time Reversal will be tremendous."

Uorin smiled bitterly.

"Gando, do you know what the most powerful weapon in the world is? One that can't be defended against or avoided, and kills without fail the moment it strikes?"

"Does such a weapon exist?"

"It does."

Uorin turned around and raised her index finger.

"It's trust."

Gando already felt like he'd been cut.

"No matter how wary a child is, they'll entrust everything and fall asleep before their mother. That child never even thinks that their mother might strangle them or stab their heart with a knife tonight."

"..."

Uorin turned around again and walked on.

"Thus trust never fails, but that's precisely why it's difficult to build. If we can build it by repaying Valhalla Action's debt, it's cheaply bought."

"Sirone isn't an easy opponent either."

Uorin acknowledged this.

"That's fine for now. I'll manipulate the debt contract. If I leave room for even one second of debt to activate, I can throw Sirone into moratorium at the crucial moment."

Gando said worriedly.

"But could you really stab? At the crucial moment... Sirone's heart?"

Wasn't it precisely because one couldn't stab that trust held absolute power as a weapon?

"I can stab."

Uorin was resolute.

"Theraze receives trust from countless people but trusts no one. Gando, the same goes for you."

Gando felt a little sad, hoping the same would apply to Sirone.

"Don't you desire to sleep with Sirone?"

"Ahahaha!"

Uorin threw back her head and laughed.

"Love? Yes, through my long history, it's not like I've never loved once. But Gando."

When their eyes met, Gando felt he understood why she could never become human.

"You'll never know what kind of life Theraze has lived."

Maze Andre

World Number 1.

"Uga uga! Uga uga!"

The primitive planet's humans spoke to Sirone as if showing off war trophies, but it didn't register in his ears.

'Those eyes are definitely Theraze.'

Anyone who had seen Theraze directly would think the same.

"Si... ro..."

Mitochondrial Eve, realizing something, instinctively turned away from Sirone.

Being in the early stages of development, her brain hadn't reached what could be called the realm of cold reason.

However, the genes that would carve countless histories ahead held the underlying events from before the reset.

'Perhaps I might live a tremendous life.'

This was the first thing Mitochondrial Eve realized in this world - fate, the wheel of law.

'This kind of thing should just be passed by. If the future changes...'

The underlying events she possessed only went up to just before the third reset was implemented.

Therefore, the current event was the first, and Sirone was thinking the same thing.

'She's wary of getting entangled with me.'

Though it was probably emotion working at the instinctual level, the intention was clearly conveyed.

'Maybe she's not the first Theraze.'

If predecessors existed, there might be other daughters remaining besides the Mitochondrial Eve before his eyes.

'The problem is I can't be certain.'

For the early Mitochondrial Eve, who lacked even the reason to analyze underlying events, the primitive planet would be the height of chaos.

'Will this woman become Uorin later?'

Or would she enter history's tomb in this cave as one of countless Mitochondrial Eve's daughters?

If the woman before him was Uorin's direct line, history would save her even if left alone.

But if she received Sirone's rescue, the future Theraze might not become Uorin.

'If not Uorin...'

It wasn't impossible for world history to change, and the aftermath would affect Sirone too.

"Uga? Uga uga!"

Finally, the primitive planet humans' words came through.

"Quickly! We're giving her to you!"

He didn't feel like blaming those who had just taken their first steps as a species.

But Sirone wasn't from this world, and he couldn't pretend not to see unreasonable things.

"Uga! Uu uga!"

The humans, seemingly angry, stamped their feet and pushed Sirone, then crowded around Uorin.

'Theraze...'

Faced with a situation that would never be tolerated in a world with ethics, murderous intent flashed in Sirone's eyes.

"Stop it. This kind of thing..."

"Krak! Kraaaaak!"

Mitochondrial Eve shook her head violently.

'Go! Just go! Leave me alone!'

Though reason wasn't established, the impulse to send Sirone away surged like never before in her life.

Yet when Sirone didn't stop walking, for a moment piercing through animal instinct, reason's death cry burst forth.

"Gaaaaaaah!"

At the beast's roar torn from her entire body, Sirone clenched his teeth and turned to run out of the cave.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

It wasn't just a problem between two people - it was history's problem.

"Your Majesty, Valhalla Action's debt has fallen below 1 percent. You must act now."

Awakened by the message from Floor 3.8, Uorin didn't even think to change clothes before going down.

'Not a moment's delay allowed.'

Gando immediately followed behind, and when they arrived at the room, the crystal orb had turned nearly perfectly transparent.

'The debt settlement will end soon. It would take a few more days to set conditions. Now is the only opportunity.'

Valhalla Action's debt would be repaid, but they would hold onto the time of the archmage carrying the debt.

"We can't set it too long. Due to technical issues..."

"One second is enough."

If she could throw Sirone into moratorium for just one second at the moment Uorin desired, subduing him would be instantaneous.

"Then I'll receive Sirone's genes."

In the same forceful way countless men had imposed on Theraze in the name of love.

"It won't be a pleasant sight, but..."

"What am I doing right now?"

Under the night sky of World Number 1 with its giant moon, Sirone suddenly realized and changed direction.

"How stupid!"

His momentarily shaken heart returned to its place because the ripple effects on the world were too great.

"Of course I have to save her!"

Even if this world headed toward a different future, even if he remained trapped in moratorium forever...

'That's the right thing to do!'

Flying at maximum speed to reach the cave, he heard Mitochondrial Eve's screams.

'She'll die at this rate!'

Perhaps that was part of history, but Sirone hesitated no longer.

It's the heart.

"Stop it! Let her go!"

Feeling the hostility in his voice, the humans bared their sharp teeth and contorted their faces.

"This woman is ours!"

The moment words burst out, a streak of light flashed past them and crashed into the cave wall.

Kururururung!

At the roar echoing in the narrow space, the humans who recalled the day's encounter with the dragon were horrified.

"Waaaaah! Save us! We don't want to die!"

"Get out now!"

When he pointed outside the cave, they all clutched their heads and quickly passed by Sirone.

"Are you okay? Try to come to your senses."

When Sirone untied the wooden vines binding Mitochondrial Eve, she pounced on him like a wild beast.

"Kiyaaaa! Kiyaaaaaa!"

It was a roar of resentment and anger.

"Why! Why did you save me! Why did you come back!"

Tears flowed from her eyes as she pounded Sirone's chest, though with different meaning.

This might end her tremendous life.

'Death!'

Having regained a reversible method, she picked up a large stone nearby and tried to strike her head.

'I have to die!'

Theraze had achieved the mentality to end her life without hesitation through countless generations, but...

'I'm scared...'

For the early Mitochondrial Eve, death was too frightening and vast.

"It's okay. Don't worry about anything."

Mitochondrial Eve set down the stone with a thud and slowly turned her head as Sirone embraced her.

"I'll protect you. No one will hurt you."

Aside from the underlying events that were still only hazy, she felt for the first time like she had swallowed something warm.

"Kueeoeo! Kueeoeoeo!"

Mitochondrial Eve buried her face in Sirone's chest, howling like a beast and shedding sorrowful tears.

"Then we'll begin."

In a gathering of the finest mages, the Floor 3.8 manager finished preparations to manipulate Sirone's debt.

"Please give your orders."

Strangely, no answer came.

Since Uorin had been giving orders with cold eyes just moments before, Gando looked back puzzled.

"Your Majesty?"

Sensing something amiss, the question burst out naturally.

"What's wrong? Is there some problem?"

Uorin was staring somewhere without even blinking, like someone whose life had drained away.

"Ah, ahhh..."

At the sight of the Empress trembling her shoulders, everyone turned with tense expressions.

"Why... why such..."

Though Theraze's mind, having experienced countless lives, shouldn't be shaken even by gods.

"Why... why did you do that to me..."

The tremendous resonance that exploded from the primordial beginning pushed something long discarded back into the present.

'No! I don't love anyone!'

It's the heart.

"Th-that..."

Not just Gando, but everyone present widened their eyes in disbelief as they looked at Uorin.

"Your, Your Majesty is..."

It was the first time in their lives seeing Theraze's tears.
