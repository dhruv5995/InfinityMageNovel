[514] The Remaining Question (4)

Looking for Ankera.

Gando realized the meaning of those words.

Judging by Uorin's reaction, the point when Ra attempted the reset was now.

In other words, it meant that Satan had been annihilated somehow.

It also meant that Ra had failed to find the answer to the remaining question.

"Even if parts change, the whole remains perfect. But that whole wouldn't be the same whole as before the parts changed. However, Ankera can perfectly erase only one concept through the ability called erasure."

"How is that possible?"

"The balance of the whole."

Uorin placed both hands on her crossed knees and formed circles with her fingers.

"A new concept replaces the place where one concept is erased. Since it's been determined that way from the beginning, the whole doesn't change. Therefore, even though Ra has been erased, a new concept to replace him should already be embedded in this world. I will find it from now on."

That was erasure itself.

Gando thought for a moment, then harbored a new doubt.

"Then Guffin's erasure too..."

"Yes. A new concept would have been inserted where Guffin was erased."

Several possibilities flashed through Gando's mind.

"Anyway, that's not what's important. As Mitochondrial Eve, I have the clearest underlying events, but those with some degree of precognitive ability would also have felt intense déjà vu. We must find Ra before they figure it out."

Gando understood.

"What should I do?"

"Protect me."

"Me... you mean?"

Why him of all people?

Right outside the door, Pungzhang, said to be the world's strongest swordsmanship group, was waiting with murderous intent.

"From now on, I will search for Ankera's new incarnation through History Search. It's a complex and vast task that requires searching through all of human history."

Gando couldn't dare imagine the scale of that work.

"History Search is when Theraze becomes most powerless. If anything happens, take me to this place."

Uorin handed Gando a note.

After staring at the location for a long while, he put the paper in his mouth, swallowed it, and nodded.

'Is that how it is...'

The Empress of Kashan was one of the most important figures in the world.

She also had the ability to protect herself, but once History Search began, she would fall into a state of complete defenselessness.

Strength wasn't important for beheading a girl.

What should be prioritized most was trust.

That was why Gando, Miro's biological son, was assigned this mission.

'Besides, if I try any foolish tricks...'

Then Crouch would cut his throat.

In the end, it was a situation where the three groups of Pungzhang, Crouch, and Gando had to check each other while protecting the Empress.

"Understood. Please trust me with this."

Uorin wasn't particularly worried.

Theraze's insight into humans, possessing all records from the dawn of humanity, was as accurate as a machine.

Gando, who had already thrown his heart to Theraze, would absolutely never be able to betray her.

"Then let's begin."

When Gando heard Pungzhang closing the door behind him, Uorin took a deep breath and closed her eyes.

History Search.

A vast ocean of information, as if containing all of human history, rushed into her mind.

As various languages, cultures, and records were transmitted, Uorin's pupils trembled.

It felt like listening to murmuring sounds from the center of a cave where hundreds of thousands were trapped.

Gando positioned himself in a corner within the range of not leaving the carpet and watched Uorin.

Shortly after, her pupils emitted light as if burning with fire.

The light penetrated her eyelids even though her eyes were closed, making it look as if two gold coins were embedded there.

'This will take longer than expected.'

All events from Guffin's erasure period became underlying events, and events after the third reset were overlaid on top of them.

Among the nearly infinite events, only one would be different.

'I must find it.'

Uorin's brow furrowed fiercely as she increased her information processing speed.

'I must find it first.'

Underground Zion in Jebul.

From within the black sphere floating at the center of Heaven's munitions factory, kinetic energy with a power of 2.19 million kilobusters struck down in the form of a flash.

The moment the mass collided with the object, ultra-high heat was generated, burning the munitions factory itself without a trace, and tremendous gas exploded, expanding the internal cavity.

Rumble rumble rumble!

Jebul's ground swelled up in a hemispherical shape, then cracked like a turtle's shell, creating bright red lava in the crevices.

The next moment, the ground that had risen dozens of meters high collapsed downward, and shock waves spread out from the impact point.

The earth undulated like waves, and the structures on it collapsed with a crash.

Seismic waves spreading throughout Heaven swept through Arabot.

Until then, countless beings had been fighting faithful to their respective desires, but from a certain point, everyone stopped their actions and looked in one direction.

"Ah..."

Arabot's spire slowly tilted, then began to collapse as it snapped from the waist with a crack.

Both angels and humans knew what this meant.

The death of God.

In other words, the annihilation of myth.

The eternal and unique being that had reigned over humans, controlling and dominating their lives, had disappeared.

"You did it, Sirone."

Shiina looked at Arabot crumbling into dust.

The light from Area 73 had brought down Arabot.

Eventually, someday Sirone would be recorded in history as the one who killed God.

"Ankera..."

Uriel sheathed Ragnarok and looked back toward where Arabot had been.

The fact that Ra had been erased was conveyed through the empty sense of loss remaining in the mental body.

But conversely, like the intaglio of an engraving, the remaining concepts except Ra were proving that Ra had existed.

Guffin had been erased, but those who had intense memories of him still knew that Guffin had existed for this reason.

Anyway, Arabot had collapsed and Ra had disappeared.

Dominating humans, conquering humanity through the final war - all of it was ultimately Ankera's will.

For the members of Heaven, it was like losing their compass in the vast ocean.

'What should we do now?'

Uriel looked back at Ikael.

Now that Ra had disappeared, and now that they had lost the archangels and couldn't even operate Babel, she was the only one they could rely on.

"Uriel, withdraw your fighting spirit. Further battle is meaningless."

"But Archangel..."

"My words are Ankera's will."

Only then did Uriel sheath Ragnarok.

Ikael had used the phrase "Ankera's will."

In other words, it meant Ra's will hadn't ended, so for now it was best to quietly follow Ikael's commands.

"Listen well, humans."

Ikael, who had spread her wings of light and flown into the sky, vibrated her mental body and proclaimed to everyone.

Those nearby and those far away all lowered their weapons and looked up at the sky.

"The war is over. It is your victory."

There wasn't even murmuring, and the silence was chillingly clean.

"Ra has been annihilated and there are no means to control you."

When the reaction was lukewarm, Ikael drove the point home.

"From this moment, humans are free."

"Ah...!"

"Waaahhhhh!"

Cheers from rebel survivors erupted throughout Heaven.

Humans had brought down God.

Though it was a war they had entered with desperate resolve, the fear of the divine that humans inevitably harbored.

The joy of overcoming that and finally regaining freedom made them forget, even if briefly, the sadness of losing comrades.

"We won! We won!"

"Ahhhhh! Freedom! Humans will never surrender!"

Ikael calmly accepted the cheering sounds of people rushing in from all directions, then looked down to survey Sirone's group scattered throughout Heaven.

Unlike the rebels intoxicated with the joy of victory, none of them were smiling.

Then Miro approached and asked.

"What's your scheme?"

Ikael lowered her altitude and looked down at Miro.

"Scheme?"

"Why did you surrender? You could punish the humans right now, couldn't you?"

If Ankera had chosen erasure from the moment the world opened, the angels he had named shouldn't exist either.

But he chose erasure 23 seconds before Heaven's destruction, right after Satan's annihilation, and thanks to that, the angels were able to survive Ankera's erasure.

Ikael turned her gaze to the horizon where ruins spread.

"There's no particular special reason. Since the will that moved us has disappeared, war is meaningless."

"...What do you plan to do from now on?"

"Wait. Judgment comes after that."

Ikael turned her gaze back to Miro.

"Nothing is over yet. Humans have gained freedom, but that freedom turning into license will happen in an instant."

"Are you talking about Satan? But that's also a problem for humans to choose. Whether God or devil, humans judge only for humans."

Beings who could be altruistic because they were selfish.

That was humanity.

"Please take care of Sirone."

With those words, Ikael spread her wings and flew up into the sky.

Subsequently, all the angels remaining in Jebul transformed into flashes of light and followed her.

Looking up at the spectacle unfolding in broad daylight, Miro clicked her tongue and scratched her head, muttering.

"Sirone?"

She could see Flu carrying Sirone on his back, walking from where Arabot's spire had collapsed.

"Uncle."

Kang Nan stopped crying.

The war was over, and the person she loved had departed for hell.

Gaold's peaceful face rather tore at her heart.

How many screams was Gaold making in the deep hell where she couldn't even say it hurt?

"I'll never give up. Just like uncle."

When Kang Nan turned around, Gaold's body fully rested its weight on her back.

But with her broken, dangling wrist, she couldn't carry a man taller than herself.

"Shall I help?"

At the voice heard from beside her, Kang Nan's eyes flashed with murderous intent as she turned her head.

The survivors of Cage Team B were approaching.

"Stop. If you take one more step..."

Kang Nan's fighting spirit extended like thorns.

The mission Cage Team B had received from the Magic Association was Gaold's elimination, and now was the best time to achieve that goal.

Among everyone who had stopped, Tarvan, leading the team as temporary representative, stepped forward.

"Don't worry. We really came to help."

"Do you think I'd trust you guys?"

Indeed, Cage Team B, having lost team leader Rose and vice-captain Horkin, was consumed with anger.

Moreover, Tarvan had to send away even Roche, his childhood friend.

But for professional mages, there was something more important than personal feelings.

The information they had gathered scattered throughout Heaven would become world-class secrets.

If they could just return to the original world, the Kingdom of Tormia would gain tremendous advantage in intelligence warfare, and that was far more significant than eliminating Gaold.

"Of course, Gaold and you won't be able to set foot in the Association anymore. But we're also in a situation where we need some help."

Since Metagate's coordinates were twisted, the only way they could return was by borrowing Miro's ability.

Having been the former secretary-general of the Magic Association, Kang Nan knew this fact better than anyone and finally handed over Gaold.

But her gaze watching Tarvan carrying Gaold on his back as he walked away was not kind.

'Can't set foot in the Association? Not a chance. Gaold will definitely return.'

Kang Nan gritted her teeth waiting for that time.

"Is it over now?"

Armin, who had found Quan in the ruins, approached Miro and asked.

Shiina ran over to check Quan's condition.

He was unconscious but breathing faintly.

After confirming Shiina's sigh of relief, Miro looked to the opposite side.

Cage Team B was bringing Gaold and Kang Nan.

With them as the last, all the project team members had gathered.

Fortunately, there were no deaths, but all they had gained were wounds and hollow glory.

Miro looked at the sun setting beyond the horizon and said.

"No. This is just the beginning."

Thus Ankera was erased.

Leaving only one question in the world that still hadn't received an answer.
