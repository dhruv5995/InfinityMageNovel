Anger (4)

Heaven's 6th Heaven, Jebul.

In the Great Hall where Kariel resided, eight subjects including Smille were imprisoned.

Humans selected by special criteria.

The first giant was formed by the union of Gaians, and there was no adverse reaction to implementing the Art of Integration.

This was because they had all achieved such a unified mental system that individual distinction was impossible.

The giant born this way was Ymir, the King of Giants, called the ultimate of all living beings.

However, as the Ultima System weakened, the success rate of the Art of Integration began to drop significantly.

'If there's no meaning in distinguishing individuality, the strength of integration comes only from quantity.'

Conversely, if even one individual remains, complete dismantling of the Ultima System is impossible.

Currently, even creating a 6th-stage giant was difficult, and Anke issued a special order to Kariel.

Analyze the Ultima System.

To completely annihilate the Gaians, it was necessary to understand their mental system.

'Smille, was it?'

Kariel turned to look at the blue-haired woman trapped in the glass sphere of the Physics Machine.

'Just an ordinary human.'

She was accepting reality with a calm expression, showing no trace of fear.

'Not mentally strong, not particularly durable, nor does she understand fear.'

The Ultima System wasn't like that.

Among humans, there were strongmen who had pushed their traits to the extreme, but integration was impossible in such ways.

'Ultimately an ordinary human? No, even such definitions are just concepts that hinder the Ultima System.'

The moment something is defined, integrating the whole becomes impossible.

'Yes, this is something before definition.'

Therefore, there was no way to define Smille.

'Just accepting it.'

Kariel approached the glass sphere.

"Aren't you afraid?"

Obtaining the essence through Black Elixir would reveal all information about Smille, but the anxiety that perhaps nothing would be found compelled the question.

"You know what the Art of Integration is. Ten people, a hundred people, a thousand people. Do you think you could find yourself among them?"

Smille's eyes wavered momentarily, but like being swept by a great river, she soon regained her peaceful composure.

"Being devoured by wild beasts or dying and being buried in the ground are no different."

"...Is that so?"

No matter what in this world you point to, if you trace back endlessly, everything is one.

'I feel like I'm starting to understand something.'

There was no distinction between friend and foe.

The position from which one could contemplate all things as one would probably be outside the universe.

'Is that why they're trying to escape the photon realm?'

As Kariel activated the Physics Machine, the liquid of Black Elixir, called the Philosopher's Stone, began filling the glass sphere.

"Lord Kariel."

Then an angel flew into the Great Hall.

"The intruder currently disturbing Heaven has passed the 3rd Heaven and entered the 4th Heaven."

"What?"

Judging by the intruder's route, they were destroying barriers clockwise from the 1st Heaven, heading this way.

"They still haven't dealt with it?" The first report had clearly stated it was a level that could be stopped at the 2nd Heaven.

'No, but more than that... this is too fast?'

It had only been 20 minutes since receiving the report, so at this rate, they would arrive within 30 minutes.

As the black liquid wet her ankles, Smille stood up in the glass sphere, buying time.

It wasn't a struggle to live.

'Brother.'

The intruder who had broken through Heaven's walls could only be Ozent.

'You shouldn't come.'

She already knew her brother's heart.

'It's been so hard for you.'

Ozent was a timid person.

Someone who could only feel love was achieved by keeping someone close and constantly clinging to them.

'Because you think too much.'

Couldn't they have lived their whole lives knowing each other's hearts like that?

If they entrusted themselves to life's flow, couldn't some opportunity have led them to share passionate love?

Humans cannot do that.

'Please find your happiness now, brother. Don't drive yourself into misery anymore.'

Anguish.

The reason all humanity could not be integrated as one.

Kariel asked.

"What happened?"

At the reproachful tone, the angel hastily bowed their head.

"I apologize. It was my misjudgment."

Making a mistake in evaluating a mere human stirred the angel's shame.

But ultimately unable to deny the facts, they bit their lips and raised their head.

"The intruder reported 20 minutes ago and the current intruder are completely different humans."

Kariel tilted their head.

"The person changed?"

"That's..."

The angel, lost in thought for a moment, finally gave up and honestly confessed.

"I no longer know what it even is."

5th Heaven, Matei.

"Weaklings! The strongest giant brigade can't stop a single human!"

Under the giant corps commander's command, hundreds of giants brought their swords down toward Ozent.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

The spectacle of blades continuously falling to the ground felt like the sky was collapsing from Ozent's perspective.

The moment the massive blade was about to crush Ozent, the eyes of the sword-wielding giant widened.

"What kind of strength...!"

Despite force similar to a mountain falling, Ozent was holding firm while gripping the blade.

"Graaah!"

Hot steam shot straight out between Ozent's tightly clenched teeth.

Crack. Crack.

Bones twisted and muscles coiled like pretzels as he transformed into something inhuman.

'I'll cut!'

As Ozent deflected the giant's weapon and advanced, the faces of surrounding giants were cleanly sliced off.

"What the hell is that thing?"

It was obsession.

"Block it! Trample it!"

Watching the giants charging while shaking the ground, Ozent fell into thought.

'I'm already finished.'

Everything had become a complete mess.

'I'll disappear without a single moment of happiness.'

Even now, his anger continued growing endlessly, eventually devouring everything.

'I don't mind dying.'

He didn't feel wronged. Born as a human, he had lived twenty-something years, and there were countless lives shorter than that in the world.

'But Smille.'

She wouldn't understand.

'I don't know how to live as admirably as you.'

Calculating and analyzing, if this then that, if that then this, and so on.

'There's not even a right answer.'

A wretched life wandering crying through some unknown midpoint of existence.

'That's me.'

Life is beautiful?

'How nice, being happy.' Where should such a petty heart go when no one in the world could celebrate it?

"Aaaah!"

Anger hot as a furnace began twisting not just his mind but his body as well.

"Gwaek! Gwaek! Gwaek!"

Vomiting biological waste surging up from within, he swung his sword like a madman.

'I've reached it!'

At the peak of anger where he couldn't even think of himself as himself, what he realized was another realm.

"Gwaeeeek! Gwaeeeek!"

Someone save me.

'See that? This is humanity's strongest swordsmanship!'

No giant could match him.

'Does this look beautiful to you? Does this look cool?'

Struggling to live like an octopus thrown into a cauldron of boiling water was life's destiny.

'Still trying to live.'

Spilling waste and flailing desperately, yet never being able to escape outside—that was life's truth.

"I'm so angry I could go mad!"

The moment Ozent's sword swung, the barrier of the 6th Heaven's Jebul collapsed with a bang.

Angels flying from afar suddenly stopped mid-flight and widened their eyes.

"This is...!"

Ozent's body upon reaching the angels' domain had already collapsed from human form.

"Heek! Heek! Heek!"

The process of anger burning skin, twisting muscles, and melting bones was truly horrific.

'It's okay.'

His breath filled to his chin and biological waste continued pouring from his mouth.

'I have to swing my sword.'

That was all he knew how to do.

'Swing, swing, and swing again...'

Surely good days will come.

"Good things will happen even to someone like me!"

Not knowing where his limbs were, Ozent swung his sword at the attacking Mara.

The movement, transcending form with only the will to cut remaining, was horrible by human standards, but...

"It's not human."

To the angels' eyes, that desperate struggle looked strangely beautiful.

"It's life itself."

Ozent cried out tearfully.

"Give me Smille!"

"Kill him."

Thinking this was dangerous, the angels gave orders and hundreds of Mara charged.

Simultaneously, Ozent's body flared up like flames, severing all surrounding Mara.

"How can he do that?"

The laws of this world never grant infinite power to a single entity.

"Destroy his weapon!"

A giant triangular Mara snatched Ozent's sword, snapped it in half, and threw it away.

"Got it! No more..."

'I'll cut.'

As the Mara's face contorted, its body was precisely split in two.

Power focused in the angel's eyes.

'I see.'

Idea.

'He's becoming a sword.'

It was regrettable they hadn't stopped him just 30 minutes ago.

"We can't let him reach it. If he progresses further, we'll have to stake Heaven's very existence."

All the angels' holy light bodies transformed into halos.

"Launch total attack!"

Judicial light wheels adorned the sky as the angels' unique concepts concentrated on Ozent.

From the bombardment that shook Jebul itself, Ozent's roar pierced through the smoke and soared upward.

"Aaaaaaah!"

As the smoke cleared revealing Ozent's form, the angels watched with blank expressions.

"This can't be..."

"Grrrr."

The perfectly regenerated body resembled a human, but its essence was definitely not human.

A face distorted like a demon, muscles throughout his body grotesquely twisted.

"Can't it be destroyed?"

If it had already reached the conceptual realm, destruction would be impossible.

"No, it's just solid. As long as it has a physical body, it can't reach the Idea."

"Then what is that?"

"A Yaksha."

The strongest Yaksha in history.

"Smilleeeeee!"

The moment Ozent's roar erupted, the angels blocking his path were split in half.

Kwaaaaang!

As Mach's law took effect, a huge hole was punched through the Great Hall's wall and Ozent entered.

"So you've finally come."

Kariel, who had been watching from above, greeted him with a displeased expression.

"Smille."

The moment he saw Smille submerged in the black liquid, Ozent's muscles tightened even harder.

Though he didn't outwardly show anger, with each step he took, the scenery shook.

"Foolish one."

Even after becoming an existence comparable to angels, to commit suicide just to find one woman.

"I'll praise you for coming this far. But what you desire, you can never obtain."

That was human life.

"Give me Smille."

Ozent had abandoned being human.

"Judicial Light Wheel."

As Kariel's signature Simulacrum concentrated, all electronic devices in the Great Hall flickered.

'The stronger it gets, the stronger it becomes, and the stronger it becomes, the endlessly stronger it gets—the cannon of matter.'

A muzzle was born from a concept approaching the theory of a perpetual motion machine, unreachable by humans.

"This is sufficient to destroy you."

That was probably true, but Ozent didn't care and raised both arms as if gripping a sword.

"I'll cut."

The hardest sphere was fired from the matter cannon.
