[653] The Air of Life (2)

"The end?"

When Sirone blinked and asked, Austin held out the note again.

"What is this?"

"It's a rough map of the waterway beneath Mr. Brooks' mansion. Estera entrusted me with escorting you, but it seems I won't be able to leave this place."

Most of the horses were already dead, and after the bombardment that had wiped out an entire cliff, even the surviving horses had fled.

Sirone examined the map.

While not as detailed as architectural blueprints, judging by the route, anyone going in blind would definitely get lost.

"You'll probably find out, but our guild handles all correspondence to Mr. Brooks. I don't have much advice for someone like you, but remember this: a commission means following the client's conditions completely. Don't concern yourself with anything other than delivering the letter. This map should help. When you reach the end of the waterway, Mr. Brooks' subordinate will guide you."

Sirone looked up and asked.

"What will you do, Mr. Austin?"

"I need to clean up here. I'll collect your spoils of war for you. Of course, 10 percent will be my commission."

He hadn't particularly thought about collecting spoils, but it would be foolish to refuse compensation when offered.

"Yes. Then I'll leave it to you."

Since he'd learned that numerous organizations were targeting Armand, Sirone had no intention of taking the established mountain path, so he readily accepted.

"It'll take time to clean up and follow. This is a request, but please make sure to stop by the Silverling headquarters after completing the commission."

Guilds were sensitive to information, and especially with an incident like this, rumors would spread across the nation like wildfire.

By the time Sirone reached the capital, countless guilds would be trying to recruit him.

Austin's reason for giving up the escort was a veteran's judgment that if he couldn't do the job himself, it was better to at least collect the spoils.

"Don't worry. I understand the importance of trust."

Austin smiled bitterly.

'That's exactly why I'm more anxious.'

Sirone knew how strong he was, but from Austin's perspective, that was just a measure of pure skill - he was still a rookie who didn't know what he could accomplish with it.

'Trust...'

In this business, trust was really just a form of insurance for the weak.

In the guild world where skill was everything, Sirone was already someone who didn't even need to invoke trust.

"You'll need to move quickly to enter the capital before sunset. Get going."

"Yes. Take care, Mr. Austin."

"Oh, and."

Just as Sirone and Rian were about to enter the mountains, Austin called out.

"When you reach the capital, it would be wise to investigate Mr. Brooks somewhat before completing the commission."

It was just a matter of delivering a letter, but it was a veteran's excessive caution.

With just the minor variable of Sirone taking on a commission anyone could handle, this world could easily turn into complete chaos.

After a moment of thought, Sirone nodded with an understanding smile.

"Yes. Don't worry."

'Well, who am I to worry about?'

As Sirone and Rian entered the mountains, Austin picked up a longsword and began beheading the bandit leaders.

Third Reset, Great Purification.

Sirone's Five Bandit Groups Annihilation Incident concluded.

With Armand's power, Sirone's speed running through the mountain paths was as agile as a wild beast, and he crossed an entire mountain in 20 minutes.

When they could see the outer walls of the distant capital and the royal castle built near the center, Rian suggested.

"Sirone, let's wash up before going in."

There was nothing good about walking around smelling of blood in a place at the forefront of civilization.

"Shall we?"

Sirone surveyed the mountainside with Fly magic and arrived with Rian at a place with a small lake.

Was this fate, or the result of causality?

La Enemie was there.

Sitting on a rock by the lakeside with one leg dangling down, he was a handsome man with the characteristic dark skin of Middle Easterners and distinct features.

His eyes seemed to contain everything or nothing at all, and his lips pressed in a straight line were subtle enough to be interpreted as either joy or sorrow.

"It's cold, will you be alright?"

Sirone asked as he passed the rock where Ra was sitting.

"This much cold is nothing. Come to think of it, you don't really need to wash, do you? You don't even have blood on you."

"No, I still want to wash. My head feels complicated after fighting."

Cold water friction was the best for clearing distracting thoughts.

When Sirone transformed Armand into sword form and threw it on the ground, Ra turned his gaze there and tilted his head.

Meanwhile, the two who had quickly stripped off their clothes jumped into the lake with a splash.

"Brrrrr. Cold, so cold."

While Sirone hugged his arms and shivered, Rian dove deep underwater and burst up.

"Puha! Refreshing."

Sirone stared intently at Rian washing his face with splashing sounds.

It must be the composure reached after countless battles, but the Rian he knew wasn't a heartless killer.

"Rian, how do you get through it?"

The hands that were washing his face stopped abruptly.

"I've never gotten through it. I just... don't think about anything."

"Don't think about anything?"

"Because there's no right answer. Whether they're evil or good, once I draw my sword, I decided not to hesitate. I just decide that way."

Rian submerged his body in the lake.

"Sirone, there's no such thing as a situation where it's okay to kill. The opposite situation is the same. It's just like deciding whether or not to drink a glass of water. What's important is responsibility. I decided to bear it, so I don't think about it."

Ra, who had been listening, nodded.

"Responsibility for life."

Rian looked down, cupping water in his hands.

"Someone born with one life erases several other lives. It's incredibly unfair. Whatever kind of people they were, we can't deny that our actions broke the balance."

Rian looked back at Sirone.

"So Sirone, let's mourn. For life itself."

And so they endlessly bear the burden.

"Yes."

While Sirone and Rian closed their eyes in silent prayer, the winter wind blew fiercely.

The moment Ra, who had been lost in thought while looking at the sky, smiled.

'What?'

Sirone's eyes snapped open.

'I definitely felt like someone was there.'

Even activating Elysion caught nothing.

What humans call the world is probably just the sum of five senses at most.

But just now, Sirone felt as if a sensory organ that perceived the world in a completely new way had been installed and then disappeared.

"What's wrong, Sirone? You don't look good."

"No, it's nothing. Let's go."

Sirone dismissed thoughts of what wasn't there and came ashore to change clothes.

Ra, who had been watching from just one meter away, slowly turned his body to clear the path as Sirone approached.

"I hope we arrive before the rumors spread."

By the time they reached Bashka, the sun was setting.

Before joining the relatively short line, Sirone took out the letter he'd received from Estera.

"I should probably know what's in it."

He'd felt it when first receiving the commission, but Austin's meaningful advice bothered him.

"But didn't they say it was in code?"

"I'll have to decode it."

Personally devised codes were actually harder to decode because they weren't professional, but he could grasp the general content through the Ultima System.

"Can you accept any information comprehensively?"

"Yeah. It's like a language before language. Quite convenient."

It was thanks to decoding the true meaning of the bird song flute with the Ultima System that he'd seen through Red Blade bandit leader Marie's scheme.

When Sirone put the letter back in the envelope and tucked it in his chest, Rian asked.

"What did it say? Is it dangerous content?"

"No, nothing like that. Just personal matters."

Since Rian wasn't the type to be interested in others' private affairs, he didn't ask further.

Even though it was just the two of them traveling, being a mage and a noble allowed them to pass through the city gates easily, and Sirone gathered information about Brooks as Austin had advised.

After visiting several shops, he finally heard something at a weapon store.

"Mr. Brooks? Why are you looking for him? Are you mercenaries?"

"No, I'm a mage."

"Ah, Silverling Guild member."

The shop owner nodded as if he had an idea.

"Mr. Brooks is a mercenary broker."

According to the owner, he was a capable businessman with seven large organizations under formal contract with him.

"In Tormia, there's probably no mercenary who hasn't gone through Mr. Brooks. But I'm not sure if he's home today. He's an incredibly busy man."

'A mercenary broker...'

This was exactly what Austin had been worried about.

If he was a businessman working on the front lines of battlefields, tight security at his mansion was natural.

Based on the letter's contents decoded through the Ultima System, the skill to infiltrate without being detected by anyone was essential.

'Going through the waterway should be fine.'

The two who left the shop arrived at Brooks' mansion.

Like other nobles' houses, it occupied a large area, but differed in being fortified.

Guards in plain clothes stood armed at the entrance, and torch-bearing figures could be seen moving around the garden beyond the arch.

"They're all skilled individuals."

Just from the overall aura they gave off, they were incomparable to the bandit groups.

"...We should definitely go through the waterway, right?"

Following the map, they arrived at a water pipe 200 meters away from the mansion.

Taking advantage of a moment when no one was passing by, they opened the cover and descended, and Rian detected a familiar smell among the foul odors.

"Sirone, I smell rotting corpses."

Having corpses left in the city sewers was disturbing, but there was no need to be suspicious about something that had already happened.

"Yeah. We can't let our guard down."

The closer they got to Brooks' mansion, the stronger the smell became, until they finally discovered a corpse that had been abandoned only a few days ago.

"What is this? It's not human, is it?"

The corpse of what appeared to be a demi-human with pale pink skin lay abandoned, though the exact species was unknown.

"There are signs of torture."

"No, it's not torture."

The bodily mutilation was too severe to be for the purpose of inflicting pain.

"Let's just... do what we came to do."

Austin's words about not concerning themselves with anything other than the commission came to mind.

After passing through the maze-like complex waterway, they came to stairs that were clearly artificially modified.

The top of the stairs was blocked by iron bars, and on the sewer side, a man sat with his arms crossed on a chair.

Rian stopped walking without either of them saying anything first.

'What is this man...?'

The man had long hair like a woman hanging down on both sides, covering his face, and no distinctive characteristics could be found in him.

It felt like a corpse sitting there.

"Sniff sniff. Sniff sniff."

The man who had been quiet as death made sniffing sounds, then slowly raised his head.

Rian stepped forward to block the way, gripping the handle of his great sword.

'This bastard is incredibly strong.'

That's what made it even stranger.

If a skilled fighter of this level was guarding this place, shouldn't Austin have at least mentioned his name?

The man, who had been looking back and forth between the two with murky eyes like a stray dog, fixed his gaze on Sirone.

"You... met Ra."

"What?"

The man who slowly rose from his chair now held short blades like kitchen knives in both hands.

"Where is he?"

The man's name was Shagal.

The fact that he was a serial killer designated as one of the world's top 100 dangerous individuals was something even his employer Brooks didn't know.
