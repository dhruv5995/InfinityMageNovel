Fanaticism (4)

At Blitz's proposal, the eleven apostles listening from behind offered no objections.

Whether proving their resolve to die or fighting all twelve apostles - both seemed reasonable to them.

'They'll attack me one by one in order.'

Miro, on the other hand, felt annoyed. She wouldn't take the hits barehanded, but there would be no retaliation once her opponent attacked.

'If I refuse... then it's real combat. A head-on clash with all twelve apostles.'

'I'd prefer the latter if I had my way.'

Regardless of victory or defeat, when would she get another chance to experience such combat as a single mage?

'But I need to get to the Central Continent right now. This isn't the time for pride.'

Having made her decision, Miro raised both hands.

"Fine, hit me cleanly. I'll take it."

Zulu approached.

"Miro."

"Stay back. You know this. They're not opponents we can provoke by carelessly breaking the rules."

Since it was true, Zulu abandoned his argument and shifted to preparing for any contingency.

'The Twelve Apostles. Those who once faced archangels. At minimum, I should create an escape route...'

Though they had flown long distance on Kydra, he had enough mental power left to cast Force Merry once.

Whether it would work on the Twelve Apostles was unknown, but...

"What are you doing? You were singing Shirone's praises, did you already learn philanthropy? Come in."

Blitz looked back.

"Who wants to go first?"

"I'll do it."

It was a woman who had shaved half her red hair and wore three piercings on her left lip.

She wore leather tights that revealed her voluptuous figure, with a long zipper visible along her body's centerline.

Miro's eyes fixed on her.

"Probably..."

Fire Dragon Infercus.

The dragon who had been the model for the final tenth stage of Shirone's graduation exam.

How many spectators back then had cursed the developer who designed Infercus as a pervert?

'Not a pervert. Rather merciful, even.'

Though she had transformed into human form, the aura of facing her in person was at a level no simulation could replicate.

'That monster is going to hit me?'

Infercus, who had jumped down below the rocks, suddenly stopped walking and looked back.

"No complaints about me going first, right?"

Light Dragon Phaeton grumbled.

"What if there are complaints? You'll throw another fit if you're not first in order, won't you?"

Infercus resumed walking.

"That's why I asked. Better to do it now and get it over with than later."

Approaching Miro, she said:

"Let's make this quick. We're both busy."

As Miro's lips curved upward, her cheeks trembled, and the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara incarnation technique unfolded.

The image of Avalokiteshvara soaring to the very top of the sky made all twelve apostles look up.

Being masters of combat, what they all realized was...

'That would definitely be troublesome to deal with.'

Poison Dragon Poine spoke in an elderly woman's gentle voice:

"When fighting an unknown opponent, you usually start with intuition. Either opening with what you do best, or targeting what seems like the opponent's weak point. But that Avalokiteshvara..."

Poine chuckled with apparent delight.

"Makes it impossible to even think of such things."

There were no blind spots.

No matter what criteria you applied, it was perfect in every direction, making you not even want to attack first.

Zulu muttered:

"Celestial Projection."

The vision of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara looking down upon all creation from the top of the universe.

"Anyway..."

Infercus raised her fist before her eyes.

"I just have to do it, right?"

As she spread her fingers, massive flames writhed like dragons, and scorching heat that could cook skin swept in all directions.

Miro took a deep breath.

"It's fine. It's not breath."

Though there were no set rules, Infercus apparently had no intention of releasing her transformation.

"Here I go."

Manipulating a fireball burning like the sun at the top of the sky with her palm, Infercus took a step forward.

"Graaah!"

Miro's nose bridge wrinkled severely, and as if the world had flipped upside down, a pillar of fire struck down from the sky.

30 minutes later.

Where all twelve apostles had departed was no longer a rocky terrain.

With soil layers that had accumulated for tens of thousands of years now exposed, Kang Nan and Zulu flew over.

"Miro!"

The two who arrived were speechless.

Miro knelt on one knee, covering her face with both arms while trembling all over.

Her arms, exposed where her sleeves had burned away, were covered in blood, and one foot was buried deep in the ground.

"She's alive."

Having watched every attack the Twelve Apostles delivered while biting her lips bloody, Kang Nan was thrilled by the current result.

'She endured it. She actually endured it.'

Honestly, she was a woman Kang Nan didn't like, but at times like this, she felt awe as a human being.

"Miss Miro."

Using honorifics for the first time in a while as she approached her.

"AAAHHH!"

Miro bolted upright and screamed.

"Those damn lizard bastards! I'll kill them all!"

As Miro pulled her buried foot free and kicked off the ground to run, Kang Nan wrapped her arms around her waist.

"Endure it! Endure!"

"Let go! I can't live after getting beaten up like this! I'm going to pay them back the same way!"

As Miro fell forward, through the weight pressing on her, Kang Nan could tell.

She was no longer in any condition to fight.

'Well, she could only take hits without being able to do anything.'

Observing Miro without showing it, she saw tears welling up in her eyes.

"Huu, damn. I'm really frustrated."

The reason the great Miro endured to the end despite being frustrated enough to cry was... ultimately humanity.

'So she's extremely good.'

Until now, Kang Nan had resented Miro for not understanding Gaold's heart, but now suddenly...

'Because she's this kind of woman.'

She wondered if that's why Gaold tried to help her while enduring that terrible pain.

Kang Nan spoke quietly:

"Let's go to the Central Continent."

"...So that's what happened."

Iruki, who had been listening to Miro's story in a daze, finally came to his senses and spoke:

"So you're late because you had to take hits from the Twelve Apostles?"

"Yeah. I tried to come quickly, but there wasn't a part of my body that didn't ache. I must be getting old too."

Miro, who had been acting like she was in pain, straightened her expression.

"Anyway, I heard the story. Elemental bombs. Definitely like Shirone's friend. You've thought up a truly cute strategy."

A shadow fell over Iruki's face.

"If Shirone knew, he would have been angry."

Miro didn't deny it.

"So do you regret your current choice?"

"No. I'll do it. I've already made my resolve."

Miro nodded.

"Good. After all, it's the only means to defeat evil, right? With the world war being fought, humanity's strength has become extremely weak. Let's bet on this. I'll help too."

The reason she could speak so easily of such terrible tragedy was because she herself was included among those sacrifices.

"Speaking of which, there's something suspicious."

Iruki pointed to the battlefield map.

"With Merey here, information absolutely won't leak. The Mu Dragon's logs are also only transmitted to Shirone. Until then, they're dormant, so no one could access them."

"Hmm. And?"

"It's going according to strategy. But how should I put it... resistance? There's that kind of reaction."

Iruki gripped his index finger tightly with his other hand.

"Like feeling the pulse of blood vessels, something is throbbing inside the enemies."

"You mean they've caught on?"

"It's not that severe, which is what's unsettling. Havitz has two paths. Going straight, bypassing Tormia. Or detouring to hit Bashka. Going straight is convenient, and detouring offers the toy called Bashka. I think with just a slight shock, Hell's army should turn toward Bashka. But the deflection feels smaller than expected."

"Hmm. So it's subtle? When you give them shock, resistance occurs, but it doesn't seem like they're refusing to go to Bashka either?"

"Yes. When viewing the army as one organism, the current emotion is closer to conflict. There might be internal disagreement, or perhaps they've intuited something but only a few know about it."

"Then now is the timing. The more the opponent suspects, the harder the lure becomes."

Iruki was grateful that Miro was someone who didn't need explanations.

"Yes. Here."

The baton pointed to the north of the flower field.

"Please create a shock wave here. We need to deflect them at least 11 degrees."

Miro chuckled.

"That's a metaphor, right?"

"Yes."

It wasn't a strategy that could be explained with mere angles.

"Intuitive, I like it. Understood. With me, Zulu, and Kang Nan, even more than 11 degrees should be possible."

Miro stood up from her seat.

"Well then, work hard."

Watching Miro's back, Iruki asked:

"Why?"

Miro turned around, but her next words only came after some more time had passed.

"You don't say anything, do you?"

"I know you hate evil. But good people will die too. Why? Because there's no other way? Because you'll die too?"

"You'd want to grasp at straws."

Iruki's eyes wavered.

"You'd want to hear something close to the right answer. Even if it's the words of a madman. No, you'd rather hear plenty of criticism."

Miro walked as if taking a stroll.

"But no one speaks to you, and all that surrounds you is the silence of stillness."

Iruki's head slowly lowered.

"And that's my answer too."

When Iruki raised his face again, Miro was looking at him with pitying eyes.

"I was the same. When the Council of Twenty convened, most people remained silent."

Only Gaold had shouted endlessly.

"It was heartbreaking and frustrating. Humans seemed like monsters. But after being at the dimensional wall for 20 years, I suddenly thought this: perhaps humanity was quiet for the first time then."

Silence.

"I hate to admit it, but there are problems that can't be answered. Believing we can find solutions to all problems is human arrogance. Back then, humanity's intelligence was pale with shock. Before a question with no answer."

Miro smiled as if letting go of past sadness.

"There was nothing to resent or be angry about from the beginning. If I had rejected the Council's decision, things would have flowed that way too. Would humanity have perished then? It's unknowable. It's just the past that's already gone."

Miro kissed the top of Iruki's head.

"Right now, you're standing alone in an unknown world that no one has ever set foot in before. It must be painful, but you don't need to be afraid. Wherever you head will become a path, and people will gather along that path to open a new world. Therefore, I too, as one human being..."

Stepping backward, Miro kissed her index and middle fingers and held them out to Iruki.

"Remain silent about your choice."

Iruki's fists naturally clenched with strength.

"Thank you."

What a great blessing it was for him that someone who had experienced the unknown world before existed in this world.

"Remember. Right now, you are the master of the world."

The door closed, and Iruki calmly shut his eyes.

The silence Miro spoke of didn't mean support, opposition, or maintaining neutrality.

'The right to choose that belongs only to me.'

Whatever he chose would be the first, and from there a new future would be born.

"Whew."

As his overheated brain cooled for a moment, Iruki was able to get about three minutes of sleep for the first time in a while.
