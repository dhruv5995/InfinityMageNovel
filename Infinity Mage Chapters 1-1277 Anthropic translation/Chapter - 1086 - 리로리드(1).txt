It was a shock so great that all the users fighting in the Solar War came to a complete stop.

"The Operator has..."

Sirone's hand, which had pierced through her solar plexus, was protruding out of her back.

An undoubtedly fatal wound.

"Urgh."

As he pulled his arm out, electricity coursed through the Operator's body as she staggered forward.

The moment she gritted her teeth and raised her head, her mech exploded with a bang.

"Death confirmed."

Though it was the same effect as any other user's death, somehow it seemed more brilliant.

Faced with an unprecedented situation in High Gear's history, the users even felt fear.

What should they do now?

When no one could provide direction, Sirone turned to look at the Eastern Kingdom and shouted.

"Come on, let's go!"

As if drawn by a magnet to that voice, the Eastern Kingdom's users burst into cheers.

"We defeated the Operator! She's not invincible! The era of the Eastern Kingdom begins now!"

As the Eastern Kingdom's soldiers activated their turbos, the tense front line was pushed back 300 meters in an instant.

Volga's son smiled bitterly.

'Momentum, literally.'

With their excitement at its peak, they were dying to fight right now.

A communication came to Aegis.

Should we control them? If they push too recklessly, there might be delays later.

Leave them be. We can't control this anyway.

They had dealt a defeat to High Gear's strongest mech.

Conversely, only Yahweh2 could have created this level of momentum. Lure the Eastern Kingdom's forces to the key strategic points. Just defending there would be profitable.

Understood.

Fermi looked at the Little Witch.

"Will you continue?"

She, who had been pressing with terrifying killing intent until just moments ago, seemed to have lost her will to fight.

"Defeating the Operator in a duel - that condition has been cleared. Does Yahweh2 have anything more left?"

"There is."

Sirone wouldn't stop.

"You know what kind of person he is."

If it were just about producing results, he wouldn't have left the Operator any room.

"He won't give up until he's satisfied himself. So we have no choice but to continue."

"Excellent after-sales service. As expected of a major corporation."

"...The customer is difficult, you know."

From the Golden Ring's perspective, Sirone was the most unreasonable customer of all.

"Haha, but I still want to catch him."

Without answering that, Fermi turned on his booster and flew up.

"Let's make this interesting. The Eastern Kingdom will win."

As he headed toward the Eastern Kingdom's base, the Little Witch also turned toward the Solar Palace.

"Hmm."

She was curious about the Operator's face.

Operations Meeting Room.

The Operator's death was shocking not only to the users but also to the operators.

"...She lost, didn't she?"

Messages that had arrived individually to the operators burst out one after another through the shared channel.

"Whoa! You startled me. What is it, what's happening?"

The Smile Mark said.

"The forum is overloaded. It seems users are posting videos of the Operator's death scene."

When each of them checked the forum, videos were indeed pouring down like a waterfall.

"Title: Operator Death! The first post already has over 7,000 views."

"That shows how shocking an event this was. Honestly, I never thought the Operator would lose either."

The Lollipop Mark said.

"Speaking of that, it's strange that Yahweh2 jumped code twice at the end. It's like knowing the location of the second door before even opening the door in front of you."

"Hmm, that's not something a guest could do."

"Right. Only the house owner knows all the door locations. This is definitely host authority."

The Gear Mark said.

"The Operator is also a host. Even if it was a surprise situation, it shouldn't have been unpredictable, right?"

"The logs show momentary paralysis. She's human after all. The problem is definitely Yahweh2. His senses have already risen to a level that can't be called individual personality anymore."

Silence fell over the meeting room.

"Look at this."

The Black Circle Mark opened a window.

"This is Yahweh2's current movement."

What was visible wasn't images but the rush of countless codes, making it even more shocking.

"The code is..."

As Yahweh2's code changed, the entire code was changing in real-time accordingly.

It had a strange texture, like a convex lens moving across the screen.

The Smile Mark asked.

"How is this possible? Can one user freely change external code?"

"It's not changing."

The Gear Mark said.

"It's not artificial manipulation. The code is automatically restructuring itself to match Yahweh2's changes."

Yoo muttered.

"Because it moves together with the system, the balance doesn't collapse?"

The Lollipop Mark agreed.

"Yes. Actually, Yahweh2's status isn't changing dramatically. I think it might be the limit threshold of the entire system handling Yahweh2's vibrations."

"Hmm, if it's not something we can understand intellectually, then it's right to see it as perfectly synchronized. Like resonance. Moving together."

The Black Circle Mark said.

"Ultimately, High Gear is safe. It's not an error either. But host authority has already been exceeded, and the Operator lost in gameplay. So, what do we do now?"

Amid the continuing silence, someone made a squeaky sound.

"Where the hell did Number Seven go?"

The Ascension Guild, which has First Mercury authority, revives at the Solar Palace upon death.

After completing the 20-minute rapid charging time, the mid-gear opened and the Operator slowly opened her eyes.

All the scenery felt unfamiliar.

Even when she arrived at the solar furnace where the low gear was located, she didn't open the communication channel.

'I died.'

Checking the satellite footage, she saw the Eastern Kingdom's forces charging toward the Solar Palace.

'It's still okay for now.'

Typically, they would gradually approach the Solar Palace through repeated advances and retreats.

The Operator, who had knelt respectfully in front of the low gear, surveyed the battlefield.

Nothing caught her eye.

"Hah!"

Throwing her upper body back, she straightened her bent knees and lay spread-eagle.

"What should I do?"

She had really died.

Apart from the promise she made with Yahweh2, there was no world left for her to escape to.

"This was everything."

Because she thought it would end the moment she died even once, High Gear could become real.

But on the other hand...

'What has changed?'

She could only see herself, revived and fine, having these various thoughts.

"Haha! Hahahaha!"

Ridiculous.

'Yeah, I know. I know too. There's no such thing as a real world anywhere.

I was just...

afraid of throwing my heart into it.

'Yahweh2.'

She watched Yahweh2 fighting a Western Kingdom expert through the satellite screen.

'Oh? It's Tiger.'

Western Kingdom Duel Ranking 3rd place.

A skilled fighter with a glossy cobalt blue mech and powerful claws.

'Pretty good. I had asked him to join our guild...'

As she recalled that time, a massive flash from the Michelan Gun struck Tiger directly.

'A bit lacking. Looks like the Michelan Gun's power dropped. Has he been fighting continuously?'

As expected, Tiger, who had lost one arm, charged at Yahweh2's back.

'Oh, Air God.'

The air bullets from the Air God mounted on Sirone's left arm struck Tiger hard.

'Ignores durability. Excellent choice. But the base damage is fixed at 10.'

Even after being hit by the Michelan Gun, destroying one piece of armor would require hundreds of shots.

'Reload. The ammunition will never run out. The motif was... someone called Gaold?'

It had been an intense dream.

Yahweh2 continued to accumulate damage on Tiger's armor while jumping through code.

'That was a bit annoying. Of course, I wouldn't fall for it twice. But being paralyzed by fear at that moment.'

Tiger's mech exploded.

"Really well done."

Though he was an enemy, Yahweh2's skills had improved so remarkably that she praised him aloud.

"No one can catch that. If it were me, maybe..."

Her voice trailed off.

'I want to do it again.'

She wanted to smell gunpowder with countless users in the world of High Gear.

"It's 1 win, 1 loss."

Ah, that's right.

The Operator suddenly sat up, smiled, and opened the communication channel.

"It was 1 win, 1 loss."

Hey! What are you doing with communications off? Can't you see we're losing the Solar War right now? What should we do?

Ooh! Boss revival! Don't get discouraged just because you died once! We just need to win the Solar War!

As all the doors of the Solar Palace opened, all sorts of noisy sounds rushed in directly.

The Operator drew her black spear.

Western Kingdom 1st Division, assemble at the Solar Palace! We'll lure in the Eastern Kingdom and then catch them! That's how we'll turn this around!

Okay! Great!

Aegis, who quickly grasped the Western Kingdom's change, communicated to Volga's son.

They're trying to lure us. What should we do?

They want to pick off just the rankers. Good judgment, but it won't be as easy as it sounds.

The Golden Ring are professionals. In terms of ranker skills alone, they surpass the Western Kingdom.

That's why the Western Kingdom is also taking a gamble.

They're coming out strong after a while. It means they're confident they can catch Yahweh2. Let's accommodate them. Let's go in.

But simply complying...

It's after-sales service.

Aegis immediately nodded.

Understood.

Watching the Eastern Kingdom's 1st Division head toward the Solar Palace, Fermi chuckled.

'Is this what they call an adolescent girl's burning heart?'

Anyway.

"There are too many difficult customers."

6 hours after the Solar War began. Leaving the battlefield users behind, the top rankers clashed inside the Solar Palace.

Though the Eastern Kingdom had superior skills, the Western Kingdom had the advantage of home ground.

We can't let this become a long battle. The Western Kingdom's reinforcement speed is twice as fast as the Eastern Kingdom's. 20 minutes or 40 minutes. If it goes beyond that, we'll fall behind in delay utilization.

While Volga's son and the Little Witch were engaged in fierce combat, the Operator charged in.

"Yahweh2!"

The Operator, who had already cut down 13 rankers, raised her black spear toward Sirone.

'This is the last time.'

From the moment they lured the enemy into the Solar Palace, the Western Kingdom had also fought with their backs to the wall.

"Alright, here we go."

With all of High Gear's eyes focused on them, Yahweh2 and the Operator collided.

"Ugh!"

Yahweh2's mech was pushed back at a terrifying speed by the head-on ramming attack.

The shadow that broke through the wall split in two, then crashed into each other again at tremendous speed.

"Wow."

Host level.

Golden flashes blazed, and black magnetic field spheres deflected them while spinning.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Fist against fist, weapon against weapon, output against output - a collision of everything they had.

'This is real.'

They both thought the same thing.

'I can't win.'

After testing everything against each other, both of them could reach the final conclusion.

"I"

"You"

Sirone, who activated Da Vinci, thrust his right arm covered in heavy armor at terrifying speed.

"lost."

Operator.

The Operator's bangs flew back from the wind pressure, and his fist punched through her solar plexus with a bang.

"How was it, Yahweh2?"

The users in front of the electronic display stared intently at her bare face, revealed for the first time.

"High Gear, it's fun, isn't it?"

Sirone nodded with sincere feeling.

"Yeah. It's really fun."

"Hehe."

Her face, smiling with her eyes, looked much younger than the image they had expected...

"I knew you'd say that."

It was the face of an ordinary girl.
