[614] The Hottest Place (3)

"What a pleasant sight."

Fiord, who was sitting at the party table with Fisho, remarked.

At school, he was known as a gloomy figure who wore robes and constantly enjoyed sinister pleasures, but today he was dressed immaculately.

Anyone who didn't know him would never guess that his specialty was the deadly poison branch of toxic magic.

"Cayden will graduate this time."

Fisho had learned that Cayden was the president of the Female Anatomy Research Society while participating in the Scramble Royale.

But now the Golden Ring was disbanded, and Cayden was preparing to enter the world.

If not for the penalty of interference, he would have had enough skill to easily make the top 10 final rankings, but Fiord was also a skilled individual who had never missed the upper ranks.

"It doesn't matter, someone like Cayden."

Fiord drew his sharp thumbnail across his wrist and let blood drip into his wine glass.

"...What kind of poison is that?"

"Kedrapusa."

It was a plant that only grew on small uninhabited islands floating in equatorial seas, and was the main ingredient of a toxin where a single drop of the pure extract could kill an elephant within a minute.

After swirling the glass and taking a sip, it was so thrilling that his tongue twisted.

"Hehe, this is exactly the taste."

"Poison flows through your body."

"The human liver is a massive chemical warehouse. If you just adapt, even poison can become medicine."

But most couldn't adapt, which is why it was called poison.

"Eat plenty of good stuff. During the graduation exam, your liver will completely melt away."

Roskas Fiord (Final Graduation Ranking: 9th place).

Major: Deadly Poison branch of Toxic Magic.

Special Notes: Mass slaughter magic that doesn't distinguish between friend and foe.

"Excuse me..."

A female student from Bermin Magic School approached.

Her hair was pulled up, revealing dark circles under her eyes, and her lips were purple.

"You're Fiord, right?"

Since the world of toxic magic was small, Fiord knew who she was.

"The Witch of Decay, Windia."

She nodded expressionlessly.

"Yes. By any chance... was what you put in your drink earlier Kedrapusa?"

"So what?"

Windia showed emotion for the first time.

"You detoxified Kedrapusa?"

"Well... I've been eating it since birth."

Roskas was a family that developed war chemical weapons under royal approval.

Windia, who had been blinking, asked carefully.

"May I try a sip?"

"By all means."

When Fiord offered, she gently lifted the glass and brought her tongue to it.

"Hup!"

The moment her tongue touched it, a stimulus that seemed to melt it struck her brain.

She too had trained her liver with countless toxins, but this was not at a level she could endure.

"Wow, this is really amazing."

Having crawled back from the brink of death, she kept exclaiming in admiration.

"This is the most delicious poison I've ever had in my life."

"I'm glad you like it."

Looking at the wound on Fiord's wrist and smacking her lips, Windia grabbed her hair.

"Want to try mine too? It's Taropascal."

With a ripping sound, her hair broke off from the middle.

"Taropascal?"

It was a poison that made skin rot.

Fiord rubbed the hair to align it neatly, put it in his mouth, and chewed.

"Hmm, this is..."

"How is it?"

"Well made. Though it's a bit bland."

If Kedrapusa was stimulating food for Fiord, Taropascal was like a vegetable side dish.

"I thought so too. I want to synthesize something with this."

"Try adding Pustan mushroom extract. That way you can also reduce the decay time..."

As the two continued their discussion about toxins, Fisho let out a long sigh and left his seat.

While he was wandering around with no proper place to rest, a student from the Royal Magic School carefully approached from behind.

"Senior brother, it's been a long time."

He was a fellow disciple who had studied together under Francis Keiler, an authority on insect magic.

"Yes. Have you prepared well for the graduation exam?"

"It's not particularly important to me. Master emphasizes the achievement of learning over results. But this time, he seems to have made a big decision."

Fisho tilted his head slightly.

"What do you mean?"

"He says to graduate and come back. You've been here too long."

The fellow disciple took something out of his inner pocket and handed it over.

"He has permitted its use."

In a transparent vial, a parasite with a dark red color was wriggling.

"Well then. I'll see you in the capital next year."

As the fellow disciple moved away, Fisho put the vial deep into his inner pocket.

'...I should graduate.'

Maranov Fisho (Final Graduation Ranking: 24th place).

Major: Evolution Acceleration branch of Insect Magic.

Special Notes: Keiler's top disciple.

As night fell and the party reached its peak, conflicts began to break out one by one among the students who had been engaging in psychological warfare.

Students from Alpheas Magic School were no exception, and while Royal Magic School students were looking for prey, they began picking a fight with Suabi.

"Hey, you. What's your rank at school?"

Suabi, who was naturally poor at socializing, hesitated and stepped back when students suddenly picked a fight with him.

"What's it to you? Get out of the way. I don't want to talk to you guys."

A giant student over 2 meters tall blocked Suabi's path as he tried to get around them.

"What did we do to make you not want to talk? We're just asking."

"18th place. Happy now?"

He tried to pass after spitting that out, but the student was so big it felt like a black wall was blocking him.

"Haha! Just doing utility magic and claiming a middle rank? What did I tell you guys, it was fabricated by Spirit magazine."

The Royal Magic School students believed that Scout Baikal being stolen by Alpheas Magic School was Olivia the vice-principal's doing.

Since she was an inspector of the teachers' council and had once even served as principal of Royal Magic School, they had no choice but to be mindful of her.

"Hey, listen carefully. No matter how much you guys fly around, you can't even reach Royal Magic School's toes."

Suddenly Suabi's eyes became sharp.

Even if his mental concentration was perfect, being overwhelmed by students from another school would affect his exam performance.

"Ooh! Did you see him glare at me just now? This is scary."

"Hey, you guys. That's enough."

When the students surrounding Suabi turned around, Screamer was standing crookedly with his hands in his pockets.

"What are you?"

"Is there any need to say? From what I hear, you seem to have Spirit magazine memorized."

Hyde Allen, 3rd in Royal Magic School's hierarchy, walked over.

"I did look at what those bottom-feeders were up to for entertainment. But I don't even remember your face."

"Suabi, come this way."

Screamer ignored them and gestured, but the giant student wouldn't move aside.

"If you're confident, why don't you come and take him? If you crawl between my legs, I won't do anything rough."

The Royal Magic School graduating class burst into laughter.

"Hah, really..."

Given Screamer's personality, he should have turned everything upside down by now, but considering the timing, he held back his anger and walked forward.

"Suabi, let's go. No need to worry about these idiots."

"Idiots?"

"I guess you've relaxed since you get 20 guaranteed admissions, but we don't have that luxury."

"Hahaha! Of course. That's exactly the difference between Royal and regular schools."

"I heard you guys have average abilities 3.8 times lower than ours."

The giant's eyebrows twitched at the words that hit the core of their inferiority complex.

"You think I'd believe such nonsense? That's fabricated."

"I think so too. The magazine must have added an extra decimal point. Looking at your pathetic state, it should be at least 38 times."

"You bastard!"

The giant student grabbed Screamer's collar and pulled him forward.

"I guess you're running your mouth freely because there's a magic control device, but someone like you isn't even worth one punch."

"Really? When you can't even lift me?"

"What?"

The giant student looked down and realized that Screamer's feet were still on the ground.

"This is...!"

He applied more force, but Screamer didn't move as if rooted in place.

'I remember now. That guy...'

Before Allen could speak, Screamer grabbed the giant's collar in return.

Though he had to stretch his arm to its highest due to the height difference, the height gap was instantly reversed.

"Gaaaah!"

When Screamer pulled the giant's collar down, his body dropped down as if a hole had been dug in the ground.

As the giant knelt under the irresistible force and looked up in disbelief, a fist flew at him with tremendous wind pressure.

"Ugh!"

With a bang that struck his eardrums, the fist stopped right in front of his eyes.

Seeing the rolled suit sleeve completely pressed against the arm from the rotation, the giant student couldn't help but recall:

'Fist Mage Screamer.'

Screamer, who had withdrawn his fist, twisted and removed the giant's hand that was still grabbing his collar.

"I get that your pride is hurt, but if Royal is pathetic, let Royal handle it themselves. None of our school kids have the mental space to care about the likes of you."

Logan Screamer (Final Graduation Ranking: 10th place).

Major: Fist Mage branch of Photon Magic.

Special Notes: After completing Fighter Pyroker's Iron Fist Project, capable of one-hit kills.

"These bastards dare look down on us!"

All the Royal Magic School students rose up and rushed at Screamer.

Then Alpheas Magic School also crowded in, matching their numbers.

Eventually, the party atmosphere became tense with rivalry between the two schools, while the remaining three schools only watched the situation seriously.

"Are you saying let's have a go, or what? Country bumpkins getting cocky after being praised a little!"

Electric Monster Lycan wickedly tore his mouth into a grin and gestured with both hands for them to come.

"Puhahaha! Cocky? Fine, come at us if you're confident. I'll make you the biggest idiots who died before graduation exams."

"Hmph! You think we don't have Schema users? If it weren't for the magic control devices, you'd all be annihilated today!"

At the rising voices, Maya stomped her feet.

"This is bad. They can't fight today."

Cayden gently blocked her path and said.

"It's okay. Nothing will happen."

At least not to Maya.

"Come out right now! Let's just have it out today! Shall we see who's the kingdom's best?"

At Royal Magic School's provocation, Fermi entered the scene with delight.

"That's exactly it. In that spirit, let me suggest an interesting game..."

"Fermi, you shut up!"

Everyone who knew Fermi shouted.

"Don't even think about getting involved!"

Fermi would turn everything into a complete mess.

"Hmm, magic control devices."

Dante, who had taken a seat at a nearby table, fell into thought while swirling his wine glass, when a man with curly red hair hanging on both sides approached from the Royal side.

"It's been a while, Dante."

It was Curtis, who had once competed at Royal Magic School.

"You were here too?"

"Haha, no need to pretend not to know. It was all over Spirit anyway."

"You think I'd read that magazine?"

Just a year ago, Dante had been sick of interview requests coming from all directions.

After a moment of silence, Curtis regained his composure and said.

"You know what I regret most before graduation? Not being able to face off against you at Royal."

"That sounds like you're saying you can definitely graduate?"

"Of course. It's not a boast, but I'm 1st in Royal Magic School's hierarchy."

It was a boast.

"You're 2nd, I heard. Even the great Dante seems to have shown his limits."

Who would have known that Dante, once evaluated as the kingdom's greatest talent, would be defeated by an unknown named Shirone and have his 1st place taken by Fermi, a long-term returning student?

"Well, that could happen. If you're confident, try to stop me."

Dante pointed at Fermi with the hand holding his wine glass.

'Hehe, his pride is really hurt. That's the price for ignoring me, Dante.'

Having judged this, Curtis walked to the scene.

"Everyone stop."

When the 1st ranked student appeared and the Royal side students closed their mouths, Fermi looked at Sabina and said.

"See? Even among 1st places, the treatment is different."

"You know what? You're best when you're just staying still."

Curtis approached and offered a handshake.

"I apologize on behalf of Royal Magic School. Let's stop here. There's nothing good about causing a disturbance at the association, right?"

Fermi clasped his hand.

"I'd like to, but as you can see, our school has a tradition of completely ignoring the 1st place."

"Are you saying you'll see it through to the end?"

"No. I'm saying tell it to someone who'll listen."

"Who would that be? Dante?"

"Here he comes."

When Fermi pointed, all 149 people turned to look at the door.

"What? Why's the atmosphere like this? Aren't we having a party?"

Shirone was blinking innocently.
