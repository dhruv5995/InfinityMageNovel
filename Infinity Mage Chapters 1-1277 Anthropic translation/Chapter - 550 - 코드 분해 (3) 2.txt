[550] Code Decomposition (3)

Apocalypse Reset.

Countless symbols began accumulating toward the destination of information.

Blue light raced through the void, drawing a three-dimensional bird's-eye view, and all scenery regained its vitality.

The city's information was reconstructed.

The ruined landscape remained unchanged except for Shirone's disappearance.

As the world was thus reborn, a man walking across the vast dried seabed suddenly raised his head.

"What?"

His name was Gaold.

One who advanced toward the world's end following his instincts.

"Feels like I'm walking a path I've already taken."

His hair was disheveled, his body gaunt, and dirty rags were all that covered his naked form.

"Doesn't matter."

Gaold struck the ground with the staff he gripped in both hands and resumed walking.

In search of something even he didn't understand.

"Where is God? I need to kill him..."

"Shirone will never return."

Rian felt heavy-hearted.

The Shirone he met in the Apocalypse was merely information, but that information matched the real Shirone exactly.

If a similar situation arose in reality, Shirone would sacrifice himself again.

"But what remains at the end is ultimate emptiness."

"Right, he'd enter an open state. Just as we feel the Apocalypse is meaningless, that would happen in reality."

As Rian's expression darkened, Miro lightened the mood.

"Don't worry. It's not easy. The Apocalypse is a world made from human thoughts, but reality isn't like that, right?"

"Nothing Shirone has accomplished was ever easy."

At these pointed words, Miro clicked her tongue.

'Sharp in strange places, this kid.'

If Immortal Function is expanded infinitely, the ego disintegrates, and if perfectly controlled, one voluntarily exits the world.

While she estimated Guffin was the only one to succeed at the latter, being Shirone made her worry.

As if breaking the irreparable atmosphere, Arius appeared.

"You've returned safely."

He had waited in Under Coder after being blocked from the Apocalypse.

"Well, if I'm not safe, who would be?"

Arius nodded as if this was obvious and asked.

"Was the matter resolved well?"

When Miro turned her head, Fermi pulled out the depreciation trade contract.

"We got the signature for now."

Though it was a forged signature, it was 100% recovered information from Shirone, so the possibility was sufficient.

Arius examined the contract carefully and put it in his pocket.

"I'll keep this from now on. It needs to be stolen goods to bring it to reality."

For the forged signature to take effect in reality, it had to be made into an object while avoiding Drimo's censorship.

According to Drimo's rules, it was clear fraud, but for tomb robber Arius, it was his specialty.

"Can you do it?"

"No problem. I've tomb-robbed worse things and sold them to Theraze."

"Right, you did. Then shall we depart?"

Miro's group ascended through Under Coder in reverse order and arrived at Drimo.

Though they could be trapped in dreamland forever if the dream keeper discovered their fraud, Arius utilized his past experience to proceed efficiently.

"I want to leave the dream."

At Drimo's exit, Arius lied brazenly.

Dream Person Ruber's eyes flashed as he scrutinized the group intensely, but soon answered with a benevolent expression.

"Did you have good dreams? Farewell."

Even Marsha, the bandit leader, felt her heart pounding when passing the Dream Person.

The group that ascended to surface consciousness stepped outside the door Arius had installed.

Physical sensations faded distantly, and bright light aggressively swallowed them.

"Cough! Cough!"

The first person to wake from the dream was Rian.

As he sat up from sudden tremendous pain, those lying beside him opened their eyes one by one.

"Graaah!"

"Rian, are you okay?"

Marsha looked around Rian with a shocked expression.

The carpet was stained red from how much blood he had vomited while sleeping.

"I took a lot of hits from underground weapons. Got slashed with swords too."

Rian took deep breaths repeatedly, fighting against enormous pain.

The sensations from the Apocalypse were real, but upon waking from the dream, it became clear they were merely information transmission.

Arius, who had controlled the dream, unfolded from his lotus position and approached.

"The seizure was severe. Without regenerative ability, you would already be dead."

Since he wouldn't die anyway, Miro checked the most important matter first.

"Let's confirm it first. Can you do it?"

Rian also looked at Fermi while enduring the pain.

"I have to try. Whew!"

Fermi took a deep breath and cast magic.

As the depreciation trade contract materialized, everyone's gaze focused on the signature line.

"It's there."

The signature "Ariane Shirone" was clearly inscribed.

"It's not over yet. Whether it'll actually work..."

Fermi moistened his dry lips with his tongue and displayed maximum concentration.

Depreciation Trade.

Valhalla Action.

A golden sphere flashed above his palm, then materialized as a chip and popped up.

"It worked!"

Marsha's eyes widened as her mouth fell open.

Of course, they had fought to the death for this, but she hadn't known if Shirone's magic would actually be extracted.

Without time to wait for the chip to fall, Fermi caught it and placed it on his palm.

Red and gold patterns were drawn along the edges, with two curved arrows in the center chasing each other's tails.

The difference from usual was a diagonal black line drawn across the center of the design.

"As expected, it shows unusable status. It means the price hasn't been paid yet."

"What about Shirone?"

Rian checked on Shirone, but Armand's robe remained unreleased and his breathing unchanged.

"The debt is still Shirone's burden."

Fermi agreed with Miro's words.

"Just extraction doesn't change anything. If we transfer it, Shirone will wake up. Probably."

"Give it here."

When Miro extended her hand, Fermi threw the chip while saying.

"The expiration date is sufficient, but just in case, it's better to transfer quickly."

That way, the 190 billion gold would start being deposited in installments.

"No need to worry. Theraze has already hired archmages. About 10 taking turns to pay should be enough. You'll be needed each time we transfer."

That level of service was basic for a broker.

"Quite devoted anyway. Sacrificing 10 archmages just to wake one magic school student."

"Theraze must see that much value in it."

Miro's thoughts aligned with Theraze's, but she didn't reveal more information and looked at Marsha.

"I'm leaving immediately. Coming with me?"

Though Marsha had been promised support for the Parrot Bandits if the mission succeeded, she had no intention of going to Kashan.

"No, I'll trust you. Not Theraze, but you. I need to go to the hideout first. I have much to discuss with my subordinates."

Respecting Marsha's decision, Miro then asked Rian.

"What will you do?"

If he said he'd follow, she was prepared to accept.

Not only was he Shirone's most reliable ally, but the spirit he showed in the Apocalypse would surely be useful in the future.

After brief contemplation, Rian asked instead of answering.

"What will happen to Shirone from now on?"

"First, I need to go to Kashan and hand over the chip. Then I'll keep him with me for a while."

Fermi pouted.

"Aunt is taking him?"

"Of course. How much time, money, and effort did we spend waking this guy up? I'll teach him a few things then send him back to magic school. He should get his mage certification anyway."

Fermi smiled meaningfully, realizing something.

"Mage certification. That certainly won't be easy."

Though they were from a branch family, blood was the same, Miro thought, responding with an eye-smile.

"That's why I'm taking him."

The world situation would change rapidly, and Shirone would be thrown into that storm's vortex.

'Even just looking at Tormia Kingdom, the Magic Association president has changed.'

Fermi shrugged as if it didn't matter.

"Teach him well. As long as I'm here, Shirone won't even be able to graduate."

"Hoho! That sounds interesting."

Miro burst into artificial laughter and asked Rian.

"So, what will you do?"

"I'll resume knight training."

This was an unexpected statement from Marsha's perspective.

"Why? It's been a while since we met, and you should see Shirone wake up. You practically saved him."

Rian shook his head with a bitter expression.

"In this battle... I died a thousand times."

The atmosphere became solemn.

"Thanks to auditory hallucinations, I returned alive, but in the end, I couldn't protect Shirone this time either. Fighting back was all I could do. That's how strong the enemy was."

In Rian's memory, the image of Parknyeo charging like a beast flickered.

"Conversely, it means even if I died a thousand times, I couldn't beat that opponent. I want to train more. When Shirone graduates, I want to appear as a dignified knight."

Miro respected Rian's resolve. It was a belief worthy of such value.

"Good. Since it's decided, let's depart quickly."

Thus the group left the Ardino family estate.

Before leaving, Miro looked back at Fermi, who was seeing them off to the main gate, and nagged as a relative.

"You graduate this time too. Don't make your stupid father worry."

"Haha! I'll think about it."

Miro looked at Shirone being carried by Arius.

"Right, it's not like you want to graduate. You must have clearly understood Shirone's level this time?"

"It's not about fighting with levels. Valhalla Action won't be released until graduation, and as for other magic, well. Most importantly, I have this."

Fermi flicked a gold coin into the sky.

"...Why did you create such an irregular technique? Can't you tell me now?"

"For now, let's say there's magic I want to buy."

When he avoided a detailed answer, Miro also gave up her lingering attachment and turned around.

"Fine. I'll give Shirone your regards."

"The sooner the deposit, the better."

Even his final greeting was very Fermi-like.

Arriving in Kashan, Miro delivered the Valhalla Action chip and explained what was presumed to be Shirone's collateral.

This completed the contract, and after leaving Kashan again, she gave Arius some mission then settled with Shirone in a cabin deep in Tormia's mountains.

For two days after delivering the chip to Uorin, nothing happened.

Miro, who checked Shirone's condition nightly, decided to wait leisurely.

And so, another day passed.

Restraint release. Behavioral will acceptance.

At the dreamlike flickering voice, Shirone's brow twitched.

Armand's robe dissolved organically and was absorbed into the demon sword's form, and soon after, Shirone's eyelids slowly opened.

"..."

Looking at the log ceiling while slowly blinking, memories from heaven flooded Shirone's mind.

"Gasp!"

Shirone bolted upright from combat instinct, eyes wide as he surveyed his surroundings warily.

"What, what?"

No matter how he looked around, it was an unfamiliar scene.

Neither Araboth's spire nor the terrifying Archangel Faiel could be found.

'What happened? Where is this?'

Fear washed over him as if he'd come to a distant future.

But the first thing his body, now aware of reality, felt was hunger painful enough to make his stomach ache.

Hearing the growling sound, Shirone clutched his stomach and bent over.

"I'm hungry."

As his sense of smell revived, the scent of boiling herbs seeped through the door crack.

'Need to eat something...'

Opening the door, he found a woman with long blue hair wearing an apron, cooking porridge in a small kitchen.

She felt somehow familiar, but he couldn't tell from just her back.

'Who is it?'

The woman, who had been tasting the porridge with a ladle, exclaimed in delight while muttering.

"Mmm, I really am a genius. A genius of taste who can make even something this tasteless feel delicious."

"..."

Shirone, who had been staring blankly, asked.

"Excuse me, who are you? Where is this?"

Hearing Shirone's voice, Miro turned around as familiarly as if it were routine and smiled brightly.

"Oh? Did you sleep well, Shirone?"
