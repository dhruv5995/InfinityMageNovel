[550] Code Decomposition (3)

Apocalypse Reset.

Countless symbols began accumulating toward the destination of information.

Blue light raced through the void, drawing a three-dimensional bird's-eye view, and all scenery regained its vitality.

The city's information was reconstructed.

The ruined landscape remained unchanged except for Shirone's disappearance.

As the world was being reborn, a man walking across the vast trench where the sea had dried up suddenly lifted his head.

"What?"

His name was Gaold.

One who advanced toward the world's end following his instincts.

"Feels like I'm walking a path I've already taken."

His hair was disheveled, his body emaciated, and dirty rags were all that covered his bare flesh.

"Doesn't matter."

Gaold struck the ground with the staff he gripped in both hands and resumed walking.

In search of something even he didn't understand.

"Where is God? I need to kill him..."

"Shirone will never return."

Rian's heart was heavy.

The Shirone he met in the Apocalypse was merely information, but that information matched the real Shirone exactly.

If a similar situation occurred in reality, Shirone would sacrifice himself again.

"But what remains at the end is ultimate emptiness."

"Right, he'd enter an open state. Just as we feel the Apocalypse is meaningless, that's what would happen in reality."

As Rian's expression darkened, Miro tried to lighten the mood.

"Don't worry. It's not easy to do. The Apocalypse is a world made from human thoughts, but reality isn't like that, right?"

"There wasn't a single easy thing among what Shirone accomplished."

At this pointed remark, Miro clicked her tongue.

'Sharp kid in strange places.'

If Immortal Function expands infinitely, the ego dissolves, and if perfectly controlled, one voluntarily leaves the world by their own will.

She estimated that Guffin was likely the only one to succeed at the latter, but because it was Shirone, she couldn't help worrying.

As if to break the irreparable atmosphere, Arius appeared.

"You've returned safely."

He had waited in the Under Coder after being blocked from the Apocalypse.

"Well, if I'm not safe, who would be?"

Arius nodded as if it were a reasonable statement and asked.

"Was the matter resolved well?"

When Miro turned her head, Fermi pulled out the depreciation trade contract.

"We got the signature for now."

Though it was a forged signature, it was 100% recovered information of Shirone, so there was sufficient possibility.

Arius examined the contract thoroughly and put it in his pocket.

"I'll hold onto this from now on. It needs to be stolen goods to bring it to reality."

For the forged signature to show effect in reality, it had to be made into an object while avoiding Drimo's censorship.

According to Drimo's rules, it was clear fraud, but for tomb raider Arius, it was his specialty.

"Can you do it?"

"No problem. I've tomb-raided worse things and sold them to Estas."

"Right, you did. Then shall we depart?"

Miro's group climbed back up the Under Coder in reverse order and arrived at Drimo.

The moment their fraud was discovered by the dream keeper, they might be trapped in dreamland forever, but Arius utilized his past experience to the fullest and proceeded with everything efficiently.

"I want to leave the dream."

At Drimo's exit, Arius calmly lied.

Dream Person Ruber's eyes flashed as he scrutinized the group intensely, but soon answered with a benevolent expression.

"Did you have good dreams? Farewell."

Even Marsha, the bandit group's leader, felt her heart pounding when passing by the Dream Person.

The group that ascended to surface consciousness stepped outside the door Arius had installed.

The body's sensations faintly receded, and bright light aggressively swallowed them.

"Cough! Cough!"

The first person to wake from the dream was Rian.

As he sat up from the sudden tremendous pain, those lying beside him opened their eyes one by one.

"Graaaah!"

"Rian, are you okay?"

Marsha looked around Rian with a shocked expression.

The carpet was stained red from how much blood he had vomited while sleeping.

"I got hit by underground weapons a lot. Got slashed with swords too."

Rian took deep breaths repeatedly, fighting against the enormous pain.

The sensations from the Apocalypse had been real, but upon waking from the dream, it became clear they were merely transmitted information.

Arius, who had controlled the dream, unfolded from his lotus position and approached.

"The seizure was severe. If not for your regenerative ability, you would already be dead."

Since he wouldn't die anyway, Miro checked the most important matter first.

"Let's confirm it first. Can you manage?"

Rian also looked back at Fermi while enduring the pain.

"I have to try. Whew!"

Fermi took a deep breath and cast magic.

As the depreciation trade contract materialized, everyone's gaze focused on the signature section.

"It's there."

The signature "Ariane Shirone" was clearly inscribed.

"It's not over yet. Whether it'll actually have an effect is..."

Fermi moistened his dry lips with his tongue and demonstrated his utmost concentration.

Depreciation Trade.

Valhalla Action.

A golden orb flashed above his palm, then materialized as a chip and popped up.

"It worked!"

Marsha's eyes widened as her mouth fell open.

Of course, they had fought to the death for this, but she hadn't known if Shirone's magic would actually be extracted.

Without time to wait for the chip to fall, Fermi snatched it and placed it on his palm.

Red and gold patterns were drawn along the edges, and in the center, two curved arrows were drawn as if chasing each other's tails.

The difference from usual was that a black line was drawn diagonally across the center of the design.

"As expected, it shows unusable status. It means the price hasn't been paid yet."

"What about Shirone?"

Rian checked on Shirone, but Armand's robe remained unreleased and his breathing stayed the same.

"The debt is still Shirone's burden."

Fermi agreed with Miro's words.

"Just extraction doesn't change anything. If transferred, Shirone will wake up. Probably."

"Give it here."

When Miro extended her hand, Fermi threw the chip while saying.

"The expiration date is sufficient, but just in case, it's better to transfer quickly."

That way, the 190 billion gold would start being deposited in installments.

"No need to worry. Estas has already hired Archmages. About ten taking turns to pay should be enough. You'll be needed each time we transfer."

That level of service was basic for a broker.

"Quite devoted anyway. Sacrificing ten Archmages just to wake one magic school student from sleep."

"Estas must think it has that much value."

Miro's thoughts aligned with Estas, but she didn't reveal more information and looked back at Marsha.

"I'm leaving immediately. Will you come along?"

Though Marsha had been promised support for the Parrot Bandits if the mission succeeded, she had no intention of going to Kashan.

"No, I'll trust you. Not Estas, but you. I need to go to the hideout first. There's much to discuss with my subordinates."

Respecting Marsha's decision, Miro now asked Rian.

"What will you do?"

If he said he'd come along, she planned to accept.

Not only was he Shirone's most reliable ally, but the spirit he showed in the Apocalypse would surely be useful in the future.

After pondering briefly, Rian asked instead of answering.

"What will happen to Shirone from now on?"

"First, I need to go to Kashan and hand over the chip. Then I'll keep him with me for a while."

Fermi pouted his lips.

"Aunt is taking him?"

"Of course. Do you know how much time, money, and effort we spent waking this guy up? I'll teach him a few things, then send him back to magic school. He should get his magic license anyway."

Fermi smiled meaningfully, having realized something.

"A magic license. That certainly won't be easy."

Though they were from a branch family, they shared the same blood, and Miro responded with an eye-smile.

"That's why I'm taking him."

The world situation would change rapidly, and Shirone would be thrown into the whirlwind of that storm.

'Just looking at the Kingdom of Tormia, the Magic Association president has changed.'

Fermi shrugged as if it didn't matter.

"Teach him well. As long as I'm here, Shirone won't even be able to graduate."

"Hoho! That should be interesting."

Miro let out an artificial laugh and asked Rian.

"So, what will you do?"

"I'll set out on knight training again."

For Marsha, this was an unexpected statement.

"Why? It's been a while since we met, and you should at least see Shirone wake up. You practically saved him."

Rian shook his head with a bitter expression.

"In this battle... I died a thousand times."

The atmosphere became solemn.

"Thanks to the hallucinations, I managed to return alive, but in the end, I couldn't protect Shirone this time either. Fighting back was all I could do. That's how strong the enemy was."

In Rian's memory, the image of Parknyeo charging like a beast flickered.

"Conversely, it means even if I died a thousand times, I couldn't beat that opponent. I want to train more. When Shirone graduates, I want to appear as a dignified knight."

Miro respected Rian's resolve. It was a belief worthy of such value.

"Good. Since it's decided, let's depart quickly."

Thus the group left the Ardino family.

Before leaving, Miro looked back at Fermi, who was seeing them off to the main gate, and nagged him as a relative.

"You should graduate this time too. Don't trouble your foolish father."

"Haha! I'll think about it."

Miro looked back at Shirone being carried on Arius's back.

"Right, it's not like you want to graduate. You must have clearly understood Shirone's level this time?"

"It's not about fighting with levels. Valhalla Action won't be released until graduation, and the rest of his magic, well. Most importantly, I have this."

Fermi flicked a gold coin into the sky with a ting.

"...Why did you create such an irregular formula? Can't you tell me now?"

"For now, let's say there's magic I want to buy."

When he avoided a detailed answer, Miro also gave up her curiosity and turned around.

"Fine. I'll give Shirone your regards."

"The sooner the deposit, the better."

Even his final greeting was very Fermi-like.

Arriving in Kashan, Miro delivered the Valhalla Action chip and explained what was presumed to be Shirone's collateral.

This completed the contract, and after leaving Kashan again, she gave Arius some mission, then took Shirone to settle in a cabin deep in Tormia's mountains.

For two days after delivering the chip to Uorin, nothing happened.

Miro, who checked Shirone's condition every night, decided to wait patiently.

And so, another day passed.

Restraint release. Accepting behavioral will.

At the dreamlike flickering voice, Shirone's brow twitched.

Armand's robe dissolved organically and was absorbed into the demon sword's form, and shortly after, Shirone's eyelids slowly opened.

"..."

Looking at the log ceiling while slowly blinking, memories from heaven flooded Shirone's mind.

"Gasp!"

Shirone bolted upright with combat instincts, eyes wide as he surveyed his surroundings warily.

"What, what?"

No matter how he looked around, it was an unfamiliar scene.

Neither Araboth's spire nor the terrifying Archangel Paiel could be found.

'What happened? Where is this?'

Fear washed over him as if he had come to a distant future.

But the first thing his body, aware of reality, felt was hunger painful enough to make his stomach ache.

Hearing the rumbling sound, Shirone clutched his stomach and bent over.

"I'm hungry."

As his sense of smell revived, the scent of boiling stew seeped through the door cracks.

'I need to eat something...'

Opening the door, he found a woman with long blue hair wearing an apron, cooking porridge in the small kitchen.

She felt somehow familiar, but he couldn't tell from just her back.

'Who is it?'

The woman, tasting the porridge with a ladle, cheered and muttered to herself.

"Mmm, I really am a genius. A taste genius who can make even something this tasteless feel delicious."

"..."

Shirone, who had been staring blankly, asked.

"Excuse me, who are you? Where is this?"

Hearing Shirone's voice, Miro turned around as naturally as daily routine and smiled brightly.

"Oh? Did you sleep well, Shirone?"
