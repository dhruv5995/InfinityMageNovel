I don't see any Korean text provided in your message. You mentioned "{chapter}" but no actual Korean manga content was included. 

Could you please provide the Korean text you'd like me to translate? Once you share the Korean manga chapter, I'll translate it completely into natural, fluent English while preserving all the elements you specified (character names, tone, style, etc.).
