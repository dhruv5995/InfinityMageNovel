In the Flower Garden (2)

It's a sad story.

At Ikael's request to name the child, Satiel agreed for now and returned to heaven.

Gephin asked.

"Will it be alright? I know Satiel's character well, but heaven is still no easy opponent."

Ikael smiled.

"Have you already forgotten? When you were struggling, which angel fought most earnestly on humanity's side?"

Gephin had nothing to say.

"I know that, but..."

"Don't worry. And with you and me here, who would dare harm this child?"

Ikael, the leader of the angels, and Gephin, who possessed power rivaling God's, were heaven's strongest couple.

"Don't tell me you're scared?"

At Ikael's joke, Gephin finally regained his smile and lifted his chin.

"Haha! The only thing I'm afraid of is you. Well then... shall we take down a formidable opponent?"

As Gephin leaned forward, Ikael protected the child and twisted away.

"Wait! Our baby!"

Gephin hurriedly stopped his movement and looked at the child, who was smiling brightly at his father.

'Don't worry.'

Gephin pulled Ikael's shoulder close and gently stroked the child's cheek with his other hand.

"Daddy will protect you."

Meanwhile, Satiel, who had returned to her quarters, felt as if she had awakened from a dream.

But it was reality, and the loving image of Ikael and Gephin wouldn't leave her eyes.

"A name."

Asked to give a name?

At the time, she was too flustered and simply nodded, but looking back, everything became clear.

'For whom did I...'

Countless days of fighting for humanity flashed by rapidly.

She had done her best.

Yet the person Gephin chose was Ikael, who had opposed him all along.

"I liked him first..."

As tears of light flowed down her cheeks, her holy light body began to drip downward.

"I loved him more. I fought more for him. So why? Why Ikael?"

She couldn't cast aside her feelings.

'I should have at least said something. If I had told him I liked him first, then in that place...'

Wouldn't there be Satiel and a child who resembled her?

Her holy light body dripped to the floor like lava, and when she came to her senses, the space had changed.

'Where is this?'

The sanctuary of Arabot.

Looking back, the door was wide open, and ahead, Ankela was pulsing with deep resonance.

"What brings you to seek me, Satiel?"

She didn't remember, but seeing that Ankela wasn't angry, she must have requested an audience.

"Ah, well..."

One of Ankela's eyelids rose, and Satiel's jaw trembled as her voice caught in her throat.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

In the Fifth Heaven, in the giant city of Matei, giants who had reached the advanced stages of the Art of Unity were marching.

Though their condensed forms weren't very tall, their massive weight shook the city with each step.

"What is this..."

For the first time in heaven's history, both archangels and Mara had gathered for this attempted technique.

"Is it really possible?"

Uriel asked Kariel, who was in charge, but his expression held no certainty either.

"I can't say for sure."

Almost all the giants in Matei were gathering around a statue that stretched up to the sky.

"Since this is the first attempt at the 10th stage of the Art of Unity, it's not a matter of probability."

"Was the 7th stage the highest until now?"

Giant Legion Commander Girshin was the only 7th stage, ruling over the giants of Matei.

"We can't say it's impossible. All the giants participating in this technique are ancients, a union of Gaians."

The first-born giants travel to Jotunheim to receive new laws.

This is the 1st stage.

From this point, giants develop their identity, making it extremely difficult to advance to higher stages.

Considering that using divine subjects only reached the 3rd stage, the Gaians' unification power was truly tremendous.

"But suddenly the 10th stage? It's like unifying 10 billion Gaians, isn't it?"

"Right. If successful, they'll become the first and last giant to reach the 10th stage of the Art of Unity. They'll surpass Girshin and rule over all giants."

"...The king of giants."

Following Ankela's instructions, Kariel progressively advanced the Art of Unity.

Success, success, and more success.

Lights continued to ignite in the lamps of the pyramid-connected bronze statues.

"Were the Gaians this powerful?"

Kariel, who had been worried sick about losing giants for nothing, was now filled with such satisfaction his face showed pure pleasure.

The moment the 8th stage bronze statue lit up, Giant Legion Commander Girshin's expression crumpled.

Uriel watched him.

'His pride must be hurt.'

It was natural, having been at the top of all giants only to fall to second place in an instant.

'But I have doubts too.'

Uriel turned his gaze to the bronze statue so massive its end couldn't be seen.

'Why is something like this necessary?'

He knew the extent of Girshin's power.

But the 10th stage?

In Uriel's opinion, he wondered if there was really a need for something that strong to exist in this universe.

"9th stage..."

Finally surpassing the demonic threshold, all the melted intermediates were absorbed into the central bronze statue.

It was so large that it took quite a while just to fill it with liquid, but the observers lost track of time.

"It's finished."

With some Mara's murmur, the bronze statue's vibrations ceased and silence fell over everything.

In the plaza that had become desolate with countless giants disappeared, the sound of the bronze statue opening could be heard.

Though it was a low sound, it was loud enough to tear eardrums, and everyone's gaze turned skyward.

All they could see was the empty interior of the mold.

"Why?"

Thud!

Just as someone was about to speak, the ground shook.

Looking down again, they saw someone with the height of a Gaian at most, standing with head bowed.

"Condensed form?"

As if to prove this, they could see walls of thick muscle that couldn't be made through normal training.

'Condensed form is a difficult technique. To succeed immediately after the Art of Unity succeeded means...'

While Kariel analyzed the situation, Girshin walked toward the bronze statue.

"Newly born giant."

Just as Uriel was about to step forward to intervene, since this was a technique performed under Ankela's orders:

"Wait a moment."

Kariel spoke with meaningful eyes.

'The life fusion technique that even the 7th stage was considered dangerous to heaven. How much different would the 10th stage be?'

It was pure curiosity.

"I am Giant Legion Commander Girshin."

Stopping before the newly born giant, Girshin drew his sword and continued.

"Though you've been chosen as king of giants, giant law is strictly might makes right. Let's settle this here and now..."

The moment the newly born giant raised his head, Girshin's breath stopped and he dropped his sword.

As the clear metallic sound echoed, the newly born giant slowly looked around.

Kariel's face went pale.

'Killing intent?'

No, it wasn't killing intent.

His very existence was so overwhelming that simply making eye contact was intimidating.

Though no angels showed it outwardly, they couldn't hide their trembling holy light bodies.

"Ymir."

As he spoke in a flowing pronunciation, Girshin's legs trembled.

"I am Ymir."

Though all creatures have natural enemies, Ymir didn't seem like a life form created with any particular purpose in mind.

'King of giants. No, king of all living things.'

Girshin immediately prostrated himself.

"Forgive my rudeness, my king. I will pacify the world according to your command."

Instead of answering, Ymir looked back at Arabot's spire.

'I want to fight.'

He didn't even have the questions about birth that any living being would naturally have.

"This world is..."

As Ymir pressed down with one foot, the stone floor caved in completely.

"Too weak."

The moment his words ended, a tremendous explosion erupted from where Ymir had been standing.

"Ugh!"

Since those gathered were angels, Mara, and intermediate giants, there was no damage, but the plaza was devastated.

"Such insolence!"

Kariel doubted Ymir's consciousness, but Uriel was interested in the source of the explosion.

"He probably had no hostility toward us."

"No hostility? Not just any angel, but in a place where all the archangels have gathered, to do such a thing...!"

"Look over there."

With the entire radius collapsed in a hemisphere shape, Uriel pointed to where Ymir had been standing.

"Ymir didn't do anything. He just bent his knee and straightened it."

Kariel stared blankly at the footprint clearly imprinted in the center of the crater.

Uriel said,

"That's exactly the problem. Having no hostility whatsoever even with archangels before his eyes means..."

It meant he saw them as no different from Girshin.

As all the angels fell silent after hearing Uriel's analysis, an explosion erupted from Arabot's direction.

Bang!

Ymir, who had reached Arabot in a single leap, buried his fingers in the spire's wall.

"Hmm."

He had intended to create a handhold, but his strength was too great and it crumbled like dust.

'Unpleasant.'

Though the universe was full of hard materials, Ymir felt like he was living in a world without solids.

'I can't feel anything.'

Thinking it would take time to control his strength, Ymir flew into the air and kicked off.

Pop!

His body floated from the wind pressure alone, and shortly after, the ground made a loud noise as it was flattened.

Crushing through the wall like tofu, the sanctuary door blocked his path right in front of him.

For some unknown reason, he suddenly thought he shouldn't open it carelessly.

"Lord Ankela."

It was animal instinct.

"I have come at your summons."

As the door opened, Ankela, composed of massive muscles, greeted Ymir.

Upon seeing with his eyes the being that had given him that strange pressure, Ymir chuckled and said,

"Are you stronger than me?"

"That would depend on the criteria for strength."

"No."

Ymir moved a little closer.

"There are no criteria. I am stronger than you. Why should I submit to you?"

"Because I granted you the blessing of birth."

"No, it would be a curse."

Ymir approached within arm's reach and placed his palm under Ankela's eye.

"I have no sense of achievement. Since I'm already the strongest, what meaning is there in becoming even stronger?"

As he applied pressure and crumpled Ankela's skin, the sound of flesh slowly tearing could be heard.

"See, with just a little force, this happens..."

"Do you want to feel it?"

Ymir raised his gaze.

"Do you want to feel power, flesh, the sensation of impact, shock?"

"...Could you make that possible?"

"It's not about making it possible."

Ankela's tentacles moved quickly.

"Maclain Gephin."

The fingers that had been tearing Ankela's flesh spread again, and Ymir's body reacted to the name.

"Gephin."

Though the personalities of 10 billion had already been integrated, it seemed like all their voices could be heard.

Gephin is the strongest.

Ankela, who had accessed Satiel's holy light body, spoke while electric sparks shot from his eyes.

"Go."

The door opened by itself.

"I will guide you to Gephin."

Slowly turning around, Ymir looked at the scenery from the broken wall before jumping down.

Shortly after, a powerful shockwave shook the spire.
