[720] The World We Live In (1)

"Argo?"

No matter how much he squinted and examined it, the hologram before his eyes was definitely Amy.

What do you see?

"Uh, well..."

As if Shirone's answer wasn't important, Argo nodded and continued speaking.

Emotional focus is important for reincarnation. It's quite rare, but if focus weakens, errors can occur in the reincarnation program. What you're currently seeing is the form that appears when your brainwaves are at their most concentrated state.

"Amy..."

He had wanted to see her even more today.

Please remember this carefully. If errors occur in the reincarnation program, you could lose your memories in reality too. If you lose the code, recovery becomes difficult.

"I don't have amnesia."

I know. Your brainwaves don't indicate that. You probably came from a different time period. That happens sometimes.

Argo seemed to know many things, and Shirone even began to think she might know everything.

"How can I get out of this place?"

You speak like a technician. How interesting. Would you follow me? I'll show you around this place.

Though he hadn't met the human he wanted to see, Argo seemed like someone he could have a conversation with, so Shirone followed her onto the elevator.

Just like the drones that perfectly controlled gravity, the elevator had no noise or even the slightest vibration.

This world is called Utopia. Originally it had many names, but after the last reincarnation refuser died, representatives from each nation held meetings to create it. Currently, approximately 16 billion people live in Utopia.

"Live?"

He thought there was a chance they were dead.

Yes, they're all alive. And the number no longer increases or decreases. Humans seem to have chosen to live new lives here eternally.

When the elevator arrived and the doors opened, a space as vast as the tower's circumference appeared.

The ceiling was at the top of the tower, and countless people were inside glass tubes he had seen from outside, arranged along the cylindrical walls.

There had to be well over ten thousand of them.

Lost in awe at the magnificent scale, Shirone asked Argo:

"What... what kind of world is this?"

It's the same world. I don't know what kind of world you lived in, but it won't be different. It just endlessly converges.

When Argo raised her hand, a large hologram turned on at a height of 3 meters, and countless images passed by.

Prototype Argo. The first complete synchronization simulation program. By connecting to human brainwaves, you can experience completely different worlds.

The large hologram's image changed, showing a young man's life passing by at high speed.

"So you're saying the people sleeping here enter glass tubes and live in completely different worlds?"

Yes. When Argo was first launched, it was nothing more than commercial entertainment. Virtual reality has limitations. The thought that you can return anytime reduces the sense of reality.

Only being trapped makes it real.

So humanity made a tremendous decision. They closed off the world so that people couldn't know that the Argo program was a simulation.

"Closed off... the world?"

It wasn't easy. There's a big technical difference between providing virtual reality and making people truly believe it. Plus there were stability and ethical issues...

Argo skipped over unnecessary information.

Anyway, Utopia solved humanity's age-old problem of immortality. They completed the final Argo program.

When Shirone noticed a shadow and looked up, a massive iron sphere equipped with mechanical lenses was floating above.

Though he hadn't noticed in its smaller form, the giant eyeball definitely resembled something.

"Ankera?"

Amy's hologram placed one hand on her stomach and bowed politely.

Let me introduce myself properly. I am the reincarnation administrator of Utopia, Akashic Record Argo.

Though Shirone had encountered Digital Ra in the Apocalypse, he had no memory of it since it was a place where information fragments gathered.

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

Let me introduce you to Utopia. There are spare slots available. If you want reincarnation, I'll help you.

When Argo raised her head, two drones flew over and faced each other in front of them.

Electricity flowed from hologram Amy's eyes, and the two drones communicated in their own language.

Zzzt! Zzzzt! Zzk! Zzzzt!

When the eerie electromagnetic sounds ended, screens showing each person's life appeared in front of over ten thousand glass tubes.

Feeling his fingertips tremble, Shirone looked around at the screens with a pale face.

Argo is an immortality program. For humanity to live forever, I too must be eternal and indestructible. An artificial intelligence capable of self-system recovery. Therefore, even if reset, I do not disappear.

"Reset?"

No system is perfect. Sometimes initialization is necessary. Though it's a virtual world, there are specific intentions. When the world doesn't flow according to those intentions, we reset and try again. That is, developing the immortality program again within Argo's world. Living eternally through eons.

For the first time, Shirone felt fear.

Another problem is when someone opens the closed world. That's classified as the most serious error. In such cases, we either reset or delete the individual.

"Delete?"

He remembered Guffin's deletion.

It means removing specific information. But since that causes system chaos, I don't have deletion authority unless conditions are met.

Even if it was virtual, it would be problematic if Argo could arbitrarily erase information from the world.

In Utopia, Argo manages reincarnation, but is also linked to the world humans dream of. However, there I don't even recognize that I'm virtual. No being should know. It must absolutely be a closed world.

World 9999 was completely different from the world Shirone had lived in, but he wondered if that was really the case.

"They live like that? Without the slightest thought that it's fake, mistaking it for reality?"

Argo pulled a screen showing someone's life in front of Shirone's eyes.

What mediates signals between Argo and humans is photons. Of course, biological signals use electricity, and precision systems sometimes use quantum transmission, but the foundation is always light. It's so sophisticated that you could never think it's fake.

Argo said while looking around at the screens.

Since virtual world time is based on the speed of light, no matter can be faster than light. Also, since it's the basic medium, the speed of light is always maintained constantly.

It was the law of invariant light speed.

If you perceive at light speed, time stops, but that's allowed within normal parameters. However, if you go faster than light, time becomes disturbed in the system. Time paradoxes cause overload. It's a serious problem.

Shirone watched through the screen the life of a soldier fighting on a battlefield.

He was crying out from serious injuries.

"They wanted this kind of life?"

No. Of course, it's not impossible to artificially set up lives, but it's prohibited by law. On screen it's a soldier, but the person actually dreaming is a woman. What being you'll be born as in the next reincarnation is determined by the system. Based on Karr.

"Karr?"

It means the degree of causality violation. The lower the Karr, the easier for the system to predict, and the higher the Karr, the harder to predict. Usually people raise their Karr through repeated reincarnations, but we don't set it above 90 percent. Because it threatens the system.

The soldier on screen was dying from an arrow wound.

"What happens when they die?"

They wake up from the dream. When they come out of the capsule, drones conduct detailed examinations. They can rest for a few days in Utopia, or reincarnate again.

"But they don't know even until the moment of death, right? The stress must be enormous - aren't there side effects?"

I can't say there aren't.

Argo readily admitted it.

That was the biggest obstacle in the Utopia project. Closed worlds were fine, but no one wants to experience the fear of death. So representatives from each nation developed one very efficient program.

"What kind of program?"

God.

Amy's hologram raised her index finger.

When the God program was introduced, the system's stability improved remarkably. The concept that it's not the end reduced stress levels by over 90 percent. Therefore, in Argo, beings above a certain Karr level are set to construct gods.

The screen showed the soldier praying to god, then suddenly developed noise.

"What's this?"

An endless first-person view of rushing through a tunnel of colorful lights continued.

It's a near-death experience program. It's the electromagnetic tunnel created during the process when a life cycle ends and updates to reality. Here, memories of reality are recovered. Sometimes variables occur during loading and they go back, but the God program absorbs the errors.

Argo's lens contracted and expanded.

Fortunately, the transmission was successful. Taking care of people who return to reality is also the administrator's role.

The screen changed to Utopia's background, showing glass tubes installed inside buildings.

"No!"

As the lid opened, a blonde woman bolted upright.

It had been a terrible death, but soon she remembered reality and sighed.

"Ugh, annoying. Why do they always shoot arrows at me?"

Though it had been a lifetime, her impression was as hollow and monotonous as having a bad dream for one night.

A drone flew in front of her and opened its lens.

Did you have a pleasant journey? This is Utopia.

"I know."

The woman answered dismissively and stepped out of the capsule, with the drone rolling along behind her.

Beginning detailed examination. Do you need anything?

"Water. Tranquilizer."

The drone extended a hose from its body to the woman's mouth, instantly generating moisture.

Then it came down to her neck and made a prick sound while injecting tranquilizer. The woman's shoulders flinched, but that was the extent of her reaction.

While being examined by the drone, the woman asked:

"What about my next reincarnation?"

Karr level 67 percent. There are 2,598 types available in the system.

"Can I be born as a human?"

That's possible.

The woman stretched languidly and muttered:

"67 percent is still far off, isn't it? What's the record of the person who's gone farthest among those currently remaining?"

Currently Omega 876 years by luminosity standard.

"Wow, really fast."

Shirone, who had been watching the screen, asked Argo:

"Omega 876 years?"

It was a time unit written in the records Guffin had left in Babel.

Omega is a unit that divides the beginning and end of time by percentage. The core of the Utopia project is to keep diving deeper into simulations. When you reach Omega 1,000 years, you enter the next simulation, so the frequency of coming to reality decreases.

They would live eternally without wasting even the few days spent in reality.

As simulations repeat, the period to reach Omega 1,000 years will shorten based on time here.

Because it's an eon.

10 years, 5 years, 2 years, continuing to decrease until finally 1 second, 0.5 seconds... Eventually living eternity in an instant.

Shirone couldn't believe it.

"But time is still passing here now, isn't it? In 100 years, they'll eventually die too."

Of course. However, for Utopia's residents, it's a future that will never come. In the world of eons, time is being infinitely divided.

It was the secret of true immortality.
