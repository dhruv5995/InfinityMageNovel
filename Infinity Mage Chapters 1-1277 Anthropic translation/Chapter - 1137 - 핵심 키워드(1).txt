Key Keyword (1)

Uorin, who had gotten up from the carpet, gulped down cold water and took a seat at the table.

Kido approached her as she sat lost in thought, pressing her temples.

"Are you feeling better now?"

Uorin suddenly realized Kido's presence, turned her head, and waved her hand dismissively.

"Get out."

Kido frowned.

"Well, aren't you just so polite." Couldn't she even say thanks to a friend who had rushed over after hearing about the crisis?

'Friend, I suppose.'

He thought they were at least that much to each other.

"Fine. Handle it yourself."

He turned coldly and headed for the door, causing Uorin to make an unpleasant expression.

"Kido."

When he turned around, she was already wearing a gentle smile.

"Thanks for protecting me. Want some tea before you go?"

The goblin's lips jutted out.

'Lies, as always...' He understood the heart of someone who had endured endless ages to meet Shirone.

'Someone like me wouldn't even catch her eye.'

Kido turned around again.

"I'm leaving. I'm the captain of Kashan's royal guard. I have lots to do. Call me if something comes up."

As the door closed, Uorin's expression vanished from her face as if it had never been there.

Thud. Her hand struck the table.

"Caiden."

It was a key keyword from the future discovered through the combination of History Search and Future Sight. From now on, it was a matter of reasoning.

'The fact that Caiden acts as the biggest variable must be related to the breakout.'

At Arachne's banquet, Caiden's right hand had almost made a grave mistake.

'Even with the laws twisted, he maintained his original impulse to attack Marcus. That's the breakout. But why? What kind of influence will he have on the future?'

Her thoughts raced rapidly.

'Obviously... it must be Maya.'

The famous singer from Tormia - only she could influence Caiden's heart.

"Hmm."

Uorin crossed her legs and rested her chin on her hand.

"But why?"

She's just a singer.

'Giant pyramids have been constructed in every nation. Humanity is steadily approaching extinction. But Maya? One human's voice in such circumstances...'

Uorin's thoughts came to an abrupt halt.

"Ultima System."

Though she had become human flesh through countless generations, she had once been Gaian too.

'Right, there's no other way to think about it. This is related to the integrated mental system.'

The meaning of the keyword had been analyzed, but this was as far as she could deduce.

'I can't know the process. There are too many logical gaps in the circumstances. This way, it's nothing but delusion.'

Uorin's eyes glowed golden.

'Future Sight!'

The moment she endured the pain and examined the timeline again, a shock hit her as if her brain would explode.

"Ugh!"

The time waves were vibrating like earthquakes due to the changes in laws led by the Zodiac.

Unable to withstand the nausea from hundreds of overlapping events, she finally cut off her ability.

"Annoying."

In this state, forget future prediction - even finding keywords would be a struggle.

'Anyway, Maya. And Caiden.'

Where were those two and what were they doing now?

The ensemble room at Delta headquarters.

The world's most famous musicians had gathered in one place, practice in full swing. In this place preparing for the performance that would crown the Holy War, countless emotions were clashing.

Since each was an artist representing their own nation, it was inevitable that competitive feelings would arise.

The performance manager spoke.

"We'll have a full rehearsal soon. Let's take about 10 minutes."

The artists stopped practicing like clockwork, immediately put on poker faces, and scattered.

"Phew."

As Maya relaxed and sighed, Reina approached and patted her shoulder.

"Good work. You did well."

"Sister Reina."

Among those from Tormia, only Maya and Reina were skilled enough to be selected for the finale performance.

"I thought I'd die from how difficult it was. The others are amazing. They didn't make a single mistake."

"Hehe, that's not true. Everyone's doing their best desperately."

Caiden brought water.

"Maya, drink this. Ms. Reina, please take one too."

Since Palmers, Maya's agency representative, couldn't attend the Holy War, Caiden had volunteered to be her manager.

Maya returned the water cup and said,

"Thanks, Caiden. Honestly, this is my first ensemble so I'm incredibly nervous, but I'm glad you're here."

"Don't worry. I don't know much about music, but your voice sounds the best to me."

As a slight blush appeared on Maya's cheeks, Reina, who had been watching, chuckled softly.

'Affection can be scary.'

Then a voice came from the sofa.

"Hey, you."

The woman sitting with her legs crossed arrogantly was El Kiana, the world's greatest singer.

"Bring me some water too."

Caiden, making eye contact with Reina, approached while taking out a new cup from his bag.

"Ah, yes."

"Wait."

Maya stepped in front of Caiden.

"Caiden is my manager."

"So?"

"If you want to ask a favor, shouldn't you ask for permission first? And don't speak informally to him."

El Kiana's eyebrows narrowed as artists from other countries watched with interest.

'I thought she was gentle, but she's got some bite. There aren't many kids who've tangled with El Kiana and come out with flesh intact.'

El Kiana looked around.

"Whatever manager he is, he's not even a real manager anyway. We're preparing for the finale diva performance right now - who else is there besides him as a man in this room?"

"Caiden isn't an employee. He's my friend, and he's helping voluntarily."

El Kiana covered her mouth and laughed.

"How childish. You think I don't know? If you brought a man into a place like this, it's obvious."

Maya didn't back down either.

"What are you thinking? Caiden is just a friend! We're nothing to each other! Ah..."

Maya hurriedly glanced at Caiden, but he smiled without showing any reaction.

"Maya, we're all performing together anyway. I can do simple errands like fetching water."

"But she's treating you rudely."

That was true, but Caiden didn't want to create any disturbance in this place.

'It would be serious if my right hand moves.'

Moreover, the biggest problem was the legal changes that had been happening to him since a few hours ago.

'It's not certain yet. But if I were to swing a sword right now, I might not be able to produce the same power as before.'

'There's no need to make enemies unnecessarily.'

With that thought, he handed over the water bottle, and El Kiana looked Caiden up and down.

"Hmph."

Snatching the water bottle, she said,

"You should know how lucky you are. The people here - even royalty would have to wait months to see them. And destroy the water bottle I drank from in front of everyone. Who knows what you might do if you take it..."

"Ms. El Kiana."

Just as Maya was about to argue again, the door opened and a man with a stern expression entered.

Even El Kiana, who was overwhelmingly famous, couldn't hide her stiff expression upon seeing him.

'Panier? That guy is in charge?'

As the world's greatest performance planner who had produced countless musicians, El Kiana was one of them.

Since no one in this field didn't know him, the atmosphere in the practice room froze instantly.

Panier slowly examined the artists' faces and spoke in a cold voice.

"What are you all doing? Aren't you going to practice?"

'Still the same.'

People who knew Panier's notorious reputation gathered on stage without complaint.

In the tense atmosphere that made even Reina catch her breath momentarily, the finale song began.

There were five divas, each with different personalities, their voices harmonizing together.

'Duet part.'

El Kiana and Maya faced each other, decorating the song's climax.

As if they had never had an emotional fight, the two women's gazes were infinitely tender.

Reina analyzed objectively.

'El Kiana. Her resonance is incredible. Her emotional expression is top-notch too, and above all, her voice is too exceptional.'

The only area where Maya was better than El Kiana was slightly more delicate emotional expression.

'Of course, Maya's technique is also excellent, but...'

Among the divas gathered here, no one was technically inadequate.

At the song's end, El Kiana's voice, calm like a monologue, permeated the air.

Panier's eyebrows twitched.

"Hmm."

Though it was qualitatively different from 10 minutes ago, all the artists watched his reaction.

"Well done. You've practiced a lot."

"Hah."

El Kiana rolled her eyes to the ceiling, and others also sighed in relief.

'We really did well.'

His standards were notoriously strict, but he wasn't the type to torment innocent people.

"The flow is good. Let's change the concept of a few sections. It feels like the impact is leaking."

The man wearing horn-rimmed glasses looked at the names written on the sheet music, then matched them with faces one by one.

"Hmm, Shibi Maya?"

"Yes."

"You handle emotional contrast well. El Kiana's last part - I'd like to hear it with your voice too."

"Wait a minute!"

El Kiana raised her hand like she used to in childhood.

"If you change that part, the roles change too. Wouldn't that change the interpretation of the song?"

"That's what we should do. What's the problem? I'm saying let's listen and then decide."

That's exactly why she felt bad.

'I acknowledge that Maya's emotional expression is good. But to experiment by changing the interpretation...'

She didn't think she had done terribly.

"What did I do wrong? Please tell me instead. Then I'll fix it."

"El Kiana."

Panier took off his glasses.

"Don't be arrogant."

She, returned to her days of taking lessons, couldn't move a finger.

"Making some money and now you think you're untouchable? Do you think you became famous because you're great?"

His gaze swept over the artists.

"Society decides what abilities are needed. In the old days, someone good at catching rabbits would have been a genius. But now? Just a hunter."

"El Kiana, you told me this. That you wanted to become the most famous in the world."

"...Yes."

"If you still think you're great and want to sing your own songs, I'll give you the chance now."

El Kiana bowed her head and stepped back.

"No."

"Why not?"

Everyone turned in surprise at Maya's sudden question.

Panier put his glasses back on.

"What did you say?"

"I understand what you're saying, Mr. Panier, but you're pushing too hard toward the 'no' side. Isn't it true that everyone works hard because they want to do their own art?"

El Kiana whispered,

"Hey, are you crazy?"

To actually argue with a master who was trying to give her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

'What kind of mindset is that?'

Unlike the artists' concerns, Panier looked at Maya with calm eyes.

'Their own art...'

He recalled a man who loved music and guitar but was clumsy about life.

"Troubling."

In a secret room in the Kaeshia Kingdom sector, Fermi checked Apocalypse information.

When laws changed, the contents of artifacts also changed, but some information remained the same.

Opening the triple-secured box, Fermi took in the contents of the memo.

A short phrase appeared on his retina.

'This one doesn't change.'

After thinking of Shirone's face for a while, Fermi shook his head and took a deep breath.

"Let's work, work."

Equipped with a magnifying glass, he picked up tweezers and began fitting together paper scraps on the desk like a puzzle.

'Cell Buster.'

One of the worst events that would occur in the future.

A piece of paper with a name written on it fit almost perfectly next to that torn section.

'This guy is one of the Seven Sorcerers...'

Guitarman.
