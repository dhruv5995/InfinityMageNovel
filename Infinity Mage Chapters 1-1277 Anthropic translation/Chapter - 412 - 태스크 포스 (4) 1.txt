[412] Task Force (4)

Sirone's group followed Mahatu through the complex maze.

The warriors who learned he was a messenger of god all knelt in unison, and even after entering the commune, they received warm hospitality from the tribespeople.

Unlike Kadum, who had offered massive tributes to the messenger of god to obtain eternal life, Mahatu operated Kergo's funds transparently.

The tribespeople's lives had improved, and the faces of those passing by were full of vitality.

Although he hadn't specifically fought for Kergo, Sirone, who had opened Guffin's door and headed to heaven, was truly their savior.

"I'd like to hold a festival if I could, but the situation seems urgent."

"Yes. We need to get to heaven as quickly as possible."

Mahatu didn't ask about the circumstances in heaven.

The Kergo people still worshipped Ankera and revered angels, but what mattered most to him was the tribespeople's livelihood.

Sein asked.

"How many are waiting? I heard earlier that it was at full capacity."

When an Unlocker opened Guffin's door, anyone could go to heaven, but Miro had created the Room of Achievement and Sacrifice to prevent indiscriminate travel to heaven, arranging it so only chosen warriors could pass through.

If it was at full capacity, it meant quite a few people were currently waiting here for an Unlocker to arrive.

Mahatu clicked his tongue awkwardly.

"Actually, there aren't that many. About 7 people."

"That's strange. Then why did you block entry?"

"Well... it's actually not something I can discuss. But you'll understand when you see for yourself."

Gaold didn't care.

After all, the only business they had in Kergo was Guffin's door.

If there were skilled people among those waiting to go to heaven, he'd take them along, but given the high level of his team members, it would be difficult to match.

"Fine. Let's go see first and get this over with quickly."

Mahatu quickened his pace as if showing sincerity.

They arrived at a massive iron door carved with giant sculptures.

"This is the Room of Warriors. The warriors who wish to go to heaven are waiting here."

When Mahatu opened the iron door, Gaold immediately entered and the group followed.

The 7 warriors Mahatu had mentioned were scattered in different locations, sitting and watching Gaold with sharp eyes.

A swordsman sitting with a longsword in his arms asked.

"Are you a warrior or an angel?"

Gaold didn't respond and checked the faces of the 7 people, then turned to Sein and said.

"They need to be at least certified 6th class. If they're not that level, they're not worth evaluating."

A mage in the corner frowned.

"You speak as if you're certified 6th class yourself."

"What if I am?"

"Haha! So that's why you're so arrogant? I've killed countless so-called certified mages. Evaluating skill by grade is anachronistic. How much hell you've experienced - that's what determines life and death."

The mage revealed the 5 rings on his right hand and stepped forward.

The man holding the sword said irritably.

"Hey, I believe I asked first."

"Doesn't matter, does it? Anyone with skill can go. Wasn't that the rule?"

The mage standing in front of Gaold wiggled his right hand, gesturing for him to come.

"I'll teach you the realm beyond grades."

Gaold's index finger pointed at him.

The moment the air gun fired with a bang, the mage's body was slammed into the wall. Spitting blood and falling on his bottom, he hung his head low and couldn't move anymore.

"Next."

Sirone narrowed his eyes.

Though he hadn't struck with the intent to kill like in the bunker beneath the association, Sirone knew better than anyone the power of Gaold's air gun.

"I also agree with what that fellow just said."

An elderly mage loosened his neck and walked to the center.

"There is a realm beyond grades. But for those without the skill to back it up, theory is just delusion. I'll be a bit different...!"

As the mage's face crumpled to one side, Gaold's hand, having cast teleportation, struck across his face.

The mage's head shook left and right like a punching ball before he fell like a wooden block.

"Next."

Watching two people get eliminated in an instant, the remaining five didn't move.

This wasn't simply a team crossing over dreaming of striking it rich on heaven's outskirts.

This was clearly a task force with business in heaven.

When no one stepped forward, Gaold pointed to the swordsman sitting with his sword.

"Hey, you. Didn't you say something about order earlier?"

The swordsman kept his mouth firmly shut and glared at Gaold.

Then suddenly his expression relaxed and he raised both hands as if giving up.

"Hehe, I surrender. Acknowledging skill is also...! Ugh!"

Gaold, who had rushed over like a dog, threw a punch.

When the press magic exploded on the swordsman's jaw, his face bounced in the direction of the hit and slid across the ground.

"They're all just talk anyway."

The atmosphere in the room rapidly cooled.

Gaold looked around at the remaining 4 people who were staring blankly at him, then turned his head toward the door and said.

"All of you get lost. If you don't want to die."

Without anyone going first, the four people flailed their limbs and rushed out the door.

With only the unconscious ones and Sirone's group remaining, a chilly atmosphere settled over the Room of Warriors.

Gaold dusted off his hands and turned toward the door.

"Done. Clean work."

"There's still one more person remaining."

Mahatu entered the Room of Warriors.

Certainly his skill would be a level above those who had been here, but in Gaold's opinion, going to heaven was still too much for him.

"What? Are you challenging too?"

"No. Actually..."

Mahatu hesitated and looked outside the door.

"There's one more messenger of god. That person asked us not to let any more warriors in..."

"Huh?"

When Mahatu cleared the way, a familiar man entered.

It was Armin of Gwangan, the Eternal Contemplator.

"Well, well."

To catch a big fish, you need good bait.

For catching Armin, Siena was indeed perfect.

Siena's eyes turned cold.

Just how long would she have to be treated like a child before he was satisfied?

But when she actually saw Armin's face, contrary to her thoughts, her tone didn't come out harshly.

"Why did you come, oppa? Did you forget what I asked?"

"No, I remember. I didn't come with the intention of interfering in your life. I came to keep a promise to myself."

Gaold said.

"Sorry, but that won't work. I don't work with the White Line. Can't tell what they're thinking."

"I left the Ivory Tower. Isn't that enough?"

Siena's eyes widened.

If he had thrown away the magical utopia that only the world's greatest mages could enter like an old shoe, it meant his resolve was extraordinary.

"Wh-why? And what about Keira..."

Armin remained silent about the internal circumstances. However, a hint of heaviness briefly crossed his expression.

"Siena, nothing in this world is more precious than you. Heaven is a dangerous place. I absolutely cannot let you go to such a place alone. If only for the sake of the Olifer School people who raised me."

"Siena is a certified 5th class mage."

"Quan..."

Siena was surprised that the taciturn Quan had spoken up.

"I roughly understand what kind of relationship you have, but you seem to be underestimating her too much. And you don't need to worry about Siena's life or death. No one will die before I do."

A mage was the position that had to survive until the very end in a party.

Regardless of skill, having them die first was something that hurt a swordsman's pride.

'Quan, is it...'

The demon of the sword who had cut down as many as 2 people against Pungzhang, the continent's strongest swordsmanship group.

It seemed such a person looked favorably upon Siena.

While it was somewhat comforting in a situation where they had to follow the madman Gaold, the disappointment as an older brother was unavoidable.

'Well, what right do I have...'

Excluding Siena, everyone welcomed Armin's joining.

The master of time magic who had conquered the speed of light.

Especially the stop magic that froze time was the world's strongest crowd control technique.

"Fine, if you're not related to the White Line, I'll accept you. But I'm the one in command to the end. If you disobey, I'll remove you from the team, so keep that in mind."

Armin had no complaints either.

With Siena held hostage, fighting for the team was the best method.

Thus, with heaven in sight, the final 10-person Miro rescue team was formed.

'Wow, looking at everyone gathered, it's really incredible.'

Sirone couldn't believe he was part of this team.

It was a task force gathering the best skilled individuals regardless of White, Red, or Black lines.

Mahatu gave them all the remaining rooms.

The 10 people, each getting separate rooms, ate dinner and gathered in the largest room as a meeting room.

The time to open Guffin's door was 6 AM tomorrow morning.

Considering the association's pursuit, leaving immediately was also an option, but they'd have to sleep first anyway after crossing over.

Since even taking rest could become warfare once they entered heaven, it was better to spend the night here.

Gaold spread out the map Kang Nan had given him on the table.

It was a spray chart with colored dots marking various locations on heaven's map.

"Heaven is currently experiencing a period of great upheaval. A revolution has broken out among the divine citizens, and rebels are active. What you're seeing now is a real-time threat map showing boundary zones of level 2 and above. Ah, I should remove the word 'real-time.' It's from 3 months ago."

Gaold's personal guard, who had been conducting intelligence missions in heaven, had sent this map as their last communication before losing contact.

Sein said.

"After confirming Estas, we need to modify our existing strategy. Confirming Miro's condition is the top priority. Depending on the circumstances, changing the coordinates of the Akashic Records might be meaningless."

Ethella said.

"If heaven kidnapped Miro, shouldn't we reset our understanding of the enemy's condition first? It means they're already prepared to some extent."

"Right. Infiltration through preemptive strike will be difficult. We'll have to see the situation, but we'll use a strategy of causing maximum disturbance before infiltrating."

Armin said.

"Causing disturbance in heaven? There aren't many methods. Are you thinking of using the rebels?"

"That's definitely in my mind. But the rebels won't move easily. That's why we need the ancient weapon Targis. If we can neutralize heaven's interception system 'Aegis,' they'll think differently too."

Armin shook his head.

"No. Even if we can break through Aegis, the probability of rebels engaging in full-scale war is almost zero. Since most were divine citizens, they know heaven's power better than anyone. If Mecca and Norr were united, it would be a force heaven couldn't ignore, but the problem is fear. Ingrained fear isn't easily forgotten."

"Fear can be removed. Heaven's movements will likely deviate greatly from our expectations anyway. We'll deal with things as they come. We have the masterpiece after all."

Siena asked.

"What do you mean? Masterpiece?"

Sein looked at Sirone.

"That's you, Sirone. If you succeed, it could have an effect equivalent to moving the entire rebel force. So let's hear it now. Just how exactly are you planning to blow up heaven?"

As everyone's attention suddenly focused on him, Sirone swallowed nervously with a tense expression.

This was something that had to be explained before departing for heaven, but the atmosphere was different from when he had told Gaold.

From now on, every word would become strategy in actual combat.

Gaold pushed his chin forward as if vouching for him.

"Kekeke, no need to hesitate, Sirone. From what I can see, it's a completely insane magic."

'That's exactly why I'm more anxious...'
