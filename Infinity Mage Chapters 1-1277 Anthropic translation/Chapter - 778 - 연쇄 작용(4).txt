[778] Chain Reaction (4)

Near midnight.

All districts of Kashan's imperial capital Aganos were lit up, and festivals were in full swing on the streets.

'Kashan at night.'

The cityscape emanating enormous energy looked like witnessing an unknown civilization hidden deep in space.

Sirone, flying beside Jet, asked.

"Are you going straight in again?"

With card players sitting in a row behind Jet, Minerva fell into thought.

'The situation is different from Nameymond.'

While the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower had no reason to be cautious even in Kashan, Uorin was a special opponent.

'Mitochondrial Eve...'

Her influence in reading world affairs through History Search was supreme even among the Three Emperors.

She was also the commander of the Valkyries, an anti-Heaven force, and even in the Holy War, there was an atmosphere that acknowledged her as the implicit leader.

"Kashan's army isn't worth considering. The problem is the world-famous Aganos Guard."

Minerva held up three fingers.

"The iron rule is this: the Outer Guard protects the Empress's buildings, the Middle Guard protects the Empress's space, and the Inner Guard protects the Empress's daily life."

"So the Outer Guard is outside the imperial palace, the Middle Guard is inside the imperial palace, and the Inner Guard is on the floor where Uorin stays."

Minerva thoughtfully bit her pipe.

"The Aganos Guard - Inner Guard. Even their regular members are said to match generals in skill. They'll attack if we invade their territory."

Though Uorin had requested this meeting, without special orders, the guards had no choice but to draw their swords.

"Let's get off in front of the imperial palace. That would be better."

"You're misunderstanding something. What I'm saying is, since they're tough opponents, let's smash through from the start. We're going straight to the Empress's room like this."

Sirone's eyes narrowed.

"Why are you so twisted?"

"As I always say..."

An explosion erupted from Jet's thruster.

"You are you, I am me!"

Cutting through the air at terrifying speed, Minerva's eyes blazed with intensity.

'She deceived me completely.'

At the time, she never even thought it could be Teraze.

'Huh, it's quiet?'

Even though the Aganos Guard's Outer Guard should have already taken action, there was no sign of movement from the ground.

"Wait a minute!"

Sirone urgently followed behind, shouting, but this only made the fire burn hotter inside.

'Whatever you're thinking, you've got the wrong person!'

As Minerva and the card players floated in mid-air, Jet shot forward like an arrow.

The wall exploded with a thunderous roar.

"Why is she really acting like this?"

Sirone spat out irritably, but it was too late to reverse the situation.

"Hmm."

Minerva, who had entered the imperial palace through the collapsed wall, pulled Jet out from where it was embedded in the floor.

"No one's here?"

Sirone, who had followed with the card players, extended her hand.

"Wait a minute. This doesn't seem right..."

Then Gando entered through the door.

"You've arrived. Her Majesty is waiting."

Despite the unauthorized intrusion and destruction of palace property, he said nothing about it.

"What? Where did the guards go?"

"There were special orders. Instructions to ensure no inconvenience in hosting the guests."

If it were any empire other than Kashan, they might have considered the hospitality excessive, but the opponent was Mitochondrial Eve.

'Is this also part of the design?'

Minerva, recalling past memories, clicked her tongue and began walking as Gando guided them.

The place they arrived at was a room in a completely different location from where Sirone had come before.

"You came, Sirone."

In a room sparkling with crystal lighting, Uorin waited with her hands clasped together.

"..."

Minerva's mouth fell open, and the card players also stared in a daze.

She wore light makeup with a red ribbon around her neck and a black dress that matched her white hair.

"Beautiful."

Sirone had never known such beauty could exist in the world.

'Well done, Gando.'

As unconcealed joy spread in Uorin's eyes, Gando finally breathed a sigh of relief.

'Now Her Majesty can handle the rest.'

What looked most beautiful to Gando would also look most beautiful to Sirone.

In contrast, distrust settled in Minerva's eyes.

'What is this? Why is she acting like this?'

Her mind was confused by temperament so different from the Teraze she knew.

'This is like...'

Wasn't this the appearance of a woman in love?

'It's not strange for Teraze to want Sirone.'

But if it were truly urgent, she could just forcibly extract his seed by any means necessary.

'The choice to obtain through love is too inefficient. No, efficiency aside, it's meaningless to Teraze.'

Sirone said.

"Sorry for causing a disturbance. I wanted to enter quietly."

"It's fine. I already knew and prepared for it."

When she heard that Minerva would be accompanying him, Uorin thought she might ruin everything.

"That's Uorin for you. You look really beautiful today."

Uorin felt dizzy enough to lose consciousness.

'What should I do? It's worse than I expected?'

Even unrequited love has its limits, but this was someone she'd kept in her heart since primitive times.

Her desire had grown so large it pressed down on her reason, and her body was so hot she felt like she'd become a beast.

Minerva approached with a smile.

"It's been a while, sister."

"Ugh."

At those words that poured cold water on her burning heat, Uorin's expression immediately crumpled.

"Sister?"

Tilting her head in thought, Sirone recalled the contents of Uorin's letter and realized.

'Come to think of it...'

Minerva pointed at Uorin.

"Of course she's my sister. Or should I call her senior? She's the one who taught me various things about the joy of being a witch."

Though Teraze had lived as a witch before becoming Kashan's Empress, Uorin didn't want to bring that up.

"It's part of history. But as you know, Teraze isn't one person, right? You should know that the Teraze who was your senior no longer exists in this world."

"Must be nice, so convenient."

While Teraze endlessly changed bodies through generations, Minerva's body remained the same as when she was a witch.

Uorin gave her a hint.

"I feel sorry about that time. But I didn't lead you to become a witch either, we just met by chance..."

"Hoho! Right! We met there back then. Now I remember."

Minerva placed her hand on Sirone's shoulder and whispered in his ear while looking at Uorin.

"Do you know what an amazing witch Teraze was? Her name was Electra or something like that. Right?"

"Um, can't we talk about old stories later?"

Minerva didn't even pretend to listen.

"I really learned a lot from getting along with sister. I was so surprised. One time she was with nearly 100 men at once..."

The pupils of Minerva, who had been chattering excitedly, wavered.

"..."

Uorin, who was trying hard to keep her lips pressed together but trembling, was shedding tears with reddened eyes.

Killing intent rose from Gando's body.

'Should I kill her?'

Perhaps he should call Pungrang.

"Uorin, are you okay?"

Just as Sirone extended her hand, Uorin suddenly turned her body and ran out of the room.

Sirone, who had been staring blankly at that sight, frowned and turned to look at Minerva.

"Why do you keep saying unnecessary things? When the person involved doesn't want to hear it."

"What did I do? If the person involved wants to talk about it, they can. Anyway, it's the truth, isn't it?"

Since Sirone could understand Minerva's feelings, she couldn't probe deeper.

Gando raised his chin and approached.

"You were prepared for the consequences when you ran your mouth, right?"

"How about knowing your place before butting in, kid? Anyway, go comfort your Empress and bring her back. We have things to do too."

"I'll go."

Sirone looked at Gando.

"Please take me to Uorin. Since this happened because of me, if I comfort her, she'll feel better."

Gando fell into thought.

'If she thinks even a little that Her Majesty is dirty...'

Then he would use all of Kashan's military power to erase Minerva from this world.

"Please take me to her."

He who had been staring intently at Sirone's eyes turned his body.

'She's not that kind of person.'

It was something he'd realized since first meeting her at the Tormia Magic Association.

"Follow me. She'll be in the annex."

Guided by Gando, Sirone arrived in front of Uorin's room and slowly knocked on the door.

"Uorin, are you inside?"

No answer was heard.

"I'm coming in for a moment."

Nodding to Gando, Sirone opened the door and entered, then blinked while holding the door handle.

Uorin was sitting cross-legged on the bed, smiling and gesturing.

"Ah..."

Sirone, conscious of Gando, hurriedly closed the door and entered, and Uorin got up from the bed.

"You came at the right time. Sit here."

"Did your mood improve a bit?"

"Not at all. I really hate that woman. But it's not like I don't understand."

Uorin offered her alcohol.

"Drink. I didn't put sleeping pills in it, so don't worry."

Finally she felt relieved.

"Actually, I wasn't being rational either. I was too emotional thinking about meeting you. Thanks to Minerva, I cooled down."

"Then why did you run out crying?"

"Because I have something I want to talk about alone."

As Sirone put down her glass and waited, Uorin avoided her gaze and said.

"Shall we make love here and now?"

"Uorin, that's..."

"I know too. There's someone else in your heart. And you think that heart will never change forever, right?"

Sirone honestly nodded.

"I also have the great responsibility of Kashan. So let's make love here. We can end everything with that."

"I can't do that. That would be..."

It would be a betrayal of Amy.

"I'm saying this for your sake."

Uorin met Sirone's eyes.

"I can't tell you the details, but I know a way to make you inevitably love me. And if I use this method, whether you like it or not, you'll have to become my man."

She never thought hearts could be stolen.

"Gando worries about me. But I don't worry. I've prepared for a long time, and the method to win your heart is already perfectly established in my mind."

Since these were the words of the designer of history, Mitochondrial Eve, they couldn't be dismissed as boasting.

"In the end, I'll have you. Regardless of your sadness. Rather, I want that. So this is the last kindness my emotions are offering. If you love me just for today, I'll let you go too."

As Sirone remained silent, Uorin added.

"Let me be clear - there won't be a second chance. This is your last opportunity to love Amy."

Last opportunity.

'I'll end up choosing Uorin?'

She couldn't even guess what circumstances would lead to that, but she wouldn't tell anyway.

"Nothing will change."

Sirone was firm.

"I don't want to hurt Amy. If I truly loved you, it would be different, but other than that, I will never change my heart."

"...I understand."

Uorin closed her eyes.

'So it comes to this after all.'

Even if minor events were useless during the Great Purification, Mitochondrial Eve's perspective differed from humans.

By integrating all events that had occurred so far, it was vaguely possible to predict what would happen next.

Above all, Uorin was a human with the most powerful future sight among the Teraze.

"Fine, Sirone."

Uorin smiled.

"Let's go out. Now we have work to do."

Since Sirone would eventually fall into her embrace anyway, Uorin could gladly smile and let him go.
