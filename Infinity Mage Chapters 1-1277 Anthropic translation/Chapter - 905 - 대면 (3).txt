Confrontation (3)

"Time remaining until purification: 65,400 hours."

It had been an eon-like passage of time since Guffin fell into hell.

'Truly an immense span of time.'

Shirone's mind was in a daze.

It was fortunate that Omega operated at one-thousandth the rate - if he had experienced Guffin's time at full intensity, he might have gone insane.

Guffin muttered.

"Time sure flies."

His body had withered to skeletal thinness, his face so gaunt that his eyes were sunken deep into their sockets.

But his mind remained intact, and that fact alone sent chills through Shirone.

'Though 60 quintillion hours haven't actually passed.'

Time was a realm of sensation, and hell was a space where that sensory function was maximized.

'Intense sensation accelerates the flow of time.'

In other words, the stronger the intensity of pain Guffin endured, the shorter his purification time became.

'That is the nature of time.'

Shirone recalled the memory of decomposing an instant into infinity in the state of Nothingness.

The bizarre signals he had seen when diving deeper past each second's 0.666 seconds.

'Those must be the special signals that govern the relativity of time and sensation.'

The truth of time.

'Ultimately, what the being who created this world wants isn't for evil to be punished, but the efficiency of data purification.'

Shirone's eyes filled with sorrow.

'Is God indifferent?'

Harboring the same question, Guffin arrived at the end of hell, blocked by a black wall.

Staring intently at it, the wall's darkness seemed to move as if alive.

"The end of space."

Though expressed as a wall, it was actually the entrance to a world of nothingness where nothing existed.

It was also the final gateway reached by the emotions of the other world after undergoing purification.

'Ozent Guy.'

Shirone guessed what end Lian's older brother, who had passed the link to him before disappearing, had met.

'He went to the eternal world of nothingness, but perhaps it wasn't as terrible as one might think.'

After all, the Jinseong-eum would be wandering hell without even getting a chance at purification.

"The wall of infinity."

At the voice from behind, Guffin turned to see an angel with shadow-black wings walking toward him.

Confirming it was Lucifer, the lord of hell, Guffin raised the corners of his mouth for the first time in ages and lifted his hand.

"Did you come to see me off?"

Perhaps because they had fought fiercely for over 60 quintillion hours, he no longer felt like a stranger.

But Lucifer ignored Guffin's joke and turned his gaze to the wall of infinity.

"Why are you thinking impatiently? Just endure another 65,000 hours and you'll be purified."

"Because I don't want to stay here for even one more hour."

Of course that was true.

But it wasn't something that should come from Guffin, who had calmly endured 60 quintillion hours.

Lucifer asked.

"Are you still harboring vain hope?"

Since falling into hell, Guffin had searched for a way to return to the real world, but it had proven impossible.

Unlike crossing through Bakji, subjects of purification could not escape the other world.

'Because that's how this world was made.'

Guffin looked back at the wall of infinity.

"Hope is a good thing. If I break through the realm of nothingness, I should be able to return to the real world. When that happens, hell will have to go on strike too."

From Lucifer's perspective, it was madness.

"Why are you so obsessed with reality? Hell has already been devastated because of you. Someone like you could live a sufficiently happy life even here."

"Yes, that's right. I've spent a lot of time here. It must have been truly long. But now that it's actually passed..."

Guffin shrugged his shoulders.

"Those eons turned out to be no different from an instant."

"Isn't that right? Time seems to keep flowing, but eventually when you reach the end of the future..."

When the moment comes where only the past remains.

"All memories are just one feeling contained in zero seconds. How long you've lived has no meaning at all."

Therefore.

"Beings who cannot transcend infinity are illusions. Me, you, and your sibling..."

Guffin pointed at Lucifer.

"Ikael too."

Originally there were nine archangels.

Eight concepts that formed the world, and one more concept that stood as the antithesis of those concepts.

The archangel of chaos, Lucifer.

"Of course, Ankera didn't create you. Because you were never born. You could be called minus energy belonging to non-existent time, non-existent events."

Called the outside of law.

"In the great cycle, you and the angels are the number 2 of law. When the angels' concepts weaken, chaos grows stronger, but..."

Guffin winked as he spoke.

"That doesn't mean you can meet Ikael."

At the words that hit the mark, Lucifer wrinkled his nose, but arguing would only hurt himself.

"So you're going to gamble on crossing the wall of infinity? If you fail, you'll face eternal annihilation."

"I don't care."

Guffin's eyes became serious.

"Even after 60 quintillion hours pass, what remains is ultimately emptiness. If God is truly indifferent, that's fine too. It means I wouldn't mind becoming God myself."

That was why he remained as his own signal instead of choosing reincarnation like his other companions.

Guffin walked toward the wall.

"Shall I get going?"

He would shatter infinity.

"Wait."

At Lucifer's words, Guffin turned his head.

"It doesn't seem like enough for a farewell?"

Lucifer felt chills at the fact that he could smile even while heading toward annihilation.

"Do you really think it can exist? Not an indifferent god, but a god who loves this world."

"Hmm, it is indeed difficult. That's not what the concept of god is like. But if I were god..."

Guffin looked up at the ceiling as he spoke.

"Wouldn't it be okay to plant at least some hope? Even if it's just a single signal."

Lucifer was silent for a long time.

'Messiah.'

If he could really accomplish that...

"I'll send you back to reality."

At Lucifer's unexpected words, Guffin playfully raised his eyebrows.

"Oh? That took quite a while. How did you hold back when your mouth must have been itching to say it?"

"It's not like a method. I can't prevent purification in any way. But precisely because of that, I can send you."

Guffin realized.

"Don't tell me, you..."

"That's right. Purification just needs to be done somehow. I'll be annihilated in your place. After all, I'm the only one in hell who can replace data of your caliber."

"Hmm."

Guffin, resting his chin in thought, asked.

"You know what kind of pain it is, right? It'll be on a different level from what I endured."

"In exchange... there's a condition."

Guffin chuckled.

"I thought so."

"If you truly want to give meaning to the world of emptiness, share that meaning with us too."

Because it couldn't end as just a signal.

"I understand the sentiment."

Guffin showed a troubled expression.

"But you're different from humans. That means you have no link. You're just part of the system that forms this world."

"Ikael."

Lucifer said firmly.

"Grant meaning to her. Not as just a system, but the meaning of existence like yours. This is my condition."

"Ikael."

Of all angels, that stubborn archangel.

"I thought you hated her?"

In fact, Ikael, the beginning of law, and Lucifer, the chaos outside law, had never actually met.

Like how existence and non-existence cannot combine.

But precisely because of that, Lucifer hated and envied Ikael more than anyone.

He still remembered.

The moment of creation, the figure of Archangel Ikael born with a smile amid brilliant explosion.

The first emotion he felt then was.

'Why was I...'

Born so ugly?

Through Omega's records, Shirone knew how great Lucifer's resentment had been.

'Yin and yang.'

Two extremes split apart from the moment of birth.

Emerging from his reminiscence, Lucifer continued with a hollow expression.

"I was jealous. Even though we were beings born from the same place, why was I so ugly?"

It wasn't about appearance, but about concept.

"Why do I hate Ikael? Why do I think of myself as ugly and Ikael as beautiful?"

"So did you realize?"

"Perhaps."

While fighting Guffin for over 60 quintillion hours, changes had occurred in Lucifer's heart too.

"Because I can't have her."

Lucifer smiled sadly.

"All I can do is hate. But not anymore. If it's all emptiness anyway..."

If emotions are also just signals.

"At least I want the end to be with love. Love is better than hatred, don't you think?"

Just as Lucifer felt Ikael was beautiful when they pointed to each other equally.

Shirone doubted his own senses.

'Love?'

The word "love" coming from the mouth of hell's lord.

'Ah...'

At that moment, what suddenly came to mind were the last words of demon general Igor.

'This was it.'

â€”There are some demons who repent, though not many.

Guffin asked.

"What about hell?"

"Just because I disappear doesn't mean evil disappears. The initiative just passes to humans. I'm curious what kind of hell they'll create, but..."

Lucifer shrugged.

"If most humans are like you, this place won't be too bad to live in either."

"What if humans become corrupt?"

"Hmph, someone returning to reality doesn't need to worry about hell. Anyway, a lord created by humans will rule this world. Let's call him Satan for now."

"Satan."

Humans, please exercise restraint.

"Go. When my purification ends, you can return to reality. Your Ultima will become stronger with hell's lord repenting, but..."

Lucifer's demonic eyes flashed.

"Ankera is strong."

Guffin nodded.

"I know. But I'm not alone. All Gaians will unite to attack."

"Ikael won't help you."

Guffin knew how conservative and prideful she was.

Lucifer's fangs glinted.

"But you must keep your promise."

Since it was a deal with the fate of the universe at stake, Guffin had no intention of breaking it carelessly.

"I'll do my best. Under no circumstances will I abandon Ikael."

Lucifer was finally satisfied.

"That's enough."

As he closed his eyes and smiled while thinking of Ikael, a cold voice was heard.

"Time remaining until purification: 764 years, 1,428 kyung, 9,984 trillion, 1,298 billion, 11 million, 763 thousand, 329 hours."

The price of repentance.

Guffin, who had left the wall of infinity, finally disappeared from view only after about a day had passed.

"...How much is left?"

Lucifer asked the sky.

"Time remaining until purification: 764 years, 1,428 kyung, 9,984 trillion, 1,298 billion, 11 million, 763 thousand, 329 hours."

Not even an hour had decreased.

"Heh, I see."

In hell, time converts to sensation, and hell's lord wouldn't feel pain.

"How pathetic."

As Lucifer looked up at the sky, his eyes became distant and Ikael's phantom appeared.

"Ah..."

As vast as the distance between nothingness and existence, so too would his love be.

"If I could see you just once."

He reached out toward her in front of him, but nothing could be grasped.

On the face of the weeping Lucifer, for the first time in his life, a beautiful smile formed.

"Ikael."

Heart-rending pain washed over him.

"I love you."

That pain was fully converted to time.

"AAAHHHHH!"

It exploded Lucifer's body into black ash and instantly pushed him toward the wall of infinity.

In the place where only silence lingered.

"...Purification is complete."

A woman's voice echoed softly.
