[731] Body (4)

Imperial Capital Aganos.

The administrator of the 3.8th floor where the Archmage lay sleeping entered Worin's room following Gando.

"Your Majesty, Sirone's debt has been fully repaid."

When no response came, the administrator cautiously added while reading the mood.

"Not a trace of debt remains."

It had been Worin's instruction.

'But this might not be Teraze's judgment.'

That's what Gando thought.

Originally, they should have left just one second's worth of Sirone's debt to seize the decisive moment.

In exchange, it wouldn't have been wasteful to keep one outstanding archmage from the empire eternally asleep.

'What made Her Majesty change?'

Worin spoke in a gentle voice.

"I understand. There will be a reward soon."

The administrator frantically waved his hands.

"No. I didn't expect such things..."

"Take it. You've worked hard all this time."

"Your grace is overwhelming."

No matter how deep the administrator's loyalty, his heart couldn't help but race at the prospect of a reward from Worin, who had the greatest magnanimity in the world.

"Your Majesty, why did you give such an instruction?"

After the administrator left the room, Gando asked.

Even an empress might fall in love, but clouded judgment didn't suit Teraze.

"Nothing has changed. I'm simply reshuffling the board."

Gando didn't know yet.

He didn't know what pain Worin had endured while waiting for this day since Sirone accepted the proposal of the Rainbow Dragon Karathorsa.

'This is the world where Sirone lives.'

Finally, they could meet.

"Gando, the world will change. Everything we've looked down upon will come crashing down on us."

What's truly important is...

Worin finally turned around and spoke with a warm smile never seen before.

"The beginning of the true Great Purification."

Ymir's fist cutting through the air trembled.

'What's happening?'

Even striking with Heart Fist at the speed of thought, his body was solid enough to show not even a slight crack.

'To suffer Heart Strike.'

But the mental impact when physical actions contradicted results was considerable.

'An angel's ability?'

According to his memory, the magic circle the mage had cast moments ago was Ikasa's Valhalla Action.

Sirone, who had grabbed Sung-eum and rolled on the ground, frowned.

"Urgh!"

He had pulled in all 19,000 versions of time to surpass Sung-eum's extreme situation, but the shock the main body received was beyond imagination.

'This is Ymir...'

He had faced countless powerful enemies, but this was the first to twist space-time with pure physical force.

"Princess! Are you alright!"

As the ether waves disappeared and space returned to normal, Munkyung checked on Sung-eum's condition.

"Princess...!"

What finally came into view was Sirone lying on top of Sung-eum.

'H-how...'

While Munkyung was shocked, Sung-eum's eyelids slowly opened.

"Mmm."

"Are you conscious? It would have been terrible if I'd been any later."

Sirone knew better than anyone the dangers of opening Immortal Function to its limits.

"Huh?"

Without time to recall recent memories, Sung-eum blinked at the surreal scene.

Sirone's face filled her entire field of vision.

'Strange. Why is he so close?'

The moment she felt Sirone's weight pressing on her skin and realized their embarrassing position.

"Huh? Uh, uh..."

Her brilliant wisdom and cold reason vanished, leaving only incomprehensible shock swirling in her mind.

"Y-you, you you you...!"

Munkyung had never seen Sung-eum stutter so severely.

"H-how dare! My, my body..."

Before she could finish speaking, Sirone lifted Sung-eum and cast teleportation to distance them from Ymir.

"Get it together. It's not over yet."

During the brief moment of teleportation, Sung-eum recalled Ymir's presence and pushed Sirone away as she stood up.

"Hmph, I merely underestimated my opponent."

It was judgment befitting an Ivory Tower candidate, but she couldn't hide her face flushed red as a persimmon.

'What disgraceful behavior...'

Having never allowed another's touch, she could still vividly feel Sirone's weight.

'To receive help from a competitor.'

Yet she couldn't repay the kindness of someone who saved her life with ingratitude, so her insides burned.

"What ridiculous fools."

What brought Sung-eum back to her senses was Ymir's fighting spirit that seemed to transcend biological limits.

Watching Ymir hunch his back as if ready to pounce, Sirone spoke.

"Be careful. If we don't finish him here..."

"I know."

Sung-eum's eyes regained their usual sharpness.

"I'll take responsibility. I absolutely won't let that monster loose in the world."

Though merely a molar of the main body, it still possessed enough force to instantly destroy a city.

"You don't seem to be the ones who woke me..."

When it came to combat, Ymir's animal instincts never missed the mark.

"Heart Strike?"

The moment Ymir's eyes widened, Sirone and Sung-eum felt their entire bodies twist.

'Incredible pressure...!'

It was eye technique on a completely different level from anything they'd experienced.

"Die."

The ground quietly collapsed, then Ymir's body disappeared with a thunderous roar.

'He's coming!'

It was a speed that couldn't be avoided by simple time perception, and Valhalla Action's magic circle appeared above Sirone's head.

'What?'

The calculation to reverse causality finished, but an overload caused his Spirit Zone to waver.

'No! If this breaks...'

The events experienced by all 19,000 Sirones would vanish meaninglessly.

"Sirone!"

Before Rian's voice could even reach him, Ymir changed direction at terrifying speed.

'This one!'

After so long, his combat instincts awakened and he felt every cell sparkling.

'A swordsman?'

The moment their eyes met.

'I've been cut.'

Having his heart cut first meant the swordsman before him was using the same technique.

"Hrraaaah!"

As Ymir raised his arm to block the great sword, veins bulged at both of Rian's temples.

'Damn! Blocked!'

It was his first experience of Heart Strike's impact.

"What are you?"

The scent was certainly familiar and therefore unpleasant, but Rian's appearance wasn't in Ymir's memory.

"Ymir?"

The moment Rian realized the identity and widened his eyes, Ymir struck his abdomen with a front kick.

"Annoying."

With a snapping sound, the elbow area broke and Rian's torso flew like a cannonball.

"Rian!"

Kido, who arrived late, caught him but couldn't withstand the impact and rolled across the ground.

"Aaaaah!"

Rian, who barely regained his balance, glared at Ymir while kneeling.

His two arms dangled from the handle of the great sword embedded in the giant's arm.

"Ymir."

Memories of countless sword strikes while thinking of him since meeting in heaven flashed like a slideshow.

"Hmm, Heart Sword. Even so..."

Ymir pulled out the great sword and dropped Rian's arms, then held <Idea> vertically.

"There aren't many swords that can cut my muscles."

Ymir held the sword horizontally, grasping both the handle and tip as if to bend it.

"Hrrrrr!"

As unimaginable force was applied, space began to ripple around Ymir.

"Here I gooooo!"

Finally, all the air was sucked in before exploding and shaking Andre.

Kuuuuuuung!

Munkyung, who had turned his head at the roar, looked back at Ymir and his face went pale.

'T-that can't be.'

Even with force that could kill people with wind pressure alone, not even a microscopic deformation was made to <Idea>.

"Keke. Kekekeke."

Ymir nodded and looked back at Rian.

"Now I understand why I was awakened."

The great sword was probably an Objet.

But as far as Ymir knew, only one being could imagine the concept of absolute indestructibility.

"What's your relationship with Augent?"

Rian stood up, bending his severed arms.

"I am Augent Rian."

"Huh? Augent?"

Ymir raised one eyebrow.

He couldn't feel any nostalgia for Augent from Rian's rough, masculine features.

"I don't remember, but..."

Unlike other parts, Ymir's molar had been independently buried in ruins from very long ago.

"Well, I'll know once we clash physically."

That was Ymir's way, and holding the great sword like a spear, he hurled it with tremendous force.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

Watching his sword pierce through walls and disappear, Rian's expression twisted.

Ymir dusted off his palms and spoke.

"It's not a sword you can wield by clumsily copying."

Without strength approaching that of the Giant King, one couldn't realize <Idea>'s true terror.

"Shall we start by dealing with the interference first?"

As Ymir turned around, Munkyung, who was protecting Sung-eum, drew his sword and shouted.

"Shut up! Who would let you..."

His words cut off mid-sentence, and Sirone and Sung-eum also looked with shocked eyes beyond Ymir's shoulder.

Crack! Crack!

At the distinctive sound of biological matter breaking, Ymir felt a chill and slowly turned his head.

"R-Rian..."

Kido, who had fallen on his bottom, trembled while looking up at a goblin-like creature resembling Rian.

"I've waited for this day, Ymir."

At the tip of his sword, there was always Ymir.

"Really? I don't know who you are."

Rian's back exploded and the ruptured muscle fibers fluttered like heat waves.

"Don't take a single step from there and come to me. Otherwise, you'll regret it."

Rian's Avatar technique was always powerful, but...

"Interesting. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens."

The enemy he faced now was Ymir, called the strongest being in history.

"Grrraaaah!"

Rian's eyes rolled back and the fluttering muscle fibers quickly twisted and were sucked into his body.

A muscular form completely unlike human, seemingly made only for battle - like looking at a goblin.

Divine Transcendence.

Complete Transformation.

"Pathetic imitation...!"

As Rian charged forward, crumbling the ground, Ymir also twisted his upper body with terrifying momentum.

On time's balanced seesaw, as their bodies moved slowly as if they'd never reach each other.

"Hiyaaaaa!"

Fists were exchanged at the speed of thought.

'Heart Fist! Heart Strike! Heart Fist! Heart Strike! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Strike! Heart Fist!'

As sounds like flesh being shredded burst in rapid succession throughout Andre, Munkyung trembled.

'What the hell...'

The sound alone felt like pain was being transmitted.

'What kind of human is he?'

For the first time, Ymir felt curious.

'Augent Rian. Augent... Huh?'

Among the pouring fists, Ymir's eyes sharpened as he confirmed Rian's face.

'Blue hair.'

Not Augent.

'I see.'

So it had been passed down.

'Smile!'

Looking at Rian's Heart Fist extending at tremendous speed, Ymir burst with joyful emotion.

"It's been a while, Augent!"

With a pop, both their jaws turned simultaneously, and the watchers' eyes squeezed shut.

"Gaah!"

One of Ymir's molars flew from his mouth and pierced through the labyrinth with tremendous force.

Kwaaaaang!

Munkyung stared in horror at the cleanly pierced cave wall, then his gaze returned to Ymir.

"Ptui!"

Spitting on the ground and wiping his lips, he spoke.

"...The second time."
