The Solar Battle (1)

The Eve Festival.

The cities surrounding the Zeta Plateau, where the Solar Battle would be held, shot fireworks into the sky all night long.

Participation qualifications: unlimited.

All High Gear users were gathering at the Zeta Plateau moment by moment even now.

Anyone could fight.

The fact that even members of the same nation could be marked as enemies seemed to foretell utter chaos...

"No need to worry about the mayflies." When actual combat breaks out, individual desires get swept away by the massive desires of the crowd.

"The most important thing is the Solar Palace. Among them, especially the Low Gear. It'll eventually be breached, but we need to buy as much time as possible."

The Ascension Guild's first team was holding a strategy meeting in the annex prepared at the Solar Palace.

Besides Ascension, the top 5 guilds in the Western Nation rankings were each secluded in their respective rooms.

The Operator spoke.

"If we hold out for 24 hours, we win. This Solar Battle, Ascension Guild will take on the command center role as the number one ranked guild. We'll operate the special task force and defend the citadel. First, the task force commander will be Little Witch."

"Yes."

Little Witch raised her hand.

"The eastern defense commander will be Ogre, western will be Rubymix, and Taedaecheon will handle the center."

Taedaecheon asked.

"What about the north?"

Since the Eastern Nation's starting point was south, breaking through the north gate would require a major detour around the Solar Palace.

"The Black Demon Guild agreed to handle it. If they deploy their entire first team, we should be able to maintain balance."

It was the Western Nation's 4th ranked guild.

"I've prepared the formation chart. I selected evenly from the 2nd and 3rd teams, so input the code names into the communication channel. I'll leave regional tactics to each commander."

The formation chart was transmitted through communication.

"Strategy meeting over. You can go out and enjoy yourselves until 3 AM. Just keep the guild channel open."

The Eve Festival celebration was one of the events High Gear users loved most.

There wasn't anything particularly special about it.

Just that there were an enormous number of users, and everyone was in an excited state before the Solar Battle.

Mental barriers would crumble, and the sense of safety provided by the group would easily welcome pleasure.

It was a night of debauchery and revelry.

As the Ascension first team members stretched and left their rooms, Little Witch remained sitting in her chair.

Breaking the awkward silence, the Operator asked.

"Not going to the festival?"

"What about you?"

"You've never been to a festival, have you? Countless users are waiting for an Operator."

"There's no need to comply with their demands. If there's freedom in High Gear, then not going to festivals is also my freedom."

Little Witch tried to read her intentions.

The white face with blonde bangs covering her eyes was merely indifferently beautiful.

"Hmm."

That's how it was.

"A false world where countless people enter and pour out their desires. But for you, is it the only real thing?"

"I don't understand difficult topics. I just... don't like exchanges I don't want."

"What did you talk about?"

Little Witch asked like a surprise attack.

"You went to Moon Island before. You must have met Yahweh2. It wasn't just to ask about her well-being."

The Operator slightly twisted her lips.

"Don't worry. I'm not threatening you. Just curious. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."

"Nothing special happened. We talked about each other, and there was some mutual understanding. But nothing will change. Anyway, Yahweh2 rejected my proposal."

"Proposal?"

"A proposal to live together in High Gear. I was rejected. So I just gave my own farewell greeting."

The Operator looked at Little Witch and gently brought her hand to her own lips.

"We kissed."

For a moment, murderous intent seemed to emanate from Little Witch's machine, but it was probably just an illusion.

The Operator asked.

"Why? Are you upset? Going to get revenge?"

"Pft!"

Little Witch's shoulders shook.

"What are you talking about? You didn't actually touch lips. This place is farther than dreams. If you think that way, what about the users enjoying themselves at the festival right now?"

The Empress of Kasha knew what would anger her opponent the most.

"...I suppose so."

It was merely respect sent by a fake.

"Yahweh2 probably didn't feel anything special either. All she cares about is winning the duel and dragging me into reality. But that's exactly why she can't beat me."

"I agree with that point."

Woolin had also grasped the essence.

'Shirone, if you don't realize the truth about that day's kiss, you'll never be able to beat the Operator.'

Therefore, mining Apocalypse and eliminating the demon realm in reality won't happen either.

In the end...

'You'll come to me.'

Spectacular fireworks unfolded in the sky above the Solar Palace.

The windows flashed repeatedly.

"Pretty."

While Death Princess watched the fireworks outside the window, the Gold Ring first team finished their meeting.

Fermi said.

"The key is that Yahweh2 doesn't die while heading to the Solar Palace. If we have to restart from the starting point, the Eastern Nation's forces will already be collapsed by then. All risk management prioritizes Yahweh2's survival."

"Understood."

In Gold Ring, Fermi's word was law.

"But..."

The only person who could oppose his words was Shirone.

"Let's change the strategy."

Not only the Gold Ring first team, but also Destruction Demon 707's group standing by the window turned around.

Fermi asked back.

"Why?"

The fact that he asked seriously meant that Fermi was also feeling some uneasiness.

"I don't think I can beat the Operator."

Silence flowed.

Wild West, who had been in charge of leveling up, lifted his cowboy hat and asked.

"Your current level is 307. Higher than initially expected, but still far from making it into the rankings anyway. Wasn't this already anticipated?"

"Of course, but..."

As Shirone trailed off, Fermi asked.

"If you have something to say, say it. If we need to change strategy, now is the last chance."

"If it were another user with the same level and same parts as the Operator, I could fight evenly. But the Operator is different. She perfectly understands the system. With martial arts at my level, the output difference will determine the outcome."

"That's what I told you - the win rate wouldn't even be 10 percent. Making that happen is your role."

"I know. It's just..."

Shirone recalled the Operator's kiss.

"It's not a matter of strategy. It's a matter of the heart. I strongly feel that this approach is wrong."

"The heart."

If it's not 0 percent, then it's 100 percent.

"If that's how you feel, then there's no chance of winning. So how do you want to change the strategy?"

"How about this?"

Shirone honestly opened up about everything he was currently feeling.

Fermi couldn't argue back.

"Long live the Eastern Nation! Long live the Eastern Nation!"

"The Western Nation will win. Tomorrow's sun will be ours too!"

As shouts erupted from both the Eastern and Western Nation camps, dawn gradually began to break.

10 minutes remaining until the Solar Battle begins.

When the notification message appeared in augmented reality, the shouting turned into complete screaming.

Even the earth-shaking noise was merely a faint echo inside the Solar Palace.

The Operator, kneeling alone while waiting for someone, checked the satellite footage.

The landscape of the area transmitted by Magnan's satellite communication function was truly spectacular.

Approximately 4,000 participants.

Among those users lined up like dense dots, Yahweh2 would also be there.

'Come.'

Today's defeat would be like the world's destruction for the Operator.

'I'll thoroughly destroy you, Yahweh2.'

Blue electricity entered her eyes hidden by blonde hair.

5 minutes remaining until the Solar Battle begins.

The countless Western Nation users waiting for enemies outside the Solar Palace were now silent.

As Woolin, Ascension's special task force commander, surveyed the front, someone approached from the side.

"Heh heh! We meet again."

The user whose lower body was shaped like a horse had the code name Horse-Head Warrior, ranked 76th in dueling.

"Because the special task force is the most fun."

"I agree. Defense doesn't suit my temperament. Where do you think will be the most intense? I'm thinking of going to the west gate."

"The center."

Horse-Head Warrior asked back puzzled.

"The center? Of course it'll be most intense at the end, but they won't break through from the beginning. Would the Eastern Nation engage in frontal confrontation while accepting casualties?"

"I'm going to the center."

Because Shirone would come there.

'Gold Ring will accept even friendly casualties to scatter the Western Nation's forces. The best way to do that is to break through the center in the shortest time possible.'

Woolin planned to cut off that route.

'I'll see you soon, Shirone.'

3 minutes remaining until the Solar Battle begins.

At the Eastern Nation's Gold Ring assembly area, Shirone conducted a final check of his machine's condition.

Yahweh2's left arm was equipped with another legendary weapon, 'Air God.'

'Activate.'

The inside of the arm opened, and a gun popped out and automatically gripped in his hand.

Death Princess looked over.

"That's Air God."

It was a weapon that could fire unlimited energy bullets through the command word 'Reload.'

"Yeah. Legendary grade. It's a weapon that can reduce durability by 10 regardless of armor efficiency."

"Will that be okay? If it drops 10 per shot, you'd need to hit a 500-durability part 50 times."

"But it has armor-piercing judgment. No matter what good firearm I choose at my level, it won't work against rankers."

It was Fermi's opinion that since the Michelan Gun had good firepower, the sub-weapon should focus on options.

"Reload."

When he input the command, energy was instantly recharged back to 100 percent.

Death Princess smiled.

"Work hard. We're nervous since it's our first time too, but we'll help you as much as we can."

"Hohoho! Just some people who barely raised their Magnan level, what are you going to accomplish in the Solar Battle?"

A user with a sleek metal body and a ponytail-like decoration on top of her head approached.

Code name: Princess.

She was ranked 93rd in level rankings.

"This is your first time actually doing the Solar Battle, right? You'll probably die the moment you clash. Have a good run from the starting point."

Destruction Demon 707 got fired up.

"Hmph! Even if it's our first time doing it, we've watched tons of broadcasts. And we're Gold Ring."

Princess shrugged her shoulders.

"Hah, Gold Ring's past their prime too. Even if it's the 3rd team, bringing someone in the 200 level range. And what's with those code names? Destruction Demon? Death Princess? Hohoho! Now that I look, you're just copying me!"

Death Princess's expression crumpled.

"Don't be ridiculous! I'm really a prin...!" She hastily stopped speaking and turned away as if she didn't want to deal with it, hiding in the crowd.

10 seconds remaining until the Solar Battle begins.

The countdown started, and all users checked satellite footage while preparing to advance.

The Solar Battle has begun.

The moment the message appeared, thousands of people simultaneously activated their High Gear, creating a thunderous roar.

The 20-kilometer distance was instantly shortened, and even before that, an exchange of fire began.

Peoooooooong!

270 people returned to the starting point.

"Quickly! Move faster!"

Little Witch led her unit charging toward the Solar Palace's main gate.

Having secured the main gate first, she used satellite footage to gauge Shirone's position.

"Huh?"

At that moment, she realized.

"What?"

The massive flow of the Eastern Nation captured in the footage was completely different from what she had initially expected.

'It's not the center.'

Just like the Western Nation, they were maintaining overall balance and engaging in tense confrontation.

"The Solar Battle..."

The meaning conveyed by the footage was clear.

"They intend to win."

Feeling electricity flow down her spine, her shoulders trembled.

"Hehe. Hehehe."

An excellent choice, Shirone.
