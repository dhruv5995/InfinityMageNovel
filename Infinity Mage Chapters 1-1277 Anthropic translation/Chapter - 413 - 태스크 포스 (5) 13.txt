[413] Task Force (5)

"It's okay to speak, Shirone. It's just a hypothesis. We'll listen and judge."

Encouraged by Zulu's words, Shirone repeated the explanation he had given to Gaold.

"First, it's magic based on Ataraxia."

"Of course it would be."

For Shirone to gain even a 1% chance of destroying heaven, starting with Ataraxia was the best approach.

"The casting direction will be toward the sky. So I'll deploy the magic circle above my head."

"Ho? The sky?"

It was certainly a unique way to begin.

As everyone's anticipation grew, Shirone continued.

"Ataraxia is trigger magic, so there's no set range limit. I thought shooting toward the sky would be the most effective way to maximize that advantage."

"I understand. Then... what will you shoot up?"

"A laser."

"A laser?"

Everyone present knew what a laser was.

But the sky was far too empty for destroying anything.

"Yes. I'll amplify the laser's linear properties with Ataraxia and shoot it as high as possible."

Flu asked.

"How high are we talking?"

"Well, it's a simple calculation, but roughly... about 6,000 kilometers."

"6, 6,000?"

Siena said.

"A laser could do it. It's a single linear wavelength. Combined with Ataraxia's amplification power and its trigger characteristics, even higher altitudes might be possible. So, Shirone?"

Shirone began his explanation in earnest.

"At an altitude of 6,000 kilometers, I'll cast Dark Sphere through the laser's information transmission method. It compresses god particles to a high degree, and using Ataraxia, I can create a mass of about 10 tons by planetary standards."

Whirrrrr!

Sein's Wheel Eyes spun rapidly.

Just from hearing this much, he realized what Shirone was planning to do.

All sorts of formulas began calculating in his mindâ€”complex yet precise.

Shirone spread his arms wide.

"Probably in the form of a spear? Actually, the form doesn't matter, but based on omnipotence, it would likely be that way. So a spear sculpted from light with a weight of 10 tons would be born. And then it..."

Sein, having finished his calculations, said.

"Falls."

"Yes. That's all there is to it."

That was everything.

And everyone was left speechless.

The mechanism was much simpler than expected.

But amazingly, it contained an idea more than sufficient to destroy heaven.

"But is it really possible?"

At Flu's question, Gaold looked to Sein. From now on, it was a matter for his servant brain to judge.

"It's possible."

Sein stated definitively.

"Simply put, a 10-ton mass falls from an altitude of 6,000 kilometers. If heaven's gravity is similar to this place's gravity, it would take roughly 14 minutes to reach the target. The mass spear would accelerate further under gravitational acceleration, and upon reaching terminal velocity, it would exceed 14 kilometers per second."

Flu's eyes widened.

"14 kilometers? Per second?"

At a speed of 14 kilometers per second, response would be impossible from the moment it entered visual range.

And the result would be the numerical representation of a 10-ton spear striking at Mach 41.

"That's what would happen. The kinetic energy generated alone, converted to explosive force, would be roughly 2.19 million kilobusters. That exceeds heaven's durability. If it just hits Araboth at the center, all seven heavens would be devastated."

If it was Sein's calculation, there would be no error.

Yet no one could accept the figures that had just been presented.

2.19 million kilobusters?

The very idea that a boy who was still just a student could produce such power was beyond common sense.

"Kekeke, how about that? I told you it was properly insane magic."

Gaold said.

"You know what I liked most when I first heard this story? There are no half-baked assumptions. What can and can't be done is clearly distinguished. I thought at best some graduating student would just spout nonsense, but that wasn't the case. Destroying heaven isn't Shirone's magic."

Sein said.

"Universal gravitation. The planet's gravity pulls the spear down and makes heaven destroy itself."

"Exactly. Those who worshipped god ultimately perish by god's hand. I call it 'Divine Punishment.'"

Shirone looked back at Gaold.

"I was going to call it Shining Spear though?"

"Names don't matter. Anyway, the problems are trajectory, impact point, and timing."

Sein said.

"I can calculate that. I'll make a chart as soon as we get to heaven. In about three days, I should have a grasp on the planet's movement, and then we can set the launch time."

Everyone began discussing new strategies and tactics to match the newly emerged variable.

Divine Punishment had such tremendous impact that it required a complete revision of the project's strategy.

While everyone engaged in heated discussion, only Siena was looking at Shirone with satisfaction.

Gaold seemed pleased that Divine Punishment utilized the properties of the natural world, but Siena's thoughts were the opposite.

Everyone knew that dropping 10 tons from an altitude of 6,000 kilometers would create tremendous destructive power.

But the reason no one attempted it was because lifting 10 tons required potential energy equivalent to the kinetic energy.

Therefore, Divine Punishment was not universal gravitation's magic, but Shirone's.

Amplifying a laser with Ataraxia to transmit information to altitude, then activating god particles there to gather mass.

Looking at just the result, it was a simple mechanism, but for Shirone starting from scratch, it was an application impossible without perfect understanding and analysis of what he possessed.

'You squeezed out every last drop.'

The supreme result created by compressing the ideas in his mind like diamond, leaving not the slightest gap.

That's why Siena could sincerely congratulate her student's great leap forward.

"But there's a condition."

Shirone interrupted the heated discussion.

"Ataraxia was received from Archangel Ikael. Therefore, I must meet Ikael before casting this magic. And I believe that was the contract."

No one was foolish enough to break a contract between team members.

But having gained the tremendously efficient weapon called Divine Punishment, wanting to temporarily ignore it was human nature.

Even the cold-headed Sein felt the same.

For Divine Punishment to activate, Ikael had to be brought into contact with Shirone.

Depending on the situation, this could be very easy, or perhaps impossible.

Regardless of difficulty, Sein disliked that uncertainty.

"We must keep the contract. Also, you have sufficient qualification to receive our help. But is that really the only option? If we give up on Ikael, we could do something equivalent. For example, assuming total annihilation of all of us, we could prioritize your survival above all else."

If uncertainty could be eliminated, that would be better.

That was how much weight Sein thought Divine Punishment carried in the project.

"No. I won't meet Ikael if it puts everyone in danger. But if it's not dangerous, then Divine Punishment isn't needed either. Even so, if it becomes dangerous, then there would be sufficient motivation to meet Ikael. Please understand that in such limited situations, there's no need to bind Ikael and Divine Punishment with different constraints."

"Hmm, so that's what you meant."

If the situation called for destroying heaven, it meant circumstances had already been pushed to the corner.

If even small probabilities had to be grasped, the case of Shirone meeting Ikael was also worth considering.

"Fine. I'm satisfied that team member safety is independent from Ikael's contact."

It was the best line Sein and Shirone could agree on.

The next morning.

Ten team members gathered in front of Guffin's Door.

Kergo's chief Mahatu and priests surrounded them while warriors formed two columns to see off the heaven expedition team's departure.

When Shirone opened Immortal Function, Guffin's Door decomposed into particles and transformed into a massive space-time tunnel.

As everyone shouted "Anke Ra," Gaold moved forward with an annoyed expression.

Perhaps they had returned to the beginning of everything.

"I'll smash your god to pieces."

With terrifying eyes raised, Gaold pushed his body into the black sphere without the slightest hesitation.

Kang Nan's expression was indifferent as she watched Gaold disappear, but her heart was churning more than ever before.

Sein recalled the 20-person Judgment Day in front of Guffin's Door.

After Miro left, Gaold became a wreck, but Sein envied him for being able to go purely insane.

Days of running madly solely for Miro's sake.

'I just need to save Miro. I don't need to worry about anything else. Even if the world ends...'

Sein's body was sucked into the black sphere.

'I'll save Miro.'

Armin looked back at Siena in front of Guffin's Door.

Just having Quan by her side made his heart ache.

'You must have felt the same.'

He could understand a little of her feelings having to just watch him live as a loving couple with Keira.

'But it was for your sake. To prove that, I'll stay by your side.'

Armin quickly turned his body as if erasing distracting thoughts and disappeared into Guffin's Door.

Even if the end of the world lay beyond, there was no reason to hesitate.

'Siena, if it's where you're going...'

Only after Armin disappeared did Siena's eyes fill with sadness.

She had wanted to become a mage with her brother. And she had wanted to see the world's many beauties.

The dream she had cherished since childhood had become reality, yet why wasn't she happy?

'No, don't think about it. Getting sentimental before a mission is foolish. I just need to do what I can.'

Quan watched Siena's retreating figure.

As a swordsman, all nine lives lay beyond his death.

Probably his chance of returning alive was only slightly higher than the miraculous possibility of all ten surviving.

Yet the reason he didn't feel entirely bad was probably because for the first time, he wanted to protect someone.

'Is that place my grave?'

A cold smile formed on Quan's lips as he headed toward certain death.

'Master, please give me strength.'

Etela closed her eyes and entered brief meditation.

Her sense of mission, honed through repeated training since her defeat by Arcane, was burning more fiercely than ever.

The moment Karsis Jung's warm voice telling her to become the world's light rushed into her mind like thunder, her eyes snapped open.

'Destroy evil. That is my mission.'

"Huu. Huu."

Flu did her utmost to suppress her adrenaline.

Joining the world's greatest mage team as a professional mage was an honor beyond anything else.

'I can't show inexperience. Trust what I've done so far. Right, I'm Rabid Flu. I can do this!'

No matter what hardships came, she would definitely succeed in the mission.

Having made this vow countless times as if carving it into her heart, she finally took her first step into Guffin's Door.

'A position where even death is an honor for me. I'll just do my best not to burden everyone.'

Shirone watched until the very end as all team members departed for heaven. Then he looked back as if reviewing the years that had passed.

His entire life flashed by like a panorama.

'Goodbye, everyone.'

Meeting life's beginning at life's end.

For Shirone, this journey held such meaning.

There could be no fear now.

Even if he lost everything, he intended to pour out everything in heaven so he wouldn't regret today's decision.

"Safe travels, messenger of god."

Receiving Mahatu's farewell, Shirone passed through the warriors' path and reached Guffin's Door.

The black sphere's tunnel showed nothing beyond. Only vast uncertainty swirled like everyone's future.

'From now on, there's not even a back to look toward!'

Shirone opened his eyes wide and leaped into Guffin's Door.

The space-time barrier, distorted by powerful force, swallowed Shirone and hurled him into a world humans could never reach.
