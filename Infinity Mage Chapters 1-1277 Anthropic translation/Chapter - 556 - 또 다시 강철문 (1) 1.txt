[556] The Steel Door Once Again (1)

Though they were both incarnations of Prajñā, the depth contained within them was completely different, so Shirone felt pressure just from facing her.

The realm of Shirone, who had just reached the境, couldn't possibly be the same as Miro's realm, which had transcended the impossible.

"Don't be nervous. You won't die, at least."

Since that meant anything except death was possible, it made him even more nervous.

'Photon Cannon...'

Whether she knew his feelings or not, Miro glanced up at the solemn face of the Archangel of Light.

No incarnation could manifest anything greater than its user.

'Affinity for light, god particles, ataraxia, Valhalla Action...'

Countless experiences and techniques would comprise the Archangel, but Miro couldn't help thinking of the influence of someone who no longer existed.

'Mckline Guffin.'

If Miro split one second to its extreme limit, Shirone destroyed the boundaries of one second.

An incarnation technique that concentrated the particle and wave properties characteristic of light.

'If he were to reach the realm of Paramita...'

Even she couldn't imagine what the result of Photon Cannon would be.

"Let's begin."

As Miro slowly turned her body and took an attack stance, Shirone also took a step back and prepared to receive it.

Accordingly, the incarnations' postures changed, and the tense atmosphere reached its limit.

'Thousand-Hand Avalokiteśvara Lightning Palm.'

Even before Miro's expression or posture changed, her incarnation moved.

In the space of one second divided into thousands of fragments, the Thousand-Hand Avalokiteśvara's consecutive strikes overlapped a thousand times and struck down at Shirone's head.

'Uwaaaah...'

Shirone, who could see Avalokiteśvara's attack for the first time, trembled as if electrocuted.

Could the human mind fall to such depths?

'I have to dodge!'

The Archangel of Light permeated his body, and Shirone quickly twisted away.

'Direct hit!'

As Miro was certain and widened her eyes, a thousand palms struck the ground.

And Shirone had already moved to the right, following a gap in time that Miro couldn't perceive.

"Huk! Huk!"

Though she had controlled her strength, it was a serious attack, so Miro gave a passing smile to Shirone, who was breathing heavily.

"Pass. Congratulations, Shirone. This ends your training."

The word "ends" hit his mind like a switch, and Shirone's eyes gradually rolled upward.

"Ah, thank you..."

He had no strength left to endure after the long period of ascetic training and the shock of witnessing Avalokiteśvara's attack just moments ago.

Shirone collapsed with a thud and couldn't get up, while Miro let out a relieved breath and carried him back to the cabin.

It was around 4 AM.

"Mmm."

Shirone opened his eyes, collecting his hazy mind as if intoxicated by medicine.

'Training!'

His body tensed first from the daily repeated training, but when he recalled Miro's words at the end of his memory, his muscles relaxed.

"Right, it's over."

His body felt heavier than usual.

This was probably his true body weight that he hadn't felt until now.

"I did it, I really did..."

Shirone raised his arm and clenched his fist tightly.

He had completed the seemingly impossible training and obtained a powerful incarnation technique.

But the greatest achievement from this training was the experience of overcoming himself countless times.

'This experience will lead to another success.'

That's how he would continue advancing endlessly, day by day.

"Where's Miss Miro?"

Having sufficiently recovered his body, Shirone slowly came out to the kitchen.

Miro was nowhere to be seen, only the grass porridge cooked in the morning was left there.

"..."

Now that he thought about it, he realized for the first time that there were tastes one couldn't adapt to.

Creating new bitter flavors with each cooking could be called nothing short of divine mastery.

"I'm not hungry yet anyway."

Deliberately talking to himself and denying reality, Shirone went out to look for Miro.

Opening the door to the training hall under the midday sunlight, he found Miro deep in meditation with only a few candles lit.

"You're awake?"

"Ah, yes."

He was worried she might ask if he had eaten the porridge, but fortunately Miro just offered him a seat.

"Sit down."

As he sat cross-legged and waited, her eyelids slowly opened.

"You did it, Shirone."

"Yes. It's thanks to you, Miss Miro. Thank you."

"You're the one who worked hard. There's not much vacation left now. Descend the mountain tomorrow."

Shirone's heart swelled at the thought of seeing his family.

"But as you know, nothing has changed. You'll face countless trials ahead. Both in your life as human Shirone and as a mage."

Shirone recalled what Miro had said before entering training.

"I'm prepared."

"Good. I promised to tell you once training ended safely. As a senior from magic school, as a victim who received the world's attention before you, I'll tell you what you need to do at school from now on."

As Shirone took a deep breath and waited for her words, Miro raised her index finger and explained the strategy.

"First, when you return to school..."

The West family in the central region of Tormia.

Nade, who had spent the entire vacation in the warehouse, fell asleep with an excited heart as the new semester approached.

He could meet his friends.

Though Shirone's life or death remained unclear, just the fact that he could leave home made him feel like he could fly.

But perhaps because happiness didn't suit him, that night once again, events from long ago revived as nightmares.

"Huhahaha! This kid's interesting!"

"Uwaaaah!"

A notorious bandit group with cockscomb-like haircuts had tied up Nade tightly and was giving him electric shocks.

"Do it! Do it again!"

"Please spare me! Please spare me!"

The electric shock at such a young age was not only painful but also terrifying beyond what his brain could accept.

"This kid's fun, isn't he? Is this magic or something?"

"What kind of mage is a little brat? Hey kid, did you really make this yourself?"

"Uwaaaak!"

As another electric shock was applied, Nade's body, deep in nightmare, convulsed roughly.

He was drenched in cold sweat, his hands clutching his chest in agony.

"Don't... don't..."

As bluish electricity emanated from Nade's body, the metal parts scattered around the warehouse began to tremble and then float into the air.

"Die! Die!"

The bandits persistently tormented Nade.

'Mom, mom... why?'

Blood flowed from burns carved all over his body.

His body felt like it was burning, but in the inescapable pain, he resented the world.

These people would kill him.

What was most heartbreaking was the fact that no one would come to rescue him.

The people who had abandoned him and fled would never return.

"Good! This time, maximum output!"

Nade could only watch as the clips of the generator he had made were attached all over his body.

The switch was turned all the way up, and unbearable current flowed through the child's body.

"Uwaaaaaaah!"

Nade woke from his dream screaming and bolted upright.

Simultaneously, powerful electricity spread in all directions, and the warehouse exploded and flew away entirely.

"Huuk! Huuk!"

Sitting on the burning bed, Nade glared straight ahead with murderous eyes.

Then, hastily realizing the situation, he threw off his burning clothes.

"Kuk!"

Though over ten years had passed, burn scars still remained here and there on his body.

Besides his family, only Iruki knew that it wasn't from an accident during experiments.

"What! What happened!"

People who heard the explosion from the mansion rushed over and stared at Nade with bewildered expressions.

This was why he had stopped entering the mansion at some point.

He was used to people looking at him with fearful eyes, but there was one gaze he could never get used to.

Among the crowd stood his mother.

Nade thought his own expression must be as horribly distorted as hers.

The opening day of Alpheas Magic School had returned.

After spending a day catching up with his family, Shirone departed slowly for school in the Ogent family's carriage.

Since graduating class passed through the Steel Door separately from the opening ceremony, and Shirone had dropped out of the test, time could be considered leisurely.

Around the time the advanced class was noisily dispersing, graduating class students began passing through the Steel Door one by one.

Collie, the graduating class supervising teacher who had been waiting since long ago, greeted them with a smile welcoming them to hell.

Amy, Canis and Arin, Iruki, Nade, Dante's group, and others - the eyes of students climbing the uphill path all had an eerie gleam.

'Hehe, this is why I stay with the graduating class.'

Anyone who had completed the first half graduating class schedule would realize that the intensity of competition was beyond imagination.

This led directly to special training, and when the new semester came again, they would emit a murderous aura like well-sharpened swords.

'Not one of them was discouraged. Everyone did their best. But only 10 of them can graduate.'

If even he was getting goosebumps, how queasy must the actual participants feel?

Because of this, the atmosphere was quiet despite the long-awaited reunion.

Iruki and Nade were approaching Amy to catch up, but it wasn't as lively as before.

'Shirone's not here. I was looking forward to a revenge match.'

Canis, who had completed terrifying special training during vacation, found this disappointing.

"Long time no see, Amy."

As Canis raised his hand, Amy also greeted him calmly.

"Yeah, long time no see. Arin's been well too, right?"

While Arin shyly waved her hand, Canis pretended not to know and looked around.

"By the way, where's Shirone?"

"Shirone? Why are you asking me that?"

At Amy's irritated voice, Canis blinked for a moment, then smiled knowingly.

"Don't misunderstand. I'm just asking because you're close to him. I definitely don't think you were rejected or anything."

Fire lit up in Amy's eyes.

"What nonsense are you spouting? Whether Shirone is here or there, what does it have to do with me!"

"Okay, okay, I get it."

Though Canis usually prided himself on being Amy's nemesis, this time he felt he shouldn't provoke her.

But the atmosphere had already become like a funeral.

'That bad guy. How could he just leave like that? I don't care anymore either. Whether he dies somewhere or not.'

As Amy left with a sulking face, Iruki and Nade looked at each other.

"What's going on? Iruki, didn't you hear anything from your father?"

"Nothing at all. I was too busy training to even talk much. He wouldn't tell me even if I asked."

"I see... Is he not planning to return to school? No, before that, is he even alive?"

Fermi cut between them and said.

"He's not someone who'd die easily."

"What's with that guy? Acting like he knows something."

Nade grumbled toward Fermi's back, but Iruki just remained silent.

"Twenty-seven people. Looks like everyone's here."

As Collie said, Aider was still hospitalized, and Maya and Shirone had refused evaluation, so they didn't need to attend.

"Now, today begins a new competition. I'll introduce the second half schedule, so follow me."

As the students were about to follow Collie, Screamer, who had been checking behind, pointed toward the Steel Door.

"Huh? There's one more person coming over there?"

"Huh? That, that's..."

The graduating class students' eyes shook with shock.

A blonde boy with luggage in a Cube, not even carrying a bag, was leisurely walking up the slope.

"Shirone?"

Only after hearing Nade's words did Amy realize it was real, and her heart began pounding.

"Hi? Long time no see."

Though no one had spoken, Shirone looked around at his friends calmly, as if he had already expected this.

"I'm back, everyone."
