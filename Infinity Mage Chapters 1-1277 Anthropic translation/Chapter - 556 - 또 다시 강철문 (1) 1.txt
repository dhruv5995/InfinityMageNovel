[556] The Steel Door Again (1)

Though they were both manifestations of Prajna, the depths contained within were completely different, so Shirone felt pressure just from facing her.

The realm of Shirone, who had just reached the Mirror, could not be the same as Miro's realm, which had transcended the Incomprehensible.

"Don't be nervous. You won't die."

Since that meant anything except death was possible, it made him even more nervous.

'Shibuljeonpokmaera...'

Whether she knew his feelings or not, Miro glanced up at the solemn face of the Archangel of Light.

No avatar could manifest anything beyond its user.

'Affinity for light, divine particles, ataraxia, Valhalla Action...'

Though countless experiences and techniques would comprise the Archangel of Light, Miro couldn't help but think of the influence of someone who no longer existed.

'McClain Guffin.'

If Miro split one second to its extreme limit, Shirone destroyed the boundaries of one second.

An avatar technique that concentrated the particle and wave properties characteristic of light.

'If he reaches the realm of Paramita...'

Even she couldn't imagine what the result of Shibuljeonpokmaera would be.

"I'm starting."

As Miro slowly turned her body and took an attacking stance, Shirone also stepped back with one foot and prepared to receive it.

Accordingly, as the avatar's posture changed, the tense atmosphere reached its limit.

'Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara Lightning Palm.'

Before Miro's expression or posture even changed, the avatar moved.

In the space of one second divided into thousands of fragments, the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara's consecutive strikes overlapped a thousand times and struck down at Shirone's head.

'Uwaaaaa...'

Shirone, who could see Avalokitesvara's attack for the first time, trembled as if electrocuted.

Could the human mind fall to such depths?

'I have to dodge!'

The Archangel of Light permeated his body, and Shirone quickly twisted his body.

'It hit!'

As Miro widened her eyes in certainty, a thousand palms struck down into the ground.

And Shirone had already moved to the right, following a gap in time that Miro couldn't perceive.

"Huff! Huff!"

Though she had controlled her strength, it was sincere, so Miro gave a passing smile to Shirone, who was breathing heavily.

"Pass. Congratulations, Shirone. This ends your training."

As the word "end" struck his mind like a switch, Shirone's eyes gradually rolled upward.

"Ah, thank you..."

He had no strength left to endure after the long ordeal and the shock of witnessing Avalokitesvara's attack just moments ago.

Shirone collapsed with a thud and couldn't get up, and Miro sighed in relief as she carried him back to the cabin.

It was around 4 AM.

"Mmm."

Shirone opened his eyes, gathering his drowsy mind as if intoxicated by medicine.

'Training!'

His body tensed first from the daily repeated training, but when he recalled Miro's words at the end of his memory, his muscles relaxed.

"Right, it's over."

His body felt heavier than usual.

It was probably his original body weight that he hadn't felt until now.

"I did it, really..."

Shirone raised his arm and clenched his fist tightly.

He had completed training that seemed impossible and obtained a powerful avatar technique.

But the greatest achievement from this training was the experience of overcoming himself countless times.

'This experience will lead to another success.'

That's how one advances endlessly, day by day.

"Where's Miro?"

Having sufficiently recovered his body, Shirone slowly came out to the kitchen.

Miro was nowhere to be seen, and only the grass porridge cooked in the morning was left.

"..."

Though it was late to say this now, he realized for the first time that there was a taste he couldn't adapt to.

Creating new bitter flavors every time she cooked could be called nothing short of divine mastery.

"I'm not hungry yet anyway."

Deliberately talking to himself and denying reality, Shirone went out to look for Miro.

When he opened the door to the training hall under the midday sunlight, Miro was deep in meditation with only a few candles lit.

"Are you awake?"

"Ah, yes."

He was worried she might ask if he had eaten the porridge, but fortunately Miro just offered him a seat.

"Sit."

As he sat cross-legged and waited, her eyelids slowly opened.

"You did it, Shirone."

"Yes. Thanks to you, Miro. Thank you."

"You worked hard. There isn't much vacation left now. Go down the mountain tomorrow."

Shirone's heart swelled at the thought of seeing his family.

"But as you know, nothing has changed. Many trials will come to you in the future. Both in your life as human Shirone and as a mage."

Shirone recalled what Miro had said before entering training.

"I'm prepared."

"Good. I promised to tell you when training ended safely. As a senior at magic school, as a victim who received the world's attention before you, I'll tell you what you need to do at school from now on."

As Shirone took a deep breath and waited for her words, Miro raised her index finger and explained the strategy.

"First, when you return to school..."

The West family in the central region of Tormia.

Nade, who had spent the entire vacation in the warehouse, fell asleep with an excited heart as the new semester approached.

He could meet his friends.

Though Shirone's life or death was unclear, just the fact that he could leave home made him feel like he could fly.

But perhaps because happiness didn't suit him, that night once again, events from long ago revived as nightmares.

"Huhahaha! This kid is interesting!"

"Uwaaaaa!"

The notorious bandit group with rooster-comb haircuts had Nade tied up tightly and were giving him electric shocks.

"Do it! Do it again!"

"Please spare me! Please spare me!"

The electric shocks at such a young age were not just pain but terror beyond what his brain could accept.

"This kid is fun, isn't he? Is this magic?"

"What kind of mage is a little brat? Kid, did you really make this?"

"Uwaaaak!"

As another electric shock was applied, Nade's body, dreaming the nightmare, convulsed violently.

He was drenched in cold sweat, and his hands clutched his chest in agony.

"Don't... don't..."

As bluish electricity emanated from Nade's body, the metal parts scattered in the warehouse began to tremble and then floated into the air.

"Die! Die!"

The bandits persistently tormented Nade.

'Mom, mom... why?'

Blood flowed from burns carved all over his body.

His body felt like it was burning, but in the inescapable pain, he resented the world.

These people would kill him.

Most heartbreaking of all was the fact that no one would come to save him.

The people who had abandoned him and fled would never return.

"Good! This time it's maximum output!"

Nade could only watch as the clamps of the generator he had made were attached all over his body.

The switch went all the way up, and unbearable current flowed through the child's body.

"Uwaaaaaaaa!"

Nade woke from his dream screaming and bolted upright.

Simultaneously, powerful electricity spread in all directions, and the warehouse exploded and flew away entirely.

"Huff! Huff!"

Sitting on the burning bed, Nade glared ahead with murderous eyes.

Then he hurriedly realized the situation and threw off his burning clothes.

"Ugh!"

Though over ten years had passed, burn scars still remained here and there on his body.

Only Iruki knew, besides his family, that it wasn't an accident from experiments.

"What! What happened!"

People who heard the explosion from the mansion rushed over and stared at Nade with bewildered expressions.

This was why he had stopped entering the mansion at some point.

He was used to people looking at him with fearful eyes, but there was one gaze he could never get used to.

His mother stood among the crowd.

Nade thought his own expression must be as horribly distorted as her terrifyingly contorted face.

The opening day of Alpheas Magic School had returned.

After spending a day catching up with his family, Shirone departed slowly for school in the Ogent family's carriage.

Since the graduating class passed through the steel door separately from the opening ceremony, and Shirone had withdrawn from the test, he had plenty of time.

Around the time the advanced class was noisily dispersing, graduating class students began passing through the steel door one by one.

Teacher Collie, who had been the graduating class supervisor for a long time, welcomed them with a smile meaning welcome to hell.

Amy, Canis and Arin, Iruki, Nade, Dante's group, and others - the eyes of students climbing the slope all had an eerie gleam.

'Hehe, this is why I stay with the graduating class.'

Anyone who had completed the first half of the graduating class schedule would realize that the competition's intensity exceeded imagination.

This led directly to special training, and when the new semester came again, they would emit a murderous aura like well-sharpened famous swords.

'Not one of them gave up. They all did their best. But only 10 of them can graduate.'

If even he got goosebumps, how queasy must the students themselves feel?

Because of this, the atmosphere was quiet despite the long-awaited reunion.

Iruki and Nade were approaching Amy to catch up, but they weren't as lively as before.

'Shirone isn't here. I was looking forward to a revenge match.'

Canis, who had completed terrifying special training during vacation, was quite disappointed by this.

"Long time no see, Amy."

As Canis raised his hand, Amy also greeted him calmly.

"Yeah, long time no see. Arin, you've been well too?"

While Arin shyly waved her hand, Canis pretended not to know and looked around.

"By the way, where's Shirone?"

"Shirone? Why are you asking me that?"

At Amy's irritated voice, Canis blinked for a moment, then smiled knowingly.

"Don't misunderstand. I just asked because you're close to him. I definitely don't think you were rejected or anything."

Fire lit in Amy's eyes.

"What nonsense are you talking about? Wherever Shirone is or isn't, what does it have to do with me!"

"Okay, okay, I got it."

Though Canis usually prided himself on being Amy's nemesis, this time he thought he shouldn't provoke her.

But the atmosphere was already like a funeral home.

'Bad guy. How could he just leave like that? I don't care anymore either. Whether he dies somewhere or not.'

As Amy left with a sulky face, Iruki and Nade looked at each other.

"What's going on? Iruki, didn't you hear anything from your father?"

"Nothing at all. I was too busy training to even talk much. He wouldn't tell me even if I asked."

"I see... Isn't he planning to return to school? No, before that, is he even alive?"

Fermi crossed between the two and said,

"He's not the type to die easily."

"What's with that guy? Acting like he knows something."

Nade grumbled toward Fermi's back, but Iruki just remained silent.

"Twenty-seven people. It seems everyone's here."

As Collie said, Aider was still hospitalized, and Maya and Shirone had refused evaluation, so they didn't need to attend.

"Now, today begins a new competition. I'll introduce the second half schedule, so follow me."

As the students were about to follow Collie, Screamer, who was looking behind, pointed toward the steel door.

"Huh? There's one more person coming?"

"Huh? That, that's..."

The graduating class students' eyes shook with shock.

A blonde boy with luggage in a Cubic and not even carrying a bag was leisurely walking up the slope.

"Shirone?"

Only after hearing Nade's words did Amy realize it was real, and her heart began pounding.

"Hi? Long time no see."

Though no one spoke, Shirone looked around at his friends calmly as if he had already expected this and said,

"I'm back, guys."
