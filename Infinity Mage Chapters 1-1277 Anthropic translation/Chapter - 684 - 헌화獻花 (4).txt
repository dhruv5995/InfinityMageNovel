[684] Offering Flowers (4)

Upon reaching the entrance to the Living Flower, Shirone realized through the Ultima System that a unique signal was tracking them.

'What is this?'

It was the most intuitive signal he'd encountered so far.

At the information possessing consistency approaching just before the Ultima System's level, Shirone shouted:

"Take cover!"

Dragon Speech Magic: Lightning Strike.

As the group scattered, electrical charges collided where they had been standing, erupting in lightning.

"Hiiiiek!"

The charges traveled through the electrolytes in the rain, spreading electrical current in a spherical pattern.

The mages could escape the radius through teleportation, but Lian had no choice but to take the full brunt of the lightning.

"Hot! Hot!"

Kido, who had been bouncing around stabbing the ground with his spear, slid across the ground with his hands pressed to it.

"Hey! I almost died!"

If the previous attack had been magic, there's no way Shirone, who was maintaining Spirit Zone, wouldn't have noticed it.

"Sorry, I couldn't sense it. And it's not magic."

It wasn't Spirit Zone.

The boundary was as vague as Elysion's, and without the Ultima System, he wouldn't have been able to warn them before the attack struck.

"Have you come, mongrels?"

At the sight of the giant figure standing in the rain, Kido grimaced and adjusted his glasses.

"War Minister Drakker. A dragon-human."

The fact that half his face was covered in scales suggested his body would be the same.

The dragon's amber eyes, sharp teeth in perfect alignment, and the cold body that didn't steam even in the winter rain reminded them of the dragon race's cold blood.

"We'll need to be careful with this one."

Kido spun his spear and prepared for battle.

"That bastard's the strongest in Ladum."

"That's correct."

Drakker displayed his displeasure.

"But having a mere goblin speak of strength makes me feel like my nobility is being sullied."

Even facing the gaze of a dragon, the apex predator of the food chain, Kido remained unshaken.

His mind, which converted feeding experiences into overall experience, flowed as calmly as the ocean.

Lian stepped forward, shouldering his great sword.

"I'll handle this."

He was partly drawn to the title of strongest, but the remaining three had the crucial role of finding La Enemy.

"Lian, that guy is..."

"I know."

He didn't have senses as keen as Shirone's, but even that didn't matter - Drakker's fighting spirit was terrifying enough.

"I'm not confident I can win while protecting someone."

Since this implied he could win if he didn't have to protect anyone, Drakker crossed his arms and growled.

"Do you think acting like that makes you my equal? You won't be able to move a single step from here."

Lian spoke without hesitation.

"Go."

The three moved simultaneously, but the dragon-human's eyes precisely caught Shirone, who had taken a slight lead.

'Courting death.'

Just as he was about to kick off the ground, Drakker felt an ominous presence running up his spine.

Quickly turning his gaze, he saw Lian, who had definitely been motionless, somehow already approaching right before his eyes.

Axing: Deny.

"You insect-like creatures!"

As Drakker raised his arm toward the great sword falling like lightning, a thunderous crash erupted.

It wasn't a sound that could come from a living being.

'Hard. Half-hearted attacks won't even scratch him.'

Drakker, who had blocked an attack powerful enough to split an elephant with his arm, sneered and said:

"With just this much... huh?"

Tremendous force began pushing down on him from the great sword that was already in contact.

"Graaaah!"

Finally sensing the seriousness, Drakker put his full strength into his entire body, causing the solid ground to cave in and his legs to sink into it.

'Impossible! How can he do this in this state?'

If human strength is called human power, then dragon-human strength is called dragon power.

The reason for different names is that the very unit of biologically generated force is dimensionally different.

"Insolent fool!"

When Drakker swung his arm with all his might, Lian lightly lifted off and landed on the ground.

"How did this happen? Everyone already got inside?"

Shirone's entire group had safely infiltrated the Living Flower, but turning around to look was something Drakker's pride wouldn't allow.

"I'll kill you."

Dragon Speech Magic: Dragon Rush.

As Drakker launched a body attack with added propulsion from Dragon Speech, Lian's feet lifted off the ground.

"Guh!"

He was pushed back a full kilometer, smashing through buildings.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Just the continuous impacts of wooden, stone, and steel structures against his back were enough to nearly knock Lian unconscious.

'Stop!'

He applied Deny, but instead Lian's brakes were shattered.

'Stop!'

Deny was applied consecutively.

'I said stop!'

After breaking through three hundred walls and bending dozens of steel beams along Lian's body until they snapped, he finally stopped in the middle of collapsed building debris, already more than 2 kilometers away from the Living Flower.

"Are you... really human?"

Drakker, still pressed against him, looked at Lian with an expression of disbelief.

"Don't know. I stopped caring about that stuff long ago."

'Human power that matches dragon power...'

It's physically impossible by numerical calculation for a human to kill a dragon.

"Would you like to become a Dragon Slayer?"

Something beyond mere physical strength after all.

It wasn't coincidence that the heroes in Dragon Slayer legends all had unwavering conviction.

"Sorry, but I don't deal with fakes."

Dragon's fury filled Drakker's eyes.

"A lowly human like you!"

When Drakker kicked the great sword with a clang, Lian was pushed back at tremendous speed, breaking through a building wall.

"I'll crush you!"

Following him inside, Drakker saw Lian already waiting and swinging his great sword vertically.

'Cut!'

Lian's conviction, the Will of Mach, began to depart from the end of the world, cutting through everything.

'What?'

An optical illusion created by the negation of natural law.

The reason one cannot feel the flow of time in the scene of the world splitting is because space-time itself is being pushed forward.

"I am a dragon-human!"

Dragon Speech Magic: Heaven and Earth Division Method.

Binary 0 and 1 separated up and down like electrodes, creating a horizon that divided heaven and earth.

Lian's vertical line struck the horizon head-on.

CRASH!

Lian's law cut through the center, while Drakker's law pulled from both sides to separate.

Both were absolute.

"AAAHHH!"

Lian and Drakker simultaneously let out battle cries.

BOOM!

As the two laws swirled together like a storm, the seven-story building swelled like a balloon before exploding outward.

"What's that sound?"

Quan drew his sword and looked toward where the sound came from.

Even in the heavy rain, seeing the rising smoke, one couldn't think it wasn't magic.

"Are there still people outside? What are they doing?"

"Please go."

Aria said.

"My mission is complete. You don't need to protect me anymore."

Her words were true, but with her body temperature having dropped to dangerous levels due to the heavy rain, it would be like leaving a corpse behind.

'Rescue is probably impossible anyway.'

Quan's combat power should be used for far more constructive purposes than taking Aria out.

"It's okay. I can endure."

It was just words to reassure him - she knew she was already waiting for death.

"I'll be back soon."

Knowing this, Quan still turned away.

"Aria!"

Just then, the sound of hoofbeats splashing through puddles was heard as Brooks arrived leading his subordinates.

It was a good opportunity to entrust Aria to someone, but Quan, a soldier to his bones, felt doubt first.

"Why did you come in? Don't you know this is a classified area?"

"Damn it! I had no choice either! Aria! Stay conscious!"

Brooks, who seemed reluctant himself, snapped at Quan and slapped the unconscious Aria's cheek.

"Put her in the carriage! We're going back!"

"Don't tell me you came all this way to rescue one woman?"

As Brooks chose his answer, the carriage door opened and Venetia, the leader of Spectrum, stepped out.

"Please take me to La Enemy."

Quan looked at Brooks, demanding an explanation.

"I don't know either! She was near cardiac arrest when we saved her, and now she's like this! I tried to confine her, but she says she can see La Enemy!"

Though not deeply involved in this project, he wasn't obtuse enough to not understand what Lufist wanted.

"Give me Nemesis."

Quan stared at Venetia extending her hand, then sheathed his sword and pulled her waist into his embrace.

"Later. First, we infiltrate the Living Flower."

This solved everything anyway.

"Take Aria to a doctor. She seems infected."

Without waiting for an answer, Quan kicked off the ground and soared, hovering briefly at the critical point of descent before rising even higher.

As everyone wore blank expressions, Brooks sighed and muttered:

"Where the hell do they find guys like that?"

Fire Race's unique Incarnation Technique: Small World Creation.

Plants cannot act on their own, but instead create a world where they can act in combination with countless things.

They still have no autonomy (Vajra Armament).

However, when assimilated with objects like the Living Flower, they could be said to have at least decision-making authority (Precision Control).

'The main system...'

Plarino, who felt the Living Flower's entire system like nerves, realized Jane had succeeded.

'Tormenting us to the very end?'

Living such a wretched life, he'd wanted to just wither away like other Fire Race members more than once or twice.

'I don't want to do anything. Why must I decide and act? Why won't someone take care of me?'

Venetia had been a good person but abandoned Spectrum, and his second master, La Enemy, wasn't appearing either.

'I just want to be loved.'

He simply wanted to obey someone's words and entrust his body to warm, gentle hands.

He wanted to spread flower fragrance freely throughout their world.

'No one ever loved me.'

When the primordial Fire Race decided to advance from plants to animals, to the realm of primates, could they have ever imagined

How decadent the sensory organs called bodies would be?

'You're the ones who are wrong.'

The expectation of being cared for as gently as butterflies might have been the Fire Race's naive innocence from the beginning.

'Hitting, tormenting, making me scream.'

The Fire Race is an evolutionarily failed species.

But even Lufist couldn't take their incarnation techniques lightly - the very thing that enabled their rapid evolution.

Confirming through Spirit Zone that heavy rain was pouring outside, he approached with killing intent.

"Hand over the code. You must resent the sky."

While clouds blocked the sun, the Living Flower's photon collection would inevitably be delayed.

Plarino took a deep breath and steeled himself.

'I have to fight.'

Though dynamic struggle went against a flower's nature, it was unavoidable to prevent the extinction of his species.

"Time is on our side. You can't beat me."

"Is that so?"

Plarino, who had returned with a calm expression, spread both arms, causing the room to shake tremendously.

'The Living Flower is moving?'

No, it was growing.

'If he increases size to boost total photosynthesis, the entire capital will be within range. I need to kill him.'

Hoping Jane had completed her mission, Lufist created dozens of steel storms - rotating blades.

"I'll tear you to shreds."

The moment blades attacked from all directions, the steel plate beneath Plarino's feet rose like liquid and deflected the steel.

"It's useless. I am the Living Flower, and the Living Flower is me."

The reason Plarino, who desired submission, became Interior Minister was solely because he was the right person to care for the Living Flower.

'It's not liquefaction. He's pushing the growth rate of photominerals to the extreme to gain fluidity.'

He was probably using energy collected by the Living Flower, which wasn't bad from Lufist's perspective.

Plarino, who had opened the iron barrier left and right, spoke with cold eyes:

"How unfortunate. The capital will soon be destroyed. Your citizens will taste the same pain we experienced."

"Do humans look that easy to you?"

Dozens of sharp metal chunks formed around Lufist, ready to shoot out.

Plarino, glaring at Lufist with resentful eyes, bit his lip and spread another iron barrier.

"You should have stepped on us back in primitive times."

Steel Magic: High-Speed Armor-Piercing Bullets.

The metal chunks that shot out at tremendous speed made tremendous noise as they penetrated all the iron barriers.
