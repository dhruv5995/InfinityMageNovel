Karma Chain (3)

Galley Islands.

When the Ultima System extraction team arrived at Toa Mountain, Kergo Chief Mahatu came out to greet them.

"Welcome, Lord Sirone."

"Yes. Have you been well? I hate to say this right after arriving, but we'll be imposing on you for a while."

"Imposing? This is Kergo's honor."

Mahatu led them underground to a temple with a mystical atmosphere.

It was a familiar scene to Miro and Gaold.

"The Kergo tribe, huh. It's a fortress, but... will it really be safe?"

At Sein's concern, Mahatu said:

"There's a separate shelter underground. My direct subordinates will take turns guarding it 24 hours a day."

Since they had to go through Drimo, the team members would inevitably fall into sleep in a defenseless state.

This was why Sirone had set up a base on the island.

'Activity is impossible while sleeping. I want to avoid overlapping simultaneous incidents.'

Mahatu emphasized again:

"Leave it to us. I will protect all of you with Kergo's honor and my life."

Crawling on the ground, Arius spoke:

"Dream walkers can infiltrate dreams. Through Drimo, we'll enter directly into Ymir's REM domain, the 6th deep layer. But getting out is a different problem. We can't install doors."

Divers inject keywords into targets and use them to install doors.

"This is also magic, after all. We can't inject keywords into Ymir, who exists outside the galaxy. Even if we could go, we'd die instantly."

Miro asked:

"Then how do we get out?"

"If you're really thinking of coming back alive, I'd tell you to quit even now."

"Just answer."

When Miro kicked his butt, Arius fell forward and hit his chin on the floor.

"We'll swim up from the depths. We'll fall from Ymir's dream back into Drimo. But the reason it's quite difficult is that once we reach the deep layer, the upper levels become complete chaos. Because the core of the ego is under attack."

Kang Nan rested her chin on her hand.

"Combat is unavoidable. So we have to break through those things called Egoists?"

"Puhahaha!"

Arius burst into laughter then quickly cleared his throat.

"Sorry. It's just so absurd. Anyway, think about it carefully. Ymir is the strongest even in reality. But the place we're entering now is a world where Ymir is the master."

The atmosphere grew heavy.

"I don't want to give you despair. Our team also has Gokseun, Bakae, and Mr. Gaold. What I want to say is, let's only choose to fight and win right before we die. Once we enter Ymir's mind, we'll get a lot of information. I'll somehow find a way out."

The moment Arius finished his explanation, the group entered a bunker deep in Toa Mountain.

There were pre-prepared beds, and several days' worth of food and water were piled in the corner.

Mahatu said:

"Once we close the door, no one will be able to open it until you send a signal, forever. Even 100 years from now, this door will be guarded by Kergo's descendants."

It was quite a grand statement, but no one knew what would happen.

"Thank you. We'll be back."

After Sirone's farewell, Mahatu closed the door, and perfect darkness arrived.

Sirone cast a lighting spell and pointed to the beds.

"Let's begin. It would be better to devise specific strategies once we enter Ymir's mind."

As the six members each took a bed and lay down, Arius cast a sleep spell.

Sirone slowly opened his eyes.

He was inside a cabin that seemed to have been abandoned long ago, with moonlight seeping through the walls.

When he focused his senses with lucid dreaming, he felt himself sitting on a chair placed in the center of the cabin.

Cold wind, the smell of old, stale dust.

A thin girl wearing white rags was walking around the cabin with her face covered by her hair.

'It's a nightmare.'

He would probably be trapped in this cabin with the nameless girl until this segment ended.

An ordinary person would have experienced sleep paralysis, but Sirone calmly opened his mouth.

"Monga."

Ruber's satellite and dream designer.

"I don't have time for games."

The cabin door creaked open, and a boy with a pale face and round eyes entered.

"I'm sorry. But it's not a game. Using nightmares is the fastest way."

Sirone and Monga turned their gaze to follow the girl passing between them.

"What's the meaning?"

"There's no meaning. That's the characteristic of nightmares. In short, they just need to be terrifying."

Monga grabbed the girl's wrist and lifted the black hair covering her face.

A face distorted as if melted by heat was revealed.

"Nightmares process negative energy. Events unfold in ways you absolutely don't want to experience. In reality, everyone would hope for the girl's face to be pretty, and it would be..."

"But underneath lies the psychology of fearing the worst-case scenario."

"That's right. The reason this is important is that the dream walker plans to inject nightmares into Ymir. Even if he's the dream's master, when swept up in negative energy, every situation will attack Ymir. Then we can utilize our team's mobility."

Sirone blinked and fell into thought.

"I understand it's effective, but... would there really be situations where Ymir feels fear?"

"We don't know. But since it uses inner energy, the possibility isn't completely zero. Actually, what I'm more worried about is when the nightmare actually unfolds."

It would be on a different dimension from nightmares ordinary people have.

"Let's go out first. By now, the others should have arrived following their nightmares too."

Rising from his chair, Sirone looked back at the girl before leaving through the door.

Staring intently at her standing barefoot, Sirone slowly lifted her hair.

A beautiful face was revealed.

As the girl showed her white teeth in a bright smile, Sirone smiled back and patted her head.

"Everything will be alright."

At the end of the wasteland absorbing moonlight, Miro's group was waiting.

Ten Island Kingdoms.

As Corps Commander Gamagin's earthquake caused a tsunami, most of the islands were submerged.

Sirone, aboard a sailing ship carrying refugees, looked out at the sea from the deck.

'Dionas Kingdom.'

Although it was the nation with the least damage, crossing the windless zone would take several months.

"Messiah."

Poison Dragon Poine approached Sirone.

"According to Chaos, the tectonic plates continue to shake. If a tsunami occurs, even the people on the ships won't be safe."

"It's not a one-time event. This is serious."

The demon world was another system embedded in reality, so stopping it was impossible.

'As long as hell's purification isn't finished...'

While Sirone was lost in thought, the sailors moved blankets and food to the deck.

"Now, take them in order! Since supplies are limited, we'll distribute only the set amount. If anyone violates this, even we don't know what might happen!"

The reason for the threat was that they knew how cruel surviving on the isolated sea could be.

"...Food."

People with haggard eyes briefly showed signs of life as they began gathering around the supplies one by one.

"Stand back!"

Then a knight with a sturdy build drew his sword.

"How dare commoners try to touch this! According to the kingdom's law, Minister Desika will take his share first."

People's gazes turned to one spot.

Interior Minister Desika of the Rosarion Kingdom was resting with a cold expression.

"Move! I said move!"

The knight who pushed people away gathered thick blankets and plenty of food to offer to the minister.

The sailors watching this scene looked grim, but they couldn't handle the interior minister's knight.

"There'll be trouble. That shrimp-like skinny man took one-fifth of all the bread."

Since there wasn't time to load supplies, the food per person fell far short of even one meal.

"At least he himself must eat his fill. Well, he's a living being, so it's natural."

Poine's eye-smile contained condensed venom that was unapproachable.

"What will you do? If you just give the command, this old woman will give him a sharp lesson..."

"Let's go."

Poine tilted her head.

"Pardon?"

"We need to receive ours too - bread and water."

Waiting at the end of the line, Sirone was able to get supplies when his turn came.

As expected, bread was insufficient, and all he got was half a container of water and one shabby blanket.

Those who couldn't eat were angry, but for now, the knight's sword was more frightening than hunger.

Poine sat next to Sirone.

"The Messiah must have many concerns. In this old woman's opinion, 'extraction' would also be acceptable."

Removing factors that hinder integration could be one method.

Sirone said:

"Desika isn't righteous. But to perform extraction, we need more fundamental criteria than that. If everyone here became Desika, could they act differently? Humans can't be integrated through principles and rules alone."

"What's important is the heart..."

Poine held back her words, but the light embedded in her narrow eyes became even more eerie.

"Drink slowly."

When Sirone turned his gaze, a little girl was drinking all of her day's water supply.

"Oh my. She seems to have drunk seawater. It's unbearable pain for children."

Sure enough, unable to quench her thirst, the child who had licked the last drop burst into tears.

"Mommy, I'm thirsty! I'm dying of thirst!"

Though it was water the mother couldn't even touch, her heart burned even more at her child's pain.

"Water, water..."

As people's gazes focused on the minister, Desika quietly turned his head away.

'Water won't do. Food is one thing - knights can find that - but water is life at sea.'

Then Sirone gestured and called:

"Little one, come here."

As the child who saw the water ran over as if entranced, Sirone handed her an opened water container.

"Drink this."

The child lifted her head and emptied the water in an instant.

"Do you feel better now?"

"Yes."

As the child hung her head feeling embarrassed, Poine handed over her own water container, saying:

"Take this to your mother. But from now on, you have to drink sparingly. Understand?"

The child hesitated but ultimately couldn't ignore her family's pain and accepted reality.

"Thank you."

Heavy silence fell over the deck.

A man across the way stood up decisively, approached Sirone, and offered his water.

"Here. Have a sip."

Under Sirone's gaze, the man scratched his nose bridge with an awkward expression.

"I can't give it all, but we have to help each other survive. Drink. No need to feel burdened."

Like a wall crumbling down, people finally began to notice who was around them.

"Um... let's share this."

Small pieces of bread were split in half and distributed to the hands of those who hadn't received food.

"Grandmother."

A young man offered his water container to Poine.

"Please take this. You're elderly - if you don't drink even a sip, you won't be able to endure the midday heat."

The gaze of the Poison Dragon, known as the most cruel among the 12 Apostles, pierced through the water container.

For a dragon, it was just a single drop of water.

But her smile contained a warm energy different from before.

"Thank you, young man."

Swallowing a lukewarm sip, Poine turned her gaze to Desika.

'The criteria for extraction.'

She finally understood the Messiah's words.
