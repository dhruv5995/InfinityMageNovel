Trigger (4)

A grotesque feeling, just like Habits.

'No, this kid's aura of disgust is much stronger. So alien it makes my stomach churn.'

It felt like looking at a fifth-dimensional being.

'I don't even know what that would be, but if it existed, this would be the feeling. I can understand Habits' sentiment now.'

Vulcan looked back at Natasha.

'Can you catch it?'

Receiving the silent signal, Natasha deployed Death God's Dance and seized control of the space behind the Wizard.

'Break the arms.'

But the child had already vanished.

'Fast?'

No, it was different from that.

Having no eyelids meant no blind spots in his vision, yet it felt like he had blinked.

'A flicker. That kind of feeling?'

In the midst of ultra-high-speed movement inertia, what appeared before Natasha as she twisted her body wasâ€”

Huoooooo!

The sight of a tree-like fetal face with its tongue stretched long, wailing.

It was truly eerie, but that feeling suddenly disappeared along with the form itself.

'This is it!'

The identity of that flickering sensation.

'The moment that thing disappears...'

As if the world had closed and reopened once, the Wizard was suddenly somewhere else.

'How annoying.'

Deciding impact was needed, Natasha activated 'Death God's Dance - Battle Machine.'

Then the Formless God roared again.

Huooooo!

'What a terrible discord.'

Whether time flowed fast or slow, the Formless God's movements seemed unchanged.

'No. There are identical movements within each movement.'

A fractal structure, in other words.

No matter which part of the motion you isolated, the same movement as the whole would repeat.

'This bizarre vibration dominates the surroundings.'

Huoooooo!

The moment the long tongue writhed from the fetal face, Natasha's fist shot forward.

"Huo..."

The wailing cut off abruptly as the Formless God's form dissolved into the air.

'When it becomes perfectly silent.'

Simultaneously with the discord's disappearance, the world lost exactly one frame.

Flicker.

After that frame was skipped, the scenery Natasha saw was upside down.

'Huh?'

Using delicate schema to assess the situation...

'Hip toss?'

The Wizard, having grabbed Natasha's waist, used all their strength to shift their body weight.

"Ugh, ugh, ugh!"

Thrown with full inertia, Natasha hastily raised her arms as she was sent tumbling head-first.

Despite reducing the impact with proper falling technique, her body bounced like a ball and slid across the casino floor.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

After rolling 20 meters in that state, she crouched down and applied the brakes.

"Phew."

It was a sigh mixed with admiration.

'That one frame is really tricky. Once it activates, I can't do anything. For me, it's nothingness.'

Huooooo!

As the Formless God stuck out its tongue again, Natasha tilted her head and filled her eyes with madness.

"Death God's Dance..."

"Stop."

Vulcan said.

"Stop now. There's no point in us fighting each other."

"Us?"

The battle between Natasha and the Wizard lasted only an instant, but that was enough. Vulcan looked at the Wizard and asked, "Habits... is he dead?"

A natural enemy.

Whoever had sent them, this was a combat weapon designed to counter all of Habits' abilities.

The Wizard shook their head.

"No."

"Why?"

Vulcan knew better than anyone what kind of being Habits was, but this time he was rather puzzled.

This child gave off that kind of feeling.

"...Because I'm weak."

While Smoodo and Zetaro pondered those words, Natasha returned to her position.

Feeling the casino patrons' gazes, Vulcan approached the Wizard and asked, "I think we need to talk, don't we?"

The time Habits arrived at Delta headquarters was one hour before midnight.

The fact that he had stopped by the casino had already been transmitted through various nations' intelligence agencies.

The officials wore uncomfortable expressions.

'What exactly did he do? Seeing that Rebecca seems unharmed, there must have been another reason.'

No one knew about the roughly six-hour gap after he left the casino.

And those six hours...

"Kekeke."

Had completely excited the mind of Habits, who found every second boring to death.

'Interesting.'

Wena Wizard.

Every creative result she had produced in battle thrilled him.

'I can't tell what she's thinking. I can't predict even one second ahead of that woman. Who the hell is she?'

He was so mentally absorbed with the Wizard that he didn't even notice the Delta knights rushing toward him.

"Hey! Habits! Stop it!"

Though he wasn't using Vanishing, his magical energy alone was suffocating.

"Ah?"

When Habits came to his senses and turned his head, dozens of knights were positioned around him.

As anger filled Satan's eyes, the knights' instincts screamed.

"Gah! If you're thinking of fighting...!"

"Sorry."

As if nothing had happened, the anger disappeared and Habits smiled with his eyes as he spoke.

"I thought this was Kashan sector."

Using Vanishing would be convenient, but now he didn't want to disturb Uorin's mood.

"J-just be careful from now on."

Since no knight wanted a direct confrontation, the situation ended anticlimactically.

Habits headed straight to Uorin.

"Hey! Where did you go!"

As soon as he opened the door, a voice that seemed ready to tear came out, but the voice of her heart was different.

Habits smiled and said, "Congratulations. You've hit the jackpot after a while. Is a full-scale assassination war beginning?"

Uorin sighed.

"Where did you go?"

"Just... getting some air. What's there to worry about? When you need me, I'll come find you."

If it were Satan's law, that would certainly be the case, but this time she wasn't confident.

'The feeling is different from before.'

Now that future sight was blocked, the Habits she sensed with her intuition wasn't purely chaos.

"Anyway."

Time was pressing.

"I know everything, so I'll skip the explanation. The assassination technique that Moon Kingdom poured their heart into creating - can you enhance it?"

"It's possible. The Alchemist's System Control Division controls karma. But the spirit realm is closed. To handle this job, I'll need to send Sheol."

"That's why I'm asking. There's only one hour left until midnight. You can make it, right?"

She knew how dangerous it was to use the expression 'asking' with Satan.

"Fine, I'll do it."

But surprisingly, Habits showed no particular interest and readily agreed.

"I have a favor to ask too."

"Hm?"

Uorin blinked.

Like Under Coder and High Gear, time in Apocalypse was also different from reality.

"Mining. It's tough work."

They had been mining for over two weeks already, but finding meaningful information was difficult.

Marsha said, "It's still okay. Finding keywords from specific time periods is similar to digging for fossils. Once we find events from that era, information will come out in large quantities."

The operator rested their chin on their hand.

"Hmm, it would be good to find a place where various eras are accumulated. Like a museum, government document storage, or an equivalent database."

Number Seven said, "The problem is we can't see ahead because of the eucus. We haven't hit an air pocket for 17 hours already."

The mining team aboard the massive excavator 'Extra' examined the screen attached to the control room.

Only the endless repetition of laser drills carving through eucus continued.

Frustrated, the operator grumbled, "Isn't this machine too slow?"

"Are you kidding? Do you think it's easy to drill through stone while traveling at 40 kilometers per hour? It's made of titan alloy specially manufactured by Metal Genome Corporation. The engine is..."

"That's creepy, so please stop. It's all fictional companies my brother made up anyway."

Number Seven pouted.

"Tch! This kind of realism becomes the motif for creating masterpieces. You don't even know..."

After about 30 minutes of chatter, Extra's hull shook violently.

"What's that?"

"Forward speed has increased. Resistance is weakening. I think we'll break through soon."

As everyone's attention focused on the screen, the frustrating limestone suddenly disappeared.

"We're out!"

The celebration was brief as tremendous gravitational acceleration pulled Extra downward.

"Aaaaah! Aaaaah!"

Though they had experienced the same situation several times, it was a fear they couldn't get used to.

"Wait."

Shirone, who had gone outside, gripped Extra's hull with Hand of God.

"Phew."

Looking down in that state, he could see a small town containing military facilities.

'A government institution.'

Eyes brightening, Shirone flew toward a large spire and landed Extra in front of it.

"Looks like some kind of monument."

The mining team, having gathered their equipment, searched the area and returned.

"This is a war heroes' memorial. The bodies seem to be interred elsewhere, but their personal effects should be here. Let's take a look just in case."

The mining team opened the iron door installed in the ground and descended into an underground area with thousands of shelves.

Shirone searched randomly.

'Identification tags. Family photos. Notebooks. Diaries...'

As he slowly scanned the items placed on the shelves, his gaze fixed on one spot.

"Hm?"

It was a toy pyramid.

After briefly checking both sides of the corridor, Shirone took out the pyramid that fit snugly in his hand.

The interior was hollow and light, but when he shook it up and down, paper rustled around inside.

'A note.'

Opening the bottom lid and unfolding the twice-folded paper revealed a detailed eye drawn on it.

"All-seeing eye..."

The eye of God that sees everything.

When he brought the note to the upper part of the pyramid, the lines matched perfectly.

"Shirone! Over here!"

Hearing Marsha's voice, Shirone pocketed the pyramid and ran to her.

"What's wrong?"

"I found it."

What Marsha was holding was a thick book covered in mold.

'Ancient Sorcery Guide.'

While Shirone decoded it with Ultima, Marsha referenced not the language but the illustrations.

"I was skimming through and suddenly found this..."

The page she opened showed the Holy War's mark and the flags of the 12 participating nations.

'Moon Kingdom's sorcery, Kill. Presumed to have been used for royal assassinations. The casualties at the time were...'

Shirone immediately closed the book.

"What time is it in reality now?"

The bell tolling midnight.

When the solemn sound waves would spread through the night across the capital, lights would go out in every house, but...

"Kyaaaaa!"

In a cave 4 kilometers away, that sound was the very thing that awakened ghosts.

"Your Majesty! Please take cover!"

As the essence of resentment tore through even the barriers, the fortune-teller retreated toward the entrance with Moon Dragon.

"This can't be..."

The apparition of a woman clawing at her face with her fingernails flickered like electricity.

The shaman went wild.

"O resentful soul! O ghost wandering the nine heavens! You must resolve your grudge. You must resolve that grudge!"

The ghost glared at the pictures of kings fallen on the ground and screamed with evil rage.

"I'll kill them! I'll kill them all! All the living things, I'll kill them all myself!"

'To be this vivid. This is... too severe.'

The fortune-teller's face turned pale, but Un-ryong didn't even twitch an eyebrow.

"What are you doing? Shoot."

Thus the trigger was pulled, and the fortune-tellers cut through the final barrier with their swords.

"Go! Begone! Your resentment... gah! Your bitter resentment...! Ugh, uaaaaa!"

The moment the shaman who had coughed up blood collapsed, something like white frost shot toward the entrance.

"Hmph!"

Moon Dragon stared straight at the ghost's face flying toward him and said, "I am the king."

Aaaaaa...

The essence of resentment that escaped the cave became a distant scream decorating the night sky.

Dong. Dong. Dong.

Twelve bell tolls rang out.
