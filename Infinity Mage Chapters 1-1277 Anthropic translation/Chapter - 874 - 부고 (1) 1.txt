Obituary (1)

How could he forget Tess's voice? Rian thought to himself, though his memory was hazy.

"Huh?"

Looking up at the ridge, he saw Tess sitting on a black horse with a tearful expression.

"You rotten bastard...

Being alive with all your limbs intact like this."

"Haha, it's Tess, isn't it? It's been a while." He hadn't expected much from the start, but treating him like some random person he'd bumped into was a bit harsh, wasn't it?

"You crazy fool! Is that what you say when you see me? Not even a single contact all this time..."

Amy's voice made Tess shut his mouth.

"Shirone."

Her face, speaking his name with a trembling voice, showed an almost fearful ecstasy.

"How are you here...?"

It didn't seem real, but even if it was a dream, she hoped it would never end.

"Amy."

As Shirone slowly stepped toward her, Rian moved aside to make way.

At the subtle atmosphere flowing between the two, the soldiers whispered among themselves.

"I heard the demons calling him Yahweh. Could he possibly know our battalion commander?"

Among those who had been hardened by the battlefield, none were unfamiliar with the Infinite Wizard.

"This seems serious. Could those two possibly be—"

"Shh."

Shirone stopped in front of Amy.

'Is it really Amy?'

Even seeing those red eyes that would unknowingly flush when she got excited, it didn't feel real.

It didn't matter.

"Shirone..."

Before Amy could finish speaking, Shirone pulled her into his arms and buried his face in her shoulder.

"I missed you."

Amy's scent.

The reason he didn't dress it up as fragrance was because it felt like she might disappear at any moment.

'It's Amy. Really Amy.'

This primal and unique scent was the only proof that she was real.

What should he say?

The sacrifice of Sacred Sound, Guy's death, Yahweh's rampage—he had experienced so many things.

But now, holding Amy in his arms, there was only one thing Shirone could say.

"Don't disappear."

Tears suddenly welled up in Amy's eyes.

"...Okay."

If they shared the same feelings, words weren't important, and Amy hugged Shirone's waist tightly.

"That man is her boyfriend?"

The soldiers' eyes widened, and several subordinates approached Tess to ask.

"Is it true, Sergeant? Is the battalion commander's boyfriend really one of the Ivory Tower's Big Five?"

"The Ivory Tower's Big Five?"

Reading his subordinates' psychology, Tess chuckled and said,

"No, just school classmates."

That's how connections work.

And another classmate, Maya, was watching Shirone and Amy from afar.

'There's no place for me to intrude.'

It wasn't just a matter of distance—she could tell from the look in their eyes.

"Maya, let's go back."

Palmers, who had been guarding her back, grabbed Maya's shoulder and turned her around.

"...Yes."

Tess's heart wasn't feeling good watching Maya return to the barracks either.

'How unfortunate. The timing was bad. Of all places, for the three of them to meet here.'

Actually, it wasn't the time to worry about others.

Tess, irritated by Shirone and Amy's affectionate display, hit Rian's arm.

"You idiot! Where the hell have you been and what were you doing?"

"What do you mean, what? I was at war."

It was a response that left no room for argument.

"I cut down an incredible number of demons. Cutting, cutting, and cutting some more until I got here."

Rian asked, placing his hand on Tess's head.

"How about it? Was I helpful?"

Tess pulled Rian's arm down to his shoulder and smiled while looking ahead.

"You did well."

It was a joyful reunion for almost everyone.

Since it was still wartime, they couldn't remain sentimental forever.

After hearing from Shirone about how he came to be here, Amy gave orders to her adjutant.

"Send a messenger right now and prepare to withdraw. Move as soon as orders come from above."

"Yes, Battalion Commander."

Since the 30,000-strong demon detachment had been annihilated, Amy's army had no reason to remain stationed here.

'Such a perfect victory.'

It was an achievement worthy of receiving a military decoration from the Holy War, but that would never happen.

'Shirone and Rian.'

Standing before the Infinite Wizard and the Knight of Mach, today's victory report felt rather shabby.

'This isn't the kind of force that should be in a single battalion.'

Even Amy, who had experienced countless wars, realized how great Shirone's strategic value was.

"Shirone, you said you're going to Tormia?"

The death of Rian's older brother Guy was sad news for Amy and Tess as well.

"Yeah. I'm going to the Ogent family to ask for forgiveness. I think that's the proper order."

It was conscience worthy of Shirone.

"Good. Our unit will be moving anyway. Would it be okay if we travel together partway?"

"Yeah, of course. I won't be leaving immediately either."

The report about Shirone reaching Valkyrie meant that the Chief of Staff would know about it too.

If Iruki needed him, there was no reason to create variables by leaving the unit early and being unable to prepare for urgent situations.

A duty officer approached.

"Battalion Commander, the barracks maintenance is almost finished. What about the performance? They're asking..."

Since there was a contract involved, he had to ask.

"Oh, right. The performance."

Amy, realizing belatedly, said,

"Shirone, Maya is here too. She came to give a comfort performance for our unit."

Shirone's face brightened.

"Really? Maya?"

Amy asked the officer,

"What does the agency representative say?"

"He says the affiliated singer seems to be shocked by the attack. If it comes to contract violation, he'll have to do it reluctantly, but..."

'It's not because of the attack.'

She had heard through Tess that Maya was present when Shirone reunited with them.

"Never mind. We have fault on our side too, so let's end it here. Give the soldiers beer."

Alcohol was forbidden even during performances, but the nearby demons had been completely annihilated.

"Shirone, you're going to see Maya, right?"

"Uh, well... would that be okay?"

Shirone wasn't stupid either.

"What are you talking about? She's not a stranger, she's a classmate. Go ahead. I'll check on the work site and follow."

"Okay, then."

As Shirone left the barracks, Amy put her arms on the desk and grabbed her head.

"Ugh, this is really driving me crazy."

She was worried sick.

'Why today of all days?'

Why did heaven send Shirone and then create a situation where he'd be with Maya?

Anyway, she had work to do.

Arriving at the unit's entrance, work was in full swing to clear demon corpses and repair the wire fencing.

"Amy."

Tess, who had been managing the site, came running.

"How did it go? Huh? What did Shirone say? Did you kiss? No wait, you're already in a hot relationship..."

Amy turned around, dumbfounded.

"What nonsense are you talking? This is the military. It's not a place where you can make a fuss just because your boyfriend came."

Tess was also conscious of his subordinates' watchful eyes.

"Who said to do it openly? Everyone else is probably thinking the same thing. You'd be a fool not to."

"Hmm."

Amy was human too.

The stress that builds up on the battlefield was beyond imagination, and her sexual frustration had reached its peak.

The only reason she had been able to endure until now was because she had no experience with men.

"Battalion Commander, we'll change the wire fence to C-type. It should save time."

Amy looked back at the soldier with vacant eyes.

He was examining blueprints and habitually putting the pen cap on and off.

Amy swallowed hard.

"Heave! Ho!"

At the entrance, soldiers with hammers were pounding thick stakes into the ground with thud-thud-thud sounds.

"Hey! Tighten it! More, more!"

On the opposite side, she could see soldiers sweating as they tried to fit long bolts into nuts.

"...!"

Suddenly she felt hot.

'Ugh, I need to get it together.'

Before diving deeper, Amy shook her head left and right to clear her thoughts.

"Are you sick somewhere? Your cheeks are really red."

"It's nothing. Anyway, I'll go see Maya first. You finish up and rest too."

As Amy turned to leave, Tess asked,

"You're worried after all, aren't you?"

Amy stopped walking.

"The person Shirone loves is you. So you don't need to think deeply about Maya."

"I don't know."

Though she was a rival, she was also a friend and comrade.

"It's not a simple matter. So... it makes me feel like I'm committing a sin. In some ways, it feels like violence."

Could sharing love with Shirone in Maya's presence really be called the best choice?

"You missed him too. Besides, we're soldiers. We don't know when or where something might happen."

Soldiers have no tomorrow.

"I won't die. I'll definitely win."

Amy smiled as she looked back.

"Don't worry about me, worry about Rian instead. I really can't figure you two out."

Having nothing to say back, Tess puffed up his cheeks and looked up.

"You have to look at the sky to pick stars."

Past midnight.

In an empty field with no one around, Amy and Maya looked up at the night sky, lost in thought.

"I'm sorry, Amy."

Maya knew her position exactly.

"For what?"

"You're bothered because of me for no reason. It must have been annoying to see Shirone and me laughing and chatting."

Amy chuckled.

"You really haven't changed. What's wrong with that? It's good for friends to have fun together."

Whatever her true feelings might be.

"But you know. How I feel about Shirone. And even now."

"Tess told me."

If she had been in Maya's position.

"I felt uncomfortable too. Honestly, I don't really know what to do in situations like this."

"Don't think like that. I have no intention of being a hindrance. If you care about me, just do what you want to do."

"Do what I want to do..."

Amy turned her head.

"I won't do anything that would make you worry."

"Huh?"

Maya blinked.

"It's not pity, and it's not about conscience either. It's because we're friends. While we're here, I'd like everyone to get along well."

She didn't want to distinguish between men and women.

"Amy..."

How could this be exactly like their school days?

"What? Why are you making that face? Don't misunderstand. It's not that I'm giving you a chance..."

Maya wiped away tears.

"Thank you. Thank you, Amy."

She was happy to have such a wonderful friend, but at the same time, her heart ached.

'This way, I can't even steal him away.'

The next morning.

A Kaidra sent from the Holy War landed at Amy's unit at lightning speed.

"Urgent orders!"

At the faster response time than expected, Amy greeted the messenger with a tense expression.

"What's the matter?"

Tess and Rian arrived, and Shirone, who had been helping pack, also approached with Maya.

The messenger took out a letter.

"Orders from Valkyrie Chief of Staff Iruki. Shirone, Amy, and Maya are to return immediately to the Kingdom of Tormia and go to Creas City."

Maya pointed to herself.

"What? Me too?"

If it was war-related business, Rian couldn't be left out, even if Tess might be.

Shirone fell into thought.

'Me, Amy, and Maya?'

The only thing the three had in common was being graduates of Alpheas Magic School.

"Here is the Chief of Staff's letter."

As Amy opened the letter, Shirone and Maya stood side by side behind her and read with their eyes.

"What...?"

It contained Fisho's obituary.
