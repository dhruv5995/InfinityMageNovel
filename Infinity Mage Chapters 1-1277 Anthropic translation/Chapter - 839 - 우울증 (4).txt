Depression (4)

Habits' army entered Kashan's capital without shedding blood.

White flags hung from every house, and the residents bowed their heads in terror.

It wasn't just because they had lost the war.

The vanguard had already swept through - corpses littered the streets and the thick scent of fresh blood filled the air. Smodo, chewing on a toothpick, smiled.

"Quick to grasp the situation. That's Kashan's Empress for you."

Vulcan thought it wasn't over yet.

"I heard there was a succession ceremony. If they've already lost the war, why would that matter?"

"They're probably planning to negotiate while keeping the Empress hidden. If the conditions are right, we might as well accept. After all, we just need to enjoy ourselves."

When they arrived at the entrance of the imperial palace Aganos, the army of hell had completely surrounded it on all sides.

As the gates opened, the spectacle inside the palace was revealed.

"Heeeuuu......"

Over a thousand humans were bound to various torture devices, bleeding profusely.

The torture devices were connected along mechanical tracks to objects that looked like musical instruments placed throughout the area.

"Something Zetaro made."

After passing through the outer gate, a demon who had distinguished himself in this war approached Habits and bowed his head.

He was just under two meters tall, wearing black armor studded with spikes - a remarkably handsome man.

Amon, commander of the 7th Corps of Hell's Army.

One of the ten corps commanders called Satan's direct lineage, he wielded a black iron sword heated by hellfire.

None of the demon corps commanders were weak, but those in the top ten were on a different level of power.

"I have been waiting, Satan."

Though Habits maintained human form, Amon could see clearly.

The four red triangles floating above Habits' head were the mark of one who existed beyond the law.

Vulcan asked.

"Where is Kashan's ruler?"

As soon as he finished speaking, a group emerged from the direction of the inner gate.

It was Gando, who had just become emperor, and the highest nobles who had ruled Kashan until now.

Amon spoke to Habits.

"This is an event Zetaro prepared to commemorate this victory. Please enjoy it to the fullest."

With those words and his signal, a hundred-member orchestra composed of demons took their positions.

Red-skinned female forms with hair made entirely of tentacles stood holding sheet music.

A short, plump conductor looked around the orchestra and waved his baton.

As countless instruments began to play.

"......!"

Over a thousand humans began screaming in different pitches.

From the moment the first note rang out, Gando and the nobles felt all their body hair stand on end.

'Wicked bastards.'

Gando gritted his teeth and endured.

"Army of Hell!"

In time with the music made from human screams, a choir puffed out their bellies and sang.

Each time they played their instruments, the clattering torture devices squeezed even stronger sounds from the human voices.

"World of Chaos!"

It was truly the sound of hell's song, and even Vulcan and Smodo were deeply moved.

"This is really killer..."

Zetaro is a genius.

Habits seemed impressed too, but after listening to the music briefly, he only let out a small laugh.

"Let's go."

As Amon led the way, Habits' group passed the tearfully moved choir and approached Gando.

'It's not boring. But...'

Just the fact that it wasn't Uorin greeting him dampened his mood.

'What I want to hear is the Empress's song.'

Though Habits didn't need to personally greet the surrendered empire's emperor, boldly, he approached right up close.

"Where is Uorin?"

Gando, who had already prepared himself for everything, bowed respectfully.

"She is in the castle. However, before you meet her, I have a proposal as Emperor of the Kashan Empire."

Vulcan smirked.

'I knew you'd come at us like this.'

"I will hand over Kashan's governing rights. You may employ me or behead me if I'm inconvenient. However, I hope to see no more bloodshed. Please guarantee the lives of the people."

The highest nobles' faces were filled with emotion.

'Forgive us, Your Imperial Majesty.'

This was a decision to abandon Teraze's honor and sell his own body to ensure his country's safety.

Habits looked at Gando with indifferent eyes.

Though his pupils showed no intention of analysis, Gando felt dizzy from the unknowable chaos.

'Mother...'

Last evening, Uorin had called for Gando.

"We will lose this war as it stands. Even the Holy War's help has limits. Kashan will soon perish."

Gando didn't mind.

Though he should have been angry and despairing, somehow he felt no emotional turbulence.

Perhaps it was because of Uorin's unusually pale face.

'So Mother knows fear too.'

She who had never known defeat through her ability to encompass history, but from the Great Purification onward was uncharted territory.

Most of all, facing Habits of Chaos was the worst possible situation.

"I'll find a way. With the remaining forces and the Holy War's power, somehow an escape route..."

"No, that won't get us away from Habits. I've considered every method. I've thought about what would be a good ending. And my decision is—"

Uorin looked up at Gando.

"I must live."

Though she had the expression of a terrified rabbit, only her eyes still burned with the will to live.

"I'm not afraid of dying. Being caught by Habits... I could endure that. But Gando, I want to live."

Gando realized what Uorin would do.

'Focus only on survival.'

She intended to cast aside Kashan's history, Teraze's honor, the officials' lives, and the people's welfare - everything - just to survive.

'That Teraze...'

He wasn't angry about abandoning the emperor's responsibility.

What disgusted him was seeing her, who had stood at the world's pinnacle, desperately clinging to life.

"Mother, I'd rather..."

"Save me."

Gando couldn't say anything.

Breaking free from Habits' chaos, Gando spoke.

"That is all we desire. If you accept our proposal, we will open Aganos immediately."

Vulcan asked.

"If we refuse?"

"Then Kashan will perish. But you'll never get what the Gustav Empire wants."

"Uorin."

Habits spoke.

"Where is she?"

Gando pointed to the highest floor of Aganos.

Just below the fluttering white flag, a white-haired woman was looking down from a window.

"What will you do?"

After staring up at the spire for a long while, Habits spoke.

"Amon."

Amon in his armor stepped beside him.

"Kill them all."

The moment those words fell, Amon's sword passed by, leaving a black afterimage.

All the nobles except Gando, who had evaporated and transformed into electricity, were split in half.

"Kyaaaaaaah!"

Maids and servants farther away screamed and fled.

"Damn it!"

Where the crowd parted, Gando was crouched down frowning, having cast spark magic.

'Did he notice?'

No, he had just acted on a whim.

'Definitely the Empress's natural enemy.'

With Plan A failed, Gando's eyes focused on Habits, barely twenty meters away.

'If I could just kill him...'

It was a life he'd already offered up anyway.

Casting spark magic toward Hell's army, Gando cast Lightning in front of Habits.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

Perfect release, holding back no magical power.

Blue electricity spread in all directions, wildly tearing through the atmosphere before causing a massive explosion.

Boooooom!

'I missed!'

A demon of division commander rank under Amon had embraced Habits and soared into the sky.

Smodo sighed in relief.

'If the demon hadn't helped, would Habits have died?'

Vulcan drew his sword and approached.

"Smodo, don't think complicated thoughts. Just remember - he simply doesn't die."

"...I see. Understood."

Though Kashan's royal guard was pouring out attacks, the 7th Corps Commander's direct unit was no pushover either.

"Was it a trap?"

Vulcan shook his head.

"No. Until just moments ago, I detected no killing intent in the crowd's energy. They really intended to surrender."

"Then why on earth?"

Vulcan smiled bitterly.

"Truly remarkable, Teraze."

She had chosen to live even if it meant killing all ten billion citizens.

"To the spire!"

Amon instantly flew to the spire, grabbed the woman standing at the window, and brought her down.

The woman with white-dyed hair trembled in terror.

"P-please spare..."

The woman who was about to beg for her life shed tears and shouted.

"Long live Her Imperial Majesty!"

Vulcan, who had beheaded her with one stroke, looked at the exhausted Gando and asked.

"Uorin. Where is she?"

Gando could only weakly raise one corner of his mouth.

While the Five Great Stars maintained their respective philosophies in silence, the other stars argued.

Mynie jumped up and shouted.

"We must go to Kashan immediately! If the Three Emperors system collapses, the demons' power will grow even stronger!"

"Why should we? Kashan was trying to side with the demons. Humans will do anything for profit."

"I agree as well. After all, it's human affairs. The Ivory Tower pursues supranational purposes..."

⟨Law Kill⟩ let out another shriek.

Kyaaaaaaaaah!

The voice vanished as if by magic, and all the stars looked at Shirone.

"That's enough."

The Ivory Tower.

The pinnacle of the magical world that pursued pure scholarship without being swayed by any power.

"I'm leaving the Ivory Tower."

At this unexpected statement, Minerva asked in surprise.

"Shirone, what are you saying?"

"Don't misunderstand. I'm not angry or disappointed. Everyone here is right."

The problem was that everyone was right.

"You're not running away?"

Freed spoke without even turning his head.

"You were friends with Kashan's Empress. Too soft. I don't know how you became one of the Five Great Stars like that. We consider the overall world. If you truly care about the world, push through here. Try to pressure us."

"No."

Shirone was firm.

"Now I understand what you said. You climbed to this position because you were sick of getting involved with humans, tired of arguments."

"Yes. That's the Ivory Tower."

"That's why I'm going up."

To a higher place.

Only then did Freed turn his head, and Shirone glared at him coldly as he spoke.

"I'm sick of it, getting entangled with you people."

Freed's face reddened, and Sein looked at Shirone with an interested expression.

Minerva let out a small laugh.

'Yes. That's more like you.'

Shirone caught the trembling ⟨Law Kill⟩ from the air and approached Taeseong.

"It'll be too late if I start from the North Pole. Let me exit from here."

"...Outside is space."

Shirone looked down at the blue planet visible through the transparent glass floor.

"Because it's the fastest route."

"I understand."

Though this was an unauthorized departure from the Great Assembly, Taeseong looked oddly pleased.

'Yes, Shirone. The position you seek isn't the highest, but something beyond that.'

And someday, you'll clash with me over that one unique position.

'Material.'

As Shirone emitted Yahweh's light, a transparent sphere formed around him.

Minerva nodded.

"Aha..."

If he could just break through the atmosphere, it would be a direct route to Kashan.

As Taeseong raised both hands, the glass sphere containing Shirone rose to the ceiling.

"Remember, Shirone. You said you're leaving the Ivory Tower, but..."

In an instant, the glass sphere escaped outside the Earth Temple.

"I won't allow it."

The glass sphere, pulled by the planet's gravity, began falling toward the desert at a terrifying speed.
