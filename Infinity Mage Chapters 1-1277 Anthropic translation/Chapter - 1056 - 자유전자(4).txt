Free Electron (4)

'How did he get in?'

Bedium was Lycan's father, but no longer a biological father.

His body was electricity, and by controlling the movement of electric charges, he could go anywhere in the world.

'Is it an angel's ability?'

Having remained in Amy's room in the state of electric charge, he remembered all the conversation content.

In the process, he had discovered that Ikael was an angel, but didn't know her exact abilities.

'An ordinary human, no, even the most exceptional human couldn't detect the movement of electric charges. Therefore...'

There was no chance of winning in a direct confrontation.

"Answer me."

As Ikael moved, the moonlight coming through the window revealed her face.

The eyes carved on the white mask had changed to hearts, but the atmosphere remained cold.

"That woman... is Sirone's girlfriend."

"Sirone?"

"Yes. What I'm after is Sirone. If I kill that woman, I can shake Sirone's emotions."

The reason for being honest was to somehow get a chance to escape the situation.

'No matter how fast I react, I won't be able to escape that woman's senses.'

If she was like a Scale mage who could ignore space, her mobility would be tremendous too.

"Hmm."

Thinking she had caught her prey, Ikael rested her chin on her hand and fell into thought.

With Bedium still unable to move, her judgment wasn't wrong either.

"Why... are you trying to kill Sirone?"

"That bastard..."

Complex and delicate lines were drawn on the white mask that had only shown simple emotional expressions.

It was the face of a demon, clear as a photograph.

"Because he killed my son."

"What?"

Thinking 'now's the time,' Bedium's body dissolved into electric charge again.

"Damn it!"

When she regained her focus, the flow of electric charge had weakened to the point where it was difficult to track.

'He was aiming for this.'

He only needed to hold Ikael for the brief moment electricity remained in space.

'Truly a strong human. But for Sirone to have killed his son, what could have happened?'

She would find out by asking Sirone as soon as dawn broke, but she changed her mind.

'Sirone is my son.'

In any situation, protecting her child came first.

Her body spread into light again as she watched Amy, still deep in sleep.

'I'll handle this.'

A silent explosion of light occurred, and the room was quiet as if nothing had happened.

'This is absurd.'

Bedium, roaming as free electrons in the air, sensed Ikael's presence.

He could read human brain waves, but couldn't analyze their exact thoughts, that is, language.

However, angels were different from humans, so her thoughts were being felt directly through her photon body.

Ikael turned at a right angle, ignoring inertia.

'There.'

In Amy's room, Bedium had perfectly deceived Ikael's senses, but...

'Enhanced?'

That was only her natural, unamplified senses.

Currently, Ikael's senses were so sensitive she could feel the breathing of a butterfly sleeping in the forest.

'He's gone.'

Ikael stopped with a thud.

'He's eliminated his thoughts.'

In the free electron state, Bedium's presence was zero, but when specific thoughts occurred, he couldn't prevent the electric charge.

"I don't know what circumstances led to that body..."

Ikael treated him as a worthy opponent to respect.

"The elimination of thought is the elimination of existence. You won't be able to stay in that state forever."

A breeze passed through the silence.

"Come out. I want to hear your story. Depending on the circumstances, I might be able to compromise."

His son had died.

Although she had Sirone now, she knew the pain of losing a child.

Crackle crackle crackle!

Sparks burst around them, and grass 10 meters away from Ikael caught fire.

Where ash ascended like a whirlwind, Bedium revealed his human body again.

The mask was just blank like white paper.

"So you're an angel? Interesting."

Despite his admiration, there was no fear in his tone.

"You're also a strong human. You said Sirone killed your son. Is that true?"

"Yes."

"If Sirone did wrong—"

"There's no need."

Bedium extended his hand, cutting off her words.

"My son was also an assassin. He probably died trying to kill Sirone instead. It's just business. I have no special feelings toward Sirone."

Ikael understood the situation but didn't think Bedium was being honest.

"To achieve what emotions want, you must kill the emotions instead?"

"...You don't seem like an angel. Of course, this is my first time seeing one, but I thought you'd be more cold-blooded."

Ikael thought of Gauffin.

"There's no being without a heart."

"So what's your reason for tracking me? Are you planning to eliminate threats to Sirone in advance?"

"I'm also a parent. Even if there were justifiable reasons, the sadness itself doesn't disappear. If you apologize in the way you want, could you forgive Sirone?"

"Impossible."

Bedium said.

"I've already received the commission fee, and there's money I need to receive after completion. It was my mistake not to properly assess an angel's abilities. But I won't make the same mistake twice."

His eyes changed to dollar signs ($).

Ikael didn't give up.

"If you want money, I'll give it to you. No matter how much you ask, I'll get it."

"No."

This had a different meaning from 'impossible.'

"Why?"

After being lost in thought for a long time, Bedium muttered as if to himself.

"I can't... be embarrassed in front of that kid."

Lycan.

Perhaps because these were the most painful words for Ikael, she quietly turned her body.

"Fine."

Her delicate fist aimed at Bedium.

"If it's a matter of emotions, I'll act on my emotions too. One strike. I'll subdue you with this. If I can't, then you can do as you please."

Bedium didn't understand but had no choice.

"You'll regret it."

His body glowed bluish.

"I'll show you my greatest technique. I guarantee it'll be completely different from anything you've known."

Even if he were to vanish forever.

Bedium, who had been glaring at Ikael as she silently extended her fist, evaporated into electricity.

Simultaneously, blue sparks flew in all directions.

The flow of thought currently composing Bedium was nothing but killing intent toward Ikael.

'Kill her.'

If the sky were to strike Ikael with lightning, the sense needed to avoid it...

'Right now!'

Following not human insight but the vital points of nature, Bedium charged in.

Time slowed to the extreme.

Even with Bedium's strike approaching point-blank range, Ikael didn't move a muscle.

Only her photon body unfolded.

'Ataraxia.'

As if ignoring the relativity of time, a magic circle was born, her senses became incredibly sharp.

Feeling the movement of electrons as if she could grasp them, she twisted her body at tremendous speed.

'Hit!'

Her extended fist twisted its trajectory and struck Bedium's mask hard.

Crack.

The mask cracked, and Bedium's body shot backward like an electric cannon.

"Aaaahhh!"

The white mask that had been floating alone over the grassland fell downward, pulled by gravity.

An expression with drooping eyes was displayed.

"That was close."

Ikael said, withdrawing her fist.

"I don't think you're someone who'd break a promise. However, I'd like to hear your last words. What happened to that body?"

"Kek! Krik..."

The mask made mechanical sounds for a moment before barely regaining human speech.

"What's the point of knowing? It's a frustrating story that nobody wants to hear. Your son is alive. Isn't that enough?"

A cold wind passed, and Bedium's mask spoke in a voice smaller than before.

"Why are you curious about that? My son tried to kill Sirone. There's absolutely no reason to sympathize with me. Why did you bother to give me a chance?"

"A very long time ago, my son died. Right before my eyes... his head was cut off."

"I'm not sure. Self-defense, or that your son was in the wrong—most people would think that way, but..."

Ikael's eyebrows rose sadly.

"Emotions aren't like that. Even if a parent's heart is the same, because we've had the same experience, there are situations we can't handle logically."

A long time passed like that.

"I don't know exactly either. Why my body became electricity. But what's certain is..."

Bedium searched his memory.

"After hearing about Lycan's death from the client, I decided to kill Sirone. It must have been from then. Whether my hostility toward Sirone caused some effect... Maybe I'm already dead, and only my memories have been restored."

Ikael recalled a word she'd heard from Sirone.

'Fine-tuning.'

Bedium's voice was now so small it couldn't be heard without careful attention.

"When you become electricity, you can know many things. Most of it can't be organized into language, but the feeling is like that. This world seems to hate your son."

Ikael's expression became serious.

'Fine-tuning is applied to those who hate Sirone. Active intervention from the outside world.'

The ceiling of the world was half-open.

"Who commissioned the assassination?"

"I can't tell you that. It's professional pride. But Sirone probably has an idea."

Ikael didn't pry further.

"I have nothing more to say. But anyway... when exactly am I going to disappear?"

His body had vanished, but his thoughts spread slowly like dispersing scent.

That's what made it possible.

"Was it Ikael?"

Ikael, who had been bowing her head as if in silent prayer, looked back at Bedium.

"This is strange. No, should I say mysterious? I'll give you good information."

He was at the boundary of the outside world.

"For God..."

Neon flowed across the mask's surface, revealing an expression with tongue sticking out.

"Time flows backward."

"What?"

Before Ikael could ask, the neon went out and the cracked mask quietly disappeared.

Something even an archangel couldn't understand.

But she set aside her thoughts for a moment and turned her head as if following death with her gaze.

'I hope it was at least a life filled with something.'

Good or evil, anything.

The next morning, Ikael told Sirone about what had happened the night before.

Sirone had roughly guessed.

'Giyorgi.'

He was the head of a department called Catacomb, organized by hell's army to assassinate Yahweh.

"I didn't mention it because I was worried, but there were assassination attempts in other regions too. But this time..."

It was chilling that they had targeted those close to him.

'I was too careless. No, actually, it's impossible to be more careful than this. The problem is...'

Fine-tuning.

'It's impossible to guard against something where even universal constants are different. That's why Nane also went to the outside world.'

Ikael said.

"For God, time flows backward. Those were his last words. Do you have any idea what that might mean?"

"No. I could set up several hypotheses, but there's nothing definitive. But I'll find out soon. I'm going to ancient ruins with Zulu."

Canis and Arin had also joined.

'First, Wizard.'

As soon as he thought this and turned his head, Wizard was walking toward the training ground.

Whether he'd stayed up all night, his eyes were sunken and he'd become noticeably gaunt in just one day.

'You worked hard.'

If a genius of the century had exerted enough effort to exhaust his calories in just one day, what would the results be?

"Teacher."

As Wizard approached Sirone directly, the instructors swallowed nervously while watching.

"Yes. You spent the whole night. Did you get some results?"

"One day."

Wizard's expression, which had been glaring fiercely at Sirone, suddenly changed to a tearful one.

"Can't you give me just one more day?"
