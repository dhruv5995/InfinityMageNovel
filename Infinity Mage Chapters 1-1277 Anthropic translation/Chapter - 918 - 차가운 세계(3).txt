The Cold World (3)

Dante looked around the village.

Instead of the concepts of walls and roofs, they followed a unique residential style called the "Sun Path."

Where the trees intertwined, when sunlight entered, the ground sparkled like stars.

'They eat food too, but in extreme situations, they can survive on just water and sunlight.'

Of course, they never ate meat. As they walked along the Sun Path with its straight-line open ceiling, a smile bloomed on Plarino's face.

"Ah, look at this sunlight. What a beautiful sky. I wish you could all walk this Sun Path and..."

She wanted to share the joy of the Flower Tribe, but what came back was Lupist's cold gaze.

"S-sorry."

Contrary to expectations, Lupist looked up at the sky.

"Do you like the sun?"

"Huh? Oh, of course. For the Flower Tribe, the sun is the greatest gift that brings us joy."

"I like it too."

Plarino's mouth hung open in bewilderment.

"But I don't look up at it without reason. How many humans do you think live while actually thinking there's a sky up there?"

"Why not? It's so wonderful. When you close your eyes and feel the sunlight, you feel happy."

"Happy?"

Lupist sneered.

"Do you know what we gave up first to build the current system? Individual happiness. We use the suffering of the entire population as fuel."

The Flower Tribe man asked.

"What meaning does that have? If no one can be happy, why do such a thing?"

"To dominate you."

"If they can feel superior, humans will even give up happiness. Call it madness toward supremacy? But a system even more consumed by madness than ours has appeared."

The Flower Tribe didn't leave their territory, but they read the political situation through World Creation.

"Depending on which side is more insane, the winner of the system will be decided. Understand? Humans exist in such a world. Yet you talk about the sun and happiness."

Plarino hung her head dejectedly.

"We know we're a failed species too. That's why we live in hiding like this."

"It's too early to conclude that."

When Plarino turned around with a surprised expression, Lupist pointed at the air with his index finger.

"Anyway... the weather's killer."

How long had it been since he realized there was a sky and that he could look at it?

'Is it time for me to retire?'

When did he start getting lost in sentimentality?

"You've arrived."

In a spot with good sunlight, a woman with flowing black hair sat cross-legged.

'That woman...'

Lupist stopped walking at the rich lotus fragrance wafting through the air.

"Are you a direct descendant of the Flower Tribe?"

The woman smiled and bowed her head.

"Yes. I'm Protea of the Lotus bloodline. Thank you for coming to this humble place."

He had given them a place to live as payment for the deal, but hadn't particularly cared about who the chief was.

He had only received reports that some Flower Tribe members had found their way here on their own after the village was established.

'Lotus bloodline. Some remained.'

The origin of the Flower Tribe was known to be the lotus.

"Long, long ago, a nameless Buddha sat on a lotus and devoted himself to enlightenment for 40,000 years."

Protea spoke.

"That lotus, without withering or dying, listened to human life alongside the Buddha."

Lupist continued.

"And on the day the Buddha departed, the lotus also awakened to incarnation and became human. That's the creation myth of the Flower Tribe."

It was just folklore, but without it being true, there was no way to explain the diversity of Flower Tribe bloodlines.

'It can't happen naturally. Unless the first Flower Tribe spread it through World Creation...'

Therefore, the Lotus bloodline before his eyes was a direct descendant of the Flower Tribe that gained enlightenment from the Buddha.

'Annoying.'

If it were another Flower Tribe member, he could just intimidate them, but Protea was no easy opponent.

"So, what brings our benefactor Lupist here?"

"You already know, don't you?"

With the direct descendant's abilities, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say she controlled the entire forest beyond just the village.

"Hehe. Yes, actually... I heard Lupist's philosophy about systems well. You seem to be facing a situation requiring precise control of bioweapons."

Dante readily admitted.

"Yes. It's a massive structure. We've built a separate interface, but precise work requires dozens of people."

"On the other hand, with World Creation, one Flower Tribe member could control down to the neural level."

Lupist stepped forward.

"If you know, this will be quick. If we lose, you won't survive either. It would be wise to cooperate."

"The Flower Tribe's decision is..."

The smile disappeared from Protea's face.

"Refusal."

It was an unexpected answer, but Lupist didn't hesitate.

"Then die."

As blades shot up around her, Plarino screamed and jumped back.

"One less won't change the strategy. If I carry your head around, other Flower Tribe members will join in."

Dante asked.

"Why? Half the world has already fallen to the Demon Tribe. If humans lose, you won't be safe either."

"We're going to die anyway."

The Flower Tribe's gazes focused on her.

"Bioweapons are ancient weapons. Mobilizing the entire Flower Tribe means there are at least hundreds of them. If such powerful weapons can't stop the enemy, aren't we just sacrificial lambs?"

Lupist didn't deny it.

"Humans will pay an equal price. Risking everything to gain everything - that's war."

"It's only a human war. Present a means to guarantee the Flower Tribe's survival. Otherwise, cooperation is impossible."

The Flower Tribe members who had been listening from the forest revealed themselves and activated World Creation.

The forest rustled, and a writhing sensation like nerve bundles passing underground was transmitted.

"Hmph."

The moment Lupist snorted, a blade larger than a person shot up beside him.

"Ugh!"

Several Flower Tribe members frowned, but Protea didn't even blink.

"Threats are useless. You've manipulated us as you pleased until now, but we'll choose our own death."

"I-I'll do it."

Everyone's attention focused on Plarino.

"I'll operate the bioweapon, so please don't fight. I've done it before, so I should be able to do it well."

Protea glared.

"Plarino, what are you doing? This is a fight with the entire Flower Tribe's fate at stake. There's no choice."

"If there's no choice, we should at least fight. If humans lose, the Flower Tribe will perish too."

"No, if we're going to perish anyway, we won't help humans. Think about what they've done so far. They violated your body and defiled your mind! Humans are the most selfish!"

"I know."

How could she forget?

"But I think Lupist is different. He seems cold and calculating, but if he were really that kind of person..."

Plarino's gaze turned to Lupist.

"He wouldn't have prepared a village for the Flower Tribe from the beginning. This place is truly where we wanted to be."

It was the optimal location.

"You're being deceived. He prepared for this situation to use us..."

"He said the weather was good."

Plarino continued.

"I don't think someone who knows the warmth of sunlight doesn't know true happiness."

Her eyes moistened.

"You know but have to fight anyway. Because not everyone can be happy, so you become colder and colder... But actually, you want everyone to be happy, don't you?"

"No. I'm naturally a cold bastard. And humans are evil. I can do anything for my purposes."

This was why Lupist found dealing with women difficult.

'She's sentimental in strange ways. Annoying.'

An enemy worth tearing apart was approaching, and what did it matter if someone was good or bad?

'We have to fight first. Set up the optimal strategy and execute it.'

But on the other hand.

He felt good that someone understood the reason for fighting.

"Sigh."

When Lupist released his Spirit Zone, Dante also withdrew his killing intent shortly after.

"Fine, let's resolve this through dialogue. I'll do my best to ensure your survival. Is that enough?"

"No. We need a definite guarantee."

Just as veins bulged on Lupist's temple, a woman's voice came from the forest.

"I'll take care of that."

The pupils of Lupist and Dante, who looked toward where the voice came from, moved with afterimages.

'Fast.'

Just the speed of moving out of sight raised their wariness to the limit.

Protea's eyes shook.

"You are..."

She was a woman with ears more pointed than humans, a pale face, and eyes as clear and clean as a spring.

"Hello?"

As she turned around waving cheerfully, Lupist recognized her face.

"Enox."

She was the representative of the Fairy Tribe, one of the Holy War's Second Army Commanders.

"Yes. The Grand Marshal told me to come. He said I'd probably be helpful."

Dante's eyes grew hollow.

'If this was the plan, at least give me a heads up.'

When Protea knelt and prostrated herself, the remaining Flower Tribe members followed her in paying respects.

"O Master of the Forest."

"It's been a while. The Flower Tribe still has a wonderful fragrance."

Enox raised her index finger and said.

"Anyway, don't worry about the war. We elves will step forward to protect the Flower Tribe."

"...Do you mean the elves will also participate in the war?"

"Of course we should."

"Why do you help humans? They are beings who destroy the nature we cherish."

"That's exactly it."

Enox caressed Protea's chin and said.

"Humans are thrilling."

That night.

The royal castle of Tormia.

With King Adolf on sick leave, Lupist and Flu attended a royal banquet.

With Pony, a graduate of Alpheus Magic School, in attendance, various small talk was exchanged.

"The world situation has reached a serious point. Countless people who invested in other countries have gone bankrupt."

Even now, with the war against the Demon Tribe in full swing, the royals were only obsessed with increasing their wealth.

'The most unrealistic space.'

Lupist silently continued his meal.

'That's what the system needs.'

Components that are completely divorced from reality and only cry out for ideals.

"By the way, this secretary-general is quite cute. The previous woman was too fierce, not my type."

Flu smiled with her eyes.

"Thank you for the kind words."

Taking advantage of the atmosphere she created, Lupist brought up a difficult request.

"The Demon Tribe will invade Tormia. I'd like to mobilize the royal castle's guard."

"The royal castle's guard?"

Since they were the last bastion for the royals, the atmosphere instantly grew heavy.

"Yes. You don't need to worry. We have the flower garden. We just need troops for support missions."

They're all going to die anyway.

If they were going to be annihilated, Lupist wanted to use everything available.

"Well, if there's a flower garden, it's safe. Tormia has the world's strongest defense."

The person who achieved that was Lupist.

"That aside..."

A royal with thick eyebrows pointed his fork alternately at Lupist and Flu.

"How is it, the bedroom compatibility? You know, there were rumors before. That you were a secretary-general killer. Hahaha!"

The royals burst into laughter.

Regardless of the rumors' truth, they just wanted to see the reactions of the Magic Association Chairman and Secretary-General.

"Not particularly..."

Lupist showed no change in expression.

"It's not fun. The previous secretary-general was much better."

"Oh? Is that so? Well, Miss Flu is too thin. Eat this and put on some weight."

Flu puffed her cheeks.

"This is kind of insulting to my pride. The Chairman just has strange tastes. Not that I can prove otherwise."

"Why can't you? Leave it to me once. My virility is world-renowned."

"Eek! That's a bit scary."

While the royals burst into laughter, only Pony wasn't laughing.

'It's a lie.'

Having attended magic school, she knew.

The bone-chillingly cold emotions in the eyes of the two mages who were disguising their laughter.

'Professional mages. But not political enough to genuinely please the royals. And the royal castle's guard.'

A thrill ran down Pony's spine.

'Something tremendous is about to happen.'
