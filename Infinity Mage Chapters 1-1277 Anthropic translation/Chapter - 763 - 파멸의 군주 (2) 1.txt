[763] Lord of Destruction (2)

"Legion Commander."

Beshum, the 7th Division Commander belonging to the 24th Legion, approached with his black iron armor clanking.

"Our soldiers are attacking our own forces."

Marduk the Destroyer, a beautiful man, merely smiled faintly while sitting on his throne.

"Can you stop them?"

Beshum immediately prostrated himself.

"Just leave it to me!"

"Hmm."

When Marduk rose from his seat, the three other division commanders guarding the area showed their respect, aside from Beshum.

"An interesting ability. Infection..."

What Marduk looked down upon from the window was a massive wave where individuality could no longer be distinguished.

"Aaaah! Die! Just die already!"

Number of infected: 165,843.

Marduk bared his fangs and laughed as he watched the demons afflicted with Walking Dead massacre their own kind.

"Truly demonic, isn't it?"

Savoring that irony, the four division commanders also silently watched the scene outside the window.

Number of infected: 325,574.

The infection routes created on a scale of millions were generating massive ripples, surging toward the leader's palace.

"Clear them out."

Marduk made a resolute decision.

"They're useless."

The situation was already beyond recovery, and once the number of infected exceeded one million, even the division commanders would find it troublesome.

"I shall obey your command."

Sirone and Minerva, walking through the middle of the battlefield, set their eyes on the leader's palace visible in the distance.

"Kill yourselves! Kill yourselves the moment you're bitten!"

The brigade commanders of hell issued threats, but the chain of command was already beyond salvage.

Some demons took their own lives, but statistics always converge to the average, and as demons who missed their chance attacked those around them again, the infection grew like a snowball.

Number of infected: 653,329.

Sirone walked along the path opened by hell's army and gulped nervously.

'It's over. What a terrifying magic.'

While they benefited from the high population density, even if they had been scattered, total annihilation would have been a matter of time.

That's why his heart ached.

'Magic of fratricide.'

When Minerva first revealed this magic to the world, humanity faced extinction.

'Originally created to eliminate humans.'

What kind of horrific hatred of humanity must have been harbored to manifest such magic in the world?

"Don't be so hard on yourself."

Minerva, exhaling cigarette smoke, spoke with a twisted smile.

"I get embarrassed when you praise me like that."

"..."

While Sirone was lost in thought, an explosion erupted from the leader's palace with a boom.

"Looks like they finally realized their ass is on fire over there."

Where Minerva pointed with her pipe, there were four figures emitting distinctly visible purple auras.

"Division commanders."

The moment she finished speaking, a demon in black iron armor took a step forward and swung his sword.

"Pathetic creatures."

The sword's trajectory, which should have ended as an afterimage, still writhed in space, then spread out in massive ripples.

"Aaaaaaah!"

The number of demons cut down by a single sword stroke exceeded 300, and the other division commanders also began eliminating their own forces.

"A counter-fire strategy."

If they eliminated the infection targets in advance, they could at least prevent the demons from surging toward the leader's palace.

"A very demon-like judgment. But they can't stop it anyway."

The number of infected had already surpassed the number of uninfected.

"They can buy time though. Look over there."

Pointing to the top of the leader's palace, they saw Marduk, the 24th Legion Commander, looking down at them with a displeased expression.

"He's handsome."

Minerva's voice was as cold as ice.

"He'll be strong."

The demonic aura was blazing like flames to an undeniable degree.

"I'll handle the legion commander. You clean up here."

Sirone shook his head.

"No. This is my job. I'll take down the legion commander, so please handle the division commanders."

Minerva let out a hollow laugh.

"You, have you ever fought a legion commander?"

He hadn't.

"You know how strong division commanders are. But legion commanders are on a completely different level. The finest masterpiece that can be created through the condensation of demonic power."

He recalled the memory of how the Lord of Terror Igor had tormented the mercenary corps with his 'Brain in a Jar' in Radum.

"Hell's army was born when Satan's individuality melted into the raw material called demonic power. Especially from division commander level and above, the bizarreness of their individuality transcends common sense. It's a different matter from your righteousness."

Satan was an existence beyond the law.

"The reason your sermons are powerful is ultimately because they are right. Your tongue becomes a sword of truth that pierces the world. On the other hand, the reason your Yahweh is powerful is because it makes even wrong things not wrong."

All laws loved Sirone.

"That's the infinite mage. Everything imaginable is manifested through Yahweh's light. Then are you a god?"

He was not a god.

"You merely wield god's abilities, but you're human. Gods don't imagine things. Everything they created is all there is."

If he had truly been a god, Jaycee wouldn't have accepted the world as suffering either.

"I'm showing off, but you are strong. Surely only your infinity can stop that great righteousness. But that's also a battle of expandability. In terms of depth alone..."

Her voice was resolute.

"I don't think your level is deeper than Miro's or Beron's. At least not yet."

That was also true.

"You're twenty years old now. Your decisions are based on seeing possibilities, not believing you can save everything right now. Wasn't it the same with Jaycee?"

With all demons except a few commanders infected, Minerva began walking.

"Leave it to me. I'll ask you to watch my back."

Sirone placed his hand on Minerva's shoulder.

"Please let me do it."

"...This isn't a bet. If you die, humanity is finished. Not that it matters to me."

"I won't die. Nothing can be saved through death."

Minerva clicked her tongue and turned around.

"Do as you please. It's the world you saved anyway, whether you boil soup or mix poison..."

"Don't worry. I survived even against archangels in heaven."

Minerva smiled bitterly.

"Those angels who can't perform System Destruction..."

"System Destruction?"

"Ankera is the master of the system. No master allows their house to be burned down."

"I don't understand."

"Ask Taesung for details. Why Ankera had no choice but to seal Ymir..."

Minerva, gripping her jet, crouched down and took a stance to leap forward.

"I won't stop you if you insist, but you'd better be careful. Legion commanders can withstand Yahweh."

As Minerva charged forward riding her jet, Sirone also set aside his questions for now and launched his body.

'If I take down the legion commander, the war ends.'

Flapping his wings of light, he instantly arrived at the spire of the leader's palace where Marduk was.

An explosive sound erupted from where Minerva was, but without time to look back, Marduk flew up.

"Yahweh?"

The legion commander's sword stood vertically, and black energy climbed up the handle to cover the blade.

'Dangerous.'

As Marduk swung his sword, splitting the landscape, a line 10 meters thick extended to the horizon's end.

"What is that?"

Sirone, who had escaped using teleportation, climbed onto the opposite spire and observed the ground.

There was no sound, no impact.

The line extending straight as if drawn with a ruler was a deep furrow of immeasurable depth.

'How deep is it?'

One kilometer, ten kilometers, perhaps even more.

"It would be troublesome if you're surprised already."

Where Sirone slowly turned his head, Marduk was floating a black sphere above his right hand.

"Demonic power of destruction."

The sphere, wriggling like oil, fell and pierced through the ceiling of the leader's palace.

"..."

Checking the palace interior with Spirit Zone, he saw the sphere continuously penetrating floors and drilling into the ground.

'It keeps falling.'

It was a phenomenon that couldn't occur physically.

"Don't worry. It won't pierce through the star."

Sirone looked back at Marduk.

"It will just... hurt a little."

Because he was beyond the law, he was different from others, and even an infinite mage had no choice but to squeeze out imagination.

'How should I block this?'

Taesung grimaced and curled up her body.

"Ugh!"

The tremendous shock delivered to the star was being transmitted directly to her body.

"Are you alright?"

Mahoro Amanta, another of the Five Great Stars invited to the Earth Temple, approached.

The highest star in the Department of Balance, he was a bald, slender man with brown skin and many wrinkles around his eyes.

As the wheel held between his thumb and index finger made clockwork sounds while spinning rapidly, Taesung's gaze turned toward it.

'World Wheel.'

Mahoro's meaning was 'one who turns the world wheel,' and the clockwork sound was a signal that he was ready to step in if necessary.

Taesung forced a smile.

"Don't worry. System Destruction won't occur from something like this."

This was Taesung, who had proudly overcome even when asteroids collided in the very distant past.

"Of course. Even if mere demons attempt System Destruction, Overclock is a distant goal. However, I mean that Taesung need not unnecessarily endure pain."

Amanta pursued only moderation, and in that regard, the current actions of the demons seemed to have crossed the line.

"You speak like Terraforce."

"...It's the same philosophy. If you don't follow the rules, you cannot exist. I'm neither on the demons' side nor on humanity's side."

Taesung's sad face was captured between the rapidly spinning wheels of the World Wheel.

"I only hope not to sadden you further."

When Amanta clenched the World Wheel in his hand, they realized how quiet the Earth Temple could become.

"Take care of yourself."

After leaving those words and disappearing, Taesung looked back at the scene of North Eymond reflected on the ceiling.

"Sirone..."

The day of judgment was approaching.

'Angel's Punishment!'

Hundreds of Archangels of Light simultaneously hurled spears of light, devastating the ground.

The leader's palace had already lost its form, and the capital filled with the dictator's greed resembled a wasteland.

'I can't catch him.'

Every time Marduk's sword swept with afterimages, countless Sirone heads fell with thuds.

They were all Sirone, but they had sacrificed themselves with the single-minded determination to protect the main body.

The problem was the destructive energy that Marduk's sword sprayed like ink—any matter that touched it would be annihilated.

'Homing Photon Cannon!'

A full two hundred homing photon cannons drew parabolic arcs as they struck Marduk, but he had no reason to move.

"Veil of Destruction."

Black liquid covered Marduk, and the photon cannons silently created ripples of light before being annihilated.

"I misjudged."

Marduk took a stance to swing broadly, letting his sword hang toward his side.

"You weren't even worth targeting."

As the Great Destruction Sword Technique unfolded, black liquid sprayed in all directions, drawing massive lines.

'Instantaneous Space Movement!'

Sirone, who had penetrated the trajectory of the lines using teleportation, entered the other world through Cheonyi Bardo.

'This was it!'

If it was a phenomenon that ignored physics, it had to be an ability activated in the domain of the other side.

As expected, the black liquid was flying while encroaching even the other world, but its form was different from the real world.

"What the hell is this?"

Thanks to buying time by creating a shield with Material, he could feel it with Spirit Zone.

Extremely small creatures were eating away at iron.

'It's nano.'

Because of their sheer numbers, the metal decomposed instantly, and Sirone hastily flew his body.

"Do you think knowing will change anything?"

Marduk, who had tracked Sirone's position where he touched the nano weapon, swung his sword in the real world.

"Of course it changes."

Dark Sphere.

"100,000-fold overlap."

God's particles compressed tremendously, creating a black hole with a gravitational field of 8 meters in radius.

Kieeeeeee!

The black liquid that had been drawing parabolic arcs was sucked in spirally while emitting bone-chilling screams.
