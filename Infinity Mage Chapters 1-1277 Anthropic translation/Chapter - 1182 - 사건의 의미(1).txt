The Meaning of the Incident (1)

Strange phenomena occurring around pyramids scattered across the world were reported to the holy temple.

Entara, the chieftain of the southern tribal alliance, spoke.

"Divine intervention."

"The abnormal phenomena from the pyramids have people's emotions reaching their peak. Powerful magic will flow into the other world and affect all systems."

Entara's expression was grim.

"The world will boil like a cauldron. All events will be unified into one. Faster than humans can."

The unification of laws means the victory of God.

"How about retrieving Elikia? If we attack Jive with that power, perhaps..."

"Hehe."

Entara sipped his tea.

"That's why we fail. Trying to solve problems without even knowing what they are."

When asked what he would do with Elikia's power, Sirone had said this:

"Nothing."

After long contemplation, Sirone raised his head.

"I will do nothing."

It seemed like a deflating answer, but Entara, pondering those words, realized it was the answer he had been seeking.

Entara said:

"How arrogant is the thought that one human can change the world? Yahweh isn't a belief. It's just a great wind. Doing what one can do."

"Is that why you handed it over?"

"Whether we do this or that, nothing is perfect in the end. Someone will be sacrificed, someone will be angry."

Unity is impossible.

"Elikia is one, but Yahweh exists throughout the planet. If we start prioritizing, the power will become corrupted. Elikia found its master."

"Will his wish come true?"

Entara sipped his tea, lost in thought.

'Countless events are overlapping. Everyone is trying to fulfill their desires. Is God saying that even human hearts can be changed into law?'

He raised his head.

"I don't know. What's certain is that all future events will operate for a single purpose. When we finally reach the end, what remains will be..."

Human or divine.

"I can see the end."

Entara deliberately ignored the fact that the unification of laws was faster than the unification of humans.

Corona Kingdom.

Sirone's eyes shot open.

"Huh!"

Hastily sitting up and looking around, he found himself in a military tent with a campfire burning.

'What happened?'

Sirone, who had been ejected from the Ivory Tower with Baal, had fallen in Huig occupied territory.

'Ah...'

He remembered Minerva appearing to save him just before the demons got him.

"You're awake?"

Minerva entered, pulling back the tent flap.

"What happened?"

"You lost consciousness when we reached the hideout. You were in really dangerous condition."

It was a shock so severe that even Sirone's mental strength couldn't maintain consciousness.

"There's no time. I have to save Taeseong."

Minerva didn't respond.

"What's wrong? What happened?"

"See for yourself."

The moment he followed her out of the tent, shock filled Sirone's eyes.

Just 100 meters ahead, demons and Corona soldiers were engaged in close combat.

"We're completely pushed back. Lost the war." Among the soldiers, he could see stars from the Ivory Tower, which Sirone couldn't believe.

"Why...?"

"It happened suddenly. Less than 20 minutes ago. The demons feel incredibly stronger."

Sirone quickly realized.

Like an anesthetized part coming back to life, when he focused his consciousness, simultaneous events connected.

'The pyramid.'

Events overlap according to the heart.

"Mica."

_Yes.

'How many humans are affected by the pyramid?'

83,002,873 people. 28 people just reached the death route.

It was far more powerful than Elikia.

'Events happening under God's intention. I don't know what that intention is. But...'

Now it was the demons' world.

"Sirone, we need to get out of here now. If the Ivory Tower's stars are annihilated here, there's no future."

"What they're after is Taeseong. Without intelligence, the definition of good and evil disappears."

The Ivory Tower would be worse than this.

"Anyway, let's escape first. Corona's soldiers will buy us time. If you at least leave..."

Sirone shook his head.

"No. There's nowhere to run now. The magic from the other world will spill into reality."

Even Authentic Sound couldn't stop it.

"First, let's eliminate the demons here and go to the Ivory Tower. Saving Taeseong is the priority."

"Easier said than done. Those guys seem to have advanced about 2 ranks by feel. Regular soldiers became battalion commanders. Even battalion commanders became division-level strong."

"I'll do it. There aren't that many, so I should be able to hold them off for now."

"You're injured."

Sirone, launching himself toward the battlefield, looked back at Minerva with a smile.

"You've become much prettier."

Though Minerva wasn't one to be shy about compliments, this time her face flushed.

As the world's laws changed, she too had escaped the witch's fate.

"Young fool..."

Though her appearance hadn't particularly changed, her impression looked much kinder than before.

'That doesn't change anything though.'

Minerva's lips curved into a bitter smile as she kicked off the ground to follow Sirone.

'I'm a murderer after all.'

Even if the laws changed, she thought she had to take responsibility for her life.

Meanwhile, Sirone, heading to the battlefield, finally felt the demons' powerful strength firsthand.

'They're being completely overwhelmed.'

He could feel Corona soldiers dying and Ivory Tower stars struggling desperately.

Twelve Mini from the Integrated Universe Management Department cast scale magic to enlarge her body.

"You bastards!"

Growing to 10 meters, 50 meters, 100 meters, she struck the ground with her fist.

Kuuuuuuung!

The impact was enough to shake the earth, but demons immediately climbed up her arm.

"Get off! Disgusting things!"

She swept her arm down like brushing off ants, but the demons instantly devoured her flesh.

"Aaaah!"

At that moment, Miracle Stream's light swept up all the demons and slammed them to the ground.

Mini's face brightened as she looked down at the ground.

"Five Great Stars!"

From between her cleavage, Mini's satellite Ariana suddenly appeared.

"Here, here! Hurry and come in!"

Sirone smiled awkwardly.

"Next time."

"Oh my!"

The joke ended there, and Sirone, eyes blazing again, leaped into the battlefield.

"Stand back."

As Mini stepped back dozens of meters in one stride, Hand of God appeared in the air.

Photon Cannon formed on the palm of light.

"Yahweh! Kill Yahweh!"

"Kahahaha! I've become strong! Now I can finally kill your disgusting..."

A direct flash struck down.

The shockwave from the thunderous impact sent demons flying in concentric circles.

"Huuuuu."

It was amazing power as always, but today's demons were different from usual.

"Guuuuoo!"

Countless demons still alive in the giant crater showed their faces.

'Is this the extent?'

"Yahweh, I'll kill you."

Seeing demons crawling up through the dirt mounds, Sirone closed his eyes.

"Huu."

And when he opened them again.

"I'll kill you..."

A sphere of light incomparably larger than before filled the sky.

"No, don't!"

Like dawn breaking in the morning, the horizon of Huig occupied territory swelled brightly.

"Advance! Advance!"

Though blizzards surrounded the Ivory Tower, the strengthened demons were unstoppable.

Roughly 200,000 demons, with even the weakest soldiers having the power of former battalion commanders.

As demons infiltrated through the narrow entrance, Taeseong and Syng remained motionless.

Umji and Yangji, 4-star residents assisting Syng, sensed the situation below.

"Lord Syng, this is dangerous."

Though stars from the Law Department and Balance Department were defending, the demon forces were too powerful.

Taeseong said:

"Syng, resolve this misunderstanding now. At this rate, the Ivory Tower will collapse."

Syng knew too.

'Sirone, do you think the same?'

As long as Syng didn't move, Taeseong couldn't move either due to the law's power.

"Why?"

Taeseong asked.

"You can't accomplish anything. Restraining me is just baseless stubbornness."

"Right."

Though stars and residents united in will, ultimately it was Syng himself who had to carry it through.

"I might be wrong. I won't deny it. But I know that if I step back here, no one can replace me."

If he was right...

'If 99.99 percent are wrong and I'm right. If everything ends the moment I change my mind.'

Syng said:

"Let's die together, Taeseong. I'm already prepared."

Taeseong's eyes filled with sadness.

"Go up! Push through with numbers!"

The demons were staging a show of force against the Ivory Tower's stars on the 23rd floor.

Arte swung his fan, and a massive gust pushed back the demons like an iron wall.

"Kuuuuu!"

But Arte's mental strength, continuously casting magic, was nearly at its limit.

"I can't hold for more than 10 minutes. If we don't do something within that time, the Ivory Tower will collapse."

"Stupid fools! Soon more demons will swarm here! You've lost!"

Though victory and defeat were common in war, today's defeat was crucial for humanity.

'Evil will no longer be evil.'

Arte gritted his teeth.

"Wind Slash."

The 23rd floor's atmosphere spun sharply, tearing the demons' flesh to shreds.

"Steel Storm."

At that moment, Arte felt not just his magic but his very mind splitting in two.

"Kugh!"

As he staggered, tremendous sword energy scraped the earth and surged forward.

Heukgangsi pulled Arte back, and cracks spanning the entire height of the 23rd floor appeared in the wall.

Where the demons turned with blank expressions, 1st Corps Commander Baal was walking forward.

"Commander!"

Watching the army kneel before him, Hokgangsi bit his lips.

'Damn it.'

With battalion commanders becoming division-level, what had the corps commander become?

"Stand back."

Baal spoke to the Ivory Tower's stars.

"Clear the way. You can't defeat me. I'm going to negotiate with Taeseong."

Tanjura asked:

"You think we'll step aside?"

"Do you think I'm threatening you with your lives? Not at all. This is the last chance. The last chance to compromise without me opening the demon world."

'Deadly Cross.'

The moment Baal opened the demon world, not just the Ivory Tower but all of humanity would perish.

"A wicked negotiator."

But Baal's threat only made the Ivory Tower stars' hearts colder.

"Intelligence doesn't yield to threats. Whether humanity perishes or the universe is destroyed..."

Tanjura launched himself.

"What's right is right because it's right."

One punishment to warn a hundred.

"The crime of denying righteousness. Death penalty."

Baal was imprisoned by law, and satellite Daeho, charging from the side, executed his cleaver technique.

"Keke."

The next moment, everyone saw the bisected corpses of Tanjura and Daeho.

"Intelligence is dead."

Baal, blade hanging at his side, asked the stars blocking the entrance:

"Will you object?"

Sirone, flying at tremendous speed from Huig occupied territory, opened his eyes wide.

Demons were gathered around the Ivory Tower like an ocean.

Minerva approached on a jet.

"The entrance is blocked!"

The demons' durability itself was different, so breaking through with physical force had limits.

'Taeseong, hold on just a little longer.'

Sirone, deploying Judicial Halo Ataraxia, activated Close Combat and plunged toward the ground.

"That crazy bastard!"

As Minerva changed direction, Sirone crashed into the middle of the demons.

"Wh-what?"

The demons who realized it was Yahweh triumphantly bared their fangs, but...

"Huuuuu."

Seeing Sirone's face breathing light, they quickly turned pale.

"Move aside."

Though he wasn't addressing anyone specifically, the demons felt the world splitting left and right.
