The Presence of Absence (2)

An explosion erupted around Rian. It had enough power to obliterate everything within its radius, but the party behind Rian remained unharmed.

As everyone looked forward in puzzlement, Shirone, who had arrived at some point, was casting Hand of God.

Beyond the palm of light that had blocked the explosion, Ymir could be seen leaning back his upper body.

"Huuuuu!"

While the entire area had turned to black ash, only Ymir was radiating vitality.

'Did it miss?'

Just as everyone was thinking that, Ymir's chest split open and blood gushed forth.

"Hmm."

Even watching his own blood pour out before his eyes, Ymir showed no change in expression.

'Ymir... was cut by the sword.'

Rather, it was Rian's party who were surprised, and if Heaven's army had been there, they would have been shocked.

"Impressive, Rian."

Shirone, who had been examining Ymir's condition, also had no choice but to genuinely acknowledge Rian.

'In Omega's history, Auzent is the only being to have wounded Ymir's true body.'

Rian's single sword strike had now reached that level.

"Kuuuuu!"

Smoke rose from where <Idea> was, and Rian's body began to take physical form.

After watching this for a moment, Ymir flexed his chest muscles strongly to cut off the bleeding.

"This is the standard."

Shirone said as he pulled in Hand of God.

"Remember this level of power. Anything less than this won't be able to shock Ymir."

Even if he said that...

'I couldn't even see what I swung or how. This isn't power a human can produce.'

Rian's physical regeneration was quite slow, but in the realm of sword-soul unity, the shell didn't matter.

"I waited beneath the frozen sea. It was a tedious time. I'm not particularly patient, but there wasn't anything particularly enjoyable about coming out either."

It had been years of endlessly dwelling on and enduring the strike Auzent had dealt.

"You said you'd return. You told me that."

Looking down at Rian, who had perfectly regained his form, Ymir nodded.

"I'll consider the promise kept, Auzent."

Pride in carrying on the will of his predecessor, the founder of the Auzent family, burned in Rian's chest.

'But...'

His head was colder than ever.

'He avoided it. My desperate strike.'

What about Ymir?

Had he also used all his strength to avoid the attack?

Rian concentrated all his nerves, but still couldn't sense Ymir's presence.

Shirone spoke.

"Rian, over here."

Having pulled Rian back toward the party, Shirone positioned Hand of God at the front and said:

"You've probably experienced it already, but Ymir's attacks have two types of shockwaves. The first is the impact on the photon system."

Physical force, in other words.

"The second is the impact created by his body itself moving. It's a unique wavelength, and if you get caught in this shockwave, your mind becomes paralyzed. Prepare for it in advance."

As Shirone said, he had already experienced it, but honestly, he thought it was too much.

'Does he have no natural enemies?'

The idea that a single strike could destroy physical, magical, lawful, and even non-regulatory systems all at once.

"You know well."

Ymir said with a twisted grin.

"It certainly feels familiar. Something that's been passed down from much longer ago than Auzent."

Hand of God reacted keenly to Ymir's movements, fingers twitching.

"Good."

Shirone, Blitz, Aetra, Rian, Tess, Amy, Nade, Miro, Zulu, Kang Nan, Sain, Enox, Garcia.

And toward the allied forces beyond them, Ymir raised both hands and wiggled his fingers.

"Come at me."

For the first time, they felt it.

'Until now, he wasn't thinking about anything at all.'

What Ymir's killing intent was like when he truly decided to kill someone.

"Huuuuu—"

Just as Tess was chattering her jaw and holding back screams, Ymir's body bounced with a thud.

Muscle vibration.

As the shockwave from his body itself paralyzed their minds, hallucinations flickered before their eyes.

"First..."

With no one able to move, Ymir shot toward Miro.

"Shall I start with you?"

Miro's gaze, which had been aimed straight ahead, moved sideways and caught the fist.

Ymir laughed with interest.

"Oh?" Just from her unwavering eyes alone, he could tell how deep a realm she had reached.

Time compressed to its limit.

'Thousand Hand Projection.'

The hands of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara frantically struck the left and right sides of Ymir, who had covered his face with both arms.

'Hmph, can he withstand this too?' As Miro prepared her killing blow, she saw Ymir's eyes glinting through his guard.

'No impact.'

Before the eerie feeling could even be transmitted, Ymir took a step forward and thrust out his fist.

Just as she couldn't even react, Hand of God grabbed Ymir's body.

"Huk!"

Shirone's brow furrowed.

'I can't block this.'

Even with quantum signals at full power, he couldn't completely suppress Ymir's physical strength.

"Kuaaaa!"

While held by Hand of God, Ymir's punch shot out, and Miro twisted her head away.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The fist created wind pressure as it toppled the buildings behind Miro like dominoes.

"Ha. Ha."

Miro exhaled roughly.

'I almost died.'

If Hand of God hadn't restrained Ymir, her head would have already been blown off.

Shirone frowned and said:

"This is the limit."

Hand of God dissolved into light smoke and wrapped around Ymir's body.

It would certainly have some effect, but they couldn't even guess how much.

"Here I go!"

Just as Rian kicked off the ground, the mages following behind equipped their magic.

In the realm of sword-soul unity, Rian's body couldn't endure and burst with a pop.

Entering the state of Attachment of Existence, the soul state, Rian swung <Idea> at the speed of thought.

The atmosphere exploded.

In the thick smoke, the mages relied on Spirit Zone to attack Ymir.

Fire and lightning, wind and cold exploded in one place, turning the area around Bashka's walls into a wasteland.

"Phew."

Even the fighters were amazed by their own power, but to Ymir it was merely tickling.

"Kuhahaha!"

Garcia, who had pushed his mental power to the limit, cast Hellfire from the sky.

Just as Ymir was briefly exerting force to break free from Hand of God, he bent his lower body and loaded his fist.

Amy shouted:

"Danger—"

Before she could finish speaking, Ymir's punch struck the heavens, and the Hellfire vanished with a whoosh.

"Master!"

Garcia, who had been beyond it, crashed to the ground with his upper body gone.

Literally instant death.

"Uaaaaa!"

A fire giant erupted from Amy's body, filled with rising fury, and shot toward Ymir.

"It's dangerous!"

Shirone followed, and Sain cast Sun-Moon Light Ring to maximize Hand of God's binding force.

"Keke. Kekekeke."

Feeling the damage accumulating bit by bit on his body, Ymir laughed, shoulders shaking.

"Kuhahahaha!" Simultaneously kicking off the ground and shooting forward, he swung his fist toward Sain's face.

Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara pushed Sain away with her right hand and struck down at Ymir with her left hand in a chop.

Bending at the waist, Ymir twisted his lips and said:

"Did you think you'd win?"

Because you're Ultima, because you're omniscient and omnipotent, because you inherited Auzent's bloodline, because you're Hwagye, because you're the world's strongest mage.

"Did you really think you guys would win?"

Avoiding the following attack from Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara, Ymir twisted his waist and pulled back his fist.

<Idea> was flying in at a terrifying speed, but Ymir's punch was faster.

'Foursome Territory.'

Zulu, who had canceled the Lich summons, joined with Miro to call forth space-time birds and shot up in a flash.

Kwaaaang!

The shockwave swept forward, and <Idea>'s blade reached Ymir's neck.

'What?'

As time slowed infinitely, Rian's mind saw Ymir rotating at high speed.

How fast was that speed?

Before he could even finish that thought, Ymir's fist penetrated Rian's mind.

'Kuk!'

Rian's mind grew distant, and <Idea> fell to the ground with a metallic clang.

Though invisible to the eye, it was clear that Rian's mind had lost grip of the great sword.

"Rian!"

Just as Tess shouted and tried to leap forward, Shirone blocked her path.

"No, Tess."

Even Shirone, who had experienced all of Omega's history, couldn't understand the situation from just moments before.

'He attacked a mental body.'

Ymir dusted off his knees and straightened his upper body.

"It's nothing special."

And as he clenched his fist, brilliant golden energy shot up, piercing the sky.

"Link."

Shirone realized that throughout the long history, information about Ymir had been far too lacking.

Ymir laughed as if it were absurd.

"What? Didn't think I could do it? No, I just didn't need to." Shirone's gaze dropped downward, but <Idea> still wasn't moving.

He might be dead.

"Zulu! Zulu!"

At Miro's cry, he turned to see Zulu collapsed, spitting up blood that was flowing backward.

"...Don't make a fuss."

Just like striking Rian's mental body, Ymir's fist had pursued them through space-time.

"Blitz. Aetra."

Shirone turned forward again.

"Block him."

The moment the order was given, both apostles simultaneously kicked off the ground and shot forward.

The reason they didn't transform into dragons was that Ymir was also capable of becoming gigantic.

"I'll attack first."

Blitz's body wrapped in electricity as he struck Ymir, and Aetra circled behind.

'I'm not confident in martial arts, but...'

Ymir's waist swayed to the side as Aetra's elbow struck him.

"Keke."

Excluding the mutation that was the sum of 10 billion Gaias, dragons were the most powerful life forms in the universe.

'This is ridiculous.'

Aetra smiled bitterly.

The most chilling thing about facing Ymir was not knowing the limits of his abilities.

'He keeps getting stronger.'

Perhaps he wasn't even using a tenth of his original power.

'No, has he ever reached his limits?'

And Ymir, at the point of receiving the dragons' coordinated attack, once again shifted into higher gear.

"Kuhahahaha!"

At the point when Blitz's body flew to somewhere invisible, Shirone drew a dagger from his chest.

"<Legal Kill>."

The world's most dangerous weapon that changes laws to cause incidents of murder.

As Yahweh's wrath was contained, <Legal Kill> emitted red energy and screamed.

'Please! Please!'

Taking a large step forward, Shirone captured Ymir in his sight and adjusted the sensation in his arm.

'Disappear from the universe!'

At the point when both Blitz and Aetra had been sent flying, a black flash rushed toward Ymir.

Ymir quickly turned his head and grabbed <Legal Kill>'s blade with his massive hand.

There was a sound of the blade cracking with a thud.

"What is this toy...?"

The next moment, Ymir's eyes widened, and the hand holding <Legal Kill> shook terrifyingly.

"Aaaahhh—"

Shirone clenched his fist.

Except for the ultimate evil outside the law, no being could be free from <Legal Kill>.

'It got him properly.'

Whether hit by a carriage or struck by falling stones, such incidents couldn't kill Ymir.

Eventually, as dimensions collapsed, the space around Ymir itself became distorted.

Simultaneously, infinite laws capable of killing him began to operate across space-time.

"What a cute trick."

Despite his words as he looked back at Shirone, his expression was more serious than ever.

'This... is definitely dangerous.'

As if pressing in from the entire universe, the blackened space was devouring Ymir.
