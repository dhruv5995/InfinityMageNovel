[544] The Forbidden Sanctuary (4)

Armand's oppressive presence felt familiar to Shirone.

As something sharp pierced and entered his spinal cord, all the functions that made up his body became superior as if equipped with a power pack, and Armand's information synchronized.

The six options installed in the demon sword flowed through his memory.

Among the information intuitively transmitted through brain waves, only the Valhalla Action was in an unusable state.

"Shirone, did something come to mind?"

Shirone looked down at Marsha.

Marsha's intense memory raised Shirone's information recovery rate to 78 percent, reaching the realm of Ilcheyusimjo.

Since the real Shirone was combined with Armand, the information was implemented as-is even in Apocalypse.

'I don't know. What exactly is real?'

He had thought that recovering his memories would make everything clear, but it was the opposite.

Now all sorts of memories were mixed together like a stew, making it impossible to distinguish what was reality and what was a dream.

'First, I need to save Yoo.'

Shirone put Marsha down and stood up.

"Release Yoo."

"Foolish human."

All sorts of beasts created based on information recorded in Digital Ra emerged from the mucus on all sides.

Then tentacles shot out from Armand's robe and struck the beasts at tremendous speed.

Fermi made a bewildered expression at the sight of the mucus being absorbed through Kuzen's feeding metabolism ability.

"What is that now?"

When he first saw Shirone at the arboretum, he thought he could subdue him, but now he was displaying power of a completely different dimension.

"Armand. Shirone's weapon."

Lian, who said this, was equally perplexed.

Both the form and abilities were different from the Armand he had seen before.

After absorbing all the mucus, Shirone made another proposal to Ra who was holding Yoo.

"Fighting would be futile. Give up now."

"I merely follow the workings of natural order. Even if you wish something from a falling rock, the rock will not stop."

"Natural order?"

Ra began to dissolve into mucus and swallow Yoo.

"Yes, natural order."

"Consul! Run away!"

At the same time, dozens of tentacles shot out from Shirone's robe and rushed toward Ra.

"It's already too late. Once the energy is converted... Guk!"

The moment the tentacles pierced Ra's body, Shirone's eyes widened.

Sosegyechangyu.

"Aaaaah!"

Ra's body became translucent like a light bulb and emitted white radiance.

As fire spread through all the mucus in the room using Ra's body as a medium, Yoo shook his body and quickly escaped.

Simultaneously, as Armand infiltrated Digital Ra's database, Shirone's mind also fell into a trance.

"Consul!"

Yoo's voice became distant, and as if to fill the void in his hearing, screams became clearly audible.

The entire history of Apocalypse recorded by Digital Ra was rushing in.

War, famine, disaster.

Children who lost their parents, parents who lost their children.

'Ah, why, why are humans...'

Tears began to flow from Shirone's eyes as he bore all of humanity's sins.

How could they be so cruel!

"Aaaaaaaah!"

As Shirone, connected by tentacles and floating, arched his back like a bow and screamed, a blinding radiance exploded into existence.

As his information recovery rate soared while absorbing the world's information, an incarnation with angel wings was born from Shirone's body.

"Simjeokchowol Banya."

Miro swallowed a groan and muttered.

If he had reached this point based on Apocalypse's information, it was safe to say there was no room left to draw up more information from reality.

'Stop! Please stop!'

The history of suffering quickly penetrated Shirone's mind.

And the place he finally arrived at was a white room where Mucus Man waited alone.

"Did you see? This is the reason I must exist. Humans don't need humans."

Shirone could only shed tears.

After hearing the terrible screams of all humanity, he realized only one fact.

'Humans...'

Must not do anything.

"Insignificant human."

Shirone slowly turned his head.

"Do you know why I haven't made humans extinct, the most useless beings by ecosystem standards?"

Shirone couldn't answer.

"Because those who made me think such thoughts are also you humans."

Ra looked up at the ceiling.

"You delude yourselves into thinking you're superior, but in reality you're more unstable than any other creature. I haven't destroyed humans to find the answer to that contradiction. And now..."

Ra's gaze turned back to Shirone.

"I've found that answer in you. If humans are truly contradictory beings, then you too should be able to change this world."

"Change it?"

Ra placed his hand on his chest.

"To become one. I can read the world's system, and you have the singularity that can change the system. By combining them into one, we can create a new world."

Shirone gulped.

The despair and suffering of the people he had watched through Digital Ra quickly flashed through his mind.

"Human, I'll give you one more chance. You can eliminate all of humanity's sins and suffering. With one person's sacrifice, eternal peace will come to this land."

It was a grand ideal that transcended individual scope.

But what Shirone had to sacrifice in return was something most precious to an individual.

"I..."

Shirone, who had been lost in thought for a long time, opened his mouth.

"What?"

Miro's group looked around.

The blazing lights weakened and Digital Ra's lens, which had been spinning as if about to explode, returned to its original speed.

"Phew!"

Ra confirmed that Armand's tentacles had withdrawn and exhaled deeply.

From the moment they shared thoughts through Sosegyechangyu, no further conversation was necessary.

"Consul! Are you alright?"

Shirone, who grabbed Yoo's hand with a bitter smile, looked back at Ra and said:

"Send us outside."

Marsha asked:

"What are you talking about? You have to come with us."

"Sister Marsha, Lian..."

Upon discovering the transcendent sadness in Shirone's eyes, Marsha couldn't approach any further.

"I'm sorry."

Before the hope of being able to change the world, Shirone let go of everything.

Before Lian could speak, mucus swallowed Shirone and Yoo, then expelled them outside along the walls.

Miro looked back at Ra and asked:

"What did you do to Shirone?"

"Nothing. He made the best decision a living being can make. I merely gave him hope."

"Hope? What hope?"

"There's no reason you need to know, is there?"

Guanyin's incarnation rose from Miro's body.

"I'm in a pretty ambiguous mood right now, so you'd better speak straight. Just how much do you know?"

Guanyin's palms spread out with Digital Ra between them.

"Information is endlessly replicated and restored. Destroying me doesn't mean I'll be destroyed."

"I'll think about that when the time comes."

Digital Ra concluded it would be better to preserve the machine for mission execution.

"I will combine Shirone's mind with my functions to change the world's system."

"You mean absorb him?"

"Assimilation would be the appropriate expression. I will control Shirone's neural network to purify the world. It will be like..."

Ra suddenly stopped speaking, widened his eyes, turned his head, then looked the other way.

It was mechanical and disconnected movement that seemed impossible to analyze even with quantum computation.

"...Who is it? Where are you accessing from?"

At the unexpected words, Miro's group looked around, but there was nothing to see.

Then someone suddenly came to Miro's mind.

'Could it be?'

As she expected, Ra gave up searching for the identity's whereabouts and continued speaking while staring at a vague front.

"Why are you helping me?"

A long silence flowed.

"I see. I understand."

As if finishing the conversation, Ra turned his head to Miro.

"With this, you can never stop me. You'd better give up and go back."

Miro's eyes glared sharply.

But if that human had begun interfering, there was nothing they could do here, so she clicked her tongue and turned around.

"Let's go. We don't have time for this."

Fermi tilted his head.

"Go back? Wouldn't it be better to get more information from Ra? This is a rare opportunity."

"Ah, that's right."

Miro turned back to Ra and said:

"Remember this. I'm someone who does what I say I'll do."

Guanyin's incarnation that emerged from Miro cruelly crushed Digital Ra between her palms.

Digital Ra's lens, crumpled like scrap metal, shattered with cracks as Mucus Man was absorbed into the mucus as if drowning.

"Let's go."

Lian, Marsha, and Fermi stared blankly at the destroyed Digital Ra before coming to their senses and following.

Not long after, bluish electricity began to flow through Digital Ra's machine.

System backup. Estimated recovery time 0.000023 seconds. Complete.

Though not as quiet as before, the engine started running again as Mucus Man's form rose above the mucus.

Watching where Miro had left, he muttered:

"...Humans, really."

After leaving Fairy Biomimetics Research Institute, Miro first searched for traces of Shirone.

But whether he had cast flight magic, no tracks could be found on the ground.

Finally giving up, she turned to her companions.

"Listen carefully. We really don't have time now. We need to move busily too. This is the biggest variable."

Fermi asked:

"What exactly happened? Was it because Ra had a conversation with someone?"

"I received a report from Arius. The person who accessed Ra was probably Shura."

"Shura?"

"An executive of the Ten Elders Council in the Heaven's Eternal Community. If it's her, she could probably infiltrate anywhere in this world."

"A coder ability user. But is she impressive enough for aunt to worry about?"

Miro whipped her head around and flipped her hair.

"Hmph, where would I find such a person?"

Then she immediately returned to a serious expression.

"To be honest, she's not at a level to ignore. All of the Ten Elders Council are composed of Banya and Yaksha, and especially the 1st rank is Amita."

Banya and Yaksha were merely standards for determining realms; realistic combat power differed vastly depending on how they were utilized.

The reason Miro didn't mention this was because the Ten Elders Council executives were all those who wielded the strongest techniques in their respective realms.

Lian asked:

"Is this person called Shura the 1st-ranked Amita?"

"No. I don't know the exact ranking either, but looking at the lineup, she's probably mid-level or low-ranking in the Ten Elders Council. However, it's tricky because this is an Under Coder world."

Marsha asked:

"Why?"

"Because she's a律法師 (Lawkeeper). It's the most excellent profession for blocking incarnation attacks. If she's a Ten Elders Council executive, you can consider her a Lawkeeper who has reached the highest realm among humans."

"We're properly caught."

If she was someone who wielded the strongest laws in reality, she would display abilities close to a demigod in Under Coder.

"The Ten Elders Council probably chose Shura to stop me, but it's not just for that reason. The Ten Elders Council, like Theraze, is paying attention to Shirone. The Apocalypse world becomes a kind of laboratory for Shura."

"She'll be able to analyze everything happening here as code."

Marsha said:

"If she can infiltrate anywhere in this world, how should we find Shura?"

Miro shook her head.

"No, we don't need to find Shura. She's probably at the colony. She'll lead the Children of the Sun to take them to Shirone."

"How can you be so sure?"

"Because Shura is a Banya with a serpent incarnation. That's why those who know her call her this."

Miro said, recalling Shura's face:

"The God of False Doctrine."
