[590] The Incident of That Day (1)

The twelfth island of the Mediterranean, the Kingdom of Roblang.

This small nation of 700,000 people boasted such beautiful scenery that 70 percent of its citizens worked in tourism.

In a hotel of this world-renowned resort and tax haven for the wealthy, a secret meeting was being held by politicians whose names alone would be instantly recognizable.

Marika Hotel, basement level 2 tavern.

"Cheers!"

Fourteen people were raising their glasses around six tables pushed together.

At their center sat the world's most famous person whose identity remained unknown—a woman named Miro.

"One more!"

"Are you challenging me?"

"Of course. I'm nowhere near done!"

As Miro boldly raised her hand, the men burst into laughter.

"This lady's no ordinary drinker. Good! Kadun, pour her another."

"Leave it to me!"

A man named Kadun set up a 1000cc glass, climbed onto the table, and tilted bottles in both hands, pouring liquor like a waterfall.

Two types of liquid filled the glass with foam, and as Miro gripped the beer mug, the surroundings instantly fell silent.

Every gulp of Miro's throat drew fascinated stares from the audience.

The moment the last drop went down, everyone jumped to their feet, and Miro slammed down her cup with a bang, stepped up onto two chairs, and pulled her fist to her side.

"Cheers!"

The simultaneous shout of fourteen people rang thunderously through the tavern.

"Lucky you, Miro."

"Huh?"

Turning her head, Miro spotted Sein, who had somehow entered the tavern, and her face lit up.

"Hey, my friend! What brings you here?"

As if drunk, Miro's face was flushed red.

"Cheers!"

Someone must have downed another shot.

Hearing the cheers coming through the wall, Miro flopped down onto the bed.

"Ah, I'm getting drunk. I think I had too much Polka."

Sein wasn't curious about what Polka was.

"Are things proceeding properly?"

At Sein's question, Miro pointed to the ceiling.

"They're on the 14th floor. The talks seem to be dragging on. I think it'll take at least two more days to reach a conclusion."

Sein pulled out a chair and sat down.

"It's fine to enjoy yourself, but be careful. There are many who target you."

"Hehe, who would dare attack me?"

While there were probably only a handful of people worldwide who could harm the great Miro, seeing her disheveled state today made him feel concerned.

'Well, she was confined for 20 years.'

Miro's naturally free-spirited nature seemed to have exploded beyond her control.

'Perhaps the world's greatest troublemaker has been unleashed.'

Miro asked.

"So what's the matter? Coming to see me directly. Is there some problem?"

"A bit. Fermi came to see me."

Miro smiled mysteriously.

"He took the blueprints for Estas. The ones with Guffin's door, of course."

"Hah, I figured as much."

"I did send them to Armin as you said, but is it really okay?"

"Of course. What could happen?"

"An infinitely looping spacetime structure. The incident Guffin tried to protect at all costs. If external factors interfere and distort the incident, the world could end."

Even at this terrifying statement, Miro remained silent.

"Just what kind of incident was it? What happened at Estas?"

"I don't know."

Sein tilted his head.

"You don't know?"

"I definitely experienced something at Estas. But it's not in my memory. It disappeared along with Guffin's erasure. I can only vaguely guess now that I've experienced the world."

"Is that why you didn't step in directly?"

"The me from 19 years ago exists in Estas's upper floors. If the incident gets distorted in any way, this world will become different from what we knew. That's why I told you to give Fermi the blueprints."

Miro's eyes became distant.

"If the world's history is going to be twisted anyway, it's the participants' responsibility to destroy it."

"Does that include Shirone among the participants?"

"It's possible."

Lost in thought, Sein asked.

"Who is Shirone? Is he Guffin's bloodline?"

"I don't know. Only the me from 19 years ago knows the answer."

Sein poured liquor and handed it to Miro.

"You're not running away, are you?"

Miro raised an eyebrow as she received the glass.

"Running away?"

"From Yoga."

"I told you. I don't have memories from that time."

"But you should have memories from before entering the upper floors, right?"

Sein was persistent.

"Yes."

Miro recalled Yoga's face.

"She was lovely, kind, and just perfectly suited to the description of a good person. Could there really exist anyone in the world who could dislike Yoga?"

"Then she went missing."

Sein approached Miro.

"What are the odds that you killed her?"

"Hehe, do you want to know that badly?"

"I'm just worried about you. Why did Guffin choose you instead of Yoga? If she was such a good person?"

"Because she was a good person."

Miro downed the strong liquor in one gulp.

"Maybe I did kill her. But even if I could turn back time, my judgment would be the same."

The drunkenness completely disappeared from Miro's eyes as she looked at Sein.

"I killed her because she deserved to die. I was the one who should have become Guffin's successor."

The graduating class was bustling from early morning.

Participants who had finished the Scramble Royale joined another fierce competition, while only a few left school for personal reasons.

Representative figures were Nade and Cayden.

The winning team was determined to make up for their seven-day absence, while the losing team had to discreetly prepare alternatives to score lower than Nade.

'I just need to stay lower until the graduation exam. Being one point behind Nade would be the best result.'

The problem was not knowing when Nade would return.

"Don't worry. He just needs time to think."

Iruki, his closest friend, reassured Amy.

Meanwhile, Shirone, who had refused evaluation, left his dormitory early in the morning and arrived at the meeting place.

Anchal was waiting without his eyepatch.

"Did you unseal it?"

"That's why I brought the Magic Eye. Where's Armand?"

Shirone showed the Kubrick in response.

"Now tell me. What do you mean Guffin is in the upper floors?"

"I'll explain as we go."

When Anchal turned toward Estas, Shirone refused.

"No. I need to hear the explanation first. Going together comes after that."

Anchal checked the time and turned back.

"Fine. Your life is at stake too."

Anchal reconstructed and told him about the situation that might have occurred at Estas 19 years ago.

"Guffin... was here?"

"Isn't that obvious? You saw Guffin's door too."

Even so, hearing it directly didn't feel real.

The gap between a figure erased from everyone's memory and someone who 19 years ago was a magician known to everyone in the world couldn't be easily bridged.

"Among those who infiltrated Estas pursuing Miro at the time, Yoga's group was probably included."

"Yoga?"

"Fermi's mother."

"Ah..."

"What's certain is that the Tormia Kingdom also secretly sent forces to kill Miro. The secret unit Mars from the Intelligence Agency. Each one is a powerful assassin."

Shirone recalled the scene he had witnessed through Sibulsangpokmae at Estas.

"Definitely... the Tormia Kingdom's emblem was engraved there."

"Estas's upper floors won't open unless very complex conditions are met. But your ability to control time ignored those conditions and brought past events to the surface. This should be helpful somehow."

Anchal asked finally.

"Will you come with me? My explanation ends here."

Shirone, who had been lost in thought, finally raised his head.

Rumble! Rumble!

Inside Estas's 89 buildings that changed structure in myriad ways, Fermi and Lycan were having a conversation.

"The upper floors only open in specific structures. A stop spell is needed at the end."

"Very meticulous."

"It's not just meticulous. This place wasn't made to be explored in the first place."

"An infinitely looping structure of time."

To Lycan, it still didn't feel real.

"If such a thing really exists, you could have everything in the world."

What he focused on wasn't Estas's incident but time itself.

"Right. The incident keeps repeating. We're no exception. Therefore..."

Fermi threw a red-glowing orb.

"Objects can be duplicated indefinitely too."

Lycan caught the orb with a puzzled expression.

"Didn't you say 10 billion gold?"

"That's worth 10 billion gold."

"This? It doesn't look like a gem. Is it an objet by chance?"

"Correct. 'The Jaeger Family's Last Cry.' I bought it at Curia Auction for twice the market price."

"Twice? Then you lost money. Objets are expensive because of their rarity, but if you copy them..."

"Of course, but 'The Jaeger Family's Last Cry' is an exception. When the owner is in danger, it sends a sound signal to alert them. It's a consumable item closely related to life, so if we duplicate it into hundreds, we'll make a fortune instantly."

"Hmm, I see."

Lycan was finally satisfied.

"Follow the predetermined coordinates, then return to this warehouse and put it in this safe."

Fermi pointed to a sturdy safe.

"Then when the incident repeats again, they'll keep accumulating. But be careful. The skills of those involved in this incident are no joke. It's best to bypass space."

"Hehe, doesn't matter."

Lycan pulled up his rubber bodysuit to cover up to his nose.

'His skills are solid.'

The eldest son of Gunjo Bedium, rated as Black Line's strongest hitman, was Gunjo Lycan.

With such trust, Fermi asked.

"What will you do when you make a fortune?"

"Charity work."

"Haha! What?"

To Fermi's thinking, Lycan was an even worse villain than himself.

"It's fun, right? A villain philanthropist. Giving those hypocrites with their fancy words a taste of their own medicine."

Stretching his neck, Lycan said.

"Know why humans think only they're right? It's all because of damn imagination. They mistake things they've never experienced for things they've actually done."

Fermi listened with interest.

"In imagination, you could cut off your own foot if you didn't want to die. But when you're actually given a saw in reality, you can't even bring it near your ankle. That's imagination's blind spot. It lacks pain."

Lycan doesn't imagine.

"I'm in the assassination business too, but honestly I think it's wrong. If I kill someone, others can kill me too."

"That's the social contract."

"But my father fed our family through assassination work. If he hadn't killed people, I would have been more miserable."

"That doesn't mean everyone commits murder."

"They don't not commit it either. The point is, if you won't bear my pain in my place, shut up and stay quiet. Don't exercise your pathetic imagination."

Fermi raised the corner of his mouth.

"You're a world-class villain, Lycan."

"Hehe, that's why I like you. I figured from the start that working with you would make me rich."

"Deploy, Electric Monster."

Electricity flowed through Lycan's body, and with a crackling sound, his form instantly vanished.

"Well then, shall we begin?"

Confirming that Estas's structures had stopped moving, Fermi left the warehouse.

It was time to cast the stop spell.

"The structure's position has changed."

Shirone, who had arrived at Estas with Anchal, muttered with a serious expression.

It wasn't just that it had changed—the key was that it was a structure he had seen somewhere before.

'It's the same structure as when Guffin's door opened.'

"Fermi seems to have already entered."

After carefully examining every aspect of Estas, Anchal turned to Shirone.

"Are you prepared? Once we step inside, we might never return."

Shirone gulped and nodded.

"Good. Then let's begin too."

The warehouse door opened, and the two slowly entered.

This was an incident that actually existed 19 years ago but was erased from everyone's memory in the world.

A record of 2 hours and 48 minutes.
