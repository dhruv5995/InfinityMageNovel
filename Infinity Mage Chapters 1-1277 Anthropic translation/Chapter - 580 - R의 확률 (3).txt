[580] The Probability of R (3)

"Ah..."

Shirone's group finally realized.

"Get it? Another probability hidden in R. If we use this, we can manipulate probability more powerfully than Hercy."

"...is what you'd think."

Hercy smiled.

"Scramble Royale with 30 years of history. The unwritten rule is to never reveal hidden rules after a match ends."

"But how did you know?"

Hercy rubbed her thumb and index finger together.

"Money. Only students care about unwritten rules. Do you think guys who graduated decades ago would care? Especially among those who led underground research groups, there are plenty of scumbags. Alcoholics, gamblers, womanizers, drug addicts too. Give them some cash and they spill everything."

"So... why are you telling us this now?"

Hercy looked back at Frings, who was kneeling in a corner of the forest.

"I won't forgive them. I'll get revenge. I'll drive them crazy with rage. I'll dig up every last secret."

Muttering with bandages wrapped around all ten fingers, there was no trace of his former sharp intellect.

'He's completely lost it.'

Anyway, there would come a time when his madness would be needed.

"I need personnel to tactically manipulate probability. Frings is in that state, and Eden won't show herself until the very end. At least it's comforting that Cayden will join us tomorrow."

Fisho asked.

"What do I need to do?"

"Collect as many scrambles as possible and bring them to me. If they're also making infinity, victory will depend on the next sequence. I'll win in the card battle. The match ends in 2 days. From now on, it's about focus rather than choice."

"...is the strategy they'll likely use."

Iruki struck his palm with his fist.

"In other words, concentrate cards on Hercy to end the game. There are now 144 cards that can be collected in total. We need to settle it within that."

Dorothy said.

"I won't lose to Fisho. If Sabina keeps him in check, I can collect at a similar speed."

Amy asked.

"Then what's our strategy to counter Hercy's strategy?"

Iruki smiled and said.

"Disperse the cards as much as possible."

No one objected.

The next morning.

A visitor came to Aramoneth Orphanage located in the outskirts of Bashka, the capital.

Children who were planting sweet potatoes in a small garden stopped what they were doing when they spotted a young man in an immaculate suit.

"Hello there, kids."

"Who are you?"

The young man looked around without answering.

"This place is still the same."

A middle-aged woman in her early 40s who had been working the garden with the children slowly stood up.

"Fermi."

"Have you been well, Ms. Rachel? You're as beautiful as ever."

While she appreciated the compliment, it wasn't something she wanted to hear from her friend's son.

"Why have you come here?"

"Is it a problem to come home? Has it been 14 years?"

Having lost his mother, Fermi had to stay at the orphanage for a while due to family circumstances.

"Come inside first."

Fermi smiled at the children and entered the orphanage.

"That man is really handsome."

"Yeah. But somehow... scary."

Once in the room, Rachel brought out tea.

"I thought you'd never come again."

"Is there any particular reason I wouldn't? It's already been 14 years."

Rachel hurriedly spoke up.

"Fermi, about what happened that day..."

"It's fine. I've already forgotten. You don't need to feel guilty. I was the one who seduced you."

Rachel's face turned red.

"Please... take this."

Fermi pulled out a check from his inner pocket.

"It's a check issued by Tormia Central Bank. Use it with confidence."

Rachel's gaze fixed on the amount.

'1 billion gold.'

She sighed and shook her head.

"Fermi, this is..."

"Please take it. If the Yolga Foundation hadn't gone bankrupt, you wouldn't have had to struggle like this."

The Yolga Foundation was a child welfare foundation established by Fermi's mother, Yolga.

"I can't accept it."

"Why? Are you worried it's dirty money? Don't worry. It's from a legitimate transaction."

Director, this is a legitimate transaction.

The red lips of the nine-year-old boy remained vivid in her memory even after 14 years.

'Don't think about it. I mustn't remember.'

"I'm sorry."

When Rachel looked up, Fermi was gazing at her with transparent eyes.

"I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sincere."

It was just a light kiss that could be shared with a nine-year-old child.

But the emotions she had allowed at that time had become a lifelong trauma that tormented Rachel.

"You... haven't changed at all."

When Yolga, who had died—or more precisely, gone missing—was legally declared dead, the orphanage that had received her support also began to struggle.

At that time, the Ardino family was in such a precarious situation that they couldn't even set foot in the world, and Fermi had also come to the orphanage seeking a place to hide.

Massive debts, debt collectors who came daily to ransack the orphanage, tempting hands reaching out to a beautiful woman.

Rachel, who couldn't abandon dozens of children, persevered steadfastly but eventually reached her limit.

Director, I'll go get money.

At first, she could only laugh at the bold words of a nine-year-old.

She thought he was starved for love.

He had lost his great mother Yolga overnight, and his new mother Rachel had to divide her attention among dozens of children.

'Fermi was a special child.'

When witnessing his incomparable intelligence, insight, and ability to understand the world, even Rachel, an adult, would be intimidated.

Perhaps that's why she was even more cold.

Because she was afraid of becoming dependent on him.

I earned 1 gold.

When she saw the gold brought by a nine-year-old, Rachel's eyes couldn't help but widen.

Where did you get this?

I earned it.

Tell the truth! Did you steal it? No matter how poor we are, if you steal from others...!

I really earned it. Won't you accept it?

With money that could feed all the orphanage children their fill right before her eyes, Rachel gritted her teeth.

Shall I pay it back for you, Director?

What?

The debt. Shall I pay it all back for you?

Coming out of her reverie, Rachel looked at Fermi.

Seeing his still confident expression, that mysterious composure as if nothing in the world would be impossible, reminded her of an old friend.

'How can he be so exactly like Yolga?'

If I pay back the debt, will you become my Rachel alone?

What are you saying, Fermi? I'm always there for all of you...

I don't need dozens of siblings.

Rachel closed her mouth.

I just need someone who will love only me.

It was a transaction that started with a faint hope.

She wasn't in her right mind.

Six months later, Fermi had paid off the orphanage's entire debt of 12 million gold.

No one still knew how he had earned such a fortune.

"Fermi, I'm sorry."

Rachel said tearfully.

"I... can't be your mother."

Fermi's expression barely changed, but his eyebrows seemed to rise just slightly toward his brow.

"I know."

Standing up, Fermi said.

"Use this money to establish a foundation. Please protect the dream my mother couldn't fulfill."

Leaving only the check behind, he headed for the door, and Rachel jumped up.

"Fermi."

"Don't worry."

Opening the door, he turned his head slightly.

"...I won't come again."

Closing the door and walking down the corridor unchanged from 14 years ago toward the shabby exit, the children were waiting.

"Mister, who are you? You came to bully our director, didn't you!"

"He definitely did. His eyes are all squinty, just like the debt collector who came last time!"

Fermi asked.

"Do you kids like the director?"

"Of course! The director is everyone's mother!"

Fermi! The director is everyone's mother!

Hearing the voice from 14 years ago, Fermi slowly extended his hand.

Even as a shadow fell across the child's face, the child couldn't move.

Making a tapping sound as he touched the child's head, Fermi crouched down to eye level.

"Here, buy something delicious with this."

It was a small silver coin.

Unable to hide his conflicted emotions, the child said in a dying voice.

"Um, I shouldn't accept things like this. The director will scold me."

"It's okay, it's a legitimate transaction. So take this and just make me one promise."

Pressing the silver coin into the child's hand, Fermi said.

"When there are difficult times, you must protect Director Rachel."

As if confident about that, the children shouted in unison.

"Of course! When I grow up, I'll punish all the bad people who bullied the director!"

"Good."

Fermi smiled with his eyes and left the orphanage.

Looking up, a clear sky without a single cloud spread before his gaze, and Yolga's face flickered in his vision.

'Mother, was this the right thing to do?'

Fermi's face twisted grotesquely and hatred filled his eyes.

'Now the revenge begins.'

At noon, the 6th day of Scramble Royale commenced.

Since victory would depend on how they handled the remaining 144 combinations, both teams' actions were swift yet careful.

Fisho's insect magic was fastest for collecting scrambles, but while Sabina kept him in check, Dorothy struggled valiantly to somehow maintain a 5-to-5 ratio.

'Nade didn't come.'

Shirone's mind was troubled as he searched everywhere for Eden.

'He didn't leave the battlefield either. What on earth happened?'

According to the master card status, it was certain that Nade had claimed one scramble.

Acting independently without telling his friends meant there had been a mental change.

Iruki said to leave him alone for now, but for Shirone, who didn't know the circumstances, it was frustrating.

'Found it! A scramble!'

Spotting a scramble glinting in the distance, thoughts of Nade were temporarily erased from his mind.

At the same time, Eden emerged from the bushes.

"You don't know when to give up."

She was still naked, and her master card wasn't visible.

'I can't let my guard down.'

Without even a moment to feel relieved, he summoned Photon Cannon, and Eden shook her head.

"I told you clearly, didn't I? As long as God protects me, no one can harm my body."

"Is that really so?"

As soon as he fired the Photon Cannon, Shirone cast teleportation and hastily snatched the scramble.

'Tch, she doesn't even care.'

Seeing her not even blink while being hit by the Photon Cannon made him even more annoyed.

'But if this is how she's going to be, it's actually easier.'

Casting Elysion, Shirone concentrated Ataraxia toward the sky.

Perhaps this was what invincibility meant—she didn't care where Shirone was and just stared straight ahead.

'I can't shock her, but...'

Shirone bound Eden's entire body intricately with Shining Chain and threw her into the sky.

Canceling time division and concentrating with all his might, the Ataraxia in the sky began concentrating at a tremendous speed.

Even during this, Eden just waited for the next moment while bound in chains, as if sleepy.

"Oh God, I believe in Your existence."

As her prayer began, Ataraxia started rotating while emitting brilliant multicolored light.

'Immortal Function!'

Shirone, pushing his mental power to the limit, compressed Photon Cannon above his head.

With Eden, Ataraxia, and Photon Cannon aligned in a straight line and precisely aimed, Shirone's molars clenched tight.

'If it's the sky, I don't need to worry about power!'

The moment he thought this, a thick flash of light penetrated Ataraxia.

Before the soaring light with tremendous amplification power, Eden's eyebrows twitched for the first time, but even that was buried and disappeared in the flash.

'It's started!'

Everyone participating in Scramble Royale stopped moving simultaneously and stared up at the massive pillar extending into the sky with their mouths agape.
