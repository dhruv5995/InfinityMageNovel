The Beginning of Destruction (1)

Those who knew Havitz were shocked.

'The ultimate evil of our era.'

The fact that Satan had joined hands with Uorin meant that even the demons were under Kashan's control.

'Damn it.'

Tension struck them.

'Havitz's ability is Vanishing. There's already been countless research and analysis, but...'

The conclusion was that even knowing about it, they couldn't stop it.

'It's like releasing a dog into a rabbit pen.'

Of course, no one in the holy war would consider themselves rabbits.

Lufist asked Sirone.

"Did you know?"

"I had some idea. But I didn't expect him to reveal himself so openly like this."

Sirone looked back at Uorin.

'What Havitz ultimately wants is the world's destruction. Do you really wish for that?'

As if she had heard his thoughts, she turned her head toward Sirone.

'Now you're finally looking at me.' Just that alone made her heart swell, but even without High Gear, she could hide her emotions.

"What is the meaning of this?"

King Woodlai of Corona scolded her.

"Empress of Kashan, at a time when we should achieve world unification and pursue peace among all nations, you summon Satan. Do you truly wish for humanity's destruction?"

It was what everyone was curious about.

"Of course not."

Uorin smiled.

"What we're doing now is a world war where all races compete for hegemony. Isn't strategic alliance fundamental?"

"Do you think such sophistry will work? This is a gathering of the highest-level leaders from each nation. Who would possibly attend a place where Satan is present?"

"That's why I'm introducing him like this."

As Uorin finished speaking, Havitz, who had smoked his drug Asker down to the butt, dismounted from his horse.

"Kugh!"

Just the fact that he moved caused the guards of Tormia and Corona to stir.

'Vanishing is dangerous.'

It's not simply disappearing.

There's no way to prevent what happens outside everyone's perception.

'Havitz is here. Havitz is here.' Even knowing it was useless, the guards endlessly etched Havitz's existence into their minds.

"Well, we're acquainted. With the Empress of Kashan." Havitz said.

"I need History Search too. But that woman made a wonderful proposal."

The guards' concentration reached its peak.

'Havitz is here. Havitz is here.'

"Hearing it, I thought I might have something to say at the holy war too. Anyway, so..."

The moment Havitz turned around.

'Havitz is here. Havitz... huh?' All the people in the procession, including the guards, blinked with blank expressions.

'Havitz? What's that?'

While everyone forgot about Satan, only a few including Sirone wore serious expressions.

"I'll make one proposal."

Reeking of Asker, Havitz, now mounted on Uorin's horse, continued speaking.

'Damn. We lost him!'

The few who realized belatedly felt chills.

"During my participation in the holy war conference, I won't use Vanishing. Would you let me join then?"

Pony said.

"Do you think we'll accept that proposal? Even if we did, how would we verify that you're keeping your promise?"

Uorin said.

"How about I stake my life on it?"

The moment her words fell, the leadership of Tormia and Corona stirred.

Albino of the Thunder Dragon instructed.

"Find out if she has a daughter."

"Yes."

If Mitochondrial Eve had secretly given birth to a daughter, the empress's life would be meaningless.

While the think tank moved busily, Uorin smiled shyly.

"Don't worry. I'm a virgin."

"Ahem. Hmm."

The elderly officials cleared their throats.

"In other words, there's no other Mitochondrial Eve. If I die, the empress dies too. If you want verification, I'll comply with official procedures and submit to investigation."

Gando's expression darkened, and Kido, who was guarding beside him, bared his sharp teeth.

'Tch! Do we have to go this far?' Even if it was an unavoidable choice, he didn't like joining hands with Havitz.

'He's the one who brought you to your knees. You're the empress, the most noble among humans...'

At least in Kido's eyes.

'Do you like that guy so much?' Feeling the gaze, Sirone turned his head and saw a goblin standing at the center of the guards.

'Kido.'

A precious friend who had overcome hardships together.

'You're doing well.'

When Sirone substituted a smile for a greeting, Kido also shouldered his spear and chuckled.

'You've become quite dignified.'

He had heard stories about Yahweh until his ears were worn out.

'But I've been promoted too.'

When Kido pointed to his guard captain badge and shrugged his shoulders, Sirone grinned widely.

'Haha.'

And again... their gazes crossed.

'I hope things go well.'

Though they were walking different paths according to their respective beliefs, they would still be friends.

He wanted to believe that.

"Anyway, the decision will be made after all 12 nations gather."

Uorin continued.

"For now, this is my proposal. I'll take responsibility for and control Mr. Havitz's actions. If this rule is broken, I swear to offer my life."

Woodlai said.

"I don't mean to disparage Kashan, but isn't claiming that your life is more valuable than the lives of 11 national leaders excessive self-importance?"

"Then what should we do? Will the 11 nations excluding Kashan boycott the holy war?" The holy war was the ultimate business.

"I don't think anyone wants to scatter again and fight bloodily. In that sense, I believe Mr. Havitz, as the leader of the demons, participating in the holy war has its own legitimacy. If you can't accept it..."

Uorin said coldly.

"I'll release Mr. Havitz. Freely."

"...Am I some beast?"

While Havitz muttered, Sirone's eyes calmly settled.

'This is the biggest problem.'

He was never someone who could be controlled from the beginning.

'Even without Kashan, Havitz could come to the holy war. The leadership of each nation must have already run simulations and prepared countermeasures.'

Just as Sirone had trained the Wizard.

'Therefore, the reason for displeasure isn't Havitz, but that Kashan preempted the demons. It's displeasure at others breaking taboos they couldn't break due to appearances.'

The balance of power was tilting toward Kashan.

"Regarding that matter..." Woodlai opened his mouth heavily.

"It seems right to gather the opinions of the 11 nations. Let's formally raise objections at the holy war."

When traditional powerhouse Corona stepped back, Uorin bowed her head gracefully.

"Thank you for your consideration. Then..."

Kashan's procession turned their horses' heads, and as if by appointment, Tormia and Corona withdrew.

"Kashan Empire! Inner castle entry!"

Hearing the general guarding the gate shout, Albino laughed heartily.

"Hahaha! We got hit right from the start. As expected, the empress is no pushover."

On the other hand, Rai's expression wasn't good.

"This is no laughing matter. The ability Havitz used just now is on a different dimension from what we heard."

The fact that he felt unease showed how sensitive Rai's senses were.

"The risk of royal assassination is at a realistically possible level. I'll set the alert level to maximum."

"Stay calm. The royal guard is the king's strength and face. It's not cool to make too much fuss."

"It's better than having your throat cut with your eyes open. Other nations won't be different from us."

"Hmm."

Albino twisted his beard.

"Perhaps that's Tormia's strength."

"Pardon?"

"Just saying."

Albino, who brushed off Rai's question, had his expression turn cold the next moment.

'Pony can die.'

Unlike other nations, Tormia's dependence on the king wasn't that high.

'Clever but with zero political credibility. Even if Pony dies to Havitz, Tormia won't be easily shaken. On the other hand...'

Other nations were different.

Especially the Kashan Empire, where it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say Uorin was all of the power.

'It's hard to breach, but once breached, it's a castle that collapses uncontrollably. That's exactly Kashan.'

Albino's lips twisted crookedly.

'A virgin.'

Who would have thought the words "biological purity" would come from the mouth of Mitochondrial Eve.

'Hehe, the Empress of Kashan must be quite desperate too.'

Mismatched eyes exactly like Iruki's glared fiercely at Uorin's figure.

'Yes, where should I start stabbing?'

After Kashan's entire procession withdrew, Tormia and Corona faced off from left and right.

Sirone said.

"We'll yield."

Lufist also agreed with those words.

'Corona has deep connections with Sirone. There's nothing good about making enemies now.'

Pony, knowing his role, spoke up.

"The Ivory Tower fought against humanity's crisis. I believe Corona Kingdom's participation is also a decision for the greater good. Tormia respects that intention and will yield the path."

Woodlai responded.

"As expected, you're a sage king as I've heard. Declining here would only half-accept King Pony's consideration, so I'll go first despite the embarrassment."

Even returning words after gaining action felt like excessive praise.

He was being conscious of Sirone.

'There's nothing good about getting on the bad side of the Five Great Stars. The Ivory Tower's factional fighting isn't ordinary either.'

Many stars had agreed to Singh's New World proposal, but Yahweh's influence was still formidable.

As if proving that fact, the stars participating in the holy war couldn't hide their awkwardness either.

On the way to the inner castle gate, Rampa's satellite Chongi saw Sirone and bowed his head.

"Ah, Five Great Star. Hello..."

Rampa stopped him.

"Don't act rashly. We're participating as Corona's think tank. Refrain from private interactions."

Acting rashly?

"How can you say that? I made eye contact with the Five Great Star." Rampa also knew.

'The Ivory Tower's stars are supranational beings. If Chongi respects someone, it's not something I can stop.'

But this time was an exception.

'We declared neutrality and left the Ivory Tower. If we show special feelings toward Yahweh here, there's concern that even the Ivory Tower might be corrupted into politics.'

Rampa apologized in his heart.

'I'm sorry, Five Great Star. Please scold this old man someday.'

Of course, Sirone understood their circumstances and remained calm even seeing Chongi avoid his gaze.

'Mr. Rampa. Chongi. Tsuoi. Mussho. The Ten-Member Magic Council. They're all from the System Inspection Department.'

Stars and satellites from other departments weren't visible.

'The head of the System Inspection Department is 3-star Rampa. It would have been difficult to endure in the power struggle between the Five Great Stars. Yet choosing neutrality means...'

It was a subtle nuance.

'Thank you.'

Even with the same neutrality, Singh would have been the one damaged by the System Inspection Department's departure.

'The balance was maintained by Mr. Rampa's bold decision. But conversely, it means the power struggle within the Ivory Tower is that tight. I should probably go...'

Sirone emerged from his thoughts upon discovering a familiar face in Corona's procession.

'Mr. Armin.'

Armin of Broad Eyes was going with Caira.

'Right. The Ivory Tower doesn't only have stars. The residents' abilities are also top-class.'

32 percent of the world's top 100 dangerous people belonged to the Ivory Tower.

'Mr. Gudyo.'

People who play card games and specialists known by name alone continued endlessly.

'Intelligence.'

The nation of intelligence.

"Corona Kingdom! Inner castle entry!"
