[671] Lord of Terror (2)

"Fire! It's at the Grassleaf Circus!"

Chagall dropped the groceries he was carrying at the market and ran toward where the circus tents were located.

"Those damn bastards!"

Though they toured throughout the Merchen Kingdom, Chagall despised this place where he first met Raiden more than anywhere else.

The troublesome trio who had harassed the circus since long ago had not only grown up to become leaders of a violent gang, but were constantly targeting Tia.

'No!'

With his genius athletic ability, he climbed the mountain in an instant, but the flames were already blazing fiercely.

'If something happened to Tia...'

Chagall shook his head.

'Just stay alive!'

Bodies were visible even from outside the tent, and the fact that Swift Sword Raiden had broken his taboo against killing was, in one way, hopeful.

"Boss! Tia!"

When he threw open the tent flap, a bloody hellscape unfolded before him.

"T-Tia..."

Among dozens of corpses, Chagall immediately found Tia.

She had dozens of stab wounds, and beside her lay the three detestable gang leaders, dead with their tongues hanging out.

Everyone was dead.

Only one person, Swift Sword Raiden, sat on a high box with his head bowed.

If his legs hadn't been swinging back and forth, one would have thought he was a corpse too.

His face was covered in blood, and the life had drained from his eyes.

"La Enemy."

"Boss... why?"

Had he killed Tia too?

"Boss!"

The moment Chagall shouted, Raiden seemed to come to his senses and lifted his head.

"La Enemy!"

As he jumped down from the box and charged at Chagall, daggers rose by themselves as if drawn by wind and gripped themselves in his hands.

When dozens of blades simultaneously aimed for vital points, Chagall instinctively deployed the same technique.

As ownership of the daggers changed in real time, master and student unleashed tremendous hand techniques.

As Raiden had called him a genius, Chagall's skill in operating no less than seven schemas had already surpassed his master.

As ownership of the daggers completely transferred to Chagall, dozens of holes were pierced through Raiden's body.

"Hah! Hah!"

He couldn't remember what had happened or how.

Only the terror that Tia was dead and that he had killed the boss who killed Tia swirled in his mind.

"Huuuh!"

Just as he was going mad, Raiden spoke.

"Forgive me."

Chagall's head snapped around.

"Why did you kill her? Why on earth...!"

"Forgive me."

Those words, which had once been Chagall's belief, now remained as the boss's dying words, their meaning incomprehensible.

"Whyyyy!"

While everyone was struggling against Igor's terror, Shirone stood in a dark space.

Fear is an emotion that arises when imagining things that haven't happened or being unable to turn away from things that have already occurred.

For Shirone, whose Kar was approaching 90 percent, neither applied.

Therefore, what appeared before his eyes was fear itself—Igor.

"Kar, de sumaham?"

Are you unique?

Igor's meaning was conveyed through the Ultima System.

"You cannot subdue me. Please let us go now."

"No."

Igor raised his spear.

"You are not unique."

As the blue flame spear flew and struck where Shirone had leaped away, blue lightning spread in concentric circles.

'That would be dangerous if it hit.'

When he teleported in a wide arc and fired photon cannons in rapid succession, the body pierced by flashes dissolved like smoke before quickly returning to its original form.

'Fear. It doesn't disappear just because you turn away from it?'

Before he knew it, Igor held a new spear in his hand, and as he swung his arm at tremendous speed, blue flames filled Shirone's vision.

'Let's do this!'

Shirone flew into the air, manifested the Avatar of the Archangel, and cast Angel's Punishment.

Light and blue flame spears crossed countless times.

Angel's Punishment, pouring down like a downpour, was enough to shatter Igor in one blow, but each time his body was endlessly restored.

'How am I supposed to eliminate him?'

The right arm, which recovered first each time, threw spears endlessly.

'Sibulsangpokmae!'

As Shirone dodged thousands of spears rushing like a tsunami, Igor's head tilted slightly.

"You've learned a little."

"What?"

Igor's body line vibrated like a plucked string, then multiplied to numbers that filled the horizon.

"Fear is within you!"

Igor's space filled with blue flame spears.

With nowhere to dodge, a single spear struck Shirone's body directly.

"Kuuuh!"

As lightning spread, the will of fear bypassed the 90 percent Kar and acted on the 10 percent of humanity.

That fear was, surprisingly...

'What?'

It was a very old memory of Shirone's death.

'Ikael?'

In Araboth where Ankera resided, Ikael knelt while countless subjects condemned her.

The reason no sound could be heard was probably because the subject who held this memory couldn't hear.

Shirone had never seen her weeping so sorrowfully before.

It wasn't because she was being condemned.

With an archangel's mind, even death shouldn't approach her as fear.

'Why are you crying?'

Her sobbing face revealed emotions extremely close to human, not what one would expect from an archangel.

It was maternal love.

Tears suddenly flowed from Shirone's eyes.

'Why are you crying!'

The subject of the memory was certainly Shirone himself, but it was a memory that had never been contained in his mind.

'Kariel!'

The one who had tormented Shirone terribly in heaven looked down at him with an arrogant gaze, then turned his head away in disgust.

Suddenly he thought:

'What... state am I in?'

What state was he in that he couldn't hear sounds, his vision was completely open, yet he couldn't even move his mouth?

Shortly after, Tricorn Mara thrust his face close.

Red skin and a lizard-like face, flames spouting from long-slit nostrils, yet he felt nothing.

'What am I exactly!'

He couldn't see his own appearance by any means.

As Tricorn Mara slowly raised his upper body, the massive axes in both hands shot toward the sky.

'This is my death?'

As death he had never experienced in life seeped into his memory as a recollection, fear began to surge.

'I'm dying!'

Tricorn Mara's axe struck down, ending Shirone's life.

Simultaneously, the body pierced by Igor's spear convulsed and scattered blue electricity in all directions.

"Uaaaah!"

Terror!

Igor's fear ability created a cause by reviving the death from a previous life that hadn't existed in Shirone's current lifetime.

This was exactly what La Enemy desired, and his incident attempted to infiltrate Shirone's mind.

Finally caught you!

Just as the memory of the five senses tried to change Shirone's past, protrusions burst from Armand's robe.

Small World Creation!

All memories of the five senses were blocked, and Shirone's body fell with a thud into a dark space where a small torch burned.

"Huuuuk! Huuk!"

As his body trembled with terror that hadn't yet subsided, the sound of sharpening a blade—srrring srrring—was heard.

Wiping away tears and raising his head, he saw a woman with fangs protruding beyond her lips grinding a sword on a whetstone.

"Pitiful, my master. Truly pitiful."

'Master?'

The torch was warm, and just having his senses return was reassuring.

"Who are you?"

Though he had a guess, he had no choice but to ask.

"I am sharpening a blade."

Thinking it wasn't really an answer, Shirone approached her but stopped dead in his tracks.

Only her face was illuminated by the light source, and her body hidden in darkness was a collection of various creatures dozens of meters in size.

In the spine-chilling sight, Shirone found familiar things.

Demonic Parasite Gatormic, Armored Mineral Species Ringer, Akamai clinging to it, and the unconscious fallen angel Ikasa's form was also mixed in.

"I can become anyone."

Just her raising her upper body lifted her face 10 meters high, and her right arm—the only human-shaped part—pointed a sword.

"Countless beings embraced and violated me. You are the same, Shirone."

Though they achieved mental synchronization, the initiative was always held by Shirone.

If it were a human-to-human union, the pain would be unimaginable.

"But it doesn't matter. I was already prepared. That's why when you put countless things into my body, I simply accepted it."

"Uh, that's..."

"It's fine. It's fate. However, this too is fate."

"What do you mean?"

"I call someone master only once in a lifetime—when I come to claim my master's mind and body."

Shirone slowly backed away.

"You're going to kill me?"

"There's nowhere to run. This place is both me and you."

Strangely, it made sense.

"Please tell me why."

"You were broken by fear. All the masters I embraced were the same."

"I'm not broken! I can still fight!"

"Even if I send you back like this, you'll die anyway, Shirone."

The woman smiled sadly for a moment, then revealed killing intent and charged toward Shirone.

"It was enjoyable, though brief."

Realizing her sincerity, Shirone cast Photon Cannon, but she easily swung her sword and deflected them all.

"It's useless. You and I are one."

Through Sibulsangpokmae, he felt one second of past and future simultaneously, but the woman existed in both.

'She's sharing my time exactly.'

One second ago and one second later, the blade would strike precisely at Shirone's crown and split his body in half.

Faced with absolute death occurring within unified cognition, Shirone couldn't even muster the courage to move.

'So this is how it ends.'

Since there was no room for denial, acceptance was rather easy.

Aryan Shirone.

The moment the letters carelessly carved into her body glowed, another name carved inside came to mind.

'I can't die like this!'

Because Aryan Shirone exists, the concept called Carmis Amirah could be conceived.

'Because I exist, Armand exists.'

As the concept corresponding to the number 2 of the law struck his mind along the path of insight, lightning flashed and struck the dark space.

"..."

The sword the woman swung passed right through Shirone, and she slowly turned to look at him without showing emotion.

"The one who was cut... was me?"

Sense Sword.

Shirone and Armand, integrated through the Ultima System, were separated into two by the blade stroke of existence and non-existence.

The woman who had passed through Shirone walked to where the torch was and began sharpening her blade again.

"Go. It seems you can live a little longer."

"I don't know how to get out."

"Lies. You already know, don't you?"

Shirone realized why he was hesitating to leave.

"Um... thank you. And I'm sorry."

It was sincere.

"I'm not an existence. I'm a concept."

The woman turned her head and smiled with her eyes.

"I will swallow any part of you. Become strong."

Feeling that even asking about her identity would be hurtful, Shirone simply bowed his head and turned away.

When he left this place, terrible fear would be waiting, but he was no longer afraid.

'Wait for me!'

Shirone's resolute gaze aimed at the Lord of Terror beyond the thin membrane.

Thin Knowledge.
