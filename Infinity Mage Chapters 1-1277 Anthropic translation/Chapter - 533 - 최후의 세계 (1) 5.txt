[533] The Final World (1)

The Abyss is a virtual world that implements the apocalypse of the future based on current information.

While it would be foolish to gauge its size in this garbage dump of information, Miro's group was confident they could meet Shirone.

No matter how vast The Abyss might be, if one is human, they would inevitably connect to the information of the world most familiar to humans.

However, since it was the final destination of information, that world would be the furthest future that current information could reach.

Naturally, Shirone's information had also seeped in, in the state that The Abyss could 'most appropriately accept.'

The name someone first gave to this world was Apocalypse.

Ruined skyscrapers.

Buildings exposed their steel frames like creatures stripped of flesh, and cars were nailed in place like fossils with their engines dead.

"Hamei, hurry up, hurry!"

In the midst of this terrible ruin, a boy and girl not yet ten years old appeared.

They were a race called the 'Children of the Sun,' the last descendants of humanity who had survived multiple nuclear wars and cosmic-scale disasters.

Their green hair and dark skin were unique characteristics of those who sustained life through photosynthesis.

Therefore, their digestive organs were only needed for water intake, and they wouldn't swallow anything harsher than water, not even for fun.

"Thank you, brother. I can't tell you how reassuring it is that Woodga is coming with me. I'm sorry for making such a difficult request."

"Don't talk like an adult when your stem hasn't even fallen off yet."

Though only a year apart in age, Hamei, who was just starting to 'gather,' seemed childish to Woodga.

"Tch! Your stem hasn't fallen off either, brother!"

The Children of the Sun had stems on the tops of their heads like fruit, which would shrink over time and eventually fall off.

"Fine, let's hurry. There's a set time when we can enter the 'Tree of Life.'"

Woodga urged them along.

"You're eight now, so you need to start 'gathering.' It's important work that can't be left to slaves. Watch the path carefully today and memorize it."

"But we have to pass through the 'contaminated zone.'"

"Don't worry. Just do as I tell you."

The Children of the Sun skillfully navigated through the dangerous terrain full of hazards and entered the city.

"Kahahaha! There they are!"

Suddenly, a harsh shout rang out.

Reflexively pressing down on Hamei's head and crouching, Woodga cautiously peeked his face around the corner.

'Underground people!'

Beings with elongated arms and hair growing down to below their ears were skillfully stepping on building debris as they climbed to higher ground.

Though the Children of the Sun would never acknowledge it, they too were another branch of humanity living in the apocalypse.

Commonly called underground people.

A race with the physical abilities of apes and human intelligence, they were those who sustained themselves through 'hunting.'

'Of all places to encounter them...!'

The underground people were dangerous because they used weapons from ancient civilizations buried underground.

Even now, those engaged in hunting were running with machine guns and bombs dangling all over them.

"Food! Food!"

Seven underground people who had navigated through the snake-like complex debris aimed at fish flying in the sky.

When the seas dried up, some fish species evolved to fill their swim bladders with gases lighter than air to fly through the sky, and the species they were targeting now was a sky fish called Razet.

"Shoot! Blast them!"

When the underground people pulled their triggers, the recoil made their long arms swing wildly, quickly emptying a magazine.

Woooom! Woooom!

The sky fish Razet made strange sounds as it expelled jet streams from its rear.

Using jet propulsion to escape was the only survival method for fish whose durability had become terrible due to weight reduction.

When bullets penetrated the Razet, its body rapidly shrank and crashed to the ground.

"Got it! The eyeball is mine!"

There would be hardly any flesh, but it would still be enough for seven people to barely survive a day.

When the shrunken fish hit the ground, all seven rushed over and dismantled the fish with their bare hands.

"Delicious! Delicious!"

Hamei, who was secretly watching them push things into their mouths without even checking what they held in their hands, trembled.

"Horrible."

Eating food was simply something the underground people had to do to survive.

But to the Children of the Sun, who had an intense aversion to the very act of eating, it was too horrific a sight.

"Now's our chance. Let's slip away while they're distracted."

Woodga took Hamei and crossed the street.

Only after running three more blocks with hearts ready to burst from tension could the two wipe the sweat from their foreheads.

"Phew, that's done. From here on..."

Woodga's words suddenly cut off.

He had spotted one underground person approaching from across the road.

Wearing a rusty pot like a bulletproof helmet, with ammunition belts across his shoulders and heavy machine guns in both hands.

"Meat!"

The underground person, who looked like a hairless monkey, drooled at the sight of the Children of the Sun and fired his machine gun.

Having no concept of aimed shooting, he roughly sprayed forward, causing buildings to crumble and break apart.

"Run! Run, Hamei!"

Not even noticing their skin getting scraped on the building's steel frames, the two ran frantically down the street.

"Ow!"

Then something caught Hamei's feet.

Unable even to break her fall properly, she tumbled forward, and Woodga's eyes filled with shock as he turned toward her.

"Danger! Hamei!"

"Yahoooo!"

Like a monkey swinging from trees, the underground person leaped down from a traffic light, aiming his gun.

"I'll eat it all by myself!"

Kiyaaaaa!

Just then, a giant strange bird flew in from the opposite direction and snatched up the underground person with its enormous beak.

Having wings meant it was a carnivorous creature.

In a world lacking energy sources, explosive speed was a gamble, but it was an unavoidable choice to be faster than the jet propulsion of air-eating creatures.

As the strange bird faded into the distance, seemingly having swallowed even the thunderous gunshots, Woodga's legs gave out and he collapsed to the ground.

"Phewwww, we almost really died. Hamei, are you okay?"

When no answer came, Woodga finally raised his head to find Hamei examining the ground where she had fallen.

"Hamei, what are you doing? Are you hurt?"

"...Brother, look at this."

Only when Woodga got up did he realize what she was looking at and was startled.

"Wait, move aside."

After sweeping away the dirt from the glass tube that had emerged from the ground, he could finally be certain.

"It's real. This is an 'Ancient's Shelter.'"

An Ancient's Shelter was a personal capsule where those who lived before this world's destruction lay sleeping.

For the Children of the Sun, it meant additional labor force to use as slaves, and for the underground people, it was premium food with plenty of meat, so discovering a capsule could be considered hitting the jackpot.

"Let's take it out! Help me!"

"But what about 'gathering'? There's a set time to enter the Tree of Life."

"There'll be another chance before sunset. When we return to the 'colony,' say that you discovered this. Then you'll be able to receive Ra's blessing."

"...Ra's blessing?"

Having imagined sweet times, Hamei reluctantly helped Woodga excavate the capsule.

Though inferior to the underground people, the Children of the Sun also had enough physical strength and muscle power to survive in the apocalypse.

The capsule was excavated without difficulty, and the two could see a blonde boy sleeping inside the glass tube.

"Wow, his skin is incredibly white."

"Let's open it first. I saw the older brothers do it when I came out to gather before."

After clearing away the dirt, they could see writing carved in large letters in the ancient language beneath the glass tube.

Silence Artificial Hibernation Corporation

"If I touch somewhere here..."

When he pressed the green button, the capsule shook, lights came on, and the engine started running as a woman's guidance voice was heard.

System activation. Subject code number 10111

Releasing hibernation of 111001.

Hibernation time: 2,473 years, 287 days, 14 hours, 9 minutes, 42 seconds.

The capsule, which had been silent as if lost in thought, reported its results after a moment.

Memory power insufficient. User information lost. Releasing hibernation.

Suddenly the glass panel flew out with a bang.

Then smoke billowed up as if there was a fire, and Hamei grabbed Woodga's arm.

"Is this really okay, brother?"

"Don't worry. It won't explode. When the older brothers woke up an ancient person before, there was smoke like this too."

Only after the smoke cleared did the two examine inside the capsule.

All processes were complete, but the blonde boy still showed no signs of waking up, remaining fast asleep.

"What should we do? Should we wake him? Hey, hey. Open your eyes."

"Huh!"

The moment Woodga grabbed his shoulder and shook him, the boy's eyes snapped open and he bolted upright.

"...Good. He really woke up."

The boy panted roughly without even being able to blink, like someone who had awakened from a nightmare.

Then, finally coming to his senses, he looked around.

'Where is this? What on earth happened?'

Many memories had been lost, and he couldn't even clearly recall who he was.

Woodga, whose eyes met the boy's, spoke in an authoritative voice as he had heard from his older brothers.

"Wh-what are you staring at? If you're awake, hurry up and come out. From now on, you're a slave of our colony!"

'I can't understand what he's saying.'

The boy ignored Woodga and fell back into thought.

As information combined in the form most familiar to the apocalyptic world, his memories were jumbled.

'I definitely remember entering a hibernation device...'

On the other hand, he also had dream-like memories of living in a world where strange abilities were used.

The problem was not knowing which information was real.

"Argh! Hey, aren't you coming out quickly?"

When Woodga grabbed the boy's arm and pulled him out, frightened Hamei grabbed his arm to stop him.

"Brother, don't do that! What if he gets angry and does something to us?"

"That's exactly when we need to be strong. Until he receives Ra's baptism, he's not a complete slave."

'Wow, what strength for a little kid...!'

Rather than displeasure, the boy was amazed by the strength of this newly met human as he emerged from the capsule.

In any case, these were the people who had awakened him again.

"Ah, thank you. But where is this? No, how much time has passed?"

The reason he wasn't greatly shocked by seeing the ruined world was because it had been predicted from the moment he decided on hibernation.

Woodga, who didn't understand, beat his chest and said:

"I'm Woodga. And this is Hamei. When we get to the colony later, you must say that Hamei discovered you. Got it?"

'Woodga. Hamei. I guess those are names.'

"What's your name?"

When Woodga pointed at him, the boy fell back into thought.

'My name. Who am I really?'

Then suddenly a splitting headache rushed in, and fragmented memories scratched through his mind like shards.

Second power plant collapse! Power is insufficient! We can't put everyone in hibernation!

Shut up! The people waiting in capsules are still awake!

But!

Save even one more person! For humanity! We will survive to the end!

The conversation the researchers had been shouting reached clearly to the ears of the boy lying in the capsule.

Shortly after, golden code passed through the inside of the glass tube, and his eyes trapped inside shook with anxiety.

Hah! Hah! Hah!

Activating artificial hibernation system. Molecular activity will cease. Minus 273 degrees Celsius.

Ahhhhh!

The memory cut off as if sliced by a knife.

"Kugh!"

The boy clutched his head in agony amid the flood of all kinds of false information.

"What's wrong? Are you okay?"

The moment Woodga approached with concern, one piece of information closest to the truth suddenly flashed in the boy's mind.

"Ro..."

"Ro?"

"Roscine. My name is probably Roscine. Maybe..."
