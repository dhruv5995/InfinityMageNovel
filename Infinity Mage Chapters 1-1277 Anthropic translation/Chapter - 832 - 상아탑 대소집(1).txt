The Ivory Tower Assembly (1)

The 400th floor of the Ivory Tower.

Even now, as the present world was in the midst of war with the demon race, the natural landscape of the 400th floor remained tranquil.

Within the artificially created natural scenery, people planted seeds and prepared for a hopeful tomorrow.

'I have been defeated.'

In a red-roofed house prepared on the outskirts of the village, Sirone was immersed in meditation.

'I lost.'

As the plan to assassinate Harvits through <Law Kill> failed, the world hurtled toward catastrophe.

The death toll from demons was already approaching one million, and Sirone felt responsible for it.

'Why did I lose?'

His thoughts chased each other in circles, ultimately arriving at the conclusion that it was because he was weak.

The sacred light of Yahweh enveloped his face, but it was not in the form of a beautiful sphere.

'I must endure.'

The spirit of universal love that embraces all things equally.

'I must accept everything.'

Though he understood it intellectually, suppressing his inner rage was beyond the realm of human capability.

When the heart leans toward one side, the mind becomes twisted and enlightenment shatters.

'My heart must move.'

If he could transcend calculation and become love itself, only then would Sirone obtain perfect freedom.

"Ugh!"

It seemed impossible.

'I must forgive. I must embrace it all.'

Like Sirone's flowing tears, droplets of Yahweh's light fell burning downward, drop by drop.

"Annihilate the humans!"

By absorbing hell's army, Harvits had made the Gustav Empire truly the world's strongest military power.

Interior King Smodo reorganized the army of one billion according to the characteristics of the demon race.

And currently, under Vulcan's plan, an army of fifty million was heading toward Kashan's imperial capital.

"Isn't this too easy? Boringly so."

It was practically an entire nation moving as one, and no human army could stop them.

In the massive carriage pulled by Maranka, monsters from the other world, Harvits and all four of Gustav's knights had gathered.

"Uorin."

There was no need for the empire's emperor to be on the battlefield, but if the conquered nation was Kashan, the story was different.

"I'm looking forward to seeing what expression she'll make when we occupy the imperial capital."

From his open carriage, Harvits gazed at hell's army filling the sky and earth.

It was a procession possible only because they weren't human.

"Satan, my lord!"

A demon with red tail and wings approached, flying against the aerial unit's flow while brandishing a trident.

It was a messenger who had learned human language.

"We have occupied Kashan's commercial city of Benaford."

Benaford was a wealthy city located forty kilometers from here.

Vulcan gave instructions in place of Harvits.

"We'll stay there tonight. You continue advancing without rest."

As the messenger immediately departed to carry out the order, Vulcan turned to Harvits and said:

"With this, we've consumed one-third of Kashan's territory. It's time to make a decision."

Once they occupied half of Kashan's territory, the path to invade the central continent would open.

Smodo said:

"Zaive, Molton, and Bornau - these three nations bordering Kashan will become the gateway. Break through here and we can devour not only the central continent's twenty-one kingdoms but the southern continent as well, without any obstacles."

"I'm going to Uorin."

At Harvits' command, showing no interest in strategy, tactics, or even war itself, Vulcan sighed.

"Then we'll split our forces. From Benaford, ten million troops will attack Kashan, and the remaining army will head south."

Natasha looked back questioningly.

"Forty million to the central continent?"

"There's been no movement from the Holy War yet. They're probably planning to make their last stand at the central continent's border. Ten million troops are sufficient to take Kashan."

If Vulcan said so, no one would object, and that night Harvits' unit arrived at Benaford.

The city that had once been among Kashan's three wealthiest was now horribly destroyed.

Harvits set up camp in an area where buildings had completely collapsed and summoned the city's rulers.

Twenty high-ranking nobles including the mayor were dragged out, bound with ropes.

Already knowing Harvits' nature, their faces were drained of color and their eyes filled with terror.

'We're going to die anyway. That's not what's frightening.'

They couldn't even imagine how this madman would torment them.

"I'll spare half of you."

When Harvits spoke indifferently, everyone raised their heads in disbelief.

'Half? Half?'

One out of two.

It was a probability that made them hope they wouldn't be the unlucky one, even though they might die.

"But I'll torture the other half."

Since it wouldn't be torture to extract information, the nobles' shoulders trembled.

"Those who want to live, raise your hands."

At first, no one raised their hand.

Shame at begging for their lives, buying time to analyze the situation.

'We're going to die anyway. It's right to take the gamble.'

When three quick-thinking individuals simultaneously raised their hands, the rest turned to look at them as if their necks might break.

Their gazes mixed bewilderment, anger, and perhaps vague hope that those three would die.

"Release them."

At Harvits' instruction, a soldier untied the three men's ropes and helped them stand.

"Leave. You are free."

The faces of the remaining seventeen turned ashen.

"You said you'd spare half."

Now seven people could live, and seeing hope, they all raised their hands.

"Please spare me! I have children!"

"I must live! I'll do anything for Lord Harvits!"

After listening to their cries for a moment, Harvits extended his hand to Zetaro.

He received two dice and threw them to the person sitting on the far left.

"From now on, you'll pair up and roll dice. Whoever gets the higher number goes free."

"Uh..."

The noble who had been staring down at the dice that fell before his knees looked up with a dazed expression.

"Roll it."

Startled by Harvits' brief command, he picked up the dice with trembling hands and rolled them.

"Huuuugh!"

The two six-sided dice showed 3 and 4, totaling 7.

"Next. The person beside you."

Unable to even make eye contact, the man kneeling next to him grabbed the dice.

The time it took for the dice thrown with trembling hands to roll across the ground felt like an eternity.

"Ah, aah..."

The dice showed 6 and 2, totaling 8.

"UAAAAH!"

The man with 8 let out a roar, while conversely, the man with 7 became dazed.

"This, this is ridiculous."

A mere dice game - it was impossible for his fate to be decided by just a difference of one.

"Just once, please give me just one more chance!"

"Take him away. Torture him until he dies."

Even as soldiers dragged him from the tent, he couldn't accept his fate.

"Please! Please, just one more chance!"

Vulcan smiled bitterly.

'This is the truth of the world. There's nothing you can do but roll the dice.'

Human free will amounted to just that much.

'But some humans transcend the shackles of law and carry out their own will.'

At least, none of those present here were such people.

"Next. Roll it."

The dice continued passing to the next person, and cheers of joy and screams of despair repeatedly erupted.

"There's one person left?"

Since three had raised their hands and left, the remaining one had no opponent for a dice duel.

"Ah, please... mercy..."

Watching the noble who feared he might not even get a fifty-fifty chance, Harvits stood up.

"You can do it with me."

"What? How could I, with Your Imperial Majesty..."

Harvits sat cross-legged in front of the noble and handed him the dice.

"What does that matter? Actually, I wanted to try this. If you beat me, you become emperor. And I... hmm."

Looking around, Harvits said to Zetaro:

"Right. Zetaro, you kill me."

Vulcan said:

"Your Majesty, such a proposal is..."

Before he could finish, Zetaro burst into laughter, clutching his stomach.

"Bwahahaha! Understood! What a thrilling match. Then I'll serve as judge."

As Zetaro approached Harvits and raised his sword as if to strike his neck, the terrified noble's pupils rolled upward.

'Crazy bastards. They're not normal.'

"Roll it. It's the chance of a lifetime."

The tent's atmosphere became explosively tense, making it the most entertaining round.

"Please. Please, just once..."

The noble, convulsing all over, squeezed his eyes shut and threw the two dice.

For a moment the air froze, and the noble who cautiously opened his eyes gaped in disbelief.

"Aah! Aaaah!"

The dice showed 6 and 6, totaling 12.

'It's a miracle! Dear God! Thank you!'

While Harvits' officers wore serious expressions, Zetaro burst into laughter.

"Bwahahaha! What will you do now? Surely Your Majesty won't go back on your word?"

Any other emperor would have cut off Zetaro's head, but Harvits actually smiled.

'As expected, you're the best.'

The most entertaining.

"Now it's my turn."

Though Harvits had truly staked his life, there was no hesitation in his dice-throwing motion.

"Here goes."

Everyone's gaze followed the dice.

When they showed 6 and 6, totaling 12, drool dripped from the dazed noble's mouth.

"A tie. One more time."

"Huuuugh."

The noble, making a face like a crying child, grabbed the dice while shedding tears.

The crying wouldn't stop.

"Uaah. Uaaaah."

His shocked nerves ran wild as the two dice slipped from his palm.

The result was again 6 and 6, totaling 12.

"UAAAAH! UAAAAH! UAAAAH!"

The half-mad noble screamed repeatedly, tears and snot streaming down his face.

Vulcan's gaze finally turned sharp.

'There's no manipulation in the dice. But 12 came up three times in a row. Even if they're independent events, this is...'

Harvits snatched up the dice.

"Not bad. Then what about this time?"

The two dice flew through the air without hesitation and fell.

"UAAAAH!"

The soldiers who had been holding their breath in tension stared at the dice and roared.

"It's 12! Another 12!"

While nothing was impossible in probability, this was certainly not a situation one commonly encountered in life.

"Please... spare me."

The noble begged, but Harvits was resolute.

"Roll it."

Though his body was already exhausted, hoping for one last miracle, he threw the dice.

1 and 2, totaling 3.

"Then is it my turn now?"

Just as Harvits was gathering up the dice, the noble's body trembled violently and he opened his mouth wide.

"Gwaaah!"

A bowlful of blood poured out as he rolled his eyes back and collapsed forward.

Zetaro checked his condition.

"He's dead."

"Pity. I was going to spare him."

Returning to his seat, Harvits wiggled his legs with a disgusted expression.

"Boring. Isn't there anything interesting?"

By the next morning, the 20,000 citizens who had survived in Benaford were horribly murdered.

'Forgive them. Love them.'

Bloody tears flowed from Sirone's eyes as he remained immersed in meditation for thirty hours.

He could no longer suppress his anger.

'No. I mustn't waver.'

The battle between universal love and rage was like walking a tightrope where even the slightest misstep could destroy his mind.

"Huuuugh..."

Blood flowed from his closed eyes, nose, and lips, soaking his clothes.

'Endure it. Swallow even the anger.'

Yahweh's light began dripping down like melted candle wax.
