Trigger (3)

Even as the drinking session reached its peak, Uorin and Unryong didn't reveal their true intentions.

"Heh heh heh, horseback riding is not only good for your health, but it's also an excellent remedy when you have troubles of the heart."

"I've heard that the horses of the Moon Kingdom are fast and strong. In Kashan, horses are quite precious."

While everyday conversation flowed between them, the two nations' guard captains were locked in a battle of wills.

'I can't back down.' The qualification to attend Code One belonged only to the guard captains, excluding the kings.

Any shift in balance would be tantamount to defeat in war, creating a tense atmosphere.

'That woman is no ordinary person either.'

Kido glared at the Moon Kingdom's guard captain, Lyeonglyeong.

Her corpse-pale face showed no signs of life except for her blood-red lips.

'Was it called Jeokgangsi?'

Without avoiding Kido's gaze, Lyeonglyeong gently brushed back her sideburns.

As her blue trumpet sleeves fell back, ominous red characters carved into her wrist were revealed.

'The Moon Kingdom is said to have advanced jiangshi techniques. The work of carving laws into human bodies.'

Without knowing what laws were carved into Lyeonglyeong's body, he couldn't let his guard down.

"The Moon Kingdom has a famous horse called Bipung that can run a thousand li in a day and doesn't fear a rain of arrows. We'll send you a stallion as a gift soon."

"Thank you for your kindness."

Uorin covered her mouth and smiled brightly, but her inner eyes were cold as a snake's.

'This is dragging on forever. What the hell is this about?' Kashan had no allies.

This was partly because they were strong enough, but also because half-hearted alliances could bring trouble later.

'What kind of card does the Moon Kingdom have?'

They wouldn't have activated Code One without the confidence that they could definitely persuade her.

While she felt anticipation, she also didn't like the feeling of being led by her opponent.

'Damn Time faction.'

Because the Paras Kingdom had twisted the laws, her future sight was currently useless.

"Your patience is remarkable."

Unryong spoke as if launching a surprise attack, smiling with his eyes, but Uorin responded calmly.

"Ho ho, I just lost track of time. Come to think of it, the night has grown quite deep."

Munryong looked down at his wine cup and spoke.

"Let's form an alliance."

"What do you have?"

"What you want."

"And what's that?"

"Well. Disaster? Shock waves? Massive terror? Whatever it is, something that can destroy the current state of affairs."

Uorin, who had been aggressively leaning forward, quietly retreated to her chair.

Lifting her wine cup to wet her lips was a signal that she would listen to Unryong's words.

"We will launch an assassination against the kings of the Holy War."

Listen! Listen!

With Uorin's ears perked up, the explanation continued for a full 20 minutes.

"The assassination is ready. We just need to launch it. However, at this point, I'd like to make one proposal. Habits."

Munryong leaned forward.

"I've heard that using the other world's system can further strengthen the assassination. And if that happens, we should be able to assassinate all the kings of the 11 Holy War nations."

Uorin scratched under her fingernails.

'Crazy bastard.'

Her heart pounded roughly, and for the first time, she felt blood flowing through her entire body.

'There's no law saying I have to die.'

Desperately suppressing her rising lips, she lifted her head for the first time.

"It would be possible through Siok, Habits' subordinate. Then can I avoid the assassination?"

"Your Majesty underestimates me too much. Since you've already heard the explanation, threats are meaningless. The reason I still made the proposal is because you won't refuse."

Certainly true.

'There's only one world hegemon, and a half-hearted alliance could mean having enemies at your back. A double-edged sword. But Unryong's proposal is attractive.'

If she could drive as many as 10 countries to the brink of collapse, the alliance would be worth it.

"...When will you launch the assassination?"

"Tonight at midnight."

Even Uorin thought this was the right answer.

'The value of information decreases over time. The faster, the more devastating the impact. The downside is that compared to the scale of the event, there's no time to consider variables.'

Kido, who felt the same way, glanced at Uorin.

'Hey, this isn't right.'

In roughly 2 hours, they would simultaneously kill the 10 most powerful people in the world.

'Too rushed. Let's think about us.' Uorin's lips curved upward.

'You're wrong, Kido. This works because it's rushed.'

Teraze's true strength wasn't memory inheritance or history search.

'Put exactly one bullet in the revolver. Then put the gun to your head...

The world looks different.

'Unnecessary emotions disappear, and thinking becomes cold. You can distinguish between what's important and what's not. As a result... you understand the world as if absorbing it.'

Of course, you have to pull the trigger.

'Pull it six times and it'll fire once. If the bullet goes off, that's the end, but...'

Roughly 16.6 percent.

'83.4 percent chance of survival. Actually, it's an incredibly easy gamble. But people can't easily pull the trigger because life is most precious.'

But Teraze was different.

'I pulled it endlessly. I realized it there, spun the revolver, then toward that 16.6 percent death again...'

Click.

'Kido, can you do it? You have to. Everyone in the Holy War is like that. Those who can't overcome the 16.6 percent fear don't deserve to devour the world.'

Uorin spoke.

"Fine, I'll accept the Moon Kingdom's proposal. I'll request Habits to amplify the assassination. However, I'd like to modify the strategy a bit. Now that we've formed an alliance, I should at least have the right to voice my opinion, shouldn't I?"

"Of course. I'm listening."

"The plan to assassinate the leaders of the existing 10 countries could have major repercussions. Regardless of success or failure, countries not hit by the assassination will become suspects."

"Indeed, I thought about that too. But wouldn't it be a waste to just throw away such an opportunity?"

"Instead, if we can frame a specific country as the culprit, I think the gains would outweigh the losses. A double strategy of killing an enemy country's king and also framing an enemy country's king."

"Hmm."

It made sense.

"Would such manipulation be immediately possible? Even fortune-tellers can't predict human hearts."

"You know me."

Unryong, who had been staring intently into the eyes of Mitochondrial Eve, nodded.

"Good. Choose the countries that will be hit by assassination and the countries that will escape it, right here and now."

They had to finish the design within 10 minutes.

With Kido and Lyeonglyeong also swallowing nervously, Uorin's lips opened.

"The first country to be hit by assassination is..." The decision was made.

"Tormia."

The temporary barracks that the Moon Kingdom had left were quiet, with only candles flickering.

It seemed to represent Uorin's state of mind.

"Aren't you anxious?"

Kido asked.

"Honestly, you're anxious, aren't you? So why did you accept such a proposal? Kashan's position is still fine. Going steadily would have had enough chance of victory."

"Just fine isn't enough."

Teraze's intuition was telling her.

"Kido, being fine actually means you're falling. Because humans are basically not animals that feel satisfaction with just being fine." "You have to keep knocking upward without rest. If things continue this way, Zive will become the hegemon. I need the power to shake up the situation. Strong force."

"And that's royal assassination?"

"The Moon Kingdom will launch the assassination anyway. If you can't avoid destruction, it's much better to be on the side causing the disaster. Because you can control the information."

"Well, you'll handle it well, I'm sure."

The Empress of Kashan wouldn't need advice, but Kido felt it as a warrior.

'Once someone dies...

What awaited afterward was a bloody revenge drama where sword calls sword.

Uorin's eyes sparkled with life.

"By the way, where the hell has Habits been all day that we can't see him?" At the height of nighttime politics, all of Gustav's 4th Squad came into the city.

"Habits came here?"

Balkan looked up at a building with hundreds of light bulbs along its exterior walls.

Zetaro tilted his head.

"It's a casino. Was he too bored? He's not the type to enjoy gambling at this point."

Smodo said.

"He didn't come to kill people either. He made an agreement with the Kashan Empire."

From their conversation, Balkan realized.

"No, he did come to kill." Natasha asked back.

"Really? Habits doesn't care about contracts, but he doesn't break them just because they're disadvantageous to him."

That was his personality.

"Because it's not a contract violation. He's not responsible for what happens outside the Holy War. Even if he were, Kashan's power could push it through."

Smodo stroked his chin.

"Hmm, then it's even stranger. No deaths occurred, right? Not even vanishing status."

"...Let's go in first."

When the four people entered through the main entrance, numerous nobles were gambling.

"Yes! One million gold!" When a girl who won at cards raised both hands, people applauded.

'Rebecca.'

Balkan, reading the atmosphere, nodded.

"As expected, Habits coming here wasn't coincidence. There was a VIP. Rebecca, Gis's daughter."

"She's got some nerve. I heard there were casualties too, but she's still leisurely gambling."

"Her eyes are glazed. Probably drugs. But more than that, she seems unaware of her position."

Zetaro said.

"I also think Habits came to kill Rebecca. But why did he change his mind?"

"Over there."

Balkan pointed to the bar.

"Welcome."

The bartender, who had been cleaning cups, immediately changed his expression upon seeing the 4th Squad's fierce faces.

"What brings you here?"

"I'm Balkan, Emperor of Gustav. I heard Habits came here today - did you see him?"

The bartender's expression went blank.

"Who... did you say you were?"

Zetaro pounded the bar.

"Emperor, emperor! I'm the Prime Minister. Just answer what we're asking. Did you see Habits or not?"

'Are these people crazy?'

Great figures had been looking for him since broad daylight, but this was the first time an emperor had visited.

"Ah, well..."

The bartender recited exactly what he had told everyone else, word for word.

His life was on the line.

"A... girl?"

Balkan's eyes wavered at the unexpected information.

"Yes. She looked about seven years old. The atmosphere was a bit strange though. Mr. Habits drank whiskey, and the child didn't touch anything." Natasha asked.

"What did they talk about? You need to be honest."

"I really don't know! The customers started vomiting en masse, so I went to the storage room to get ice."

Smodo checked the bartender's expression with his lie detection.

'It's not a lie.'

The remaining problem was who exactly was this child that interested Habits more than Rebecca.

"We'll find her, no matter what."

There was no disagreement with Balkan's words, and the four people rose with murderous intent.

"Investigation and tracking. Even if we don't know about Habits, there should be people who saw the child. Grab anyone we can."

The Holy War wouldn't stay still, but Gustav's 4th Squad lived lives with no way back.

"There's no need for that."

The bartender pointed forward with a surprised expression.

"Huh? There, there! That child!"

Where Gustav's 4th Squad turned, Wena Wizard stood honestly.

'Alone? Where's Habits?' Balkan quickly looked left and right but soon found his gaze fixed on Wizard.

'No, more than that, this child...'

Everyone was thinking the same thing.

'Is she really human?'
