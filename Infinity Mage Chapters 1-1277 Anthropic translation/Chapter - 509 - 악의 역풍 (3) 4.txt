[509] The Backlash of Evil (3)

The aura of disgust disappeared from Erga's face as she glared at Zulu with heavy silence.

Kiruurururu.

Making a cute sound, the small monster vanished, and Zulu rose from her seat.

Circulation.

If she stopped even for a moment, she would be sucked back into the endless abyss, so she continuously spread the malevolent emotions rising in her heart.

*Pop.*

Picking up the pacifier that had fallen to the floor and putting it back in her mouth, Zulu surveyed the scene of Zion.

Most of the equipment had been destroyed in the battle with Kali, but there were countless metagates.

Grasping one of them, Zulu checked the time.

Perhaps it was already too late.

Had Etela, who went to find the disc, and Armin's group, who needed to extract coordinates to return from Ingris, completed their missions?

Since she wouldn't know until she went to see, she hurriedly began walking toward the surface.

"......"

But just before leaving Zion, she stopped.

It would be right to assume it was already too late.

For certain missions, it was sometimes better to prepare for the worst-case scenario rather than rely on small possibilities.

Zulu looked down at the metagate in her hand for a moment, then turned back toward Zion.

It was time to make a choice.

Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara Thunder Strike.

The endless barrage of strikes represented a thousand arms to drive away the world's evil, and the final Thunder Palm was a single moment of enlightenment that destroys demons.

That would be the secret technique of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist, the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara Thunder Strike, but the more Etela struck Satan, the more doubt accumulated in her heart.

"Heuuuuu!"

A groan leaked through Etela's tightly clenched teeth.

How could this be possible?

No matter how much wave energy she pushed in, as Satan's body grew larger, no interference was occurring.

'Just a little, just a little more!'

Theoretically, the Yin-Yang Wave Fist could destroy any object from within.

But it couldn't really be considered an efficient martial art against humans.

There was no need to cause internal destruction against humans whose skin was soft.

Therefore, it was a technique solely for destroying evil.

If it didn't work against Satan, who could be called the symbol of evil, it felt like even the beliefs of the Karsys Order would be broken, so she was putting all her strength into the continuous strikes.

"Kuuuuu!"

As the speed of striking the hard muscles increased, finally a look of shock began to appear on Satan's face.

'Almost there. If I can just push it to the point where I can unleash the Thunder Palm...'

"Kekeke. Kekekekeke."

The sound of Satan's laughter reached Etela's ears as she found a glimmer of hope.

Without looking up, she could tell what his laughter meant.

Satan's body began to grow rapidly again, and the ripples she had desperately driven in were growing faint.

"It has tilted perfectly."

Satan spread both arms wide and leaned back his upper body as if there was nothing left to fear.

It was a gesture saying to hit him as much as she wanted.

'A tremendous force is surging in.'

With Kariel's annihilation in Arabot, only 4 archangels remained.

And the Garas were still humiliating the angels and reducing their numbers.

As the scales of law tilted toward Satan for the first time, his body began to grow endlessly without knowing limits.

"Ooooh! Ooooh!"

Before the vigorously growing body of evil, Etela shed tears.

"Why, whyyyy!"

Since joining the Karsys Order, she had fought countless evils.

But she had never felt as miserable as she did now.

"Ah, it feels good. More, strike me more. Entertain me more."

Satan grew without end.

At 20 meters, 30 meters, 50 meters, over 100 meters in height, even the surrounding buildings collapsed.

"Kekeke, pitiful human."

*Thud thud thud thud thud!*

Etela didn't stop attacking.

In the feeling of her lifelong beliefs crumbling all at once, what supported her was the voice of the master who had taught her the true meaning of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist.

Etela, you must believe. You must believe that good exists.

Swordsmanship.

The art of handling a sword.

If swinging a sword at a scarecrow, one simple motion would suffice.

But swordsmanship is a game of tag played with lives at stake.

And from that point, the situation becomes serious.

Compatibility of movements, compatibility of trajectories, compatibility of judgmentsâ€”countless compatibilities interlock to produce the result just ahead, and that result becomes the cause of new judgments, writhing to bite the opponent.

The duel between Kuan and Nameless created the feeling of serpents of killing intent freely writhing and moving to bite each other's necks.

Nameless was near perfect, and Kuan was unstable.

The two sword paths heading toward opposite extremes awakened an existence that had remained outside their thoughts, and the higher the level became.

I am getting stronger.

In a realm where life was ignored and only thought mattered, Kuan expressed chaos with his entire body.

Like staggering on a ship caught in a storm, whenever his legs tangled and his upper body swayed, Nameless's sword wavered.

He was playing with the sword.

As new patterns endlessly seeped into his body, Kuan's thoughts became simpler instead.

It was a journey approaching the essence of the sword, and a necessity that didn't even need confirmation because it was approaching truth.

'Too easy. Was the sword... always this easy?'

Kuan's sword pierced Nameless's blind spot with chilling sharpness.

As wounds increased all over his body without exception, Nameless finally realized.

'It's regrettable that I must die.'

Truly.

'It's resentful to disappear without conveying anything about this wonderful world.'

Kuan, who had slashed past Nameless's waist, spun his body like a top and circled to the enemy's rear.

Nameless hurriedly turned around, but Kuan's figure was already nowhere to be found.

'Keke, I knew it. There's no way he'd be there.'

A human born without even being given a name, fighting for the first and last time.

Could there be a swordsman stronger than this man in the world?

Nameless hoped Kuan would become the strongest swordsman.

Otherwise, his talent being buried here would be too unfair.

'No, that's not it.'

Nameless searched in all directions for Kuan, but couldn't even see his afterimage, as if he had vanished.

'But you're watching me, aren't you?'

He wouldn't live even a day, but it had been a wonderful life.

'Because I met you.'

Nameless slowly lowered his sword.

Movement zero.

No matter where he turned his gaze, he ultimately wouldn't be able to find Kuan, so further movement was meaningless.

"Because there are two, it is infinite."

*Slash!*

With a refreshing sound, Nameless's head fell off cleanly from behind.

Kuan, who had struck diagonally upward with his sword parallel to the ground, rotated as if gathering the remaining external force's inertia as soon as he stepped on solid ground.

*Tok tok, roll roll.*

Only after the rotation stopped did Nameless's head roll on the ground, while blood spurted like a fountain from the still-standing body.

"Right."

Kuan muttered with indifferent eyes.

"Because there are two, it is infinite."

When one perfect being meets another, the future opens and all possibilities spread infinitely.

That is swordsmanship and the principle of the world.

Blood burst from Kuan's shoulder where his arm had been severed.

It was a fight where he had pushed himself to the absolute limit, and he could no longer maintain his schema.

"Oh no!"

Armin kicked off the ground and ran.

But Shiina arrived first and caught Kuan's falling upper body with her whole body.

"Kuan! Are you okay? Please stay conscious."

Kuan just wanted to sleep.

But hearing the caller's voice, he lifted his trembling eyelids.

'Women... have such a wonderful fragrance.'

For Kuan, who had lived his entire life smelling only blood and sweat, it was truly a fresh shock.

'But this fragrance isn't mine.'

Right, it was just a fragrance he could smell in exchange for his life.

"I'm fine. Please go to Ingris."

Though there was no word from Etela and Zulu, they needed to extract coordinates according to their original mission to plan for the future.

*Rumble rumble rumble rumble!*

Then the building shook as if an earthquake had occurred.

"What's that?"

Armin looked up at the ceiling and shouted in surprise.

"Get away!"

The building was collapsing.

As Shiina struggled to carry Kuan, Armin took both of them and cast flicker magic.

Simultaneously, a huge boulder crashed down where they had been.

*Rumble rumble rumble!*

Having escaped outside the building, Armin realized the identity of the earthquake, and Shiina was also looking up at the sky with an absurd expression.

"What... is that thing?"

A gigantic monster beyond human comprehension was continuing to grow even at this moment.

When the monster bent its waist, its evil face suddenly descended below the clouds.

*Muhahahahahaha!*

Violent laughter that seemed to devour the world erupted from its gaping mouth and shook the ground.

Armin spoke with a serious expression.

"I think we need to go there."

Not only was their way to Ingris blocked by the building's collapse, but looking at the current situation, it wasn't a time to be searching for return coordinates.

"I don't know what that monster is, but something's definitely gone wrong. Etela seems to be there too."

The human fighting the monster could only be seen as a small dot, but Armin with his enhanced vision could see clearly.

While Armin immediately took action, Shiina hesitated and couldn't easily leave.

She couldn't leave Kuan, her life's benefactor, like this.

"Go."

Kuan, looking at the sky with an indifferent expression, said.

"But Kuan, you're currently..."

"Pity is shameful for a swordsman. I won't die, so don't worry."

Though he wasn't confident he could live either.

How could a human who had never died know how much injury it takes to die?

'Shiina...'

Armin was waiting at a distance.

Mission was top priority.

But since he had already abandoned Kuan to save Shiina, he no longer had the right to persuade with such words.

'Right, there's no time.'

Shiina decided to go.

Though her heart overflowed with worry for Kuan, if they didn't solve the problem at hand, all that would remain was total annihilation.

"I'll be back soon."

*You don't need to come back.*

Since it would only be a burden anyway, Kuan swallowed the words that came to his throat.

Then Shiina turned back and asked.

"Until then, you'll stay alive, won't you?"

Kuan didn't feel it was worth answering.

With his whole body mangled, staying alive wasn't something he could do by his own power even if asked.

"If I survive and return, then..."

Shiina pondered her next words for a long time, then said with a slight blush.

"Let's eat together again."

Leaving those words behind, Shiina fled with Armin toward where Satan was.

Even after being left alone, Kuan showed no emotional change and just looked at the sky.

"Pff!"

Then he suddenly burst into laughter.

His wounds throbbed and his face contorted in pain, but his lungs still panted as if itchy.

'Kekeke, what does she want to do with me? Woman, with this body I can't even cut steak anymore.'

Fighting Nameless, Kuan had reached his current level by breaking through odds smaller than a needle's eye.

But as a one-armed, limping man, he felt only shame at the thought of serving as a woman's man.

'Right, it's all over. This place is my grave.'

As a depression deep enough to make him want to let go of everything came over him, the bleeding he had been desperately holding back burst forth again.

*Let's eat together.*

"Hah."

Kuan let out a sigh like a lament.

"Really... driving me crazy."
