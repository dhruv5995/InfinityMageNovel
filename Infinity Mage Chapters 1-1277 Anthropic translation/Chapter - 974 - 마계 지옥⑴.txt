Demon World Hell (1)

As the sea roared while healing its wounds, Shirone gazed toward the horizon.

Countless starlight sparkled at the edge of his vision.

From here they looked like starlight, but if you approached them, they would be massive shockwaves beyond what the eye could measure.

'Ikael is fighting.'

The reason angels are strong is because their source concepts—their abilities—are not bound by purpose.

The Archangel of Destruction simply destroys, and the Archangel of Creation can create anything.

The unlimited expandability of concepts is the angels' strength, but now to Shirone's eyes, which had mastered all things in the universe, their sole limitation was visible.

'The universe.'

Even Uriel cannot destroy what doesn't exist in the universe, and whatever Kariel creates ultimately becomes something that exists within the universe.

But Ikael is different.

Amplification has the potential to transcend the universe, and this was actually proven by Guffin.

The starlight on the horizon suddenly spread like the Milky Way, then at some point became invisible to the eye.

Shortly after, Ikael came flying toward Shirone from the distant sea, cutting through the water's surface.

Her photon body had weakened and fatigue was piled on her face, but her eyes held the satisfaction of one who had made a decision.

"Ah—"

As Ikael spotted Shirone and accelerated further, the sea dozens of meters below split in a V-shape.

Tears of light drew a line across the horizon as they receded, and Ikael embraced Shirone without slowing down.

"Ugh!"

Shirone let out a short scream at the impact-like speed, but in reality no shock was transmitted.

'She's a mother.'

Just before colliding with the sea, Ikael absorbed all the inertia with her own body and stopped.

The real sensation of Shirone felt like it was filling the empty heart that had been hollow all this time, but in that moment, indescribable guilt tormented her.

"I'm sorry."

Those were Ikael's first words.

"It's not your fault."

Though their conversation was still awkward, the emotions in their words were sincere.

"No. I already killed you long ago, and even after regaining my memories, I pretended not to know. I don't qualify as a parent."

Though he thought it was unavoidable, he could understand the guilt she must be feeling.

"But we can't go on like this forever. It's better to let go of the past, isn't it?"

Ikael shook her head firmly.

"There are feelings that can't be let go. For parents, children are like that. Don't mind it. Looking at your face without guilt would be even more terrible."

"Alright."

Shirone, who had been lost in thought, spoke.

"Come here and sit down."

At the unexpected words, Ikael blinked, but thinking even that might cause hurt, she quietly followed Shirone's words.

"Is this okay?"

Shirone looked down at Ikael, who was reverently bowing her head, then raised his hand.

Light soft as smoke flowed along his body, then gathered in his hand and glowed transparently.

'This is my first step.'

As Shirone brought his palm to Ikael's photon body, many thoughts crossed his mind.

'Nane is right.'

In this cold world, we cannot reverse anything and are only endlessly deflecting pain.

That's why Nane wishes for all humans to realize the truth and break the chains of worldly troubles.

'But...'

There was a god with a heart.

A single ray of light, hope, a messiah that this god sent from outside the world after sacrificing himself.

Hexa.

'If that is me.'

While completely denying the cold world, embracing everyone's anger with his heart, he would say this:

"Ikael."

That it can be reversed, that he wants to believe.

"I absolve you of your sins."

Boundless love without conditions, reasons, or basis seeped into Ikael's photon body.

"Ah—"

Ikael's shoulders trembled.

It felt as if the entire universe was assuring her that she was okay, that she was safe from it all.

'I am truly a blessed angel.' To receive the ultimate love of the heart, absolute universal love, not from one but from two people.

"Stand up."

No guilt remained in Ikael's heart after the purification was complete.

That was the heart, but precisely because of that, Ikael felt pity for Shirone instead.

"How can you do that? Without any price, without reason, how can you forgive everything?"

"I don't know."

Shirone spoke honestly.

"Maybe it's because I've become stronger. If so, would it be hypocrisy? Perhaps I'm merely following what Guffin taught me. But it doesn't matter. What's important is that I can do it."

Unlike law, the heart can be reversed, and that's the kind of world Shirone saw.

"As Nane says, reality is painful, and if we had never existed from the beginning, there would be no troubles either... but isn't it also because we existed that we can meet like this?"

"I believe that something insufficient with just the universe closing still remains here."

"I see."

Ikael was convinced.

"What do you want to do? I'll help you. I'll fight for the world Shirone wants."

Since these were her sincere feelings after purification, Shirone no longer hesitated.

"If Nane speaks of how right humans can be, I want to ask him this."

Shirone said, looking up at the sky.

"Do you know how vast the human heart can become?"

---

When Iruki arrived at Bashka, the aftermath of the shock had somewhat subsided and reconstruction had begun.

"Iruki."

Shirone came out to greet him.

It felt strange to see Shirone outside the door when they had been together in the carriage just an hour ago.

"How's the atmosphere?"

"It's calmed down a bit. Neither good nor bad."

Though they had sealed the powerful enemy Imir, two of the Five Great Stars had died and they had lost Valkyrie Corps Commander Garcia.

The two walked toward Creta, the royal castle of Tormia, conversing.

"What about the coalition's casualties?"

"They haven't been officially tallied yet. There should be an announcement from Army Command soon."

When they arrived at the castle where Pony was waiting, Amy and Nade ran over and hugged Iruki.

"Iruki."

In the atmosphere where everyone was comforting each other, Shirone asked Minerva.

"How is the Great Star?"

"She hasn't awakened yet. Naturally. She concentrated all of Gaia's power on five planets. Even if that stopped Imir, it's best not to expect the Great Star's help anymore."

Shirone's face darkened.

"Most of all, the demon world is the problem. We've found most of the corps commanders' locations, but it's not easy."

Minerva immediately caught on.

'I see. Shirone isn't only here.'

Currently, Shirone was struggling hard in various parts of the world that the Twelve Apostles had occupied first.

'What kind of experiences is he having?'

He might be fighting desperately with demon corps commanders, or wiping the tears of a child who lost family.

'Maybe both at once.'

It was impossible without the circuits of thought becoming something that transcends humanity.

If there was such a thing as god, wouldn't that god's brain have a logical structure similar to Shirone's?

Seeing Shirone smile, Minerva looked away as if stung.

"Anyway, that's also why the Great Star came to Bashka. It's no longer safe in the demon world. So she wanted to meet Ryan directly."

"Me?"

Ryan pointed to himself.

"Yes, you. There are still considerable numbers of demon remnants left. Plus the corps commanders who can open the demon world are still intact. It's probably about countermeasures for that."

"Hmm."

As Ryan was thinking about what those countermeasures might be, Gaold suddenly coughed up blood.

"Cough! Cough!"

The blood was only a handful, but it seemed pitiful that there wasn't even any more blood left to cough up.

Minerva, who had been caring for him all this time, looked at Miro and snapped.

"Hey, you take care of him now. I'm sick of it too."

Miro looked at Gaold crouched on the floor continuously coughing up phlegm, then turned away.

"Hmph."

As she walked to a corner and leaned against it as if she didn't want to be involved, Kang Nan's eyes widened.

"That girl, really!"

Sein put his hand on Kang Nan's shoulder.

"Forget it. We'll do it."

As Sein put one of Gaold's arms over his shoulder, Kang Nan came to the other side and helped lift him.

"Get some rest. We'll take you to Zulu's room."

Currently, Zulu was also hovering between life and death after being attacked by Imir.

Dragging his legs as he headed for the door, Gaold didn't lift his head until he left the hall.

Miro watched him go with cold eyes, then spat out irritably once the door closed.

"So disgusting, really."

From the moment she reached the flawless mental state of Thousand-Hand Guanyin, Gaold's pain could no longer shock her.

'It's over now. No matter how much you obsess over me, you'll only be in pain.'

She was simply angry.

"I'm going in to rest too. Let's adjourn for today and talk about details tomorrow."

Even now, various parts of the world were in urgent situations, but no one objected.

'The demon war, Harvitz's assassination, the collapse of the flower garden, the elemental bomb, heaven's army, Imir's sealing...'

It was unbelievable that all of this had happened in just one day.

'I'm tired.'

Everyone's eyes were sunken with exhaustion.

In an area 21 kilometers north of Bashka, a coalition soldier's corpse stirred.

After the sound of chewing stones, the corpse flipped over and Paimon emerged from underground.

"Gaaahhhhh!"

Mud mixed with mucus spewed endlessly from her throat like a fountain.

"Haah! Haah!"

Shaking her head as she struggled to pull her body out from underground, her face was unrecognizable from its original form. Her eyes were gone, her nose was crushed, and the only functioning organ was her jaw joint.

"Kaak! Kaak!"

Still, being the demons' greatest general, as she shook her head continuously, her body began to emerge.

Her belly, swollen more than 100 times its original size, had dirt streaming down from underneath.

"Good. That's good."

She had moved the farthest using irregular expression teleportation the moment she was directly hit by Shirone's Agape.

Using all her momentum, she had arrived 120 meters underground at this location.

At the moment she was melting in the light, she had instinctively moved to a space where she could avoid the light.

Actually, she didn't remember it well.

"Damn Yahweh!"

If demons also came from human hearts, then Shirone's universal love had the power to purify the demons' characteristic extreme emotions into the most stable state.

'It's definitely lethal.'

She was left with only her torso, no limbs, and her belly was about to burst from eating so much dirt.

"Gueek! Gueek!"

She vomited dirt several times, but it seemed it would be easier to just tear open her belly skin and remove it.

"Hehe."

As things became slightly more bearable, Paimon laughed maniacally at the night sky.

She had survived, after all.

"I won! Yahweh!"

Though there was a hitch in the plan, the corps commanders scattered across the continents would soon open the demon world.

"We won."

Her body began to rot and transform into a massive pathogen.

The disease that started here would flow southwest on the wind and eventually infect the entire world.

"Satan."

She spoke quietly as she squinted at the moonlight through her thick, melting eyelids.

"Lead the entire world to despair."

Paimon's corpse scattered like smoke and became a formless death god flying toward Bashka.

The name of the disease was Emotional Disease (or Emotion Scale).

It was an unprecedented disaster that acted on specific states of the brain to cause terrible tragedies.
