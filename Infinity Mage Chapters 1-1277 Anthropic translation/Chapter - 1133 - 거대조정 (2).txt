Giant Manipulation (2)

Shirone, who had been staring down the corridor where Flu had left, turned around at the precise moment.

"We need to talk."

Rufist sensed that the time had come.

'I can't keep deceiving him forever.'

He had hoped it wouldn't come to this until the end, but if asked, he had no choice but to tell the truth given their alliance.

"Alright."

When they entered the conference room in the Tormia district, Albino was already waiting there.

"What are you hiding from me?" Rufist let out a sigh.

"Right. It was a hastily made decision. We're planning to use Flu in a honey trap operation."

"Did she agree to it too?"

"Of course. No matter how much she's a subordinate, I wouldn't force someone to do this kind of work by ignoring her opinion."

Shirone knew Flu.

"It wasn't something she had no choice but to do, was it? In any case, this method isn't what I want."

"It's too late. She's already gone in. You saw it yourself."

"We can reverse it."

"This is a national-level strategy."

"But it's a strategy that wasn't discussed with me. If it's going to be like this, I can't help Tormia."

Even Rufist, who prided himself on being the most cold-headed person in the Magic Association, couldn't ignore this statement.

"Are you threatening me?"

"No. It's simply the truth. I can't pursue Ultima with something that isn't sincere."

"Fine. Then we have no choice but to give up on you too."

Rufist played his trump card.

"I'll bring Flu back."

"Why would you? Flu is my employee. You can't interfere with her anymore."

"I'm doing what I believe is right. I've always done so, and I always will."

Rufist slammed the table with a bang.

"What the hell is the problem!"

"Take cover. Take cover."

As voices rose, Albino, who had been at the table, quietly moved to sit on the sofa.

"You know where we are! Other countries are doing far worse things than this! Are you saying we should fight fair and square against such bastards! Do you still think you're a magic school student! Are you in Class 3 of the first year?"

Shirone closed his mouth.

"Listen carefully. The reason we're sitting in these positions is because we've only chosen to do the jobs others don't want to do. Of course, there might be noble things like effort and training in there too. But do you think that's everything? Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty to win. To solve problems."

"Class 3 of the first year."

Albino's gaze turned toward Shirone.

"The people who dreamed of ideals in their childhood, who believed they could change something and worked hard for it, are now sitting in this place."

In Shirone's mind, the years he had lived flashed by like a revolving lantern.

The librarian of the Ogent family, Class Seven, Five, Four of magic school, all the way to the graduation class.

Looking back, he thought he was truly young then, but they were years he wasn't ashamed of.

'I fought with everything I had.'

Even if it seemed like child's play, even if it made adults angry, it was because he believed it was right.

'I had the courage to do so.'

Now had everyone become so frightened, so pale with terror before the monster called the world, that they had forgotten?

'Everyone dreamed.'

Where had those giant children gone, who could easily brush away the tempting hands extended by monsters?

"If even 1 percent of them had kept their beliefs, the world wouldn't have become like this."

"Right. The fact that there isn't that 1 percent—that's reality. Everyone hopes it will be that way, but they don't want to be that 1 percent themselves. That's the world we live in. You know it too. You're not a child anymore, so don't act childish."

"Childish?"

Shirone's eyebrows twitched.

"Since when did the values humans must protect until the end become childish? Is making a subordinate do such things not childish, so it's cool?"

"Not everyone is like you. Do you look down on me? I've also given up personal advancement to work for the country. So has Flu."

"That's why I'm saying I'll do it! Whatever sacrifice it takes, the integrated mental system...!"

"How could you possibly do that!" When Rufist voiced what he had kept in his heart, Shirone was shocked.

"You... never believed in it from the beginning?"

"Hah."

Rufist, who had stood up gripping the desk, lowered his head.

"Shirone, humans aren't great. Resources are limited and we're still immature at handling desires. We've only become slightly more civilized from hunting and gathering, but we're still the same primitives chasing money."

He stared at Shirone.

"Do I not trust you? No, I trust you. You're humanity's strongest mage. If we were going to war, I would have bet not only my life but all of Tormia's citizens on you. But not the integrated mental system. What I don't trust isn't Yahweh, but humans."

Shirone's lips trembled.

"You don't want to hurt Flu, right? Then bring me a solution. Not pie-in-the-sky talk, but a clear solution. Doing your best isn't enough."

Rufist pointed to the table.

"Look at reality. What happened to Ymir's Ultima, our only hope? The simultaneous events have been cut off too. That means you couldn't solve it. Because you couldn't solve it, I'm trying to solve it."

Shirone gritted his teeth.

"There are two things you can choose. Either create something more here, or give up. Flu will be fine for now. I'll give you one day."

Shirone turned around without answering.

After he left and the door closed, Rufist, whose strength left his legs, collapsed into his chair.

"Whew."

Albino finally spoke.

"You got unusually excited. Against a kid, no less. There are plenty of ways to coax him, aren't there?"

"Because he's not a kid."

Rufist drummed on the desk.

"He definitely knows. He's someone who directly experienced all of humanity's history through Omega. He probably knows human nature better than I do."

"Hmm."

"And yet he wants to fight for humanity. That contradiction creates conflict. It makes me think that maybe what that guy is saying is actually right."

"It is unique. For someone who has reached the top of the world to sacrifice everything—it's something humans can't do."

"Exactly."

That's what made it even more regrettable.

"Of course, my thoughts haven't changed. If Tormia can become a leading nation, I'll do anything. The problem is... he always asks questions at the end."

"Truly vexing questions."

"Yes. Perhaps..."

Rufist looked out the window.

"The existence called Shirone might be the last chance given to us humans."

Shirone, who had come out of the conference room, stood motionless with a blank expression for a while.

'What more am I supposed to do here?'

Even mobilizing all the capabilities he possessed, it felt like the world wouldn't budge an inch.

"Ah, damn..."

He wiped away tears with his arm, but the sorrowful feeling wouldn't go away.

'Why doesn't it work?'

Could methods that would make everyone happy simply not exist in this world?

'There must be some.'

Shirone started walking.

'There's no time to be frustrated. Let me think. More things, more sacrifice, more responsibility...'

Hot tears blurred his vision.

Travis, who had hidden the enormous sum of 1 million gold at home, headed to his establishment.

"Heh heh. Heh heh heh."

His laughter wouldn't stop.

'Now my life is finally blooming too. I can live without envying nobles. Got that, you bastards?'

He couldn't forget his wife's face—her heart seeming to stop the moment he opened the bag of gold coins.

His son had jumped around excitedly, and Travis had even promised to send him to school when they moved.

'Right, I'll do it. I can do it all.'

Travis couldn't yet imagine how heavy a shackle that would be.

As he entered the narrow street of Edia District 2, he saw the quiet scenery of the red-light district during the day.

"Kyaah!"

A woman's scream.

"What?"

It was a common occurrence so he didn't pay attention, but listening again, it was from his establishment.

"Yeah! Hit me! If you have money, hit me!"

"Isn't that Candy's voice?"

Realizing that the voice's owner was at his establishment, Travis quickly rushed over.

Entering the shop, he found a man in his thirties, drunk in broad daylight, grabbing Candy by the hair.

"This crazy bastard...!"

With killing intent in his eyes, Travis grabbed the thin man's wrist and pulled him.

"Let go! Let go!"

The moment the man fell to his knees, a pot-lid-sized palm mercilessly struck his cheek.

"Hey, you bastard! Is this the Colosseum? Why are you beating people up and causing trouble! Do you want to die?"

Candy pulled Travis back.

"Bro! Don't! What if you go to prison again!"

"It's fine. If I go, so be it."

The man clutched his painful wrist and shouted.

"What's it to you! We're lovers! Candy is the one who betrayed me!"

"Oh, really?"

As he raised his fist instead of his palm this time, Candy hurriedly pushed the man away.

"Just go for now! You'll really die at this rate!"

The gang member who came running after hearing the commotion grabbed the man's arms and dragged him out.

When the situation was resolved, Travis asked.

"Hey. What's with that bastard? Is he really your guy?"

"No!"

Candy, with a thin cigarette in her mouth, blew out smoke in a long stream.

"He's just a customer. Says he's a ruined noble, and I felt so sorry for him that I gave him credit once."

"Credit? We don't do that."

"I paid from my own money. Day by day his drinking got worse, and now he's throwing tantrums about getting married."

"Crazy bastard."

Looking around the alley, Travis said.

"Hey, you're a problem too. Whether that guy is ruined or not, what's it to you? Mind your own life."

"Ah, forget it. I don't want to talk about it anymore."

Candy, taking another drag of her cigarette, muttered.

"He wouldn't... commit suicide over something like this, would he?"

"Hah."

Actually, it wasn't incomprehensible.

How many opportunities did someone working in a place like this have to show compassion for someone?

'Tsk tsk, pitiful things.'

Taking Candy's cigarette and putting it in his mouth, he gestured.

"Hey, everyone gather around."

With all the working women and gang members assembled, he pulled out a heavy pouch.

"Take this. Share it fairly among yourselves."

The thudding sound was unusual, but people thought it was silver coins at most.

"What? Bro, are you doing some other work?"

The moment Candy opened the pouch, everyone there widened their eyes.

"Gasp!"

The brilliant gleam of gold coins.

"Boss, what is this? These are large gold coins!"

Candy quickly overturned the pouch and laid out all the gold coins on the table.

"How much is this? Bro! Explain this."

"Puhahaha! What, surprised? Did you really think this bear would rot in a place like this forever?"

"Bro! You made it!"

Having already seen the money, the reason didn't matter anymore.

"Right. We're going legitimate too. Candy, you said you wanted to be a singer, right? Do it! Your brother will back you up."

"Boss! Congratulations!"

When the gang members formally bowed their heads, Travis's neck became even stiffer.

Even the always honest bear's mouth stretched to his ears, and the weasel who had only schemed betrayals had gleaming eyes.

Whatever else, these were the only people who had followed him for 20 years.

"Bro! You're the best!"

The women, suddenly faced with big money, rushed over and embraced the bear.

'Money really is good.'

Just spending 1 percent of the fortune he received from Mayron could get him this kind of treatment.

A hot fire blazed in his chest.

'I won't stop here. Higher, I'll climb all the way to the top of the sky.'

He was being roasted golden brown.
