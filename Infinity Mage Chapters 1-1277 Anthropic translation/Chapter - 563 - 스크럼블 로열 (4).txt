[563] Scramble Royal (4)

After recruiting Caiden, Hersy didn't return to her room but left the dormitory instead.

She had caught the sound of someone's heartbeat watching her from a certain distance.

Only after entering a quiet park did Hersy stop walking.

Judging by the heartbeat, it was more likely to be a woman than a man.

"Come out now. Who are you?"

A girl revealed herself from behind a tree trunk.

"Oh?"

It was an unexpected person.

"Eden..."

A devout follower of the Yore religion and a specialist in defensive magic.

As far as Hersy knew, she wasn't affiliated with any research society, making her an unlikely figure for the preliminary battles of Scramble Royal.

"What business do you have tailing me in the dead of night... or rather, calling me out?"

Eden also knew that tailing Hersy was impossible.

"Let me participate in Scramble Royal."

"The bigger the alliance, the more advantageous it is. But you're not from an underground research society, are you?"

"I'll create one. Once I claim Estas."

'So it's the upper echelons after all?'

Hersy's guess was half correct.

The reason Eden, a follower of the Yore religion, came to the magic school was solely because of Mikea Gaold.

He was once the president of the Tormia Magic Association, and even now was invariably mentioned among the kingdom's most powerful mages.

But he was a heretic who had betrayed the Yore religion and abandoned God.

'I cannot tolerate this.'

Being from the same church background as Gaold, she recalled what Yora had told her before the second-semester senior schedule began.

"You must not hate Gaold. He is a pitiful child."

Hearing protection for a heretic from the Yora she respected, Eden trembled with displeasure.

"Why do you say such things? He is one who abandoned the god Yore. Isn't he a monster who worships violence and has committed countless murders?"

"Yes, he is a monster. But it wasn't he who made himself into a monster. He did his best."

"No. That itself is proof of insufficient faith. No matter what pain comes, the god Yore is protecting us."

The reason Eden was recognized enough to be called a priest of God even within the worldwide Yore religious order wasn't simply because she blindly followed God.

Rather, she had an extremely rational personality, understood the conflicts between reality and doctrine, and possessed an open mind that could accept human desires and limitations.

The combination of faith and logic could not be destroyed by anything, which is why there was no way to persuade Eden.

"Yora has illusions about Gaold's strength. If he were merely an insignificant destroyer, would she still protect him now? I know what pain he went through to reach that position. I also know he's someone who surpassed human limits. But in the end, he's just a heretic. I cannot tolerate the existence of forces protecting a murderer in this sanctuary ruled by the god Yore."

"I also think Gaold's decision is regrettable. But he is being punished. And he will continue to be."

"Punishment?"

Eden looked back at Yora with a sneer.

"Yora, do you consider me weaker than Gaold?"

Yora didn't answer.

"I'm not talking about being the greatest combat mage or anything like that. I have no interest in such barbaric titles. But I am stronger than Gaold. A heretic is ultimately just a heretic."

Eden said with intensity in her eyes.

"As long as the god Yore is watching, I have no enemies."

Eden's eyes, freed from the recollection, were more intense than ever.

'I'll shatter your legend that started from Estas.'

Hearing Eden's roughly beating heart, Hersy smiled and said:

"Good. I'll report to the boss for now. You can expect good news."

Hersy patted Eden on the shoulder and disappeared into the darkness.

The first holiday since the semester began.

Shirone, Iruki, and Nade gathered at the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society for a reunion party.

Though it was just snacks and drinks, they lost track of time chatting after so long.

"The problem is always group evaluations. Especially strategy and tactics. With three absences, the last group has to do it with just two people."

With only 27 total members, the 6th and final group had to exterminate monsters in the 2000th level with just 2 people.

Of course, difficulty was adjusted according to the number of participants, but the synergistic effects of five people's firepower couldn't be expected.

To Nade's complaints, Iruki said pointedly:

"That's why everyone's trying to raise their rankings. You should hurry up and climb too. If you just beat Binder and Fisho, you could make it to the 5th group."

"Sigh. The thing is, the score gap has gotten too wide..."

Just then, the research society vibrated as Estas began operating.

"What? A teacher? But today's a holiday."

Unlike Shirone, who was looking around, Nade's expression had already turned serious.

"What had to come has come. Let's prepare ourselves."

The mechanical devices stopped operating, and Shirone's group moved to positions to receive their guests.

A familiar voice was heard from outside the door.

"Underground research society."

"Come in."

Examining the faces of those entering through the open door, Shirone blinked.

Most were strong contenders ranked first for graduation.

Hersy, who entered with her hands behind her back, turned her body at a right angle and declared:

"I propose Scramble Royal."

Nade, slumped into the sofa, rested his chin in his hand at an angle and looked at those standing in a row.

Six people total: 3rd-ranked graduate Prinz, 7th-ranked Caiden, 9th-ranked Anchal, 10th-ranked Eden, 13th-ranked Hersy, and 25th-ranked Fisho.

It was a situation where representatives of underground research societies had gathered in one place.

'Now it's war.'

Scramble Royal.

A comprehensive set of rules where opponents stake conditions and compete, with the winner taking everything.

Beyond personal stakes, it could affect even graduation exams - an absolute rule that took precedence over school regulations for underground research societies.

With a table between them, the three members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society faced the six-member underground research society alliance.

Though Shirone wasn't familiar with underground rules, he could sense the atmosphere was completely different from graduate evaluations.

This was something teachers and school authority couldn't interfere with - purely their own affair.

"Introductions aren't really necessary. We all know each other."

Hersy, attending as the Gold Ring's representative, continued:

"Of course, you already know why we're here."

Nade arrogantly crossed his legs and said:

"Indeed. Then we just need to decide the schedule and rules."

'Schedule? Rules?'

Though everything was still unfamiliar, Shirone just listened.

With a thud, Hersy set down an iron box.

Though he'd never seen the object before, it looked familiar because it bore Henna's symbol that he'd seen in heaven.

"Scramble Royal with 30 years of tradition. Shall we begin?"

Thirty years meant it was from before Miro's time of activity.

When Shirone glanced around nervously, Nade explained:

"This is a tool called a 'Judge.' You establish rules through mutual agreement and input them into the Judge, which then provides rewards to winners and makes losers pay the price. Since it can also set rules for contract violations, it's the optimal tool for staking something and competing."

Hersy added:

"Any rules are possible under mutual agreement. If you set a rule like 'death upon failure to fulfill the contract,' you'll actually die."

'Extra-regulatory formula.'

That was the first term that came to Shirone's mind.

He also thought it was ancient equipment from heaven.

The reason expressions like "weapon" or "armament" didn't seem fitting was because he'd seen heaven's way of life with his own eyes.

Though it was a dangerous device that could cost lives if mishandled, considering the otherworldly scale, he thought it might have been a recreational tool for angels or fairies.

"The game will naturally be 'Black and White,' right?"

"It hasn't changed in 30 years. Having a manual makes it convenient to jump straight into competition."

Though curious about what kind of game it was, asking right away might show weakness to the enemy.

"The alliance side has 6 participants as you can see. Match your numbers. If you want to do it with three, we won't stop you."

The number of participants could also be decided by mutual agreement.

"Hmm."

Even Nade, who had boasted about being a small elite group, was cautious this time.

Though he didn't want to involve non-research society members if possible, the alliance members were too formidable.

'We definitely need allies.'

Not only Hersy, Anchal, and Prinz, but even insect magic's Fisho and defensive magic's Eden contributed to perfect balance.

'And Caiden too... Huh? Caiden?'

Nade's eyebrows rose.

"Wait. What's going on here? Why are two people from Gold Ring participating as representatives?"

Setting such rules was fine, but he had no intention of agreeing to it.

"Don't misunderstand. Caiden isn't here as Gold Ring's representative."

"What do you mean? Then..."

Nade realized something and stared blankly at Caiden.

"Don't tell me you're..."

"That's right. I'm the president of the Female Body Research Society."

At Caiden's shocking declaration - him being the most honest among Fermi's group - Shirone gaped in bewilderment.

"You're the president of the Female Body Research Society?"

Caiden nodded as if he had nothing to hide.

"I've drawn quite a lot of Amy's nudes too."

At the immediate provocation, Shirone frowned.

'Why bring that up all of a sudden...?'

Maya's drawing from the red book suddenly came to mind, and Iruki, thinking the same thing, said:

"Indeed, you can't judge people by appearances alone. Is the reason you're participating despite risking exposure jealousy? Or are you going to stake a rule telling Shirone to give up Maya?"

"Don't reduce it to such cheap emotions."

Caiden leaned forward and glared.

"What moves me is anger. Shirone, I'll give you the greatest pain."

Though the words carried killing intent, Shirone no longer backed down.

"Come at me all you want. As I said before, I'll show no mercy to enemies who interfere with me."

As the atmosphere intensified, Anchal stepped forward.

"We'll give you a week. Gather your people during that time. We'll decide detailed rules then."

Iruki objected:

"No, there's something we want to discuss first. Since we need to recruit allies who'll also need compensation, we need to establish the general framework."

Anchal had expected they wouldn't just let things slide, given this was graduate-level now.

"Fine, speak."

"First, what the alliance wants is for us to give up the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society if you win, right?"

"To be precise, giving up Estas. We don't care what happens to the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society."

"Well, fine. We'll accept that for now. But there's something we'd like to propose."

Iruki made eye contact with his friends and presented their compensation:

"If we win, all alliance team members will be positioned at lower rankings than our team until graduation exams."

The alliance's expressions hardened while Shirone's eyes lit up.

'I see. This is absolutely necessary.'

To match the enemy's level, allies would need to be at least graduate-level, but none were related to underground research societies.

No one would get involved in Scramble Royal to the point of disrupting their graduate schedule.

But if they could achieve higher rankings than those positioned throughout Class One, it would provide clear motivation.

"Hmm, rankings..."

As Hersy seemed to deliberate, Nade smiled and said:

"Don't pretend to hesitate. I don't think you, who haven't even graduated because of Estas, would waver over mere rankings. You've just easily obtained what should be the most difficult item to negotiate."

Hersy had also thought negotiating compensation for giving up Estas would be the biggest hurdle.

'That's true. It even feels like we gave in too easily. No, I should see it as recruiting allies being that difficult. In any case, they're not thinking about losing even a little.'

The alliance side felt the same way.

"Fine, I'm in favor. Other representatives, please speak up."

Anchal immediately said:

"I don't mind either."

Caiden didn't need to be asked, and when the remaining members agreed, only then did Nade feel regretful.

'Hmm, did we concede too much? Well, Fisho's ranking is low anyway. Still, just bringing down Prinz and Caiden would achieve our desired results.'

Hersy picked up the Judge and stood up.

"Then recruit three more people. Let's enter detailed negotiations in a week."

"Right. You won't get far."

Nade didn't lift a finger to see them off.
