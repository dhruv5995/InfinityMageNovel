Face to Face (1)

Non-regulation Triangle Field.

Tanote, born from the vertices of a triangle, is a mid-tier spirit belonging to the geometric class among the 72 ranks of fairy hierarchy, governing forms created by connecting three points with straight lines.

The law contained within triangles is 'primordial confinement', and even ancient humans trapped countless concepts within this form - arrows (penetration), pottery (storage), blades (cutting), and so forth.

At a slightly higher dimension, there were triangular horns containing Mara's spirit, and at the highest level was the Trinity representing 'reality'.

"Hohoho! How unfortunate! I don't know what you dropped, but the Archangel commanded that it must be retrieved!"

Of course, what Tanote manipulates isn't high-dimensional spirit, but merely the triangular form itself.

Nevertheless, as the Triangle Fields layered multiple times, Nade couldn't move his arms and legs.

"Damn it!"

Tanote moved around Nade, marking three points, and each time red lines activated, the binding force grew tremendously stronger.

'This ability becomes more disadvantageous over time. I need to deal with it as quickly as possible.'

After his muscles, even his senses were becoming paralyzed.

Looking down with his gaze - the only thing he could still control - the elemental bomb had shrunk to a dot-like size.

'Iruki.'

Honestly, he knew.

Even if the elemental bomb detonated safely, that guy wasn't someone who could breathe and continue living.

'That's why I can die too.'

As a desperation transcending life seized his entire body, electric current flowed through Nade's flesh.

"Grraaaah!"

As electrical signals accompanied by pain flowed through him, his paralyzed senses became vividly clear.

"H-how?"

Tanote's face, who had been continuously generating Triangle Fields, turned pale.

'Avatar?'

A phenomenon corresponding to the number 4 in law, not contained within the Trinity.

As Nade gritted his teeth, hundreds of red lines spread around him began snapping one by one.

'Sorry, Liz.'

In many ways.

'I'm leaving after only telling you lies.'

Magical Assimilation.

Thunder God Reincarnation.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

As Nade let out a beastly roar, feeling his reason flying away, the Triangle Field was destroyed.

Then an avatar made of electricity writhed and surged from Nade's body.

Tanote screamed in terror.

"KYAAAAAAAH!"

The form of the thunder god that completely filled his vision was so vicious and sharp it wounded his retinas.

As the massive face woven from electricity resembling Nade approached, Tanote's screams abruptly stopped.

"Urk...! Urk...!"

Shock-induced hiccups emerged.

Though the thunder god held not a trace of killing intent, the reason he was certain he would die was...

'Nature. It's nature's avatar.'

Because he felt the temperament that only supreme fairies could possess - the law of pure emotion.

The thoughts in Nade's head exploded as a roar throughout the thunder god's entire body.

Foolish brat.

"Hii-ik!"

Nade's face, retaining a trace of reason, contorted like a monster.

It's not such a trivial object that you can touch it without even knowing what it is.

It was a bomb containing all of Iruki's and humanity's hopes.

"Huk, huu-uk."

Tanote's small face became covered in tears, and both legs trembled violently.

Even so, his pride in receiving orders from the great Archangel Ikael wouldn't break.

"Shut up! I'm following the Archangel's command...! Gack!"

As the thunder god's grasp seized Tanote, his small body made a thud sound and burned up.

"Hrrrrr!"

As Nade turned his electricity-filled eyes toward the ground, the thunder god roared while enlarging its bulk.

KWARRRRRRRUNG!

Creating thunder sounds rivaling those of Paecheonhwang, the fairies chasing the bomb looked up at the sky.

"Ah..."

What their clear pupils captured last was the charge of sharp, massive lightning.

PASSSSSSS!

The moment the thunder god passed, all the fairies disappeared, turning to ash like a swarm of gnats being burned.

"Haa! Haa!"

Nade, who had caught up to gravitational acceleration with electrical speed, embraced the bomb with his body.

Even with the aftershock of magical assimilation remaining, his two eyes clearly confirmed the timer.

'11 seconds.'

A smile of relief formed.

'It's over.'

With the final 10 seconds of life remaining, good memories flashed through Nade's mind.

'It's not an auditory hallucination.'

Iruki's pupils, though filled with terror, contained an even stronger yearning as he gazed at the door.

Though it was certainly locked and he possessed the key, the lock had opened as if by magic.

In truth, it was a door anyone could open if they set their mind to it.

However, there was only one person with the courage and qualification to enter without receiving Iruki's permission.

No, he couldn't be certain of even that, but if he absolutely had to name one person...

"Shirone."

Outside the wide-open door, Shirone stood there.

"You, how are you here..."

The commanders weren't visible from Iruki's position, and Dorothy was watching Shirone's reactions with a pitiful expression.

"I heard the story."

As Shirone took his first step into the room, Iruki's shoulders flinched as if terrified.

"You made an elemental bomb. You succeeded."

"...Go back."

Iruki couldn't bring himself to make eye contact.

"I don't want comfort, refutation, or encouragement. This is something I chose. I'll take full responsibility for everything myself."

"The elemental bomb operation is a good strategy. With this, we'll be able to annihilate many demons."

Only then did Iruki look at Shirone.

"You agree with my thinking?"

A smile spread across Shirone's lips.

"Iruki, no one can oppose it. If not you, who could have shouldered this burden? That's why you're the only one qualified to choose. Even if I were Yahweh, the Infinite Wizard, or one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower."

While the commanders wore dazed expressions, Shirone knelt on one knee before Iruki.

"I won't make any judgment about what you've chosen. The reason I came here is simply..."

Shirone's hand touched Iruki's shoulder.

"I came to keep a promise as a friend."

Dorothy muttered.

"A promise?"

On the other hand, Iruki...

"Ah..."

Recalling some memory, his chin trembled.

"...Promise."

Shirone nodded.

"Yes, that promise. When your thoughts cause terrible tragedy, when your brain devours you..."

Tears flowed down Iruki's cheeks.

"To stop me. You, you asked me to stop you..."

At that moment, from deep within his brain, from where piles of informational scrap had accumulated, a small Iruki emerged.

With a terrified expression as if stranded at sea, he reached out his hand and shouted.

Save me.

"I'll take responsibility."

Shirone answered the voice of the heart.

"Everything you've had to bear until now, I'll take full responsibility for it all. So..."

Looking at Iruki, who had become pain itself, Shirone's voice trembled.

"So now, please come back."

Iruki made a pained crying sound as if struck somewhere and hung his head.

Embracing his convulsing body, Iruki revealed his true feelings for the first time.

"I'm scared. I'm scared to death."

"It's okay now."

Stroking the back of his friend who had withered thin like a dead branch, Shirone put strength in his eyes.

"Because I'm not afraid."

As Iruki slowly nodded, Dorothy ran over and threw herself at him.

"Iruki! Are you okay?"

Having entrusted his friend to his lover, Shirone slowly stood up as Dorothy looked back.

"Thank you, Shirone."

Though she had ended up dumping all the burden on Shirone, honestly, she couldn't bear it any longer.

Iruki's head snapped up.

"What are you going to do?"

Just from setting down humanity's weight, the brilliance was returning to his eyes.

"Bashuka is too far. What time is it now? Right."

A Servant doesn't need to check a clock.

"It's already too late. By now, it would be more than enough time for Nade to have dropped the elemental bomb."

"Don't worry."

Shirone put his hands behind his back and looked out the window.

"My heart is already there."

Time remaining until explosion: 10 seconds.

Paimon, heading toward the sky, mocked Miro's group following in pursuit.

"Kekekeke! Try chasing me, humans!"

The elemental bomb was still high in the sky, but considering its falling speed, they would encounter it soon.

'Most spectacularly!'

Meanwhile, the fairy unit that had been defeated by Nade also arrived at Heaven's main army base.

"We apologize. We failed to stop it."

Instead of showing emotion, Ikael observed the bomb falling at a terrifying speed.

'It's definitely a human firepower weapon.'

Even Vulcan couldn't imagine its power, but an angel's scale transcended humans.

'Judging by the ground situation, it's not just some trivial firecracker.'

Since giants had also entered the human city, he wanted to retrieve the bomb if possible.

'There's sufficient time.'

If it's the Archangel of Light.

"Rayel."

Just as Ikael was about to give orders, Nane spoke.

"It's fine."

Nane seemed uninterested in the bomb, observing the humans screaming in Bashuka's chaos.

"I want to watch. This place will be safe."

Though it could be called Buddha's arrogance, because what he possessed was perfect, they had no choice but to follow.

"Understood."

Nade, clinging to the bomb falling at tremendous speed, felt dizzy.

'8 seconds! 7 seconds!'

Then Paimon and Miro's group, rapidly ascending from the ground, caught his eye.

'What?'

The first to catch his attention was Amy.

'Why are you in Bashuka?'

There was nothing that could be done now, and at that point, Nade fell from the bomb.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

5 seconds.

'Fine, let's die! Let's all die together!'

4 seconds.

He just felt frustrated, and beyond that frustration, a sense of futility rushed from somewhere distant.

3 seconds.

"Satan."

Paimon spread both arms toward the bomb.

"Hell on earth!"

2 seconds.

As the demon realm showed signs of opening, her skin began bubbling and boiling.

"Taste it to your heart's content! This is exactly!"

1 second.

"The worst disease I've created...!"

At that moment, brilliant golden smoke enveloped the bomb, and Paimon's eyes shook with shock.

0 seconds.

'Miracle Stream!'

Had it exploded as intended, the process would have been too fast to remain in memory.

"Ah..."

Everyone in the sky could see the massive energy vibrations trapped within the golden smoke.

The Miracle Stream, transcending time through quantum signals, transformed into Shirone's form.

"Wow."

Suppressing the explosion between his two palms, Shirone was genuinely amazed.

'The particle mobility is tremendous.'

Of course, it wasn't as if he'd never experienced energy of this scale in all of universal history.

'A human made this?'

Iruki had proven that human knowledge could reach the realm of breaking natural laws.

"Shirone..."

Nade and Miro's group, who had been floating 200 meters in the air, were stunned upon discovering Shirone.

But even more surprising was the fact that...

"Impossible."

He was confining energy that could instantly travel several kilometers within a 30-centimeter area.

'Convert the energy.'

Like turning a windmill with wind to generate electricity, Shirone converted the particles' kinetic energy into Hex.

'Any energy would be lethal, but...'

Shirone knew the one energy that couldn't be combined with photon signals.

'Yahweh's ultimate realm.'

Agape.

The particles bubbled like foam, then exploded in the sky like primordial light.

"Kiiiiiii!"

As Paimon's arms and legs melted in the light, Miro's group also twisted their heads away.

'In the end, couldn't it be stopped?'

At that moment, they suddenly realized that if the bomb had exploded, they wouldn't even be able to have such thoughts.

"What?"

When Miro's eyes snapped open, an enormous number of screams rose from the ground.

"Graaaah! It hurts! It hurts!"

Bashuka's citizens lay prostrate on the ground, listening to screams erupting from all directions.

"Detestable Yahweh! Damn Yahweh...! Guk!"

As tens of thousands of voices filling the surroundings evaporated simultaneously, silence arrived.

"Are we, are we alive?"

People straightened their backs and looked around, but everything was buried in light.

"Ahh..."

Feeling their hearts grow warm, they closed their eyes as if by agreement.

'It's warm.'

It was the temperature of Yahweh's heart, of Agape.
