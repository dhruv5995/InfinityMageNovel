Simultaneous Events (1)

Lufist spoke.

"Let's think this through first."

The standoff had been brief, but the image of Heaven's army remained vividly etched in Lufist's mind.

"The divine citizens gained independence from Heaven, and the Eternals were mobilized for Ra's Enemy's work before scattering when the Council of Ten collapsed."

Most of them were probably dead.

"In the end, what came before us is their full strength. Angels and Maras, fairies and giants."

Even so, it was a fact that humanity's forces would struggle against them.

Sein said:

"Heaven isn't the only concern. The demon race's elite forces are still scattered throughout the world. And they'll fully open the demon realm soon."

As the atmosphere grew serious, Sirone spoke:

"We have three main objectives. First, participate in the humanitarian relief activities currently underway at the Ivory Tower. Second, suppress the demon race and prepare for the demon realm. Third, suppress Heaven's army and fundamentally stop Nane."

Nade asked:

"Nane? Didn't we already stop him?"

"We shared many conversations. Perhaps about the entirety of the universe. But one clear fact is..."

Sirone looked back at Amy.

"Nane loves Amy."

That fact alone must have been the reason he withdrew from all those confrontations at every level.

"Huh?"

As everyone who knew Amy turned to look, Tess asked with a dumbfounded expression:

"What are you talking about? Why Nane all of a sudden?"

Amy, the person in question, flushed red.

"Well, that's..."

She hadn't done anything particularly wrong, but it was true that she'd missed the chance to explain the whole story.

"So when I first opened the fire realm..."

Conscious of Sirone's gaze, Amy felt like she was walking on thin ice as she revealed the whole truth.

"Oho."

After hearing the explanation, the reason Nane had withdrawn on his own when confronting Sirone made sense.

"Still, that's impressive."

Tess said:

"It was a fight with the entire world at stake, wasn't it? And yet he chose Amy."

Amy protested:

"It's not like that! It was purely a philosophical matter, so I also..."

"It's okay."

Sirone said with a smile:

"Everyone has a heart. And as long as there's a heart, nothing is absolute. Amy's heart can change at any time too."

"That may be true, but I have no intention of doing so!"

"Yeah, I believe you. What I'm trying to say is about all those workings of the heart. If Nane had chosen the world instead of Amy..."

Recalling the standoff, Sirone honestly confessed:

"I might have been the one shattered into fragments."

It was a situation no one could guarantee, and Miro looked up at the sky with a serious expression.

"He's watching from somewhere. To judge whether his heart is precious enough to trade for the entire world."

"Yes. It won't take long. The Nane I confronted has almost reached it. Perhaps even right now, he could return as a Buddha."

If he could just sort out that one heart.

"That's why we need simultaneous events. If we don't unite humanity's hearts as quickly as possible, then we truly won't be able to defeat Nane."

Garcia said:

"Do you really think it's possible?"

"All humans are different, and the standards for defining unity vary for each person. To be honest, even I'm not confident whether I can belong to that integrated mental system."

Of course, her sense of mission toward humanity was strong, but she wasn't magnanimous enough to accept all humans.

"I know it's difficult. But if it were impossible, Nane wouldn't be agonizing like this either."

Dante asked:

"So there is a method?"

"No, I can't guarantee anything. The reason we're here is because all factors of good, evil, compassion, and emptiness have come into play. Even evil is influencing the world as one axis. If demons hadn't run rampant, could something like the World Allied Forces have been created in human history?"

"Hmm."

Garcia judged this made sense.

"You're saying the times are changing rapidly."

"Yes. The wheel of good, evil, compassion, and emptiness is racing toward the end of the world. Laws can be predicted, but we can't analyze the workings of the hearts contained within them. We can only do what we can and accept the results."

Armin asked:

"What can we do? If we can't achieve results no matter what choices we make."

There was one thing he'd realized after letting Havitz escape.

Life was such a complex totality of factors that nothing went according to plan.

"What I'm asking for is just one thing."

Sirone showed the way:

"Do what your heart tells you to do. What you truly want to do—just do that."

Above the atmosphere, surrounded by endless darkness, Nane sat cross-legged and looked down at the planet.

'I couldn't defeat Sirone.'

Because compassion was stronger.

'But do you know, Messiah of this age? The reason Buddha's emptiness couldn't surpass compassion might be...'

Perhaps because the world's evil hasn't fully emerged yet.

'Of course, it's the power of good.'

Miro was holding back the evil.

'But for how long? If the world becomes more turbid than now, even Buddha will erase his heart.'

Nane's eyes, watching over the planet, filled with sadness.

'Compassion seeping into the world, emptiness will watch from here. Whether indeed...'

We are worth existing.

The Allied Forces' executives followed Sirone's words.

'What they truly wanted to do.'

It was fine to go meet family, and fine to abandon the war if they feared death.

Sirone said that looking into one's own heart was the beginning of the Ultima System.

And all the wills formed this way would seep into compassion and rotate good, evil, compassion, and emptiness.

"Well then, I'll be going."

Surprisingly, a considerable number of those who had gathered under one banner left the battlefield.

Miro said bitterly:

"Humans are certainly diverse."

"Ultima is a high-dimensional spirit that acknowledges all individuality. Righteousness, that is, integration, comes after that. People who don't know their own hearts can't understand others' hearts."

Having answered thus, Sirone asked:

"Will you stay, Miro?"

"Of course I have to stay. This is the center of the battlefield, after all. Now then, the people who remained here are..."

Rian and Nade, Amy and Tess naturally stayed where Sirone was, and among the Twelve Apostles, First Dragon Aetra and Thunder Dragon Blitz held their positions.

Armin and Quan left, and Sein assisted Miro.

'Dante, Lilia, and Eden decided to track down the demon race's remnants, and Garcia and the Allied Forces are repairing Bashka's walls.'

And the most important part was:

"Sirone, you're in all those places."

"Yes. It depends on how far I set the observer's domain, but for now, I think I can cover about downtown Bashka with Spirit Zone without quantum transmission."

"Hmm, I see. Spatial movement will be easy too. The Ultima System is certainly effective."

"Hehe, then can't you give me just one Sirone too?"

When everyone looked at Tess with bewildered expressions, she floundered and continued:

"Why, why are you like that? It's funny! Just imagine."

The longer the silence, the more anxious she became.

"No, not that kind of imagination! I really meant it as a joke! Really!"

It was a joke only the honest Tess could make, but being too honest was the problem.

Sirone liked Tess just like that.

"Haha, okay. I'll believe you."

Now he finally felt like he'd returned to his friends.

"Now soon Iruki will..."

Sirone's face suddenly hardened.

"What's wrong, Sirone?"

"...No, nothing."

Though Sirone regained his smile, unlike before, his eyes had grown somber.

Miro guessed:

'It's not an incident here.'

Perhaps somewhere very far away, a sad situation had befallen Sirone.

"Graaah!"

Countless angels gritted their teeth at an inescapable inertia.

The heart Sirone had put into Hand of God was 'please fly far away.'

Judging by that psychology, Hand of God's power would have acted most powerfully on Heaven's army's strongest members.

'What tremendous power.'

Having already passed through the central continent and entered the northern continent, Ikael looked up at the rapidly flowing sky.

Sirone. Hexa. Hand of God. Garfin. Ankera's annihilation. The position of Archangel.

"Archangel."

Three Archangels and Maras who had escaped Hexa's power gathered around Ikael.

"Yes. Report."

"The army seems to be reassembling under Ashur. But Ymir and the giant forces seem like they'll act independently."

Uriel asked:

"Shall we stop them?"

"No, leave them be. I'll handle it personally."

Satiel stepped forward:

"Archangel, I have something I want to ask. Why did you not step forward?"

Even when they first arrived at Bashka and Ymir opened the attack, Ikael hadn't given the order to attack.

"Have you perhaps regained your memories?"

When Ikael remained silent, Satiel's question became slightly more critical:

"I too have some lingering feelings. If you're abandoning the Archangel's duties..."

As Ikael stopped abruptly with a sonic boom, the Archangels who had fallen behind hurriedly returned.

"Satiel."

At the cold voice, Satiel's photon body trembled.

"Yes, Ikael!"

"Whatever judgment I make is the Archangel's prerogative. Are you above me?"

"No. I apologize."

Having spoken coldly enough to freeze an Archangel, there would be no raising this matter again for some time.

But coincidentally:

"Ikael."

Smoke of light gathered before the angels' eyes, and Sirone revealed himself.

"You..."

Satiel's judicial halo Nostalgia spun fiercely.

An inexplicable rage.

And Ikael's photon body, still not moving even now.

'What? What is it that I don't know?'

"Sirone."

Ikael slowly advanced.

"Did you come alone?"

"Yes. We probably have things to talk about."

Ikael's gaze moved as if surveying the rear.

"I..."

As everyone's ears opened, a cold voice was heard:

"I don't think I have anything to discuss with you."

A sad emotion rose on Sirone's face.

'Ikael...'

Many things had happened.

He'd first received Ataraxia in Heaven, and in their second battle, she had stood in his way.

The reason for such coldness was...

'She really... has regained all her memories.'

Because she was his mother.

The vague expectations he'd harbored, the feelings of cautiously touching hearts—none of that remained.

All that was left was the terrible tragedy clearly etched in her photon body, and the suspicious gazes of the angels even now.

'It must be maternal instinct, but...'

Even knowing this, Sirone wanted to say proudly:

"Ikael, I'm not weak anymore. So you don't need to fear anything."

Though Ikael's gaze was clear, something felt like it snapped.

It was probably her limit of endurance.

"I don't know what you're talking about. As Archangel, I..."

"It's not your fault."

Unable to bear it any longer, Ikael's photon body shook with tremendous intensity.

"My death..."

Sirone conveyed to her with his heart:

"It's not Mom's fault."
