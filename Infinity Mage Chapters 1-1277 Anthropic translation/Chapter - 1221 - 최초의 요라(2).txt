The First Yora (2)

At Delta headquarters, a Code One summit meeting between world leaders was rapidly progressing.

Sirone headed to Jincheon's sector.

'This makes it a tie.'

He had already received confirmations from the Southern Tribal Alliance, the Ivory Tower's Corona, and Arachne's King.

'Kesia and Paras will be impossible to persuade, but if I can win over Jincheon and the Moon Kingdom, the momentum will shift.'

All twelve nations already knew that Yahweh was working for Tormia.

Whatever their true feelings, listening wouldn't hurt them either.

Only one nation had turned him away at the door - Jive.

'Gis.'

Of course, that was natural.

With the world's leading nation already decided, they wouldn't want to create variables.

As his thoughts concluded, Sirone arrived at Jincheon's sector and was guided by the Five Dragon General into Jingang's room.

"You've come?"

Though already pale as a corpse from his injuries, Jingang deliberately rose from his chair to greet him.

'He's truly upright.'

If human vitality could be converted to numbers, Jingang probably had less than 1 percent remaining.

"How are you feeling?"

"Manageable. So, you've invoked Code One. Meeting with each nation's king is about the vote, I assume?"

"Yes. This is the only way to stop Jive Union's dominance. Please lend your strength to Tormia."

Jingang chuckled softly.

"You underestimate me too easily. I don't know about other nations, but the Empire is not just another kingdom. It's another world entirely. We cannot easily kneel before a kingdom called Tormia."

"Jive will become the world's leading nation."

"What difference does it make? Whether Jive or Tormia, Jincheon can stand against anything."

It was the Emperor's pride.

"Sirone, you've done your best. Jincheon is grateful to Yahweh. But this isn't a matter between nations. Even if I die, Jincheon must continue."

Since the Empire was formed by numerous kingdoms joining together, he had expected it wouldn't be easy.

"I fully understand Your Majesty's words. But now is the time to unite our strength. Humanity is on the brink of extinction. Gis won't be able to unite us. Above all, rebellions will break out in places that don't support him, like Your Majesty. Please leave it to me. Seongeum would want this too."

Jingang's eyes hardened as he listened calmly.

"Are you selling my daughter now?"

"That's the truth. Seongeum and I..."

THUD

The floor shook as he stomped his foot down.

Though Sirone worried if bones had broken, he was more amazed by such vigor itself.

"My daughter is in hell."

A demon's face formed in Jingang's eyes.

It was the heart of a father who had buried his daughter in eternal torment, even reversing that powerful killing intent back upon himself.

"Yahweh, do you know why I'm still alive? To save my daughter and completely sweep away all those demons who dropped her into hell. All preparations are complete. I'll have to fire the Pharma Light Heavenly Star at my daughter, but those demons will also learn what true hell really is. I will never forgive them."

'He's already a ghost.'

Though he appeared human on the outside, his mind was already stained with madness.

Jingang coldly waved his hand.

"Go back. Abandoning the greater cause is a man's shame, but I no longer compromise with anyone. I refuse your proposal."

If Sirone hadn't been Yahweh, the moment his daughter's name crossed those lips, he would have drawn his sword.

"I can't return like this. I came here to obtain Your Majesty's vote."

"I don't say things twice."

Jingang placed his hand on his sword hilt from his seated position and slipped out of his chair like a blade.

"There's a way to save Seongeum, Jin Seongeum."

Jingang, who had been grinding his teeth and about to swing his sword at Sirone, raised his head.

"What?"

"She won't die. I mean we might be able to bring Your Majesty's daughter back to reality."

Jingang's beard trembled.

"Didn't you say there was no way? If you're lying just to get a mere vote..."

"Teacher Etela is a Bishop of the Karsis Order and the teacher I respect most."

Jingang closed his mouth.

"If Jin Seongeum chose eternal suffering for humanity's sake, then she is heading toward extinction while embracing all that pain. It will be infinite suffering."

The candles lit throughout the room flickered wildly.

"If Teacher succeeds, then I have an idea. Perhaps your daughter might be able to return."

"Huk!"

Jingang staggered.

"Your Majesty!"

The Five Dragon General tried to approach, but he held out his hand.

"That person's name... what was it?"

"Romy Etela."

Jingang repeatedly murmured that name, then wiped away tears with trembling hands.

"Forgive me. Please forgive this narrow heart that felt relief for just a moment. I, Jingang..."

He looked up at the sky and cupped his hands.

"Even in death, I will not forget that name."

"You should."

This time Sirone was cold.

Not because Seongeum would live and Etela would die.

He was simply angry at the reality where just one human had to shoulder everything and make the sacrifice.

'Why does someone always...'

think they should carry the burden alone?

'If everyone would just compromise a little...'

Right now, this world would face upheaval like an earthquake.

"Let me tell you the method."

"I'll transfer the voting rights to Tormia."

An immediate exchange.

Though it was a matter requiring careful consideration, it was also an issue with a predetermined outcome.

"No need to beat around the bush. Speak. How do you plan to bring back my daughter?"

Sirone raised his index finger.

"Pharma Light Heavenly Star."

Tormia Sector.

In a dimly lit room relying on a single small light, Albino and Lufist were drinking tea.

"The finale begins in an hour. That will officially end the holy war ceremonies."

He had heard that dignitaries from nations worldwide would decorate the finale.

"It feels both long and short. I suppose we've done everything we could."

"Right. I don't even know myself what variables might arise. Humans seem to see far, but in reality, even trying to see one second ahead makes everything go dark. We're all blind. We advance by groping forward one second at a time with our hands."

"Jive refused Code One."

At the words spoken like an ambush, Albino chuckled.

"So you know how to throw tantrums too? Stand up. You've grown too big, and I've grown too old."

Lufist sipped his tea.

"This is the first time I've seen the Magic Association President being so sentimental. Are you feeling guilty?"

"I am. I'm just not swayed by emotions. Flu is a capable talent, too precious to use like this."

"You're killing someone who could rule the world. Isn't that sacrifice enough for the nation?"

"...I suppose so. Since Sirone is gathering votes from each nation, we can't just take without giving."

Justification was also needed at this point.

"Don't worry too much. Flu will do well. She'll solve the problems remaining for us."

Albino asked while drinking tea.

"You seemed quite fond of that girl. Are you perhaps feeling other emotions?"

"No."

Lufist corrected his attitude.

"I don't look at subordinates with special eyes. What I think is that she's a core component of the kingdom."

"Like Jane?"

Before the name of the former Magic Association Secretary General, Lufist ultimately couldn't speak.

Meanwhile, Gis, having finished his work, was heading toward Jive's sector while whistling.

'It's over. I won.'

Tomorrow he would rule the world.

Of course, once Fermi's official documents reached each nation, the situation would change.

The information scattered through windows was only circulating as rumors among the holy war's maids and janitors, still far from reaching national officials, especially kings.

Perhaps that was the distance between kings and citizens.

"Hey, Pedra."

Seeing Arachne's Prime Minister at the end of the corridor, Gis spread his arms and approached.

"You've worked hard. The money I spent on you wasn't wasted. How does it feel to become the world's Prime Minister?"

"Well, that's..."

Having already made some agreement with Albino, Pedra couldn't enjoy the present like Gis.

"Why the expression? Have confidence. It's all over. Even Jive's intelligence agency is predicting an easy victory."

"Haha, right. But... where are you going?"

"A date."

Gis dusted his collar and winked.

Pedra was amazed at how energetic he seemed despite rolling around that afternoon.

"Impressive. I don't think I could even urinate today. Who's this blessed woman?"

"You know, Tormia's Magic Association Secretary General."

"Rabid... Flu?"

"Why drag it out? Tomorrow not just women but all of humanity will prostrate at my feet. Better finish quickly."

'Tormia, huh.'

Pedra, who specialized in honey traps, began to suspect this situation itself.

'Well, well, look at this?'

Gis asked.

"Why? Is there some problem?"

After thinking briefly, Pedra smiled with his eyes and shook his head left and right.

"No. She seemed quite picky, so I was curious how you managed it."

"Haha! It's all my wild nature. Women, you see, need to be handled roughly."

"I'm envious. Such confidence."

"Hehe, I'll introduce you later. Anyway, I'm going. See you at the finale."

"Yes, take care."

When Pedra, who had been bowing along with Gis, raised his head, his face was expressionless.

'Right. Take care, Gis.'

You won't get far.

Flu, who had been leaning against the wall at Jive sector's entrance, turned her head at the sound of footsteps.

Gis said.

"What, you were already here? Unexpectedly impatient. Or couldn't you wait?"

"The impatient one is you, Your Highness. There are still many people around - isn't this too early?"

"Is it my fault? The schedule moved up. That guy Havitz... No, never mind that. I have to attend the finale in an hour. There's no time."

Flu intuited.

'He's planning to dump me. What trash.'

Since what she wanted was also just one opportunity, it didn't matter.

"Fine. I have to attend the official ceremony too."

Gis boldly pulled Flu's shoulder into his embrace and headed toward the bedroom he had prepared.

Opening the door, a Jive Royal Guard Captain was waiting in full armor.

'Just like the rumors.'

The suspicious Gis always kept a guard knight nearby even when bedding women.

Gis asked while removing his outer garments.

"It's okay, right? It might seem strange at first, but you'll get used to it. Just think of him as decoration."

"Yes."

Flu didn't hesitate.

"Haha! I like that. A woman who knows how to plan for the future is my ideal type. So, right away?"

"I'll wash up."

Flu entered the bathroom without even asking permission.

"Hehe, so prickly."

Knowing there was no man here who would refuse, she slowly washed her body.

'The Royal Guard Captain.'

There would be no way to escape against the 1st Corps that had reached the pinnacle of sword-drawing techniques.

'I'm going to die.'

As warm water dripped from the ends of her hair, she smiled like a girl.

'It's okay.'

Wiping the steam from the mirror, she looked at her final appearance and composed her mind.

"I am Rabid Flu."

Secretary General of Tormia's Magic Association, devoted to loyalty for nation and people.
