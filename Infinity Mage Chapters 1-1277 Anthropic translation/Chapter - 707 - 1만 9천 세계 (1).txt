[707] The 19,000 Worlds (1)

The Noscartha that occurred in the southern Akard Desert swept through the central desert and only dissipated when it reached the entrance to the northern desert.

The desert tsunami wiped away all traces left by living beings, and under the scorching sun, the desert was hotter than ever.

"Shirone, water. Give me some water!"

Shirone's group was walking across the vast wasteland, sand clinging to them all over.

"Drinking again?"

When Shirone cast magic to fill the water bottle, Kido gulped it down eagerly.

"I don't know. Is it because it's made with magic? It doesn't quench my thirst."

After downing a full liter of water, Kido's protruding belly became even more bloated.

"Anyway, how long do we have to walk? We've been walking for 2 hours since sending Rathusa away. Didn't you say we were almost there?"

The power of Noscartha was truly tremendous - even when they broke through the desert tsunami, Kayd wasn't in any condition to fly.

"We're going in the right direction. Just be patient a little longer. Once we can see it, we'll use magic to get there."

Rian periodically looked back at the path they had taken.

"Still no pursuit. Did they all perish?"

If even Kayd was exhausted to this extent, there was no way those who had been chasing them on Omechs could have survived unharmed.

"We can't let our guard down."

What was still worrying was that the woman who was the leader of the Maga Bandit Group and an executive of the Council of Ten possessed unimaginable power.

"That woman would have broken through Noscartha too. We don't have time to delay. Let's walk a bit faster."

"Shirone, I need water!"

After walking for another hour, Shirone's group spotted a fortress visible at the end of the horizon.

True to its reputation as a famous tourist destination, people were gathering there.

"That must be Andre."

Shirone cast air-type magic and flew while lifting Kido and Rian into the air.

When they arrived at the main gate of the fortress, there was a ticket booth set up.

"Welcome! This is Labyrinth Andre! We welcome adventurers who have come seeking experiences more valuable than life itself!"

The staff member was dressed in Middle Eastern attire, but upon confirming Shirone's skin color, spoke in the continental common language.

"This is really..."

One of the world's three great labyrinths where La Enemy was presumed to be located.

"You've come at perfect timing! Due to the influence of Noscartha, entrance fees are half price for the next week! Don't miss this opportunity!"

"..."

The voice was so cheerfully bright that it relieved their tension, leaving them standing there dazed for a moment, when those who had arrived behind them urged them forward.

"Come on, hurry up. It's hot enough to kill us."

Pushed by their voices, Shirone glanced back at Rian and Kido once, then spoke to the ticket booth.

"Um... two adults and one goblin."

"Hmm? Goblin?"

The staff member smiled with his eyes as he examined the goblin.

"There's no set price for goblins. Is he perhaps under six years old? Infants and toddlers are free."

When Shirone looked back, Kido frowned with displeasure.

"Yes, he's under six."

Kido's eyes became hollow.

"Understood. Then that's 4 gold for two adults."

Befitting a world-class tourist destination, even at half price it was quite expensive.

"Thank you! Have a wonderful time!"

Beyond the main gate, well-maintained paths were lined with numerous shops, and despite being in a desert, there were even fountains installed.

Moreover, since it was specially managed by the Empire, everything from restaurants and taverns to lodging establishments, gambling houses, and souvenir shops was luxurious.

"Surprisingly crowded. I thought it would be off-season due to Noscartha's influence."

"That means it's usually even more crowded."

Numerous nobles were walking around with their families, and among them, some quite powerful-looking individuals were gathered in one place.

'Common tourists or adventurers.'

Kido ran to a souvenir shop and looked around at the items displayed on the stand.

"Kido, we don't have time to buy that now."

They didn't know when the Maga Bandit Group might arrive.

"Shirone, look at this for a moment."

When Shirone and Rian approached, Kido showed them a three-dimensional model of Andre.

"Hmm, so this is what it looks like."

It was a structure where great caverns were connected in succession, and through the transparent ceiling of the three-dimensional model, numerous circular doors could be seen installed.

"No matter how I look at it, there don't seem to be 19,000 of them."

The doors that could be implemented in the miniature were at most a few hundred, but even that was quite distinctive.

"It'll be different when we actually go see it. Let's go."

Kido reluctantly touched Andre's three-dimensional model before placing it back on the stand.

"Andre opens from 2 PM. Those who wish to tour, please wait in line."

Following the guide's words, Shirone's group also squeezed into the crowd and waited their turn.

"What is this? We came to find La Enemy, right?"

The peaceful atmosphere wasn't bad, but Rian was wary of his sharply honed mind becoming scattered.

"There probably isn't a La Enemy here."

At Shirone's words, Rian and Kido simultaneously turned their heads.

"There isn't? Then why did we come here?"

"Because only through this place can we meet La Enemy."

Shirone shared the thoughts he had organized so far.

"What I realized while taking the Ivory Tower's test is that finding La Enemy is different from finding a lost object."

"Because it manipulates events?"

"Right. I'm not looking for La. La is making me find it. The subject and object are reversed."

Shirone raised his index finger.

"Therefore, 'I will be where you seek me' doesn't mean La is waiting where I go. Conversely, it means I must find where La is."

"A kind of hint."

"So I thought about it. Where exactly am I looking for La? The conclusion is one thing. Everywhere, no matter where it is."

Rian looked back at Andre's entrance.

"The prison of space-time. Guffin's ruins."

"Right. The 19,000 worlds that Guffin sealed away in individual prisons. If we release the seals on all these worlds, this place will become a mixture of space and time again, and..."

"Then we can meet the real La Enemy."

Shirone nodded.

"I'll know for sure once I see Andre directly, but..."

Just then, Andre's entrance opened.

"Please enter. Viewing hours are until 4 PM."

The cave was quite spacious, and the long line quickly shortened. Feeling an unexpectedly cool chill for a desert, Shirone's group also crossed Andre's threshold.

"Wow..."

Certainly different from the three-dimensional model, Kido opened his mouth with a dazed expression at the overwhelming presence of the real thing.

On the cavern walls, ceiling, and floor - everywhere without exception - countless circular steel doors that looked like eyes were installed.

At the center of each steel door was a circular panel, and despite having no power source, they were lit up.

Shirone read the number 3256 on the panel.

Looking around elsewhere, every steel door had different numbers. The end would probably be 19000.

"According to legend..."

The guide began explaining.

"Numerous worlds were said to be overlapping in this cave. But one day, a great mage appeared and classified them into 19,000 worlds, sealing each one behind these doors."

One of the tourists pointed at a door and asked.

"So if we open this door and go in, a completely different world appears? Can we enter now?"

The guide was smiling, but his face reddened slightly.

"Of course there are other worlds. But among all the people who have opened these doors and entered so far, no one has ever returned."

"Then it's a lie. If no one has come out, how would you know if there are new worlds? Isn't that right, everyone?"

People were displeased at having their tour interrupted, and the more annoyed they became, the more the man persisted stubbornly.

"How about opening one? We'll verify it ourselves. We just won't go in, right?"

The reason the guide was patient was because his monthly salary included a fee for keeping his mouth shut about such things.

'This is too disgusting to handle, really.'

According to the veteran guide's philosophy, everyone thinks they're right, but there isn't actually a single person who is right.

"Unfortunately, opening Andre's doors requires the touch of a magic circuit specialist, and it also violates Imperial law."

At the mention of Imperial law, the man shut his mouth, but the guide's enthusiasm was completely ruined.

"Rian, this place is truly incredible."

Where everyone turned their heads, Shirone was looking around at the doors installed in all directions.

"Oh my! You certainly recognize true value. That's right, the doors currently installed use special codes that no information mage in history has been able to develop..."

The reinvigorated guide's mouth moved rapidly, but it was no longer reaching Shirone's ears.

'How is this even possible?'

What he felt through the Ultima System was a perfect vacuum made of nothingness, and infinite spots forming the exterior.

'Being and nothingness. He perfectly separated the two concepts.'

Taking the number 2 from the Law and making each into independent 1s was something only Guffin could have conceived.

Rian asked in a low voice.

"Is it possible? 19,000 worlds. If we unseal them one by one, it'll take thousands of years."

"I don't have the confidence to live that long."

After directly seeing Andre with his own eyes, Shirone instinctively knew this was something only he could do.

"I'll release them all at once. With the Wheel of Kalpa."

By infinitely multiplying event bubbles to simultaneously explore 19,000 worlds.

Kido, who retained memories by drinking Shirone's blood, adjusted his glasses and said.

"Will that be okay? You don't know what you'll experience in each world. It's completely different from multiplying events for a single purpose."

Kido's words were accurate.

"If I turn the Wheel of Kalpa, 19,000 versions of me will each have different experiences. That way, my thinking will change too."

Rian wore a worried expression.

"Will you be able to return? If all those Shirones merge into one, you might go insane."

That was only the limit of what Rian could express - something dimensionally different from going insane would happen to Shirone.

"I'm not doing this because it's possible. I'm doing it because only I can do it."

Shirone looked around the great cavern.

"At first it was infinite. That was split into being and nothingness. Very many and infinite have different meanings. Guffin didn't seal this place. Rather, he reduced it to an investigable domain."

"Do you think Guffin prepared this for you? Just because you could master the Wheel of Kalpa?"

It was unknowable.

"I don't know that much. But I do have this thought. The Wheel of Law that we talked about in Banguard."

Destiny.

"The things I've felt and realized while living up to now feel like they fit precisely into this Andre. Like a key and lock."

"You're saying Hexa is the key that can unseal Andre?"

At Kido's words, Shirone nodded.

"Infinity is infinite. So the 19,000 worlds must be worlds divided under Guffin's special intention. Therefore, if I explore them all..."

When that happens, perhaps...

"Couldn't I understand Guffin a little more? And couldn't I learn more about Hexa? That's what I think."

Rian and Kido couldn't think of a way to stop him.

"How long do you think it'll take? The time to break the seals, I mean."

"With the Ultima System, I should be able to find a way out. I think it'll take at least 7 days."

If the Maga Bandit Group had survived, they would arrive at Andre by this evening.

"Time is tight. Then Kido and I will..."

Just as Rian was speaking, a loud explosion rang out from outside the cave, followed by people's screams rushing in.

"What's happening?"

While tourists watched with anxious expressions, a guard shouted from the cave entrance.

"Everyone evacuate! Bandits are attacking!"

Kido asked with shocked eyes.

"What? Bandits?"

It was much faster than expected.
