The Sun That Rose at Night (3)

"Ariana."

As Mini regained her average size, her satellite Ariana followed close behind.

"Let's go."

"Okay."

Mini's scale was growing exponentially as she approached Gircin.

And when she finally reached the same size, she threw her fist with all her might.

KUUUUUUU!

An enormous amount of atmosphere was pushed aside, striking Gircin with a thunderous crash.

Gircin's upper body swayed and bent.

"Graaaah!"

At the same size, the balance of power was equal, leaving only the difference in skill.

"A mere human."

As Gircin swung his sword, the atmosphere ignited and clouds of fire traced parabolic arcs.

"Hmph!"

Mini fluidly circled around and wrapped her arms around Gircin's waist from behind.

"Now!"

Ariana, riding on Mini, leaped over Gircin's face and landed on his forehead.

"Go!"

Mini arched her back and executed a German suplex.

"HYAAAAA!"

Just as Gircin's feet left the ground and he was flipped upside down, plummeting toward the earth.

"Phantom Press."

Ariana's phantom appeared, grabbed Gircin's face, and slammed him into the ground.

KURRRRRRRUNG.

The earth shook and dust clouds spread out on a city-wide scale.

"UAAAAH!"

Gircin sprang up and swung his fist, but it passed right through Ariana's phantom.

'It's not real.'

It was her Avatar Art, Psychokinesis.

"Over here, idiot!"

As Gircin lowered his head to look for Ariana, Mini immediately charged.

"Hole hole ho!"

And the moment Gircin looked forward again, she delivered a drop kick to his solar plexus.

"Ugh!"

Pushed back by the massive weight, Ariana immediately activated her Avatar Art.

"Huuuuh!"

Her phantom grabbed a mountain peak and slammed it down on Gircin's crown.

THUD

"Ack!"

Various trees, soil, and animals poured down onto Gircin's face like filth.

'What the hell?'

The phantom was merely a medium for manifesting power - she was actually moving objects with her mind.

'Psychokinesis strong enough to lift an entire mountain's mass...'

Before the thought could finish, Mini wrapped a chokehold around Gircin's neck and executed a twisting technique.

"UAAAAH!"

Gircin was getting annoyed.

"Awesome!"

Ariana's phantom threw itself forward, striking the giant's stomach with clasped hands.

PWAAAAAANG!

The people in the city were mesmerized by the spectacle that seemed beyond reality.

Sirone felt the same way.

'This is exciting.'

"Yahweh, the giants are moving outside the city. Now's our chance if we're going to move."

Euntara's words snapped him back to attention.

"Right. Let's get the people to the sanctuary. Mini and Ariana will handle this place. And I..."

Suddenly Sirone started.

"What's wrong?"

Despite Euntara's question, Sirone didn't answer, staring off into the distance and muttering.

"What is it?"

The laws were changing again.

At the sun's core, Ikael was holding Amy from behind, enduring.

Though in mental form, he could protect Amy until the very end.

"Ikael! Don't do this!"

"It's okay. You're not an archangel. If someone has to die at the end..."

It should be Amy.

"Ikael..."

As Amy conveyed her sad voice, the divine laws oppressing them were released.

"Huh?"

The moment they came to their senses, the two separated and regained their respective forms while looking around.

"What happened?"

Amy seemed to understand.

"Sirone did it. He blocked the divine laws!"

They didn't yet know that Satiel had helped in the process.

Ikael looked outside with his far-sight.

"Ah."

An artificial structure was completed that inspired awe even at an archangel's scale.

And much farther away, he could see Sirone breathing a sigh of relief.

"Well done."

He couldn't help but see Guffin's form flickering.

"Let's go to Sirone."

As Amy drew up her fire avatar to its fullest, Ikael also nodded pleasantly.

"Then..."

KUUUUUUUU!

At that moment, Ikael detected through light signals that the world's laws were being twisted.

"Why?"

The reason he didn't leave immediately was because it felt qualitatively different from God.

'This is definitely... a heart.'

Quantum signals.

Of course, it didn't feel good to them.

But at least it wasn't cold, and was even filled with biological variables.

"Amy! Get out quickly!"

Perhaps that made it even more dangerous.

"Huh? What..."

Amy, who was about to ask him back, also felt it.

"Ah."

Following the wistful nostalgia, she turned around, her form being engulfed in light.

"Amy!"

Then Ikael too was buried in white light.

Sirone grimaced.

"Grrr!"

The newly completed Sirone Sphere was being dismantled in reverse chronological order.

'Tachyon?'

The person who made the sphere was Sirone.

Therefore, for the structure to be dismantled like this, Sirone's cause had to be directly touched.

'Think I'll give it up easily?'

Sirone activated Ouroboros and entered a battle to protect his own past.

As if swept up in waves of cause and effect, countless events bubbled up like foam.

"Uuuuuh!"

It was different.

'This guy isn't God.'

Unlike God who manipulated cause and effect with cold logic, this definitely felt human.

'No, not just that level, it's like...'

A feeling of understanding me.

Having grasped the characteristics to some extent, Sirone used all his strength to reverse the past again.

In the collision of tachyon signals, the Sirone Sphere flickered like a mirage.

Who would prevail?

'Don't be ridiculous.'

That's something I made.

Just as Sirone finally found the crucial event and was about to manifest the sphere.

That's right.

He had the illusion of hearing some voice.

And then...

"Huh?"

An intense solar wind was fired toward the planet where Sirone was.

Just a few seconds later, the skeleton of the Sirone Sphere struck by the solar wind began burning away.

'Miracle Stream.'

Sirone too had to put up a defensive barrier with all his might to maintain his life.

"Grrrrrr!"

Tremendous heat swept over Sirone, but the planet was in more serious trouble.

"Damn it!"

Sirone looked back at his home, twinkling like a small star.

'It'll arrive in about 10 minutes.'

With this level of heat wave, even if the magnetic field blocked it, the organisms in half the hemisphere would burn up.

'Caught me off guard. To think of attacking with solar wind...'

A being proficient in both photons and quantum.

"Huh?"

It suddenly occurred to him.

"Amy."

He focused his attention on the sun, but nothing remained in the core.

"Amy!"

Sirone, who was flying straight toward the planet, soon realized there was no need for this.

'I'm on the planet.'

Sirone disappeared.

And with this, the simultaneous events that had spread across various parts of the world except for the sanctuary came to an end.

RUMBLE. RUMBLE.

On the middle slope of a mountain with aftershocks remaining, Tes shed the tears she had been holding back.

"Rian!"

It might be a mistake.

No matter how much light a Schema master could gather, it wouldn't provide vision clearer than daylight.

But she knew by feeling.

It was a shock so massive and powerful that she was certain Ymir's attack was over.

Tes mounted her horse.

"We have to go!"

This time even Klump couldn't stop her.

'Is it ending so emptily?'

That the final moment of the first swordsman in human history to reach the divine realm would be just this.

"I'm going too."

With the thought of confirming it with his own eyes, Klump drove his horse.

"Hiya!"

Rai watched them disappearing into the distance.

"Huuuuu."

The fist that struck the ground was dozens of times larger than Ymir, who stood 3 meters tall.

Ymir's expression was not good.

"It was fun."

It was the emptiness after the most thrilling moment in eons had passed.

CRACK.

The giant arm returned to Ymir at its original size.

What remained where the fist had been was one completely mangled corpse.

'He's dead.'

That's what he thought.

When the blow reached Rian's will, his divine transcendence was destroyed, and when it reached his body, even his conviction was broken.

The horribly scattered corpse was proof, and in that death, Rian...

'He's dead.'

Agreed with Ymir's words.

'This is ridiculous.'

His entire journey flashed by like a revolving lantern.

'After all that suffering. Getting called an idiot from all directions, falling into hell and experiencing every kind of hardship.'

And after reaching this point.

'Just when I thought I could finally fight properly.'

He was mercilessly crushed by Ymir.

'Come to think of it.'

Rian suddenly remembered.

'I think I heard this story somewhere before?'

At the desert oasis Vanguard, a prophet girl had once predicted the future.

'Haha!'

I thought it was fake.

'Now it's over.'

There's nothing more I can do anyway.

'I'm completely shattered. I'm tired, I wish I could sleep. Damn, how do I sleep? My brain is already destroyed.'

Why am I still thinking?

After pondering briefly, Rian gave up and waited to reach complete death.

He had lived like a flame and was exhausted.

A moment later.

'Ah, why won't I die!'

Rian felt irritation surge.

Would he have to exist only as thoughts forever?

'No.'

He actually knew.

Because even his conviction was broken, there was one thing he wanted to avoid until the very end.

'Sirone.'

He failed to protect his lord.

'I am a broken sword.'

Smile.

'Can I fight again? Can I protect my lord while bearing the misery of defeat?'

Ogent says.

Smile.

Ymir's eyebrow twitched.

"Hmm?"

Lines of light resembling Rian began flowing over the pieces of the corpse.

As will filled the Idea's signal and the scattered flesh finally began to writhe.

"Hehe."

Ymir laughed.

"Ehehehe! Ehehehehe!"

Rian's body was slowly rising.

'In my heart...'

Build a kingdom of conviction.

The mind being reborn as a single knight, not a battle-crazed swordsman, would absolutely never...

'Break.'

Right.

Rian and Ogent said simultaneously.

Ideas cannot be destroyed.

Everything inherited from predecessors combined, and the great straight sword was grasped in Rian's right hand.

"Huu."

The moment Ymir saw Rian's clearly sparkling eyes, he felt a chill.

'Incredible regenerative power.'

He wasn't talking about physical recovery.

'Even I wouldn't have been able to come back. Was there something left even after burning everything?'

That's the kind of battle it was.

"So, what are you planning to do now? It doesn't look like you're going to give up."

Having suppressed his beastly nature, Rian was calm.

'This is the last time.'

With Ogent's and his own Ideas integrated, his regenerative ability had completely disappeared.

"I fought enough."

He had no lingering attachment to life, but.

"I will protect."

He had willingly crossed the river of death to protect Sirone, humanity, and the world.

"Oho?"

Ymir stroked his chin.

"Your words sound nice, but... how? If you can't beat me, you can't protect anyone."

"I'm not alone."

"Rian!"

Tes and Klump, who arrived at the battlefield, were surprised to see Rian alive and well.

"Are you... okay?"

Ymir shrugged his shoulders.

"Keke, right. You're certainly not alone. Are you planning to try using them as meat shields?"

At that moment, space crumpled and a different landscape unfolded along a boundary line.

Zeon crossed the boundary.

"Transport complete."

Behind her, everyone who had experienced the simultaneous events with Sirone was gathered.

Nade stepped forward, cracking his knuckles.

"Alright, is that big stupid-looking muscle head first? Hey, come on. I'll smash you to pieces."

Ymir just stared.

When Miro, Gaold, and even his friends showed no reaction, Nade turned around with a confused expression.

"Why, why?"
