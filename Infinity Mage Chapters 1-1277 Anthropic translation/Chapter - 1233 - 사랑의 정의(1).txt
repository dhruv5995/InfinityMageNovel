The Definition of Love (1)

Gith's eyes widened.

"Kuk!"

Flu's arms, wrapped around Gith, moved mechanically under the power of the algorithm.

Crack.

His neck twisted completely around, and Gith's gaze fixed on the royal guards outside the bed.

'Why?'

The 1.5 generation of humanity - so highly political and intelligent that they would even exploit angels.

Flu spoke.

"Still far to go."

But what ultimately promoted that development of reason was for the sake of even greater pleasure.

Instinct still held dominance.

Gith's lips twitched as if trying to say something, and his fingertips moved feebly.

But in the end, his breath was cut short, and simultaneously the guards drew their swords and charged.

'Fast as expected.'

Befitting Zaive's strongest group of swordsmen, no conflict or confusion could be seen in their eyes.

They could think after killing Flu.

'This is the end.'

Faced with their tremendous reaction speed, she realized how distant thought and body truly were.

By the time the algorithm had just begun to activate, the blades were already within arm's reach.

And then...

Something beyond everyone's perception began slicing through the guards from the front.

Flu blinked.

'What is it?'

This sense of unease.

And the moment a longsword flew toward her neck, she suddenly realized.

'This is it! That thing!'

The presence she couldn't define precisely but had never forgotten since entering the holy war.

That thread-like perception triggered the algorithm, ultimately saving Flu's life.

"Hnngh!"

As her body bent in an unexpected direction following her brain's command, her muscles screamed.

"Hooh?"

Harvitz released his Vanishing.

"You survived?"

Flu clutched her aching side and knelt on one knee.

'I need to escape.'

She had survived by coinciding with the guards' attack, but from the second Vanishing onward, she wouldn't even be able to activate it.

"Interesting."

Harvitz activated God's Frequency.

"You pass."

"What?"

"I'll keep you alive for now. I'm setting up the board right now."

The real game would begin after Uorin gained the ability to search history.

"More importantly..."

Harvitz stepped over the corpses toward the window.

"What's that about?"

In front of Delta's headquarters, southern warriors and paladins were engaged in fierce combat.

'Kill Maya?'

That was all God's Frequency could pick up.

"Keke."

As killing intent suddenly surged from Harvitz, Flu trembled even while staying alert.

"This should be fun."

The window opened.

Flu forgot about Harvitz once again.

The Pyramid of Truth.

The ruins of an ultra-ancient civilization in the Paras Kingdom were emitting a powerful magnetic field.

The astronomical concepts carved into the inner walls were destroying spacetime and overlapping countless events.

"Krrgh!"

Amy's brother Ares' eyes were glowing as if on fire.

"Damn it..." With Hongan's magnetic field, he endlessly tried to turn his mind back through memories, but In's wavelength was powerful.

'No.'

Regret and lingering attachment.

'It had to be that way.'

The causes that led to those regrets and attachments were flooding in through all of Ares' senses.

'If only then I had...'

Within In's wavelength, the future was something that could be changed.

"Graaaah!"

But Ares maintained his will to the very end and destroyed all assumptions.

"This is life."

Taking complete responsibility for oneself.

'The moment I deny that, the moment I can't take responsibility for myself, there is no life for humans.'

It becomes no different from planetary motion, a water drop falling, or wind blowing from here to there.

"Uaaaah!"

Ares clutched his head.

"Leave me alone!"

Why wouldn't he want to change it?

If he had known it would turn out this way, if he had known there could be a better life, he would have gladly done so.

"What am I supposed to do!"

As Ares screamed, In's wavelength came rushing like a strong wind from the end of the passage.

"Uhhhhh..."

His eyes rolled upward and finally Hongan's flickering began to slow.

'It's over.'

Rather than the fear of becoming an object, the ecstasy of having the entire future exist for oneself came first.

"Hehehe."

To be honest, it had been a wonderful experience. The trouble he'd caused his parents, his first love he couldn't confess to due to lack of courage in school, losing a precious comrade during exploration due to his own misjudgment...

'I can change it all.'

Trapped in a world where neither lingering attachment nor regret existed, Ares shed tears.

He knew.

'I can't escape from here.'

One cannot live in the world as a blind person unable to see even one second ahead.

Just as he was losing his heart...

"Erga."

What seemed like the distant, faint wailing of the dead pierced Ares' eardrums.

"Huk!"

Lightning struck him simultaneously.

"Uaaaah!"

Even as his body burned with pain, Ares instinctively knew it wasn't a fatal wound.

Still embracing his convulsing body, he looked up at the woman before him.

"Zulu."

Her indifferent, pitiful face with the pacifier removed was staring into the darkness.

"If I'd been a little later, it would have been irreversible."

"Tch! Who asked you?"

Having somewhat recovered his strength, Ares looked at the lich floating behind Zulu.

"Are you alright?"

"What do you mean?"

Zulu remained indifferent, but Ares, having directly experienced In's wavelength, was puzzled.

"This pyramid is bizarre. It violates people's hearts. It submerges all history from the moment of birth until now in the realm of infinite spacetime."

Zulu remained silent.

"But why are you unaffected, Miss Zulu? Is there a way to avoid In's wavelength?"

"No. There's no such thing. The same thing is happening to me as to you. Even at this very moment... countless futures are unfolding before me."

"Then..."

Zulu turned her head and spoke.

"I have no affection."

Though he couldn't understand precisely, the moment Ares saw Zulu's pupils, he realized.

'This person might already be... In.'

He felt nothing.

Zulu said.

"Regret, lingering attachment, remorse, the desire to change the future, longing for the past - I know none of these. When I killed Erga, I probably died too."

"That's not true."

He denied it first because her words were sad, but it wasn't entirely without mental basis.

"Miss Zulu fought for humanity. Even now you came here to help Sirone. I don't think someone like that has nothing left."

"I don't mean I have no emotions. Nor that I have no thoughts. But the essence of all that is affection. If what you say is true... are In also alive because they move?"

"Th-that's..."

"The foundation of life is love. We're alive because we love at least ourselves. If you extend that philosophy to the entire universe, it becomes Yahweh."

"Is that why you help Sirone?"

"No."

Zulu shook her head.

"I have no affection for anything. Not even myself. If you love someone, that person has life. They'll remain in your memory forever. Conversely, the countless humans you've met - if you can't remember them no matter how hard you try, they're dead."

Time that has passed is contained in memory.

Whether it actually existed or not, we simply accumulate memories.

Ares thought.

'Is that so?'

Losing one's heart to In's wavelength must ultimately be because affection disappears from any life.

Suddenly Zulu lifted her top up to below her chest.

"Ugh!"

Ares, about to turn his head away in embarrassment, discovered the creature attached to Zulu's stomach.

"What is that?"

"Iron beetle Amorose. My summoned creature."

It was a creature with overlapping shells and a snake-like long tail wrapped around Zulu's waist.

Where the creature's head was could be determined by the blood flowing from Zulu's navel.

"What are you doing now?"

"Amorose injects poison into biological organs. A peculiar chemical substance is produced in the process of making that poison. I'll give it to you to drink. You should be able to endure for a while."

"But then Miss Zulu will..."

"It's fine, I'm used to it. Amorose only inhabits pyramids, so it's impossible to summon outside. Quite peculiar. This creature hasn't evolved for a very long time. Probably from when the ancient pyramids were built until now."

When Zulu grabbed Amorose's tail and pulled it out, a much longer body than expected emerged.

"Ugh!"

Zulu inserted her thumb into Amorose's snout and tilted it over her other hand as if pouring tea.

Yellowish-green mucus began dripping down.

"Here."

Since she said it was good, he'd eat it, but it didn't look appealing.

"Um, how do I..."

"Lick it with your tongue."

"Ah, yes."

The moment he consumed it, he felt toxins sharp enough to sting his nose, but soon his mind began to calm.

"Hooh, this is?"

Hongan flashed as it analyzed the body's changes.

'Incredible. I can't even analyze the components, but this is revolutionary. But how on earth...?'

Zulu said.

"Long ago, this ultra-ancient civilization's ruins probably weren't so mysterious. Countless people visited this place and left understanding something."

The numerous replica buildings of the pyramid built in the Paras Kingdom were evidence of this.

"Amorose is presumably a species that inhabited the pyramid back then. It must have developed these abilities in an environment where In's wavelength, or laws, were changing. The fact that there's been no evolution since means..."

It had adapted to changes in spacetime.

"Let's go. I need to give Amorose's fluid to others too. I can't make much."

Zulu's complexion was pale.

"Next time, attach Amorose to me. Ancient people probably obtained this liquid by offering specific sacrifices."

Zulu shook her head.

"I've experimented, but it's useless. I grew up in the pyramid and developed an ancient constitution. Only I can handle Amorose."

Ares couldn't understand.

"Why go this far? No matter how your constitution changed, it's a beetle that kills life. You can't endure it."

"...That's probably true."

Zulu readily admitted it.

"It's fine. I don't remember myself. It doesn't matter what happens to me."

"How can you say such a thing!"

Whether with or without affection, he believed that sacrificing oneself to save others was altruistic behavior.

"Come here. Let me treat you first."

Rummaging through his bag, Ares applied medicine to Zulu's stomach and wrapped bandages around her slender waist.

"I've stopped the bleeding, so don't overexert yourself for a while."

"Okay."

Zulu, who had been waiting without particular emotion, turned first toward the darkness.

Ares called out.

"Wait a moment."

And the moment Zulu turned around, he suddenly approached and kissed her lips.

'I won't make the same mistake twice.'

What he'd learned from In's wavelength was that it was better to just do it rather than hesitate about whether to do it or not.

But Zulu stood like a doll, not even her breathing trembling.

Feeling defiant, Ares held on for a few more seconds but eventually his face couldn't take it and he pulled back.

Zulu said.

"Let's go."

"Hey, I just kissed you. Shouldn't you slap me or say something?"

"I don't remember."

Because her heart was completely empty.

Ares watched Zulu's figure disappearing into the darkness with sad eyes.
