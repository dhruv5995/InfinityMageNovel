Rage (1)

Listening to the sound of his heartbeat, Osgent turned to look at Read.

"Hahaha! This should be fun!"

Watching him prepare for the duel while swinging his wooden sword noisily, murderous intent surged within him.

'Don't kill him?'

If Osgent were to express his feelings through violence, even turning Read to dust wouldn't be enough.

Still, he wanted to hit him.

'What a loser.'

Realizing the murderous intent in his heart, Osgent smiled bitterly.

Damian spoke.

"Osgent, I'm sorry."

Osgent didn't know what he was apologizing for.

"If I hadn't taken you as my son, this wouldn't have happened. But... it can't be helped."

Since time cannot be turned back.

"Father has nothing to apologize for."

Though every word made Osgent angry, it was true that Damian had saved his life.

That made his anger even stronger.

Without saying what he would do, Osgent walked to the dueling ground and gripped his wooden sword.

'With just this...'

Having never truly fought anyone before, Osgent didn't know his exact capabilities.

But he didn't feel like a frog in a well.

Though he had never fought a person, he could cut down dozens of beasts—something impossible for other humans.

"I'd like to go easy on you, but..."

Read tapped his shoulder with his wooden sword as he spoke.

"A true warrior isn't afraid of injury. How much damage could this piece of wood do anyway? Let's go all out."

'How foolish.'

Though it was common sense for those who had reached a certain level, Osgent let out a hollow laugh.

'Even a single chopstick can kill a person.'

"Big brother! Show them the power of the River Clan!"

Even in a situation where it would be awkward to cheer for either side, Smile declared Osgent's victory without hesitation.

'Is she oblivious, or just innocent...'

No, Smile had always been like that.

Unlike Osgent, who examined every possible risk before doing anything, she was always fearless.

'That's why I...'

Osgent erased the thought and extended his wooden sword.

"Let's begin."

At his declaration of war, Read's expression, which had been smiling until now, became terrifyingly calm.

'He's not a complete amateur.'

The unique aura called the Giant's Power was rising from Read's body.

Of course, it was an energy only Osgent's senses could perceive.

"Taha!"

Read charged first, and Osgent belatedly twisted his body.

"Whoa—!"

The watching crowd was quickly captivated by Read's swordsmanship, which was more powerful than expected.

Even Smile, who had always believed Osgent was the best, widened her eyes at the speed of the blade.

Only Osgent, whose expression remained unchanged, was calmly deflecting the attacks.

'He's a strong man.'

He didn't want to belittle him as weak.

He certainly had the skill to represent the Mountain Clan, and he was adept at handling the Giant's Power.

'Just how strong am I...'

That's why he suddenly wondered.

'How strong am I?'

Goosebumps rose all over his body, and he felt an eerie sensation because he had confirmed his martial prowess was on a different dimension.

'Can there really be such a difference?'

Within senses of a completely different dimension that couldn't be compared numerically, Read's movements appeared crystal clear.

'This isn't dodging.'

Read's every movement was being analyzed individually with almost prophetic precision.

Osgent's senses, which could walk ten steps over the course of an entire day, had ultimately reached such a realm.

With only 1 percent of his nerves needed to handle Read, he thought with the remaining 99 percent.

'This man will become Smile's husband.'

The woman who hadn't left his heart for even a moment since the day they first met would be taken away.

His insides boiled with fury.

"Hiyaaah!"

The moment Read made a vertical slash, Osgent twisted his body and took an upward striking stance.

'I'd rather...'

If he struck upward with his sword here, Read's neck would break, but he hastily stopped his movement.

Read, who hadn't received a single attack from Osgent, glared at him with bulging eyes.

"If you're going to do it, do it properly, you loser."

He couldn't understand why Osgent wasn't attacking, but it was clear he was being mocked.

"Let's stop. There's no point in continuing."

Though the whispered conversation between the two didn't spread outside, everyone remained silent in the subtle atmosphere.

"No point? This is a contest to determine who's superior between the Mountain Clan and River Clan. Are you even a warrior if you act like this?"

"I'm not from the River Clan."

The fact that Osgent was the chief's adopted son was obvious just from looking at his hair color.

'What's with this guy?'

Despite being skilled enough to easily deflect his fierce attacks, he was extremely timid and irritable.

'Even if he's not blood-related, would he act like this toward his brother-in-law?'

One possibility flashed through his mind.

"Don't tell me you..."

Read's gaze, which had glanced at Smile before returning, stared directly at Osgent's face.

His originally pale face had lost all its color.

"You perverted bastard!"

At the sudden outburst, both the River Clan and Mountain Clan looked bewildered.

Only Smile continued watching silently.

"I'll beat you to death!"

Read, who already considered Smile his own, spewed out his rage and swung his wooden sword.

But in this moment, the most enraged person was Osgent.

'I'll kill him!'

Anger born from shame obliterated his reason as his sword whipped forward at tremendous speed.

Though impossible to distinguish with the naked eye, Read hadn't moved even one-hundredth of his intended motion.

Hold back.

Hearing the voice in his mind, all sorts of thoughts rapidly flashed through his head.

'If I kill this bastard...'

He would become a murderer.

How would Smile look at him? How sad would Father be? Could he endure everyone's condemnation?

'Hold back! Please hold back!'

Thousands of thoughts telling him he shouldn't do this applied brakes to the rapidly moving wooden sword.

"Aaaahhh!"

A fierce wind blew as the wooden sword came to an abrupt stop.

"Guk!"

In the moment Read froze with a wooden sword that had somehow reached right before his eyes without him noticing—

Crrrrrack!

All the trees in the forest behind him began to fall in the same direction, completely severed.

"Wh-what is that?"

Even Osgent didn't know.

'What?'

Though his senses had reached the pinnacle of physical ability, this phenomenon of things being cut without being cut was his first experience.

'Something inside me erupted.'

The Law.

While thinking about a concept not yet clearly defined, Read lost his reason.

"You son of a bitch!"

The wooden sword he swung with killing intent twisted grotesquely in front of Osgent's face before exploding with a crack.

"Big brother!"

People thought Osgent had taken a direct hit, and Smile also jumped up with a shocked expression.

"You... what the hell are you?"

Only Read, the person involved, was experiencing the eeriness that defied human common sense.

'Vastness.'

The anger in his heart sublimating into principle and affecting the real world.

This was divine transcendence, possible only for the highest-level giants.

"I'll be going back now."

Osgent threw his wooden sword to the ground, bowed deeply to Damian, and left.

Watching his departing son, Damian sighed.

'Are you running away again?'

Even if it meant ruining his daughter's wedding, he had hoped his son would vent his frustration at least once.

'Well, that's just who you are.'

If he could run away forever like that, living a life of eternal endurance was also one way to live.

"I'll go to big brother."

When Smile tried to follow Osgent, Damian grabbed his daughter's wrist.

"Don't go."

"Why? He's my big brother."

Damian couldn't bring himself to say the reason.

But Smile, as if she disliked even that, coldly shook off his hand and turned away.

"You're all cowards."

She was frustrated by what they were all so afraid of.

Osgent, who had gone deep into the mountains where Smile couldn't find him, calmed his mind through meditation.

'Slowly. More slowly.'

He didn't have the courage to face Smile.

'Let's forget.'

He would leave tonight.

As always, he could just run away from the fear he couldn't bear to face.

'I see.'

The realm he had reached through his confrontation with Read came flooding in like a tide through enlightenment.

'Ah.'

As if his brain had opened, endless thoughts flooded in without conscious effort.

Osgent's body naturally floated up, and in a lotus position, both hands rose.

'I have... transcended the physical.'

It was the awakening of a genius.

'Yes, this is enough.'

For him, the sword wasn't a means to achieve something, but an escape from unhappiness.

'This is enough.'

When he opened his eyes after falling into a trance without noticing his tears, the day had already changed.

"I should pack."

The reason he didn't have the courage to meet Smile was because she would have spent the night with Read.

Though they were technically strangers until the wedding ceremony, from what he had observed, most first nights took place on that very night.

His heart felt like it was being torn apart, but he tried to ignore such thoughts as he was about to descend the mountain when—

"Big brother."

Smile was waiting in a corner of the forest.

"Smile."

Even to his own ears, his voice sounded pathetic.

"How did you know?"

Smile sighed and pointed around them.

By Maha's Law, all the trees in the forest were bent to the point of breaking in the same direction.

"This is—"

"No, forget about that."

Her tone was angry, unlike usual.

"Tell me what happened."

So he had been found out after all?

"What?"

"You know this isn't something to ask me about, right? Now it's your turn to talk."

Osgent desperately made excuses.

"I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well today. Please tell Read I'm sorry too. And make sure to have the wedding..."

"Big brother, what if I just don't get married?"

Osgent's face hardened.

"Wh-what are you saying all of a sudden? You can't cancel a wedding that determines the fate of the clans like this."

Though he was saying things he didn't mean, Smile pressed him again.

"Do you know what I did last night?"

All he could think about was running away.

"Of course you..."

"Nothing happened."

Watching Osgent's eyes change, Smile took a deep breath and said,

"Really, don't you have anything to tell me?"

It seemed like she was giving him one last chance.

'Will I have another opportunity?'

The conviction that only now could change anything struck his mind.

'I have to confess. Even swordsmanship can't protect me anymore.'

There would be no realm beyond this.

"Smile."

Osgent grabbed Smile's shoulders.

"Marry Read."

Perhaps Read had been a good judge of character.

'I'm a loser.'

He had been pathetic and incapable of anything from the beginning.

"Get married and live happily. That's what will make the clan and Father happy. If you don't marry, everyone will be unhappy."

"Why is everything so complicated? Just take responsibility for everything."

Osgent smiled sadly.

'How can you say such wonderful things?'

Quiet but encompassing everything as it flows—a great river—Smile had always been someone he admired.

"Take care, Smile. Big brother will now..."

Osgent's head suddenly turned.

"What?"

Wooooooooo.

The air vibrated as clear sound waves wrapped around the entire mountain and moved.

'Vibration?'

Anyone living in Purgatory would recognize the unique vibrational sound of angels.
