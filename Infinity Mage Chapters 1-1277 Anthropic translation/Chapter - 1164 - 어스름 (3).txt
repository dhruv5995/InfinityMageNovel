Twilight (3)

Miro arrived at the harbor, which was Tamo organization territory, and hid behind a container.

"Arius, go see how many there are." Woof.

Originally clever, Arius seemed to understand human speech lately.

Shirone sat with an indifferent expression behind a box containing 30 bombs.

"Brother, if we rob the weapons warehouse with our abilities, the adults won't have to get hurt."

"......Hmm."

The reason they could move boxes weighing hundreds of kilograms was because they had supernatural powers.

Arius, who had returned from patrolling the surroundings, barked softly.

"Let's go, brother."

The two grabbed the bomb box again and activated their supernatural powers simultaneously to move.

Their target was the most lightly guarded among roughly 20 weapons warehouses.

'Over there.'

Two Tamo organization members armed with firearms were guarding the entrance, and a sentry could be seen in the watchtower.

'That's the problem.'

Miro said to Shirone.

"Brother, I'll go up and push that guy off, so you drop the bomb. You can do it, right?"

She doesn't waver.

"......It's dangerous."

"It's fine. Dad will know by now. The Merchant Union will have to move too. While we lure the enemies to their stronghold, the adults will gather weapons. Of course, I'll finish it before then."

Arius whined.

The real Miro, Geukseon, was someone who would do anything to protect what was precious to her.

'Since I'm the strongest, I have to do it. If the adults step in, there will be casualties.'

Of course, her life was also in danger, but if her hypothesis was correct, it would be entirely possible.

"I'm going. Please."

As Miro moved, Shirone looked at the weapons warehouse location with sluggish movements.

'I have to do it?'

He didn't want to think about the reason.

He couldn't remember, but it seemed he had decided to accept the world in the most passive stance.

'Why?'

The feeling that life was important enough to be everything, yet the reluctance to dig deeper.

Shirone silently sent 30 bombs toward the weapons warehouse Miro had designated.

"Huh?"

The sentry squinted at the writhing shadow heading toward the warehouse ceiling.

"What's that?"

He watched with an incomprehensible expression, then suddenly widened his eyes and shouted.

"Bom...!"

His voice was trapped in a barrier of air, and Miro, who had climbed the watchtower, launched a physical attack.

'Now!'

A heart of steel.

Without hesitation, conflict, or anguish, even a twelve-year-old body could defeat an adult.

"Argh!"

The sentry, struck from behind, couldn't do anything before falling below the railing.

Though she had blocked his voice, she couldn't prevent the dull impact sound of him hitting the ground.

"Who's there!"

The guards protecting the weapons warehouse turned toward the sound and spotted Miro.

"Shoot!"

They couldn't confirm it was a child, but even if they had known, it would have been the same.

As bullets rained from all directions, Miro's concentration peaked.

'I didn't tell Dad, but...'

Above her head appeared an incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara with a child's face.

'I can see them.'

Time split infinitely, and Miro's spirit permeated every time frame.

'I'll deflect them all.'

Every time Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's hands moved like afterimages, sparks flew in those spots.

Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting!

After deflecting the bullets, she grimaced in pain.

"Ugh!"

Of course, the incarnation took the impact, but she also felt as if her palms were pierced.

The Tamo group was stunned.

"What? The bullets..."

At that moment, Miro shouted to Shirone.

"Brother! Now!"

The clear sound of safety pins being pulled rang out consecutively, and the Tamo organization looked up.

"Huh?"

The moment they confirmed it was bombs, everyone scattered without delay.

"Ahhh! Take cover!"

An explosion erupted with flames, and the weapons warehouse they were guarding burst wide open.

"Success!"

Miro, who had come down from the watchtower, ran to Shirone and Arius.

"Quick, move! That hurt too much!"

Of course, physical force worked on different principles in dreams, but the strong impact was the same.

"What's happening!"

As Tamo organization members rushed to the explosion site, a survivor said:

"It's bombs! And that kid... deflected bullets!"

"What nonsense! Hurry and chase them!"

The organization members were extremely tense, realizing these weren't simple intruders but ones using firearms.

"Brother! Hurry!"

Woof! Woof!

Having been exposed, Shirone's group ran straight toward the Tamo organization's stronghold.

Though they propelled themselves with supernatural powers, the organization members' mobility was also above average.

"Stop right there!"

As dozens of people simultaneously fired their guns, Miro's heart sank.

'Huh?'

It felt like the bullets weren't reaching them.

Sensing something strange, she turned around and saw Shirone, who had stopped walking, and shouted:

"Brother! It's dangerous!"

As she spoke, a second round of shooting began, and countless flashes filled Miro's vision.

'I can do it.'

That's what Shirone thought.

Whether 30 or 300 bombs, in a world of mind rather than physics, mass didn't matter.

What mattered was the heart that perceived it.

'Speed is the same.'

Human eyes can't properly see bullets, but the mind's eye can.

'I'll catch them.'

The moment he thought it, hundreds of bullets stopped dead in front of Shirone's eyes.

"Shoot! Keep shooting!"

The organization members who had emptied their magazines firing bullets stared blankly as they lowered their rifles.

"What?"

A pitch-black bullet barrier was spread before Shirone.

"Come quickly!"

When Shirone heard Miro's words and turned to move away, the bullets clattered to the ground.

Amid their bewilderment at the incomprehensible situation, one man shouted indignantly:

"See! I told you so!"

Gaold and Gangnan arrived at the harbor.

Half of the Tamo organization had pursued Shirone's group, but half remained to guard the weapons warehouse.

"Damn! What the hell are those guys doing?"

"I know who it is. A girl named Miro. She's Sein's daughter. That annoying little girl."

"Damn it. If we catch them...!"

Before he could finish speaking, Gaold jumped from the container and stabbed with a dagger.

"Who are you!"

As the organization member turned and fired his rifle wildly, his colleague's body instantly became riddled with holes.

Gaold had already left the spot and slashed the enemy's neck from behind with his blade.

"Gack..."

Hearing the gunshots, enemies came running.

"It's an invasion!"

Even with his life hanging by a thread, Gaold calmly entered the warehouse.

"Catch."

Gangnan caught the heavy rifle with both hands.

"Do you know how to use it?"

Even in the place called the real world, he knew nothing about guns.

"No."

Gaold loaded the rifle with a click and went outside the warehouse, pulling the trigger as bullets rained down.

"Damn! Shoot! Keep shooting!"

Under the enemies' return fire, holes were punched in the container and several bullets grazed his earlobes.

Gangnan pulled Gaold back.

"Are you crazy? If you get hit there, it's over!"

Gaold picked up a new rifle from the warehouse and pulled the bolt, saying:

"Same goes for those bastards. If you lose in momentum, you'll die without even getting a shot off."

Gaold knew how to fight.

When he stood at the door again and fired, this time there wasn't even return fire.

Gangnan suddenly remembered.

'That's right...'

He wasn't the type to do things because he could succeed.

"Hehehe, this is pretty good."

Having learned gun usage in actual combat, Gaold picked up whatever he could find and fired at the front.

"That bastard..."

Someone from the Tamo organization shouldered a bazooka and stood up on a box.

A trail of fire followed as a single grenade flew toward the warehouse door.

"Shit!"

The warehouse exploded with a bang, and Tamo organization members fired an enormous amount of ammunition.

"Check it."

Two low-level organization members searched through the smoke.

"What? There's nothing here?"

At that moment, two hands appeared like ghosts behind the organization member and grabbed his throat.

"Gack!"

As Gaold knocked one to the ground, his colleague reflexively turned around.

"Hey! What's happen..."

A dull impact hit his solar plexus, and Gangnan grabbed his neck and struck with his knee.

Crack, the sound of neck bones breaking, and the man's body fell backward.

"Where's Miro?"

Gaold pressed his blade to the fallen organization member's eye.

"G-Gaold sir! It's me! Asto!"

Checking through the smoke, it was a young man who did delivery work in the marketplace.

"Where's Miro?"

The dagger that entered Asto's left cheek passed through his tongue and protruded from his right cheek.

"Hiii! I, I don't know! She, she ran away!"

Had they already left?

"P-please spare me! Gaold sir! I... please..."

"Asto, you see, I'm not the type to fight if enduring today won't change tomorrow."

Because he hated troublesome things.

"Huuu!"

Asto frantically pulled at the handle of a pistol that had fallen to the ground with his fingers.

"But if you interfere with my life..."

The moment Asto grasped the pistol, Gaold pulled the blade that had pierced his cheek.

"I just kill you."

"Huk!"

His cheek tore with a rip, and the next moment the dagger pierced Asto's throat and severed his spine.

"Gack... gack!"

Convulsions wracked Asto's entire body, his pupils rolled back, and soon his breathing stopped.

"..."

Gangnan patted Gaold's back.

"He was trying to kill you."

"I know. It doesn't matter. I would have killed this guy anyway. What feels disgusting is..."

Gaold shook the blood off his blade and said:

"If you're going to interfere with someone's life, at least have the resolve that you might die too."

As Gangnan silently watched his back, the explosion smoke completely cleared.

Dozens of organization members were pointing guns at them.

"...Damn it."

The Merchant Union that Sein had gone to fetch would take at least 20 more minutes to arrive.

"What are you guys? No, that doesn't matter. All that's left is harsh punishment."

The organization member nodded.

"Drag out the woman."

As an organization member armed with a rifle approached Gangnan, Gaold's face contorted.

"Run. I'll hold them off."

"What are you saying? I will absolutely never leave your side..."

As if he had no intention of listening to Gangnan's words, Gaold charged toward the enemies.

'This is why you people don't get it.'

You don't know how to fight.

When Gaold made the first move, the thousands of things that had tormented Gangnan were resolved in an instant.

"Argh!"

Gangnan ran to the side, and all gun barrels focused on the charging Gaold.

Thunderous gunfire.

'Gaold!'

Feeling his heart stop, Gangnan looked back to where Gaold was.

"Huh?"

What Gangnan saw was:

"Graaah!"

Someone with completely bleached white hair blocking bullets.

"Shoot! Keep shooting!"

An air barrier centered on Gaold was deflecting all the bullets.

Gangnan's head snapped straight up.

"What... is that?"

Countless eyes in the dark sky were looking down at the earth.

"Graaaaaah!"

Gaold felt tremendous pain and instinctively aimed his five fingers.

Air Gun.

As tremendously powerful air bullets fired in rapid succession, the enemies in front exploded like watermelons.

"Help! Someone help!"

The organization members turned to flee but were ultimately shredded by the bullets.

"Graaah!"

As Gaold, in shock, fell to his knees, the eyes in the night sky faintly disappeared.

Gangnan realized:

"Awakening."

The more one opened their real-world abilities, the weaker the 1.5-layer barrier became.

'And outside...'

Ymir was waiting to devour this world at any moment.
