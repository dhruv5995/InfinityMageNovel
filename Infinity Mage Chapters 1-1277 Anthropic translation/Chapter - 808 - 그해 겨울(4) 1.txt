That Winter (4)

Shirone relaxed his stance and approached Guy.

"I'm Rian's friend..."

Guy's sword flashed like lightning, and a vertical wind struck with sharp force.

Though it was just wind, it was enough to cut skin, and Shirone turned his head as he dodged to the side.

"No good. You can't let your guard down during war."

Shirone spoke quickly.

"I'm Shirone, Rian's friend. I heard that the eldest son of the Ogent family is in a foreign country as a spy on royal business."

If that was true, Guy wasn't an enemy.

"A spy?"

Guy laughed with his sword resting on his shoulder.

"Who told you I was a spy?"

"Well, your family..."

Guy's laughter stopped abruptly.

"I've heard about it - that my cute youngest brother made a friend. I suppose that would be the current Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower?"

Though his tone was sarcastic, Shirone maintained his courtesy.

"Yes. I am that Five Great Star."

Guy lowered his stance.

"How is Rian?"

"I haven't heard exact news since we parted ways a year ago. But wherever he is, he'll do well."

"Is that so? How unfortunate."

The moment Guy felt shaken, the ground beneath his feet exploded upward with a bang.

"I wanted to send him a final message."

At Guy's figure that had suddenly appeared before his eyes, Shirone cast teleportation.

"Too slow!"

The blade passed by, slicing his neck.

"What?"

With the sense of time-lapse making him feel the past of one second ago as the present, Shirone retreated dozens of meters and gasped for breath.

"Ah, time."

Guy, who had cut down archmages' necks like grapes, was well aware of magic's strangeness.

"Then how about this?"

The black-haired genius applied 'folding' to all seven schemas, and a human's silhouette was stamped into the transparent air with a bang.

Though it couldn't be faster than light, the blade flew in before Shirone could even begin to think.

'Even if you carry a god in your head, the vessel is nothing more than flesh and blood.'

The only thought was dizziness, and before his nine senses could open, the flash swept horizontally.

Kuuuuuuu!

If you could hear the sound of the sun, it would be like the roar of air burning in fire right now.

"How annoying."

Minerva grabbed Shirone's collar and retreated endlessly backward.

Since she couldn't even grasp Guy's movements at a clumsy distance, where she stopped was 280 meters away.

"Are you okay?"

"No. I almost died." Shirone spoke honestly.

"I've never encountered such a strong swordsman before."

Would this be how it feels to fight Rian?

"It's not something you could call... lack of experience. If we're at the peak of magic, that's the peak of swordsmanship."

Minerva's expression wasn't good either.

"Honestly, if they're the same level, I'd avoid swordsmen too. No matter how powerful the mind is, the body is direct. We'll have to keep our distance and face him strategically."

Against lower-level swordsmen, she'd crush them in direct confrontation, but originally this was the standard way to deal with swordsmen.

'Or, we'd have a swordsman of equivalent skill on our side.'

She missed Rian.

"Stay at least 300 meters away. Otherwise, you won't get the reaction time until magic is implemented."

"No. I don't want to fight."

It wasn't just because Guy was strong.

"He's Rian's brother. I don't know why he's in Gustav, but fighting here would be a loss."

"Kid."

From 300 meters away, Guy heard the voice.

"You don't know Rian well. Just as I abandoned my family by choosing the sword, Rian is the same."

Shirone used sound magic.

"No. I know Rian. If we fought for this reason, he'd be disappointed in me."

"That might be so. I don't know how the guy grew up. But you know, even so, you can't die here, can you?"

Guy took a charging stance.

"This time I'll kill you."

At the terrifying fighting spirit visible even from afar, Shirone's eyes sharpened.

"Did you really abandon Tormia? If there are circumstances you can't speak of..."

"Shh."

The small voice sounded as loud as thunder.

"What kind of Five Great Star talks so much?"

Since this wasn't an opponent he could fight while rambling, Shirone also closed his mouth.

"We have to avoid him no matter what. Let's attack from both sides."

As Minerva drew deeply on her pipe, Guy's killing intent rose vertically like a great sword.

Emergency alarms sounded inside Ex Machina.

"Damn! What the hell?"

Iruki stared intently at the results produced by Ex Machina's transcendent computational ability.

"Failure? Why?"

The simulation they'd run thousands of times - when it came to actual battle, the conclusion was that they couldn't kill Havitz.

Gaudio gritted his teeth.

"The variable was imaginary from the start. According to calculations, Havitz should leave the capital to protect Abella."

Then getting his heart pierced by <Legal Murder> was the law that Ex Machina had calculated.

"Does this mean even Alphafish's snare can't bind Havitz to the law?"

Iruki shouted.

"It's too early to give up!"

"What are you going to do?"

"Anyway, we got into Bashken. If we twist the law of <Legal Murder>, we can chase Havitz again!"

Ness's skull-like eyes widened.

"No! It's too dangerous!"

The law acting on <Legal Murder> is enormous, with all laws within a 200-kilometer radius interlocked.

"Since I can do it..."

It's not yours, Albino said.

"I'm doing it."

Light burst from Iruki's eyes as he implemented overdrive.

'Cancellation!'

His Spirit Zone, tracking <Legal Murder>'s location through Ex Machina, canceled the law.

"Aaaaah!"

It was completely different weight from canceling a single magic, and bloody tears flowed from both eyes.

"Iruki! Stop! You have to stop!"

<Legal Murder>, which had been flying straight toward Havitz, curved as its trajectory was braked.

"I just need to reset the coordinates!"

<Legal Murder>'s hatred would handle the rest.

'My head's going to explode!'

Whether his brain would explode in Ex Machina first, or <Legal Murder> would change coordinates first.

"Iruki! If you die here, there won't be a future either!"

That's right.

'No, this is where I must die!'

Because he knew that if he couldn't achieve it now, the end of reason would come.

'A world of chaos will open.'

His vision turned red with blood, and even Ex Machina's monitor became invisible.

"Here it goes!"

Finally, <Legal Murder>'s trajectory turned toward where Havitz was, aiming at chaos once again.

"He did it!"

The people playing cards clenched their fists.

'Well done, Iruki! You did it!'

When there was no response from Iruki sitting in the front, Agaya got up to check.

"Iruki! Iruki!"

He was convulsing with blood continuously flowing from his eyes, nose, and ears.

"Die, die!"

Even while <Legal Murder> was aiming for his heart, Havitz fell into a trance and killed indiscriminately.

"Well, I'll be..."

As Balkan clicked his tongue, a soldier came running.

"General! You must evacuate quickly! Right now to the residential outskirts..."

Before the report could finish, a scream that seemed to tear the air echoed across the sky.

"What!"

At the edge of visibility, a single dagger was circling around like a bug with one wing missing, piercing through soldiers' bodies.

Abella realized the situation and shouted.

"Honey! Stop now and let's go!"

Havitz, who had stopped moving, spotted the flying dagger.

'Tag?'

Just from the dagger's trajectory, you could tell how much it wanted to kill Havitz.

'Then I should run away.'

Havitz, grinning widely, grabbed Abella's hand.

"Puhahaha! Balkan! We're escaping!"

It was a thought that leaped from chaos like a fish, and that thought was always right for Havitz.

"Natasha! Take His Majesty away!"

With Natasha guarding Havitz's rear, the royal guard rushed out of the city en masse.

<Legal Murder> screamed as it followed.

"Damn! What's so fast?"

The dagger that had pierced through people like a needle through paper flew straight toward Havitz.

"Dance of Death."

Natasha stopped in place and, looking back at <Legal Murder>, deployed her transformation technique, causing a skull in black robes to appear.

"I'll destroy you!"

She sprang from the ground like a spring and reached out toward <Legal Murder>, causing the air to ring with a grinding sound.

"What the...!"

<Legal Murder>, avoiding Natasha's hand and wrapping around her body, flew toward Havitz, ignoring her completely.

"Your Majesty!"

Balkan shouted.

"Hm?"

As Havitz blinked and turned around, <Legal Murder>'s blade had arrived, emitting an eerie light.

"What?"

Simultaneously, the world froze in gray.

"Aaaaaaaah."

Following the funeral song heard from the sky, twelve figures in black clothes rose from the ground where Havitz stood.

"We are Sheol."

0.666 seconds of each second.

"Welcome Him."

A doll that looked like its skin had been peeled off in lava emerged and opened its burning eyes.

"Pitiful one, sacrifice of law."

Havitz looked at Satan for a moment, then poked at Abella, who was frozen like ice.

He couldn't feel the sensation of pressing.

"What are you?"

"I am the source of all demons, including you. I am Satan. I have personally come to save you today."

"Save me? From what?"

"Death."

Satan's hand, dripping with blood, pointed at Legal Murder suspended in the air.

"A blade of hatred that even I cannot touch. You can never escape from it. How about making a deal with me?"

Satan brought his index finger to his eyes.

"Become my subordinate and punish the world. Join forces with the demons to dye this world with evil."

"Hmm."

Havitz, who had been lost in thought with his chin propped up, said.

"I don't want to."

Satan's eyes opened bizarrely.

"Are you saying you're fine with dying?"

"I've never thought about that, and the reason I don't want to is because I still want to play more with my friends."

He wanted to play a little more with Abella.

"Even so, you'll die in less than a second."

"That one second is what's fun - that one second."

Havitz couldn't stand even 0.1 seconds of boring things.

"...To be obsessed with something like love. Did I think wrong? I thought you were suitable to receive my grace."

Satan went back into the lava.

"You will regret it."

Listening to the majestic funeral song, Havitz grabbed his wife's wrist with happy eyes.

"Let's go, Abella."

To a world of eternal freedom.

As that 0.666 second was released, <Legal Murder> flew toward Havitz with its momentum intact.

From 0.777 seconds, countless thoughts surged simultaneously in Havitz's mind.

'Team up with Satan to conquer the world?'

A child bringing parents to the playground was disgusting.

'That's nonsense. There are still so many things we can play with just among ourselves.'

0.888 seconds.

0.999 seconds. This was the instant.

"1,411?"

"But I can catch it."

"87 years, 2,875 kyung, 3,241 trillion, 6,442 billion, 890 million, 7,109 hours remaining."

While no one could speak, the man with the chain sickle muttered with a blank expression.

Itaka looked back at Shirone.

"You're not using power-enhancing buffs. Educationally, that's an excellent judgment."

'Destruction Demon God 707.'

Meanwhile, Yahweh2 and the Operator were engaged in an intense search battle.

"Rukia is..."

Rupist answered.

"Uuugh!"

Final Chapter (4)

0.888 seconds.

'I have to have children with Abella too, and I promised Smokeran we'd conquer all the women in the world.'

0.999 seconds.

'How...'

Havitz bared his teeth with a bizarre smile and quickly turned his body.

'What an interesting world this is!'

1 second.

"Gack!"

The sound of <Legal Murder> striking with a thud was heard, and everyone who had been running froze in place.

"H-honey."

Abella turned her head toward Havitz behind her.

"Why...?"

But her neck wouldn't turn, and blood that had flowed backward seeped through her lips.

"Your Majesty."

No one could say anything.

All those who discovered <Legal Murder> embedded in Abella's heart.
