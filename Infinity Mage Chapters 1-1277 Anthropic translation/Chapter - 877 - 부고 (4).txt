"Who is it?"

Maya approached the door and asked cautiously toward the outside.

"Ah, well... I mean..."

A man's voice could be heard, and from his tone, he seemed extremely nervous.

'Who could it be?'

Though she was also a graduate of a prestigious magic school, Palmers had always told her to be wary of her surroundings.

Especially when she was alone at a hotel.

"I'm sorry. I don't know how to explain this. Should I say we saw you by chance from outside? Anyway..."

As the man rambled, another voice was heard.

"Idiot, move aside."

After clearing his throat with a cough, he spoke.

"We're fans of Maya. We happened to see you... could we possibly get an autograph?"

Normally, she would gladly give autographs under Palmers' supervision, but now it was awkward.

"I'm sorry, but..."

Maya, who was about to politely decline, stopped speaking.

'I can't live like this.'

Rather than expecting something in particular, she wanted to let a new wind blow into her heart.

"Please wait a moment."

When Maya put on her coat and gently opened the door, two men of similar age stepped back in surprise.

"Wow, it's really Maya."

Even when watching a performance from VIP seats, they couldn't see her face this close.

'What an unreal face.' The aura surrounding someone they admired had elevated her from a mere human to a divine being.

"Hello! We're fans!"

Seeing they didn't seem like bad people, Maya unlocked the door and opened it completely.

"Yes. Nice to meet you. Um... the autograph?"

Since it was something they said in haste, they weren't prepared to receive autographs.

The man, thinking quickly, turned his friend around and slapped his back.

"Please sign here. I'll never wash it and treasure it forever!"

She burst into laughter.

After giving autographs to both men, Maya closed the pen cap and grabbed the door handle.

"Well then, take care."

"Ah, wait!"

The man who hastily reached out his hand realized it was rude and scratched his head with the hand he pulled back.

"If you haven't eaten yet, would you like to have a meal together? About the autographs and all, we'd like to treat you."

"What? A meal?"

"Ah, if it makes you uncomfortable, you can refuse. It's just such a dream-like situation..."

Maya's eyes filled with sadness as she looked at the man anxiously waiting for an answer.

'Shirone...'

If the person standing here, the person who would go between heaven and hell with just one word from her, were Shirone.

'He would have been so happy he couldn't even speak.'

But that would never happen, so it was just a fantasy in her head as always.

'I need to break free now.'

When Maya didn't answer for a long time, the man understood it as a refusal and bowed his head.

"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said..."

Maya smiled and said.

"No. Since we've met like this, it's fate. Let's eat together. I was just getting hungry anyway."

"What?"

Since he thought there was a 99% chance of being rejected from the start, the man's face went blank.

"Really?"

Maya quickly blocked herself from trying to substitute Shirone's face onto the man's again.

"Why would I lie? And what's wrong with eating together?"

"But Maya, you're a celebrity..."

"Haha! Don't celebrities get hungry? Let's go. But you have to buy me something delicious."

Are you watching, Shirone?

'I'm popular too. Even these handsome noble men are completely smitten by my words.'

A bit of competitive spirit.

"Yes! We'll treat you to the finest!"

And with perhaps a glimmer of hope that she might be able to forget Shirone, Maya left the hotel.

200 meters away from the hotel where Maya was staying, Shirone and Bischoff sat facing each other in a tavern.

"How much can you drink?" With moderately sized meat appetizers in front of them, Bischoff poured alcohol into his own glass.

"I don't drink much."

If he meant the limit his mind could endure, Shirone's drinking capacity would be infinite.

"I see."

When Bischoff raised his glass with a bitter smile, Shirone toasted with both hands.

Looking down at his drink, Shirone said.

"Master, about Guy..."

"There's no need."

He hadn't arranged this drinking session just to receive comfort.

"How was he? Guy, I mean. I hope he wasn't at a disappointing level."

He wanted to know how far the eldest son of the Ogent family had managed against an infinite mage.

"He was strong."

Shirone could say with certainty.

"Not just his swordsmanship, but his spirit too - he had no hesitation in carrying out his beliefs."

"I see."

Bischoff reminisced about Guy.

"You're wrong, Shirone. Guy was weak. That's why he died."

Shirone sipped his drink silently.

"If winning fights, surviving, just those things are strength, then there are no strong people in the world. Humans are weak. They die just from being struck by lightning."

"It must have been a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes."

"There's no excuse. If that boy had truly been strong, he wouldn't have been obsessed with visible strength. He was consumed by fear. He lost to you, and to Lian too."

Bischoff looked out the window.

"...There must have been things he had to bear as the eldest son of the Ogent family. That burden must have been heavier than expected. I bear much responsibility."

Though his face couldn't be seen as he turned away, Shirone thought Bischoff was crying.

The atmosphere was heavy but not despairing, and they drank in memory of Guy.

Around sunset, Bischoff stood up.

"I'm going back first. Reina must have a lot on her mind too. Can you give us about a day?"

"Yes, of course. I'll return tomorrow."

"I'll pay the bill."

Not long after Bischoff left the tavern, Shirone also stood up.

'This is difficult.'

As he walked down the street organizing his thoughts, he saw people peering through the tavern window.

"Isn't that just someone who looks similar?"

"Does that look like just a resemblance to you? That's really Maya."

Shirone's steps stopped.

"Maya?"

"So that's the story behind it. No wonder the lyrics struck a chord from the first time I heard them."

"No, the lyrics weren't particularly well-written..."

Maya waved her hands frantically.

"You don't need to be modest. Sincerity gets through. Hearing your story made me even more of a fan."

Mason, one of the two fans who had come to the hotel, poured alcohol into Maya's glass.

"But unrequited love, I can't believe it. Just listening to it frustrates me."

Tito, Mason's friend, chimed in.

"That's right. There's a line of people who like Maya. You must have received many confessions, right?"

"Confessions? No, not really..." Suddenly one man came to mind.

'Cayden.'

Sometimes when life was hard and she recalled the graduation exam, there was always a lingering question.

'Why did he give up on the test?'

At first, she thought she was lucky.

But as she experienced society, she learned that such absurd incidents don't exist.

'He was strong enough to be a member of the Gold Ring. He definitely gave up on purpose. And I passed.'

Maybe there was a clear reason.

'I wonder if he's living well?'

If she met him at Fisho's funeral, she definitely wanted to ask about that day.

"That's right."

Maya said with a smile.

"I've forgotten all about it now. Why should I care about such a guy? I'm going to meet someone new now."

Mason's face lit up as he spoke.

"Haha! Good thinking. Well then, a toast to Maya's new love!"

"Sounds good! Cheers!"

Tito, who had been watching Mason's excitement, chuckled and stood up.

"I should get going now."

"Huh? Leaving already?"

"I forgot I had plans with my girlfriend. Sorry, Maya. Let's have another drink together next time."

Mason was almost in tears.

'Thank you, my friend.'

Tito winked.

"Take good care of Maya. See you later."

After paying for the drinks and opening the door, Shirone brushed past Tito as he entered.

'Is it okay for her to drink that much?'

Watching the table from afar, there were already many empty bottles.

"Maya, so you were here."

When Shirone approached the table, Maya's smiling face immediately hardened.

"Sh-Shirone."

She felt as if she had committed a crime.

"I saw you while passing by. Who is this gentleman?"

Mason, reading the atmosphere, stood up and offered a handshake.

"I'm a fan of Maya's. I like her so much that I'm treating her like this."

"Nice to meet you. I'm a school friend."

"Ah, I see."

Mason understood immediately, and as expected, Maya's face darkened.

'Right, just a school friend.' That's all it was.

"Should we head back? I'll walk you home."

Anyway, Maya was a famous entertainer, and the glances from outside the window were also concerning.

"Why?"

Her tone was unusually cold.

"Why would you walk me home? I'm having fun right now. Don't worry about me and go ahead."

"No, I'm worried so..."

"So what are you worried about? I'm not captured by bad people, and I can't even drink as I please?"

"Because you're drinking too much."

Maya's eyes grew intense.

"Don't look down on me. I'm also a proper mage who passed the graduation exam. I don't want to be interfered with over something like this."

Shirone, lost in thought, nodded.

"Alright. Get home safely."

When Shirone left, Mason sat down while gauging Maya's mood.

"Are you okay?"

Maya gulped down her drink and laughed refreshingly.

"I did it! I did well just now, right? I finally told him off. Ah, I feel so relieved."

"If Maya says so, then it's good. But are you really okay?"

"Yes! Let's drink more!"

Maya, who drank until midnight, arrived at the hotel with Mason's support.

"Maya, try to focus. Your legs are giving out."

"I'm fine. I'm a mage. You know Spirit Zone? If I just concentrate, I can sober up from this kind of alcohol right away."

She just didn't want to sober up.

"Mason, want to come in and have another drink?"

"What? No, that's..."

Maya stared intently at Mason.

"I don't want to be alone. I feel like I'll go crazy."

Mason, who hadn't moved for a while, gritted his teeth again and led Maya.

"Let's go up first. People pass through the lobby."

After climbing the stairs and reaching Maya's room, he released his support and breathed heavily.

"Whew. Maya, where's the key?"

"Sob. Sob."

Maya's shoulders shook as she leaned her face against the door.

"Telling me to forget..."

When Mason turned around, Maya's face was covered in tears.

"How could I possibly forget!"

"Maya..."

Shirone was listening from behind the wall to the sorrowful crying that echoed through the corridor.

Mason found the key, opened Maya's room, and handed it back to her.

"Please go in, Maya. I should get going too."

Maya hurriedly wiped away her tears.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I..."

"This might be presumptuous, but I have something I want to say."

When Maya looked up with wet eyes, Mason smiled and said.

"Unrequited love is still love. If forgetting is harder than the pain of watching from afar, don't force yourself."

"Mason."

"Cheer up. I'll always be rooting for you."

After showing her his clenched fist, he left without looking back.

"Sigh."

The spring breeze was cold when he came outside.

"So it's this again this time?"

Tito was standing in front of the hotel.

"You didn't leave?"

"I came by for a moment. How many times has this happened? That's why you're living as a lifelong bachelor."

"Stop it. I'm already going crazy with regret."

"Keke, you'll regret it for life."

"Still... she'll remember me, right?"

Mason, looking up at the hotel, said proudly.

"At least it wasn't embarrassing. Honestly, I was really cool. Can you even imagine?"

Tito chuckled and hit the back of Mason's head.

"Let's go drink."

Spring will come someday.
