Death Match (2)

11 AM.

At Delta Headquarters, Shirone was still the only one who knew of Rebecca's death.

Murderous intent flashed in Shirone's eyes.

'Habitz.'

The fact that her death hadn't been perceived meant that the Vanishing hadn't been lifted yet.

'Should I tell them?'

Probably, but even if Shirone spoke up, who would believe her?

'Even I'm uncertain. I don't even know exactly who Habitz is. It feels like my senses are twisted.'

It was like trying to identify objects through touch alone, or listening to someone speak with your ears blocked.

Either way, he definitely existed.

'Should I track him?'

Shirone heightened her 11th sense to extract information about Habitz.

'Impossible.'

It was the action of the law that had been occurring since good and evil were separated in Ultima.

'The event of me meeting Habitz won't happen. Therefore, the situation just now was...'

Intentional on Habitz's part.

'Why? There's nothing good that could come from approaching me. What's the reason for this sudden change?'

Wizard.

If something major had happened to Habitz, it would only be his contact with her.

'If Habitz is alive...'

Wizard was likely not alive.

'Don't think about it.'

There were too many variables that could occur to make a definitive judgment based on one condition.

'I'll trust Wizard.'

As she entered the Tormia sector, the guards who had been waiting informed Shirone.

"Everyone is waiting."

Among the gathered executives of the Tormia Guard, Dante was preparing a briefing.

"Shirone."

Rufist asked.

"Do you know something? I have no idea why we're all gathered here."

"Habitz..."

At that moment, the Vanishing was lifted.

"Huh?"

Dante came to his senses, and the others also looked around.

Albino muttered with a disgusted expression.

"Has it already started?"

"Yes. Rebecca is dead. He mercilessly ended her life right before my eyes."

That was probably what happened.

"When?"

"About 30 minutes ago. I don't know why he didn't lift the Vanishing immediately, but..."

"He's controlling the time of death," Dante said.

"He kills one person per hour. If we know Rebecca's time of death, we can pinpoint when another victim will occur. That's not what Habitz wants."

Lilia asked.

"But can he fool everyone like that? The exact timing of when to lift the Vanishing, I mean."

"It's possible. It's not a coincidence that we realized it the moment Shirone came in. It's intentional."

"Ah..."

God's frequency.

Albino nodded.

"He kills someone with Vanishing, reads our minds, and lifts it at the time he wants. What he wants is a game. He's trying to enjoy watching how the board plays out."

Rufist said.

"Let's start by understanding the situation."

Dante headed to the chart, and Shirone took a seat with the Guard executives.

Guard Captain Rai, Mobile Unit Captain Tess, and Security Captain Diane, who was Amy's older brother.

"Shirone."

Shirone shook the hand Tess extended and bowed to Rai and Diane as well.

Dante spoke.

"I'll begin the briefing. Now that Habitz has declared his killing game, the most important thing is identifying friend from foe."

Dante pointed to Kashan's flag.

"As a strong candidate for leadership, the alliance structure isn't complex. They're currently in a strong alliance with the Moon Kingdom."

Tess raised his hand.

"I understand Kashan humiliated the Moon Kingdom. Are they still in a strong alliance?"

"Politics isn't done on emotion alone. Now the only card Moon has is mutual destruction alongside Kashan. Since Kashan knows this too, the alliance system will be maintained for the time being."

Dante continued his explanation.

"Next, Tormia, Jincheon, Corona, and the Tribal Union have formed a weak alliance."

Rai asked.

"What's the criteria for strong versus weak alliances?"

"If one side collapses and the other allied nations also suffer damage, it's a strong alliance. Conversely, weak alliances have weak unity, but damage to allied nations doesn't immediately harm one's own country."

Dante pointed to Jive.

"Jive, Iron, and Arachne are in a strong alliance. I'm sure you understand the reason without explanation. Currently, Jive's King Gis is involved in a sexual scandal. Depending on the outcome, Iron and Arachne will also suffer damage."

Albino asked.

"Isn't this sexual scandal Arachne's work? This is different from Kashan and Moon, isn't it?"

"Of course, but according to intelligence, the side that colluded with Arachne is estimated to be an internal Jive faction - Raymond, Gis's political rival."

Either way, it was Jive.

'So it was an internal faction.'

Shirone realized the source of the unease she'd felt when meeting with Rangi.

'That's why he couldn't reveal it. Well, it wasn't a lie. That's why Mikael couldn't catch it either.'

Dante said.

"Paras, Kesia, and Gustav are known not to follow alliance strategies. This means their goal isn't to become the leading nation. We'll need to approach them carefully to gain their votes."

Rufist asked.

"What happened to Paras? He was hit by Sal, wasn't he?"

"Information is difficult to gather. They're not conducting any exchanges with other nations at all. We only received word that they'll announce the king's official death soon."

Albino chuckled.

"This should be quite a show."

"I'm leaning that way too, but we won't be able to judge until we actually confirm it."

Dante turned from the chart.

"The reason alliance structures matter is ultimately the vote. Rom, Garto, Temika. Depending on where these votes go, the entire situation could reverse, and only each nation's representative has this authority."

Lilia said.

"Even if they're unconscious from Sal's attack, they still retain voting rights."

Dante nodded.

"That's why Habitz's declaration is important. Currently, Princess Pony is in critical condition, but that fact doesn't reduce the risk of assassination. If someone draws a blade, it's likely to happen within the interests of the nations I just briefed about."

Albino said.

"Isn't this actually a good situation? When it comes to assassination, Tormia has a decent hitman too."

It was Farka Kuan.

"Yes. I classified the assassination capabilities of the 12 nations into offense and defense and ran simulations. Certainly, Tormia's offensive power ranks at the top with 94 points."

While this was good news, Rufist understood Dante's real intention.

'Our offensive power is second to none. Conversely, our defensive power could be a weakness.'

Of course, Guard Captain Rai was an excellent swordsman, but war was ultimately about relativity.

'If Lian were here...'

He indulged in sweet fantasies for a moment, but unrealistic assumptions were always poison.

"I understand."

Rai, sensing the mood, confessed.

"Our defensive power is inferior compared to other nations. I'll engrave our weaknesses into my bones and strengthen them as much as possible."

Though spoken calmly, everyone could imagine the shame he felt.

'Damn it.'

Rai clenched his fists.

'Why am I...'

Not as strong as Lian?

He had never been complacent just because he was born with talent superior to others.

'Then why couldn't I reach it? What did Lian do more than me? If anything, that guy was the world's most...'

Suddenly, this thought occurred to him.

'Ah.'

Was it because he lacked talent?

No matter how far he ran, did Lian have to run much farther?

'No matter how much I swung my sword, Lian, that guy...'

'Don't think about it.'

Rai shook his head.

'Don't try to find it in others. I'll reach it myself. I'll become strong with what I have.'

Once the mood settled, Albino asked.

"Who's the strongest?"

"The nation with the highest total score in assassination capability is Kashan. Pungzhang will handle offense, while Kashan's Royal Guard - Geun, Jung, and Won - handle defense. But the most difficult obstacle is believed to be Guard Captain Kido."

'Kido.'

Though they were in opposition, Shirone's emotions were complex as she listened to Dante's words.

'Right. Kido is strong.'

She didn't know much about swords, but he was a friend who had risked his life when exploring Andre's world.

'His conviction is incredible too.'

Albino asked.

"Evaluation aside, can Tormia's offense numerically break through Kashan's defense? In other words, can Kuan cut down Kido and take Uorin's head?"

Dante said.

"Kido's profile hasn't been updated since he moved from Radum to Kashan. However, we expect he's accumulated considerable insight through his Feeding ability 'Taste of Memory.' Even in head-to-head combat simulations with Kuan, we couldn't derive a result."

Rufist agreed.

"He seemed capable of responding to Habitz to some degree. There's a reason Uorin keeps him close."

Dante's expression became resolute.

"Kido is a formidable wall. However, as an information mage, my personal opinion is that no wall can stop Kuan. His level with the sword is beyond counterable."

Dante's true talent lay not in his own abilities, but in evaluating others' capabilities.

Albino sipped his tea.

"Ho, so he can pierce through Kashan too?"

"If the balance of offense and defense follows common sense, it's possible. We can't know exactly how other nations will balance their offensive and defensive ratios. For example, if Kashan puts Pungzhang on defense and Kido on offense, their total capability would actually decrease. It's inefficient. However, I'd summarize by saying that inefficient gambles constantly occur in war."

Rufist understood.

"I see. From Tormia's standpoint, nothing would be more inefficient than putting Kuan on defense and sending Rai on offense. Ah, don't take offense, Guard Captain."

"It's fine. I'm convinced." This time, even Rai had no room for emotion.

"We can predict the opponent's strategy, but we need to be able to respond to irregular tactics too. If we're at that level, it's sufficient. Let's push forward with the existing strategy."

Albino asked back.

"You mean, let's go after the white-haired one?"

It was Uorin.

"Looking at the alliance structure, it's the only force Tormia can't control. We'll take some losses, but the thirsty one has to dig the well."

"I agree. Hoping for others to do something for you is trying to get something for nothing. The problem is, no one in this world actually gets something for nothing."

Dante said.

"Strategically speaking, Kuan's offensive power is strong enough to break through any nation. However, the variable that came up in internal rehearsals is what we need to confirm first..."

"Olivia Siena."

Albino twirled his beard.

"The woman that sword demon loves enough to risk his life for. She's also the reason he lost an arm."

"Yes. In intelligence strategy, what's important isn't capability but reducing risk. Olivia Siena is a capable teacher, but she could also become Kuan's shackle. This seems like something that should be based on the Thunder God's judgment rather than intelligence."

Albino looked at Shirone and asked.

"Are you asking me to weigh the efficiency of protecting Olivia Siena versus just killing her?"

Dante nodded.

"Yes."
