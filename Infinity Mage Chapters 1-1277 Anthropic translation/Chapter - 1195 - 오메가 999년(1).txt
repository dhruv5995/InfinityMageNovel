Omega Year 999 (1)

As more humans around the world fell under the influence of the pyramids erected everywhere, the magic of the shadow world grew stronger.

That amplified magic was transmitted directly to the demon race, contributing to their assault on the impregnable ivory tower.

"Charge! Charge!"

The demon race looked as if every creature in the world had been randomly crossbred with humans.

"Bring down intellect! We are the victorious First Legion!" Their might, befitting their title, was so overwhelming that even the stars of the ivory tower could barely hold them back.

Minerva shouted.

"Where's Sirone?"

Sirone, who had activated Ataraxia's Body Strike technique, had already disappeared deep into the demon army.

"I can't see him! He either entered the ivory tower...!"

Or failed to enter.

At that moment, a thunderous roar erupted from the entrance of the ivory tower, and a pillar of light ascended to the heavens.

'There he is.'

She could feel the power of Body Strike.

'He's desperate to save Taesung. But he can't maintain it for long. We need to send support.'

The stars of the ivory tower were concentrating their power to break through, but the demons' resistance was growing stronger.

It was like trying to split a rock with a wedge, only to have the rock bite back instead.

'We can't break through with frontal assault.'

Minerva spoke.

"Mimoon."

From a pool of human blood, a woman's face bulged upward.

"Yes, Five Great Stars." She was a first-star resident of the ivory tower, a mimic capable of melting flesh like slime.

"Abandon the battlefield and go to the ivory tower. Help Sirone. Someone needs to get inside."

"Understood."

As Mimoon disappeared back into the blood pool, a familiar voice came from behind.

"Five Great Stars."

Golden-haired Ariana, radiating healthy beauty, was carrying Mini on her chest.

Minerva turned around completely.

"Can't you two travel normally for once?"

"Don't you know pairs are one body? The demons are getting stronger. In an hour, they'll surpass the ivory tower's combat power. We need to break through now."

"Got a method?"

"Use the wedge strategy to the extreme. Mass teleport the demons away in a triangular formation. When there's a momentary gap, we strike with everything we've got."

It made sense.

"A modest-sized wedge won't work. It needs to be an enormous wedge. Plus, if we fall with mass teleport, we'll be trampled to death by demons the moment we arrive."

Mini was prepared for death.

"That's why Ariana and I should do it. The Corona Kingdom lacks the skill to leave only allies behind."

Ariana added.

"Above all, Master Sirone is fighting on the front lines. I think our department should handle this."

"Sister."

A voice came from the defense line.

"I'm sorry."

The bodies of third-star resident Gale and satellites Moskochi and Marie split apart.

"Kahaha! We're winning!"

The remaining stars were fighting desperately, but they wouldn't last another five minutes.

'Right. You did well, you trash.'

Most of the stars in the Human Safety Enforcement Department were once threats to humanity.

"Fine, we'll go with that strategy," Minerva said.

"But I'll execute it. I'll blow away the demons, so you break through the entrance and help Sirone."

"But..."

Minerva shook her head.

"If we're doing it, better to do it right. Besides, I'd have the best chance of survival, wouldn't I?"

It was a sad lie.

"Yes. I'm sorry."

"Get ready."

As soon as the order was given and the stars scattered, Minerva looked back at the ivory tower.

'Sirone.'

You've become much prettier.

'Thank you for saying that.'

According to the changes in the law, she was no longer a witch who incited people's desires.

'But...'

The wounds carved in her heart were too deep to be comforted by just that.

'I'm still a witch. The great witch of an era who drove countless people to death.'

Minerva's body transformed into that of a ten-year-old girl.

'Nothing can wash it away.'

The heart remembers.

That time when she had to suffer in the hands of adults, that body of that appearance.

It hurts! It hurts!

It's okay.

Because it's not me who's in pain.

"Graaah!"

Tears flowed from the girl's face.

'That's when I realized.'

When moving your jaw to chew food, no one pays attention to it.

'Just repeating, repeating again, continuing and continuing until their desires are satisfied...'

What are humans?

'Just machines that torment people.'

Though she was prepared to pay any price for her sins, there was one thing that would never change.

'I don't regret it.'

The fact that she could not forgive humans.

'So, Sirone.'

Don't forgive me.

Minerva's Spirit Zone maintained its wedge shape while growing at tremendous speed.

Friend-or-foe identification of over ten thousand units was completed in an instant, and her body began to glow brightly.

"Mass Teleport."

A triangle of light appeared in the demon camp and vanished completely as if evaporating.

Mini shouted.

"I can see the entrance!"

Though it was a passage as thin as a needle, it was a point they couldn't have reached any other way.

"Charge!"

Corona's forces roared in unison, and the remaining stars struck toward the entrance with all their might.

A dull collision sound echoed through the snowy mountains 20 kilometers from the ivory tower.

"Gugh!"

Minerva's body, blocking the attack with Jet, was embedded in the ice cliff like an engraving.

The demons were furious.

"Damn pest."

Considering the demons' abilities, she needed to be at least 20 kilometers away to buy time.

But they too were elite among elites who had fought in the world war as members of the First Legion.

"Don't think we'll just kill you quickly."

Simultaneously with Mass Teleport, they grasped the situation and were pressing Minerva hard.

Cracks gradually appeared in the ice cliff, and Minerva fell 10 meters down.

"Phew."

The 10-year-old girl leaning against the wall looked at the demons with an expression of complete resignation.

'Wait, you trash. Big sister will join you soon.'

The demons approached.

"Hehe, looks like you've given up. Well, there's nobody here to help you."

Her body curled up.

"You won't be able to move a finger. Can't have you committing suicide, right? I wonder how many hours you'll last?"

"Suicide."

Minerva chuckled.

'That would have been better. If I had died alone and disappeared, the great disaster wouldn't have happened either.'

Countless people died from the Walking Dead she had unleashed.

'Afraid of dying?'

She had actually tried to hang herself once, but the reason she couldn't bring herself to die was.

'Anger.'

So angry she wanted to die, yet even angrier at herself for being unable to die...

'I really want to die!'

Even when the rope was around her neck, the faces of those bastards still alive flickered before her eyes.

'I'll kill them all!'

She became a witch.

"You brats, think you're so great? You're just moved by mere human emotions."

As killing intent blazed in Minerva's eyes, the ability restraining her was released.

"Do you know who I am?"

Looking at the demons filling the landscape as they charged, Minerva put her pipe in her mouth.

"I'm the one who created 〈Law Kill〉."

"Kill her!"

Toxic smoke poured from her mouth.

Walking Dead.

20 minutes later.

"Gugh! Grrgh!"

Minerva, with both legs broken and her right shoulder dislocated, crawled across the snow.

"Tough bitch."

Only 7 demons remained.

"Hah. Hah."

As Minerva crawled to the cliff and leaned her back against it, the demons approached with twisted grins.

"How unfortunate. If you'd been lucky, you might have survived even after pulling off such an incredible operation."

Minerva spat out the blood pooled in her mouth.

"So what. Idiots."

Without an archmage's mental strength, her life would have already been extinguished given her condition.

"Hehe, that's more like it. It'll be tough to handle your dead comrades' share too."

She wiggled her left hand hanging on the ground.

"Yeah, come on. Try me."

Even facing death, such tremendous killing intent emanated that the demons frowned.

"What kind of thing is this? More vicious than demons."

"Enough. We don't have time, so let's finish quickly. Once we peel off the skin, she'll cry on her own."

The demons approached Minerva, who had no strength left to resist, and touched her arm.

'I'll never cry.'

She could see the gray sky in her eyes.

'Right, I'm coming too, you trash. I'll probably suffer for a few hours though.'

"Let's start here."

Just as she thought the blade cutting her wrist was cold as ice, she heard the sound of wind.

Lines were drawn across the demons' bodies, and they instantly began turning into pieces.

"What bastard...! Gack!"

As the last demon fell with its throat cut, a familiar form wavered before her eyes.

"Sirone?"

She shook her head.

'No, different.'

The appearance was identical to Sirone's, but the cold eyes were far from Yahweh's spirit.

'Probably.'

She spoke.

"Sacred Brain."

The official name was "someone's unknown brain," but Minerva had a vague idea.

"What brings you to such a place?"

As if conversation was burdensome, Brain erased Sirone's appearance and returned to its original form.

"Answer me. You didn't even participate in factional fights, so why did you suddenly change your mind?"

Brain cast an illusion again.

She had seen his countless forms before, but this was definitely a first.

Therefore, it was his true form and also...

"Gaian. Right?"

Metallic hair hung long, there were no eyebrows, and his expression was calm.

Sacred Brain spoke.

"I am Adam. The beginning of all humans and the last Gaian remaining in this world."

He corrected himself.

"Precisely, just the brain."

"Seems so. But that's not important to me. Why did you come here?"

"To say farewell."

"Farewell?"

Minerva sneered.

"I know Taesung's criteria for determining fourth-star rank. Even in the same department, I wouldn't be your subordinate, would I?"

Adam looked at the sky.

"I became a star of the ivory tower and imitated countless human lives. To decode the law. I feel only sorry about your life. It's my responsibility."

"What is?"

"Everything. We ruined it. It wasn't only her fault. I should have stopped it."

"Woorin?"

Adam didn't answer.

"The end is approaching. Only my brain can calculate the law. I will reverse what went wrong."

"Don't talk nonsense. I have no intention of letting you get away with that. Kill me. That's atonement for me."

"It's still too early, my daughter."

Adam, rising to the sky, was enveloped in smoky light.

"Death is not the only atonement. Existence is subordinate to necessity, so the day will come when you realize your purpose."

If Adam could truly calculate the law, these weren't words to be dismissed lightly.

"Where are you going?"

Adam looked toward the distant sky.

"To Eve."

Watching a streak of light fly away, Minerva tilted her body and collapsed sideways.

"Gugh! Gugh!"

Crawling to grab her pipe, she lay down and took a puff.

"Phew."

The gray clouds looked like her subordinates' faces.

"Sorry. Can I live a little longer?"

At that moment, as if by magic, the snowstorm cleared and sunlight illuminated the snowy mountains.
