The World We Live In (2)

Far from Green Ocean where the racial war was being fought, there was a temporary camp.

In the shabby barracks, common angels had gathered, with an equal number of fairies tending to them.

"Sniffle. Sniffle."

"Stop your whimpering already. It's annoying." When one angel shed tears lamenting their situation, as if on cue, they all began to cry.

Just like newborn babies.

"Ugh, seriously."

The fairies, who had initially shown some respect, no longer viewed them as angels.

"If you're going to keep crying like that, just go to sleep. You should consider us who have to tend to you."

"S-sorry."

When one angel curled up and lay down, once again all the angels followed suit.

These were beings who had once imposed their will upon the world through unique concepts received from God.

"Hey. Everyone gather around." Once the angels had quieted down, the captain of the attendants gathered the fairies in one place.

"Tending to them like this is too inefficient. Let's just gather all the angels in one place and take turns watching them in shifts. About 20 at a time."

"That sounds good. Honestly, apart from it being hard work, I'm sick to death of the angels' whining. If it weren't for the racial war, I'd just punch them..."

At that moment.

"Ooooooh!"

The angels' eyes suddenly opened wide as their unique attribute of vibration occurred.

"Wh-what?"

Where the fairies hurriedly turned their heads, hundreds of pillars of light were rising.

"...They've returned."

The halos appearing one by one above the angels' heads made the truth undeniable.

'They really did it?'

Had just three archangels gone to the sun and changed the divine law that God had established?

Like corpses rising from graves, the angels slowly raised their bodies.

"Kesker."

The captain of the attendants flew over like an arrow.

"Yes! Did you call for me!"

Having already committed certain acts, his mind was hazy and his small body trembled.

Of course, the angels knew too.

Therefore, their gazes toward the fairy weren't kind, but it had been a terrifying time for them as well.

'How horrible it is to lose one's standards.'

Since it was something they never wanted to experience again, punishing the fairy could wait.

"Where is Lord Uriel?"

"A-at Green Ocean..."

The angels who surveyed the battlefield through 'Divine Sight' spread their wings of light and took flight.

'Please wait just a little longer.'

As countless flashes of light flew away in succession, the fairies asked Kesker:

"What do we do?"

"What do you mean what do we do?"

Kesker's face turned mournful.

"We follow them."

Lollipop nervously scratched his nails.

"Quickly. Please, quickly." The data currently being transferred was 100 percent precognition that could never be obtained in reality.

'If we can hold out for just one more tick, humanity's future will change.'

The operator pointed ahead.

"Look, this is rebooting, right?" When Lollipop raised his head, lights were turning on one by one on the fallen Jet's face.

"Damn it!"

He hurriedly looked down and checked the progress.

'64 percent.'

If the main system reactivated like this, they would be counter-attacked and all files would be destroyed.

'I need to cut the connection. Even if the file gets corrupted, some recovery should be possible.'

Should he be satisfied with this?

The reaction speeds of machines and humans were incomparable - he had to rely on intuition.

The operator said:

"You judge and decide. Whatever the result, I won't blame you."

"Nnnngh..."

Lollipop's eyes filled with determination.

'One second. Just one more second...'

The data contained in that one second might save hundreds of thousands of lives.

'It's still okay. About 3 seconds...'

At that moment, without any context, his vision went dark and his hand moved toward the disconnect button.

'I cut it.'

Simultaneously, with a humming sound, light began entering the main system's pillar.

"Huff! Huff!"

The number on the hologram read 83 percent.

"I did it! I was faster."

His hands frantically input keywords.

"Good, I've restored the corrupted files. Now, let's thoroughly dig into what you know."

Just as he was about to access the files, Freeman quickly approached and snatched the equipment away.

"What are you doing?"

Lollipop's eyes widened as he looked up.

The executives of the Parrot Mercenary Group had surrounded them, weapons drawn.

"Why, why are you doing this?"

"Sorry."

Marsha, who had received the equipment, said:

"No one can access this information. I'll take this. I'll compensate you instead."

"How can you do this? Give it back! That's mine! There's an important program in there..."

"Shh."

6th Squad Leader Snyder pressed a dagger to Lollipop's throat from behind.

"Stop it. This is about humanity's future. It's better for your health if you lose interest."

The threat was chilling, but what angered him more was the cold attitude of someone he'd been close with like a brother.

"Hmph! Now you say that? Fine. Go ahead and stab me. Try it, you old lady!"

"What? Old lady?"

Marsha's eyes flashed dangerously.

"I'll really kill you! You think this is a joke? We're really scary people!"

"Then do it! You don't even have the confidence! Or give me back my equipment!"

Snyder asked:

"...Should I eliminate him?"

Marsha was annoyed.

"Is that something to say to a kid? Just placate him somehow! Give him some candy or something!"

As she turned and walked away, Snyder clicked his tongue and lowered the dagger.

"Hey, why are you taking it out on me? Did I call you an old lady? Huh? Did I say that?"

The operator said:

"I understand that information sharing is impossible. You don't need to make threats."

"Right. Sorry about that."

Released from restraint, Lollipop turned around.

"Damn it!"

He aimed a low kick, but it was like hitting a log - only his own leg hurt.

"Haha! Don't be so angry. Your big brother will introduce you to a really pretty girl. She's fifteen years older than you, though."

"No thanks!"

"By the way..." As Snyder ruffled Lollipop's hair and moved forward, the executives followed.

"What do we do about these?"

Jets had already formed a wall in front of them.

Sirone, who had surveyed the outside from the rooftop, returned to the room where the Jet had been lying.

"The scenery hasn't changed."

Although the main system had gone down, this was still a world made of divine law.

'Why? Even though Ikael succeeded.' It felt frustrating, as if the future was already determined regardless of what changes occurred in reality.

'That can't be right. I'm missing something. Because God's thinking is broader than mine.'

Lost in deep thought for only a moment, Sirone turned his head at the sound of an engine.

"Jet!"

Sanskrit appeared on Jet's facial screen, and his limbs began to move.

"Are you conscious? The system suddenly..."

Sirone stopped short.

The form was the same, but somehow the feeling was different from before.

"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form."

Standing upright, he conjured bullets of divine law in the air just like the Jets outside.

"It's me! You remember me!"

"Eliminate worldly desires."

Dodging explosions from all directions, Sirone threw himself to the room's entrance.

'The error has been corrected.'

When the main system rebooted, the quantum error had returned to its proper place.

"Ugh!"

Since it could never be reversed, to Sirone, Jet was now just a moving machine.

'Don't mock Him.'

"Sentient beings, follow the divine law."

"Hyaaaah!"

Casting Hand of God, Sirone grabbed Jet and forcefully pushed him into the wall.

Following a thudding sound, Jet's body crumpled halfway and collapsed to the floor.

"Sentient beings... divine... law..."

Confirming that the light in the facial screen had faded, Sirone wiped away his tears.

A broken teacup, a burnt carpet, fish flopping outside the aquarium.

These had been Jet's heart.

Sirone put the fish into an aquarium made of material and moved the machine to the center.

"I'm sorry."

Hoping that his heart conveyed today would someday spread to the entire world, "Whew!"

Sirone flew up through the ceiling.

'What about the mining team?'

The tallest building in the city.

Countless Jets climbing the exterior walls sparkled like a broken mirror.

In the underground cavern beneath the main system, the mining team fought desperately against the Jet units.

"Damn it! There's no end to them!"

Since they couldn't destroy the building, the only way out was to break through the Jets.

The operator said:

"There's not much power left. Please drive the Jets into a corner. This is the final collapse."

"Right."

As the mercenary group rushed into enemy lines, the Jets' formation began to distort to one side.

Meanwhile, Marsha stood behind a pillar holding Omega 999's files.

'What do I do with this?'

While it was also for Sirone's sake, the mercenary group's employer was ultimately Fermi.

The special condition he had presented was 'information that doesn't need to be accessed should be delivered as is.'

"Would such a situation arise?"

Marsha had asked at the time.

"I need to know what it is to make a judgment. How can I deliver it without even looking?"

"There are various ways to handle classified information. Books written in code, metaphors contained in paintings, atonal musical scores that destroy classical forms. I'd prefer if such artifacts were passed on without investigation."

"Hmm, understood."

Marsha thought to herself:

'It's fine as long as only I know. Who would find out?'

"One more thing."

Fermi had added:

"When you obtain data created with future world technology, never access it. No one, not even the administrators of High Gear, should know about it."

Looking back now, it seemed Fermi had been thinking this far ahead.

"That's pretty strict. How are we supposed to maintain teamwork without that level of human consideration?"

"A fallen saint would be sufficient. The members don't just follow blindly. Besides, it's directly linked to profits. With information, who knows it is more important than what is known. Information that can't be monopolized has no value."

Information known by everyone has the same value as information that cannot occur.

"It's called information entropy. But actually, this clause has a different true meaning."

"True meaning?"

"Sirone."

Marsha's expression hardened for the first time.

"There's certain information that Sirone must never know. The moment he learns it, everything ends. Beyond monopoly, a level of entropy where he completely doesn't know must be maintained. Sirone agreed to have his memory erased because he understood this too."

"What kind of information is it? What if I accidentally let it slip without knowing?"

"You'll know. The moment you encounter the information, you'll be certain. That's why I couldn't even write it in the contract. No channel through which the information could move must exist."

Marsha's mouth was also a channel.

"I understand. I promise. Rather than let it slip to Sirone, I'd end my own life first."

Fermi finally presented the contract.

"...Please sign."
