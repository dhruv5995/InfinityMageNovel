[742] The Great Purification (2)

The planet that Taesung and Sirone were looking down upon was divided into five major continents.

First was the North Pole, where the Ivory Tower stood.

Below that was a continent containing more than half of the world's 70 nations.

This continent was divided into the North, Central, South, and Middle East regions. In the northern continent, two of the Three Emperors - the Kashan and Gustav Empires - occupied the west and east respectively, their borders touching.

The central continent, with the highest density of nations, contained 21 kingdoms, including the Tormia Kingdom, Sirone's homeland.

The southern continent had relatively larger territories than the central continent, but its national power was somewhat inferior.

However, the Iron Kingdom at the continent's southernmost tip was one of the Seven Kings and a powerful nation representing the south.

Paras, the only kingdom in the Middle Eastern continent, was also one of the Seven Kings and shared control of the Akad Desert with Kashan.

Crossing the sea from the Middle East led to the world's second-largest landmass, called the East.

In the north of the East was the Jincheon Empire, one of the Three Emperors, with six kingdoms below it engaged in fierce competition for second place.

Passing through the island nation below the East and crossing the equator led to the South, which was also Kang Nan's homeland.

Though it had 14 kingdoms, their dominance was weak, and instead thousands of tribes lived preserving their unique traditions.

Finally, there was Antarctica, the world's coldest place - an unknown continent where no living creatures were said to exist.

And now.

The great undertaking that had been steadily progressing since Ankera opened the gates of the Great Purification was approaching its final moment.

3,600 altars installed in 69 nations worldwide, excluding the Corona Kingdom at the North Pole, were about to open.

The Iron Kingdom.

The Iron Kingdom, one of the Seven Kings, was a nation with painful memories where Marsha's Parrot Mercenary Group had fallen to banditry.

But that was now a thing of the past.

Having rescued Sirone from Under Code, Marsha had activated her contract with Uorin and was now receiving special treatment in the Iron Kingdom as a proper S-rank mercenary group.

"What the hell are they doing?"

Freeman, looking down at the altar from atop the cliff, rested his chin in his hand, lost in thought.

Though no longer second-in-command by skill, he still served as vice-captain, staying by Marsha's side.

A lean man of medium height reported:

"According to our investigation, over a thousand altars have been discovered worldwide, with more than 200 in the Iron Kingdom alone."

And they had just been completed.

"Is such a thing even possible?"

Even as a national project, it would be impossible to simultaneously construct altars so massive they would take a full year to complete.

The earthwork alone - completely leveling mountains to create flat ground - was beyond human capability.

"Magic power... wouldn't it be?"

Though it was the closest answer to the truth, Freeman still couldn't readily accept it.

"Perhaps a god could do such a thing."

As his pale face, where eyebrows no longer grew, contorted, the members tensed and gripped their weapons.

"Should we infiltrate?"

Since Marsha had given direct orders, they would have to go even if a god resided there.

"We're going in."

The moment Freeman's command fell, the members lowered their stances like birds of prey and charged toward the cliff.

"Stop."

Though the voice was quiet, the feet of the 20 members with superhuman senses stopped without the slightest error.

"Captain."

Clay Marsha, captain of the Parrot Mercenary Group, approached through the forest with a pipe in her mouth.

"What's going on all of a sudden?"

Freeman asked, but Marsha only narrowed her eyes and looked down at the altar below the cliff.

"I was being short-sighted. This isn't something we should handle."

Though ominous rumors from high society were driving the Iron Kingdom into an apocalyptic atmosphere, the mercenary group's value was ultimately money.

A member asked:

"Captain, what do you mean? What in this world could we not handle?"

It was unusual for Marsha, an excellent calculator, to withdraw a plan midway.

"Emergency intelligence came in. The Iron Kingdom's special forces investigating altars in other regions were completely annihilated."

"Completely annihilated?"

Unless it was war with another nation, it was extremely rare for Iron's forces to be wiped out within their own country.

"Who on earth could..."

Just as Freeman was about to speak, Marsha frowned and pointed below the cliff.

On the cleanly swept path, a hunched old man was walking toward the altar, leaning on a staff.

When Freeman, who had been observing carefully, looked back at Marsha, she was swallowing hard, her white nape visible.

"Withdraw immediately."

"What's wrong?"

"No time to explain. That's not human."

"If it's not human, then what is it?"

"I don't know either."

It was an honest assessment.

When Marsha had encountered Miro's skill in Under Code, she thought no human could reach a deeper realm than that.

'But that thing...'

Surpassed Miro.

She could be certain because she felt as if all the world's scenery was being drawn into that frail old man.

'No matter how vast Miro might be...'

He wouldn't be heavier than that old man.

"Uninvited guests have arrived."

Veron, first in the Council of Ten's hierarchy.

When Amitabha's gleaming eyes turned toward the cliff, the members finally realized:

'We're going to die.'

There wasn't a trace of lie in Marsha's words.

"Run!"

The moment the entire Parrot Mercenary Group disappeared from atop the cliff, Veron clicked his tongue.

"Young people these days have no spirit."

Veron's staff struck the ground again as he continued forward.

"How long do they plan to leech off an old man's back?"

Reaching the altar, Veron sat down on the lowest tier, fanning himself with his hand.

"Come to think of it, I've lived quite a long time."

Though all the Council of Ten's executives had lived over 10,000 years, none knew Veron's true lifespan.

'Why can I not go anywhere?'

What kept him in this world?

As Veron closed his mouth like a folding fan, lost in thought, red light bloomed like flames before his eyes.

"Chairman."

Shura, seventh in the Council of Ten's hierarchy and an Apostle, revealed herself.

She had a sleek, serpentine figure, and when dealing with lies, her black eyes became elongated and cold.

"Preparations to open the altar are complete."

"..."

"Though we built the altar according to Ankera's instructions, there's much talk even in immortal society."

Ankera sought to become a god, while Nane sought to save all beings - they had accepted each other for these purposes.

"Ra becoming a god and this world becoming unified - that's what we wanted. But now..."

A vast emptiness was approaching.

"Someone achieves enlightenment, someone enters reincarnation, and now someone wants to close it all entirely."

To Veron, this world was everything.

"As always, we must find meaning. For immortals, life's meaning is like a mortal's life itself."

"Then what meaning lies in Nane's work?"

"...None."

Veron stood, leaning on his staff.

"That's why I'm thinking of creating one from now on."

As Veron climbed the altar steps, he asked Shura, who followed behind:

"What do you think of fate?"

"An illusion created by time's harmony... perhaps? Nothing escapes causality, after all."

Veron nodded.

"Human consciousness is also nothing more than grains of sand swept along time's flow. Just because fish swim upstream doesn't change the ocean's current."

Shura listened intently.

"Plant seeds in the present, and sprouts will emerge in the future. Humans mistake this for a great ability, but..."

Veron caught his breath at the altar's midpoint.

"In truth, it was already determined the moment the seed was planted. We don't change things. That's simply how they flow."

We don't create the future - the already-made future comes crashing into us.

"If human free will truly has the power to change something..."

Facing the summit, Veron turned his head.

"Rather than the illusion of changing the future, shouldn't we be able to destroy the future?"

Seeds should be able to not sprout even when planted.

"That is what it truly means to live in the future."

"Chairman."

Though Shura had reached the realm of Apostle, she couldn't grasp Amitabha's intentions.

"This world's master says he wants to close it. Then it should be accepted accordingly."

Veron looked up at the sky.

"But it is, after all, human will."

Attachment to this world - the immortals.

Perhaps this was indeed the meaning of his existence, having dwelt in this world for countless eons.

"Correct."

Veron thought.

Amitabha Avatar Technique
Iron Pole.

"Kugh!"

Sensing the concentration of law, Shura immediately leaped from the high altar's peak and reached the ground.

'Tremendous concentration of thought.'

Veron's jaw opened wide, trembling as a hoarse voice roughly escaped:

"Graaaaaaah!"

The world's laws twisted and began gathering toward the focal point where Veron's staff struck down.

His will would be planted here with binding force strong enough not to be uprooted by time's waves.

How foolish, Amitabha.

A tremendous voice spread from the heavens.

Then all the clouds in the sky condensed and transformed into the shape of Nane's face.

"Kugh!"

As Shura activated Apostle's avatar technique, countless crosses formed a spherical defensive barrier.

Gestalt of Union
Divine Strangulation.

Like seeing meaningful shapes in wall stains, her law combined falsehoods to create phenomena close to reality.

'It absolutely won't be destroyed! Even Miro couldn't break it!'

Even though that had been in Under Code's world, specialized for her abilities.

Do not fear.

Sermon
Truth.

From Nane's brow, a sword white as drawing paper struck down into the Divine Strangulation at light speed.

"What...!"

The meticulously assembled crosses separated like a chemical reaction, exposing Shura's face completely.

'This is Nane.'

Having devoured Ankera's dream, he was the natural enemy of Shura, who had approached the most righteous in this universe.

"Ahhh..."

As Shura sat down hard, trembling, Nane's gaze shifted to Veron.

Though no visible phenomenon occurred, Iron Pole was already complete, nailed into spacetime.

Do you think I cannot destroy it?

Looking up at the sky, Veron's eyes held both pride and awe.

"Though this is your world, there are ways to deny at least one like me."

Because Nane's Kar value was not perfect.

Eventually, it would be swept away.

Though he didn't know how many resets it could withstand, it would ultimately fall to time's waves - that was self-evident.

Only Hexa could endure.

"Then just accept it. I simply wish to know - was human consciousness truly such a trivial thing?"

This was Veron's final question to the world.

"Even if everything returns to nothing and not even records remain, struggling to the end is the immortal's life."

Shura suddenly realized:

'That's why before the altar opens...'

At the only point where there was still room to turn back, he had driven in Iron Pole to create an immutable standard.

'Even if hundreds of futures become mixed, the beginning is always here.'

The 0.1 percent of Nane that Sirone had created - Veron had precisely struck that razor-sharp gap.

The thought that perhaps nothing had been decided yet flashed through Shura's mind.
