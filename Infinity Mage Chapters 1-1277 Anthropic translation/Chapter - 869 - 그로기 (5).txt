Groggy (5)

"I'll speak."

Canis walked over to Dorothy's side.

"If the Holy Kingdom just needs minerals, it shouldn't matter if it's not this specific location, right?"

Iruki answered readily.

"That's right."

"Then why are you kicking us out? This is a historically important archaeological site. Plus, our entire team is funding this project out of our own pockets."

"I understand there's compensation involved?"

"That's not the point."

It wasn't a matter of profit, but of emotions.

"At least you should make us understand, shouldn't you? When you can use the entire mountain range, why are you being so rigid about it?"

"The Holy Kingdom is busy. We won't set limits on mining output, and we don't have the luxury of considering your circumstances."

Canis saw through Iruki's desire to leave not even a 0.1 percent margin for variables.

"In other words, we're just annoying and troublesome?"

"You could see it that way."

The light of anger blazed in Canis's eyes.

"Oh, I see. You've really grown up, Iruki."

As the escort knights behind him simultaneously drew their swords, a terrifying killing intent spread.

"Oh shit...!"

Closer and Sabina entered Spirit Zone, but they already realized in their heads.

'Really strong.'

Just the collective killing intent alone was enough to take their breath away.

"Canis, it's useless." Arin said.

"Iruki won't change his mind."

Through her supernatural sight, Iruki appeared as a giant flame burning life as fuel.

'It's different from risking one's life.'

It felt like his will to absolutely succeed transcended life itself by far.

"Tch! Consider yourself lucky."

As Canis withdrew his killing intent, Closer and Sabina also released their Spirit Zone.

The atmosphere was quite miserable.

"Do you have to put it that way?" Dorothy asked.

"You could explain it nicely. Ask for help, ask for understanding. It's not like we're strangers..."

Iruki looked at her.

The 4D girl who used to love fantasizing had now become a proper adult leading a team.

"You've changed a lot."

Both her bold outfit that exposed her chest and her direct way of speaking were different from before.

"No, that's wrong."

Of course, many things change as you age.

But because they shared the same time, there were things that could never change.

"The world outside school is tough. I'm not as stubborn as I used to be either. But I'm still pursuing my dreams. Canis, Arin, Closer and Sabina too - none of us have changed the dreams we had during our school days."

"Then let's say I'm the one who changed."

"You told me!" Dorothy shouted.

"That there are no adults in the world. Only children, and children pretending to be adults."

"It's still there in your heart too, isn't it? So why are you talking like that? As if you've really become an adult."

She felt hurt.

Though calculating, the Iruki that Dorothy remembered was a kid who knew what was truly important.

"...Sorry, but I don't have time for this."

Only Arin knew the real meaning behind saying there was no time.

'Iruki's right, Dorothy.'

She didn't know what was wrong with his body, but it was the supernatural sight of someone who had already given up attachment to life.

'Still, the reason he won't reveal it... is because he wants to appear dignified in front of his friends.'

'I would have done the same.'

That's why she had no choice but to remain silent even as her old classmates were in conflict.

"Really? No time?"

Dorothy spun around abruptly, walked over to Hickory 19, and lay down spread-eagle.

"Go ahead! We absolutely won't move! Run us over or kill us, do whatever you want!"

Dorothy's face looked sad with her eyes squeezed shut.

'You bastard.'

Anyone else might be one thing, but Iruki shouldn't treat her this way.

'How much Dorothy was looking forward to this reunion...'

Understanding her feelings, Sabina lay down beside Dorothy and shouted.

"That's right! Kill us, kill us! Kill us all!"

Aromi pushed up her glasses and said.

"We'll arrest them."

Just as the knights began striding forward, Iruki turned around and said.

"That's enough. Let's withdraw for today."

"But..."

"It's a team that has studied the Arca Mountains for a long time. Their skills aren't lacking, so they'll be helpful. It's not good to create conflict from the start."

Though it went against Aromi's work philosophy, courtesy toward Iruki took priority.

She said to Canis.

"Following the Grand Strategist's instructions, we'll give you one day. I hope you make a good decision."

As the Holy Kingdom led their carriages away, Arin approached the two and said.

"They're gone. Get up now."

Dorothy sat up with a gloomy expression.

"We can't work today. Let's go back and figure out a plan. We'll also review Iruki's proposal."

No matter how angry she was, doing what needed to be done was what made her a mage.

"I'm sorry the accommodations are so crude. We didn't expect to be staying overnight..."

The place where Iruki was staying was a temporary barracks 300 meters from the mining site.

"It's fine. How's the excavation team?"

Aromi pretended to look outside.

"They're holed up in the temporary building and haven't shown their faces. It seems like they're reviewing the documents we gave them."

Iruki stood up from his chair.

"They'll probably accept it. They're angry because of me, but they're kids with clear judgment and intelligence. Don't worry."

Aromi forced a smile.

"I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about the Grand Strategist's health. Since it's come to this, why don't you rest for a day?"

Even if he wanted to rest, thoughts about the army of hell wouldn't leave his mind.

Late at night when everyone except the night watch was asleep.

Iruki, who had been dozing off in his chair, heard footsteps and lifted his eyelids.

"Let go. Let go of this." 

At the entrance of the barracks, Dorothy stood with her arms held by knights.

Though taking off her work clothes revealed her youthful appearance from before, he still couldn't get used to her outfit.

"Grand Strategist. This woman was being persistent..."

"It's fine."

After the knights saluted and left, Dorothy rubbed her grabbed arms as she approached.

"Impressive. Those people jump at your every word."

"What's this about?"

Dorothy didn't answer.

"If it's about mining rights, my position hasn't changed. Starting tomorrow, the military contractor we signed with will..."

"Forget about that."

Dorothy cut him off.

"Work aside, don't we have personal matters to resolve?"

Dorothy approached faster than usual.

"Did you drink?"

"That's not important. What I want to hear is... why exactly are you like this?"

"Like what?"

Dorothy had never forgotten.

"We kissed."

"You did it."

"Anyway! And we dated."

Though they broke up after 13 minutes.

"Why did you do that? Did you have even a little feeling for me? Or was it just curiosity? Which one was it?"

"Why does that matter?"

"It matters to me."

First man, first kiss.

She could have just left it as a good memory, but seeing his face, she couldn't help but ask.

"I am..."

Iruki, who had been recalling their school days, sighed and stopped talking, turning away.

"Let's stop this. It's meaningless."

"Meaningless? Why? Is it childish now that you're in a high position? Or are you afraid I might drag you down..."

"I'm going to die soon."

Dorothy's words were cut short.

"...What?"

"My brain is pretty exceptional, you know. To the point of eating away at my lifespan. But recently, its functions have increased even more."

If it was a joke, it was malicious.

"Wh-what are you talking about? Where in the world does someone die from using their brain a little?"

"It's not at a dangerous level yet. Maybe I can hold out quite a while. But I'm a core brain that the Holy Kingdom needs, and I have no intention of stopping. If I continue this overdrive as is, probably..."

Iruki made an explosion gesture with a "pop" sound.

"No."

Dorothy shook her head.

"That can't be."

Though she had gotten angry to hide her precious inner feelings, he was actually a friend she had missed so much.

"Haha! Don't be scared. I can still hold out for now."

For now, that was true.

"Honestly, it feels good to tell someone. I can't show weakness. I'm responsible for so many lives. Oh, that Hickory 19 you made looked cool. You've modified it a lot, haven't you?"

Dorothy made a tearful face.

"Why are you so stupid? You haven't changed at all from before to now!"

Iruki smiled bitterly.

"Anyway, please help me out a bit. Since you're the team leader, convince your team members to..."

Before he could finish speaking, Dorothy grabbed Iruki by the collar and threw him onto the bed.

"I told you I didn't come to talk about work. I absolutely have to get an answer."

Taking off her shoes and climbing onto the bed, Dorothy knelt with Iruki's face between her legs.

She was wearing short jeans that exposed her entire thighs.

"...What are you doing?"

"If you don't know that, you're not even a man."

Of course he knew.

"You've lost it."

"Why are you acting like this is new? I'm Dorothy."

Of course he knew that too.

"I told you. I have no intention of stopping. To do something with you, my life might be too short."

Dorothy raised the corners of her mouth.

"If you're dying tomorrow, won't you eat?"

After being lost in thought for a moment, Iruki slowly turned his head left and right.

'Left thigh. Right thigh.'

Since there was nowhere to escape.

'Ah, hell with it, straight ahead.'

Iruki suddenly sat up.

The next morning.

Dorothy snuck out of the barracks like a thief and entered the temporary building as if nothing had happened.

In the living room, team members were gathered reviewing legal documents the Holy Kingdom had provided.

Sabina looked up.

"Where have you been? You weren't in your room this morning."

"Oh? Ah, I was just checking the mining site for a bit."

As she played innocent and entered the living room, Canis grumbled with a dissatisfied expression.

"Tch, no matter what, being kicked out like this doesn't make sense."

It was about that agenda as expected.

"Um, listen."

Dorothy carefully brought up the topic.

"How about we just take a step back? Honestly, Iruki must be out of his mind because of the war. The ruins are important, but shouldn't humanity survive first?"

While the team members blinked at her changed attitude overnight, Arin said.

"Actually, we were leaning that way too. Either way, there's no chance of winning a legal battle against the Holy Kingdom."

Sabina, resting her chin on her hand, flipped through the document folder.

"We reviewed it, and it's really not bad conditions. We can secure priority for the next excavation site, and the penalty they offered as compensation for giving up is sufficient."

Dorothy's face brightened completely.

"Th-then should I meet with the director? Maybe I can get even better conditions."

The document folder closed with a thud.

"No objection to that. But before that, there's something we absolutely must address."

"Huh? Address what?"

Sabina pointed at Dorothy with sleepy eyes.

"You slept with him, didn't you?"

"Oho?"

While Closer turned around with an intrigued face, Dorothy rolled her eyes.

"Um, what happened was..."

Even with ten mouths, she had nothing to say.
