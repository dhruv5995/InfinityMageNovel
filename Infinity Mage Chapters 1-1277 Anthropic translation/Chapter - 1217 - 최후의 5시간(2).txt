The Final 5 Hours (2)

After gathering supplies from the warehouse and arriving at the meeting point, Pena was already meeting with the captain.

"How did it go?"

"It went well. I'll tell you about it later."

The captain had also already been bribed, but it seemed better to talk about it somewhere private.

The captain said, "Let's get going. Let me be clear - I'm just a guide. I can't guarantee we'll be able to bribe the guard captain. He's a thorough principlist."

After leaving the port, Shirone's group entered the royal castle, specifically through the back gate of the castle.

It had the exact same structure as the real castle, and many people were working tirelessly.

Iruki said, "All of them are programs performing their respective roles. Maintaining the massive world of Melkidu wouldn't be easy. From what I've played so far, honestly, it's a well-made system."

Shirone agreed, but his heart ached thinking about the reason for creating such a world.

'Cain.'

According to Omega's records, he was the son of Mitochondrial Eve - specifically, Lilith's son.

"Here it is."

The captain pointed to the guard captain's office and knocked.

"Come in."

When they opened the door and entered, a stern-looking man with scars on his face was waiting.

"Good evening, Guard Captain. Here's the list of supplies that arrived tonight. Please sign here."

It was a process that required high-level authorization.

The guard captain slowly looked through the documents, then raised only his eyes to glare at the group.

"What are they?"

"Well..."

Shirone stepped forward.

"My colleague is imprisoned under false charges. Please show mercy."

Once the bribery succeeded, logic wouldn't matter, but he couldn't bring himself to act like Nade.

"Colleague? Who?"

According to Curtis's information, to bribe the guard captain, someone had to be in prison.

"Curtis."

The guard captain's expression changed.

"No. That guy is a serious criminal. Even just listing the murders he's committed and the goods he's stolen would fill dozens of pages. I can't release him."

"No, in Melkidu, Curtis is innocent. Please give me a chance to persuade you."

The man who had been glaring fiercely at Shirone opened his mouth.

"You want to try persuading me? I'm stubborn. The cost for persuasion is 50 million points."

It was as expected.

"Yes."

When Shirone answered, the captain's office transformed into a dimensional space with only the accomplices remaining.

A message was heard.

*The bribery program has been activated. Destroy the guard captain's principles with Crime Dice.*

The guard captain walked over from the other side of the dimensional space.

'This is unexpected.'

While Shirone's group was confused, the guard captain took out his Crime Dice.

Seeing four 8-sided dice, Nade frowned.

"What? He's stronger than us? Isn't persuasion supposed to be a fair fight with the same dice?"

Shirone's group had three 7-sided dice - both the number of faces and the number of dice were one grade lower.

The guard captain smiled coldly.

"Hmph, I don't know who you've bribed to get this far, but I'm different."

Shirone had an intuition.

'A principlist. Unlike other administrators, the guard captain won't break his own rules.'

A message was heard.

*Roll dice against each other and Crime Points equal to the sum will be deducted. Each face of a Crime Die has a value of 10,000 points. The team or user who reduces their opponent's Crime Points to 0 first wins.*

"Puhh!"

Nade realized the severity of the situation.

'It's not a one-time match. Three 7-sided dice can get a basic 42 points including doubles. I don't know how many points the guard captain has, but Shirone can't handle it alone. We'll have to roll too.'

Iruki asked, "What are the guard captain's Crime Points?"

*50 million points.*

Eden made a troubled expression.

"Meanwhile, we have..."

Since 50 million points had just been deducted, they had roughly 8 million points left.

'By simple calculation, if 800 dice faces accumulate, we're bankrupt.'

Shirone rested his chin on his hand and thought.

'So this is what Curtis meant by needing at least 50 million. Were we too unprepared?'

No, that wasn't it.

'We're just a special case. Other people would come here with 100 million points. As a simple dice match, it might be quite an easy game.'

Therefore, this match was...

"Items."

Shirone asked, "Can we use items?"

*The guard captain's principle is to stake everything and fight head-on. For this persuasion only, there are no restrictions.*

"We can change the order too, right?"

*Possible. However, one person cannot participate multiple times before their turn comes. By the same rule, one person cannot use two items.*

"I see."

As for items, they had acquired quite a lot while searching through the port warehouse.

"Who would have thought Nade's kleptomania would help at a time like this."

"Hey!"

She shouted with an aggrieved expression, but Nade was also secretly relieved.

'Thank goodness. I was the one who insisted on spending those points.'

Shirone said, "If items are applied, it won't go beyond 20 turns. Each turn will be that much more important."

The guard captain said, "I'll go first."

This was also unusual, but there was no point complaining in front of a principlist.

He took out a card.

"Captain's Authority."

"What? What kind of item is that?"

*The guard captain uses an administrator-exclusive item. It cannot be purchased in the shop.*

The card's effect appeared.

*Divide the opponent's attack power by the lowest number on the Crime Dice. Lasts for 3 turns.*

While listening to the explanation, the dice were thrown.

'Come on, roll a 1! Please!'

Contrary to Nade's wish, the dice stopped at 3, 6, 2, and 7 respectively.

'Divided by 2.'

It meant that for the next 3 turns, the damage dealt to the guard captain would be halved.

"No way, what kind of item is that?"

"It's administrator-exclusive. Let's change our order too. We have enough items, but it's inefficient for Shirone to attack while Captain's Authority is active."

Shirone's turn was essentially critical.

"I'll go first."

Eden took out a card.

*Using the top-grade item 'Genius's Inspiration' to combine dice faces and create the maximum number.*

However, in case of doubles, the two results would be added, so the highest expected value was 15.54 million.

"7, 3, 4."

The maximum value of 7.43 million was divided by 2.

"...Too bad."

Of course, it was an excellent effect, but considering the opponent's 50 million points, it wasn't satisfactory.

The guard captain held up a card.

"Conviction of Punishment."

*The result value doubles with each progressing turn. Lasts for a total of 5 turns.*

Iruki's eyes narrowed.

'A 32x critical on the final turn. He's planning to end it within five turns.'

The guard captain's numbers were 5, 1, 7, 4.

"340,000 deducted. It's still manageable, but it'll get a bit brutal from the next turn."

Iruki's eyes sparkled.

"Wait, let me go first."

Pushing Nade aside, he used 'Accountant's Mistake'.

*This turn's value will be applied to the next turn.*

'Even if we use full power, we have too few points. We have no choice but to bet on this method.'

A double came up for a total of 27.

"Foolish. Being afraid of Captain's Authority and giving up the chance to use other attack items."

The guard captain's turn again. This time 4x was applied, deducting 1.64 million.

The guard captain raised the corner of his mouth.

"Next turn will be even stronger. You can never break my conviction."

No one answered because they all understood Iruki's strategy.

'This persuasion isn't 100% certain. Quantum collapse alone can't win.'

The reason they couldn't reveal their strategy was that the opponent could defend with items.

"Accountant's Mistake."

When Nade used the item, the guard captain frowned.

'Again?'

*Accountant's Mistake stacks twice. This result value carries over to the next turn.*

'These guys are planning to use Storm God.'

The guard captain realized.

'A user-exclusive item. It's a good strategy, but it's hard to expect actual results. Unless big numbers come up consecutively...'

The multiplicative effect drops drastically.

'I'll win anyway. The probability of deducting 50 million at once is laughably low.'

Nade threw the dice vigorously.

'Please! Double! Double!'

When the dice that fell to the ground all showed different numbers, she despaired, but soon her heart pounded.

'It worked!'

7, 4, 6 for a total of 17.

If Storm God was used next turn, at least 4.59 million points would be guaranteed.

The guard captain held up a card.

"You like gambling. Then shall I judge your fate? Activate, Emergency Situation."

*All dice faces get +2 applied.*

Another double hit for a total of 4.8 million, leaving Shirone's group with about 1 million.

"It's definitely over next turn. Get ready to go back."

"It's too early to feel relieved, isn't it? Your Captain's Authority effect has worn off now too."

"So what? Nothing will change. Can you deduct 50 million at once? That probability is..."

"Give it to me."

Shirone took the dice.

"Storm God."

*All numerical operations convert to multiplication.*

Shirone asked, "Why can't you release Curtis?"

"You're stating the obvious. He's committed numerous crimes."

"You guys created them."

The guard captain fell silent.

"It's natural for those who commit crimes to take responsibility. But what about those who created this system? If you have points, you're innocent no matter what you do; if you don't, you're guilty. The more crimes you commit, the more points accumulate, and those who can't adapt must always start over at the bottom of the game - is this system normal?"

Shirone's question was directed beyond the guard captain.

"I don't know what you mean. No one forced anyone. If you don't want to go to prison, don't commit crimes. Don't tell me you mean 'hate the sin, not the sinner'?"

"No."

Shirone gritted his teeth.

"If you hate criminals that much..."

Swinging his arm to scatter the dice, three Crime Dice bounced around.

"Try hating the crimes too."

When 7, 7, 7 came up, the guard captain gaped in bewilderment.

"Wh-what is this..."

*Double. One more chance is given.*

"If you really want to punish criminals," Shirone caught the dice that had fallen before his eyes again and threw them in the same spot.

"Think seriously about why crimes have to exist in the first place."

Again, 7, 7, 7 came up.

*Accountant's Mistake activates. With Storm God effect, all operations become multiplicative.*

27×17×7×7×7×7×7×7=54,000,891

Iruki smiled.

"Our victory."

The dimensional space disappeared, and time began to flow again.
