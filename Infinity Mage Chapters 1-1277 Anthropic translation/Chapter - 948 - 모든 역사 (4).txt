All History (4)

While Griffin spent 40,000 years in the lotus, Heaven had developed the Elixir of Life, and Nephilim were active throughout the universe.

Beings with human bodies housing angelic souls.

These beings, who instinctively sought the truths of existence, eventually came to realize Heaven's existence through the Immortal Function.

Countless stargates were installed on planets, and it was an era when angels, following Anchera's commands, provided guidance for human life.

Some humans followed the gates into Heaven.

And among those humans were Smile's ancestors.

"Lord Kariel! We've detected rebellion signals from the 13th planet of the 64th solar system in the Alphacross Galaxy."

"Insignificant fools..."

Not all Nephilim succeeded in enlightenment.

Humans were truly strong-willed, often denying Anchera and proclaiming themselves gods.

'Even if they've faded, they're still descendants of the Gaians after all.'

Heaven's army was deployed.

Countless human civilizations were destroyed, and the one who achieved the most distinguished service was undoubtedly Ymir, the King of Giants.

'Too strong.'

Though he was a biological weapon created to subdue Griffin, the problem was that even the universe couldn't handle him.

Breaking the realm was forbidden.

By Anchera's command, Ymir was isolated in Niflheim, Heaven's thickest ice region.

"Hmph! Little worms."

Unless Griffin attacked Heaven again, it seemed he would never return to the world.

Then one day, an incident occurred.

A single human broke through Heaven's walls and invaded.

The name of the man who would be recorded in history with weight comparable to the Gaia War was "Smile!"

It was Ozent.

When Heaven's walls were destroyed, Anchera remained indifferent.

'The world has stabilized.'

Though Hexa and Griffin, who weren't included in the Akashic Records, still remained in the universe, Heaven's forces were far too strong for him to attempt anything.

Eliminate him. Strip away the existence of one who defies God's will.

Having issued such grandiose orders, Anchera, though heartless, was satisfied with Heaven's perfect system.

'Hmm?'

It was then that Anchera's eyes snapped open and his pupils vibrated with a sharp sound.

'What is this?'

The wall of the First Heaven, Shamayim, had been breached.

Since it was where mortal subjects lived, it wasn't particularly strange, but the speed was too fast.

Clang! Clang!

His pupils shook violently, and Anchera's nerves tensed sharply.

Even the Second Heaven, Rakia, where fallen angels resided, had been breached.

Though their power was sealed, they too were angels with sacred light bodies.

'Why is this so fast?'

No matter how many simulations he ran, he couldn't find any approaching life form.

Finally, Anchera accessed the Akashic Records, confirming the logs of events occurring in the world with his incorporeal senses...

'A human?'

He discovered a single human whose form was already collapsing.

'Guest code: Ozent.'

Even the immortals who had reached the art of incarnation in the Third Heaven, and the spirits born from the essence of the Fourth Heaven, were helplessly breached.

"Keeeeeee!"

As his system was being broken through from the bottom up, Anchera's nerves released a terrible shriek.

'Why? Why?'

The initial blow struck against Heaven's wall was a minor shock that could have occurred once in the vast universe. But the information that came in less than an hour showed numbers that were hard to believe came from the same human.

"Human!"

Ozent, transformed into a yaksha's body, broke through the giants and destroyed the Fifth Heaven's wall.

Anchera stubbornly persisted.

'It's not Griffin. Not a Gaian either. Just a human.'

However, he was approaching Gaian level at a terrifyingly fast pace.

'There's no way they're connected.'

If anyone could become a Gaian, then Anchera would have to eliminate all humans once again.

'That's why I'm watching.' He intended to take on the challenge just as when Griffin came to settle matters.

'Entering the Sixth Heaven's Buddhas.'

Since they were angels with the highest status in the universe, Ozent's charging power also weakened.

'Got him?'

It hadn't weakened enough to be certain, so while waiting for notable data...

'No.'

A shock that didn't exist in this world—a signal not present in the Akashic Records—struck the Great World War.

'Idea!'

It was connected.

"No!"

The horrific event stored in the database drove Anchera to an extreme choice.

He tore away the entire Great World War and relocated it to some planet in outer space.

Shortly after, Idea's signal was detected from a place very far from Heaven.

'Protected it for now.'

But it couldn't be left like this.

If Ozent made contact with Griffin, the Ultima System would rear its head in this world again.

"Come, Ymir."

The moment the order was given, Ymir approached, breaking down Arabot's walls.

Though he came with just a few leaps, one could imagine what happened to the places where he stepped without checking the logs.

"Hmph."

Instead of greeting, Ymir snorted.

He still harbored resentment from being isolated in Niflheim.

"Ymir, in Heaven..."

"I know. Something came, didn't it."

Ymir's senses were created from the insight of 10 billion Gaians.

"Seeing that you've summoned me, you must have been quite anxious, God."

Why was Ymir prickly toward Anchera?

A non-logical thought briefly crossed his mind—that even though the Gaians had disappeared, their souls remained.

"Show proper respect. Insolence will not be tolerated."

Ymir knelt.

"I receive your command."

"Eliminate him. That is your only task."

When no answer came, Anchera added:

"Don't you want to find your reason for existence?"

Finally, Ymir reacted.

"You know how many disappointments I've had so far. I don't think this time will be any different."

Being the strongest meant being overwhelmingly stronger than the second strongest...

'Which means there's no meaning to exist.'

He had fought countless battles, but they all ended up crushed in Ymir's hands.

Ashur, Sun Wukong, Zeus, and Behemoth—they all had only differences in degree but couldn't satisfy his deficiency.

'Now they've all grown old. The only decent one left is about Ashur's level.'

"He's a human who handles the mind."

Though it wounded Anchera's pride, Ymir took the bait eagerly.

"Mind?"

Griffin came to mind.

"Go. Perhaps there you might find your reason for existence."

'To that extent?'

Lost in thought, Ymir turned around.

"Send me."

"...Prove you are the King of Giants."

The moment Anchera's voice entered his eardrums, Ymir's coordinates flew to the far reaches of the universe.

On the planet where Sirone would later live, the universe's greatest battle took place.

His name was Ozent.

Besides Griffin, he was the first human to make Ymir feel truly alive.

But he sacrificed himself to save Smile.

Ymir felt regret, but realized Anchera's words had been correct.

'I found my reason for existence.'

They would meet again someday.

When he returned to Arabot, Anchera's voice carried thorns.

"You left room for hope."

"Eliminating Ozent. Wasn't that all you said?"

That was true for now.

"What reward do you want? If you refuse to be imprisoned in Niflheim—"

"No."

Ymir shook his head.

"There's no prison that can contain me anyway. You know that, don't you?"

"I won't fight anymore. Not until I feel like fighting again."

"You have proven yourself the King of Giants. There will be much for you to do."

When Ymir extended his index finger, the nail grew long and flowed down to the floor like liquid.

"I'll leave behind... just one nail."

The index fingernail fell off, and a part of Ymir born beside the main body approached Anchera.

"I will handle all duties. Command me."

Since it was a time of accelerated heavenly expansion, Ymir would have to fight countless enemies.

'Just one nail?'

It would probably be sufficient.

No matter how many times it would divide, it could hold out until the main body awakened.

Ymir's main body left Arabot and sank again into the deepest part of Niflheim.

The Suoi living symbiotically with him gathered around happily, telling him stories of the world.

"Hehe."

Ymir laughed, licking with his tongue the empty space of the molar he had left far away in the universe.

'I'll be watching. To see how far it extends.'

Ozent Smile.

Knowledge is contained in history.

And at this point, Sirone had absorbed almost all of the universe's history.

'The spine of knowledge.'

The grand project that began in the Ozent family's great library was approaching its end.

The library of knowledge in Sirone's depths expanded to four dimensions, eliminating spatial limitations.

'When I first started this work, I thought all knowledge was connected.'

Finally, it had transformed into a 5-dimensional multi-cube form where even time was combined with space.

'It was actually the opposite.'

If Arius entered the depths again, this would be the only fact he could realize.

'All knowledge was born from one source.'

God.

And finally, Sirone, possessing God's brain, came to face the end of history.

Omega Year 999.

Heaven reached an unprecedented golden age.

Everything was peaceful, and if things continued this way, some planet would create a system of cosmic cycles modeled after Anchera, creating a new world.

But as always, the problem was humans.

"Why!"

Seven archangels seated at the White Mirror's table engaged in heated debate.

"Why does every planet plot rebellion? What is this, a trend? We gave them everything! Immortality, the paradise they sought—we created it all!"

"Because they're human."

Satiel spoke with venom.

"Creating the Elixir of Life was wrong from the start. Trust humans? Those beings always think only of overthrowing God. They're a race that can't stand having anyone above them."

Kariel shot back:

"There's nothing wrong with my Elixir of Life. Haven't countless species followed Anchera until now?"

"Authority."

Uriel spat out.

"There's no authority."

"Are you saying I'm inadequate?"

"That's not what I mean. It's that we're not perfect. I'm talking about us."

Everyone's gaze turned to the empty seat of the Archangel.

"Ikael."

The reason Anchera couldn't reset was because he couldn't give Griffin two chances.

In the end, he could only partially excise events, and the aftereffects were more severe for beings with higher spiritual bodies.

'There's definitely something. Something terribly horrible.'

Though there were no clear memories, it was possible to infer based on the shape of the void created in the sacred light body.

'For instance, bearing a human child.'

Kariel shook her head.

The reason such illogical thoughts arose was also likely an aftereffect of memory erasure.

Nevertheless, the shape of the void was too filthy.

Uriel said:

"We need Ikael. Authority cannot be established unless the White Mirror is perfect."

Currently, Ikael had lost all her powers and was being punished in Arabot's spire.

That punishment was none other than flying to rebellious planets to destroy civilizations.

Only then could Ikael regain her strength, and the archangels didn't know why this was considered punishment.

Not even Ikael herself.

However, she...

'Why am I like this?'

She couldn't stop the tears that flowed every time she returned from killing humans.

'Griffin.'

It had been since that secret meeting that night, which no one in Heaven had noticed.

'If I could just meet him once more, just once more.'

A knock was heard.

"Come in."

Ashur, who carefully opened the door and entered, hesitated without being able to speak.

"Is it a mission?"

"Yes. I'm sorry."

He had witnessed countless times Ikael's tears upon returning from missions.

"It's not Ashur's fault. And punishing those who rebel against Lord Anchera is the Archangel's duty."

Ikael took a deep breath and smiled.

"Yes, where is it?"

"It's a planet located in the 7th solar system of the Oregon Galaxy. The Kergo race settled there 1,500 years ago, but recently we've detected signs of them denying God."

"Kergo. That's surprising. Their faith was unmatched even among Heaven's three peoples."

"Even among the Kergo, God doesn't dwell in distant lands. Humans tend to grow distant in heart as they grow distant from sight. At this rate, the Heaven expansion project will fail too."

Ikael nodded emphatically.

"Good. I'll personally punish them and restore sanctity. You said the 7th solar system?"

"Yes. The seventh planet of the 7th solar system. Since it's a volcanic island in the ocean, it won't take long."

"Hmm? A volcanic island."

Ashur opened the door and said:

"The natives are called Galliant."
