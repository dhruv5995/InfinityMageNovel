Fanaticism (3)

"Zion's representative has arrived." The moment Aromi's voice echoed from the ceiling, the door burst open roughly as Miro entered.

She was accompanied by Kang Nan and Zulu on either side.

"This woman is really...!"

The security captain who entered the room belatedly saw Iruki and bowed at a right angle.

"I'm sorry! This woman was so unreasonable that..."

Iruki raised his palm.

"It's fine. You may go."

Iruki had never blamed his subordinates for failing to handle unexpected situations.

The security captain also knew Iruki's nature, so shame preceded his inability to handle the situation properly.

"Understood."

Though he had a mountain of things he wanted to say, he didn't want to become the same type of person as Miro, so he simply responded.

'What kind of extreme good is that from what era? She's an insufferably arrogant woman.'

Well, Iruki didn't think that actions done for someone's sake were necessarily good.

That was actually closer to the concept of love.

'Good is law.'

It was an iron rule and belief mixed with not a trace of chaos, and in that sense, Miro was extreme good.

"Welcome. You're later than expected. I actually thought you'd arrive first."

With Zulu, who was the strongest in utility, it wouldn't have been a matter of distance or speed.

Miro plopped down on the sofa, placed one arm on the backrest, and crossed her legs.

"We got a complaint on the way. We were late dealing with it."

"A complaint?"

"The Apostles of Time."

A vacuum phenomenon occurred around Miro's group as they flew toward the central continent on Kydra.

"Huh?"

When she suddenly couldn't breathe, Miro turned to look at the cockpit and asked.

"What's happening?"

Naturally, no sound was transmitted, but Zulu had already turned his head and answered.

"There's no atmosphere. Flight is impossible."

After canceling the summoning magic and landing, they found themselves in a rocky area with massive reddish-brown boulders clustered together.

As Miro's group, having escaped the vacuum, took deep breaths, humans emerged from various parts of the rocks.

There were twelve in total.

"Hooh?"

Zulu's eyes widened unusually, and Miro's smile also looked somewhat unnatural.

'These things aren't human.'

You could tell by looking at their eyes.

Even without knowing any special methods, the alien feeling in their gazes was enough for anyone to have the same thought.

"Greetings, extreme good of this era."

The one who spoke was an elegantly aged old woman, her smiling face looking benevolent.

'Dragon.'

Since only First Dragons among dragons were capable of transformation, Miro became even more dejected.

'Has there ever been a time when all twelve apostles gathered in my memory?'

Slowly scanning the figures on the rocky cliffs, they varied in age and gender, but none looked ordinary.

'Six men and six women.'

Of course, dragons don't obsess over form.

If the inherent characteristics of birth were manifested as human personality, then the old woman's identity was ultimately...

'Poison Dragon Poine.'

According to legend, Poine's nature was benevolent, compassionate, and terrifyingly cruel.

Miro gestured forward with her finger.

"Uh, so, could you introduce who's who first? I'm getting confused just looking at faces."

"No need to know."

The man standing third from the right in the rocky area transformed into blue electricity and appeared before Miro's eyes.

With electrical afterimages still remaining on her retinas, Miro examined the man's face.

'Thunder Dragon Blitz.'

His pale face without eyebrows and sunken eye sockets added to his sharp impression.

"A message from Lord Caratosa."

Miro bent her knees slightly.

"Caratosa. To hear that legendary name here. If it's a message from such a great being, I should make time. Though I'm busy enough that I can't even wash after taking care of business."

Despite the sarcastic words, Blitz calmly delivered the message.

"Do not go to the central continent."

Miro waited for more words to follow, but Blitz's mouth didn't open again.

"Is that the end?"

"Yes."

Miro burst into laughter.

"Puhaha!"

Of course, she understood what it meant for all twelve apostles to gather just to deliver those few words.

'They're saying they'll crush me with force.'

Honestly, she felt a bit shaky, but Miro steeled herself.

"I'd like to hear the reason."

Giving them a chance to convince her was out of pure curiosity, not because of the dragons'Â®Åse.

"Miss Miro, don't be mistaken."

A blonde boy sitting on a rocky cliff spoke.

"These aren't our words, but Lord Caratosa's message. You just need to do it."

Miro's gaze turned to the boy.

'What kind of monster is that?'

His appearance looked about twelve years old.

He had a mischievous face, wore sports shorts, and had a fashion band on his wrist dangling between his legs.

He looked exactly like a boy who loved sports, but the light in his pupils sent shivers through Miro.

'Light Dragon Phaethon.'

Behind the boy, she seemed to see the form of a golden dragon blazing with blinding radiance.

'He's second to none in violence.'

According to legend, even the great angel of light Rayel would stick out his tongue when fighting Phaethon.

"So..."

Miro sighed, organized her thoughts, and tilted her chin toward Phaethon.

"Tell me the reason. Don't annoy people."

Even Kang Nan's heart sank at Miro's words as the atmosphere became strange.

Phaethon's head slowly lowered, then after a moment his shoulders shook soundlessly.

When he raised his face again, only murderous intent remained in his eyes.

"Damn it...!"

"Stop."

At Blitz's voice, Phaethon flinched and looked at Blitz with unchanged killing intent.

"Who? Me?"

"Yes, Phaethon. I'm talking to you."

Golden smoke rose from Phaethon's slowly rising body, forming the shape of a dragon.

This time it wasn't an illusion.

"Are you insane? Just because the Mu-deung Dragon entrusted this era to you, do you think you're wearing some official hat?"

When Shirone sacrificed himself in the first world of the labyrinth Andre, Caratosa appointed Blitz as representative.

If not for that single phrase "remember Shirone's light," there would be no hierarchy among the twelve apostles.

"I'm merciful, so I'll accept it if it's a mistake. Well then... how about trying to babble again?"

Phaethon's information volume when using dragon speech at light speed is uncontrollably violent.

"There's no point in us fighting among ourselves."

The reason Caratosa thought Blitz was suitable for this era was because of his ultra-cold nature.

"The reason we're trying to stop Miro is to preserve her combat power. But what if we kill her here? Cool your head."

Miro smiled bitterly.

"Ah, such deep meaning. But from what I hear, you seem to completely look down on people?"

Even at Miro's provocation, Blitz remained calm.

"Lord Caratosa has protected time through three resets. Without him, this world would have already been changed by some specific being's intentions. We cannot fathom Lord Caratosa's deep meaning. However, if a reason is necessary, I can convey my personal thoughts."

Miro gestured as if inviting him to speak, turning her palm upward.

"Your wise opinion?"

"The reason he ordered us to stop you is probably because we can't guarantee whether Shirone can make it in time."

Miro blinked.

"What do you mean?"

Blitz conveyed the current situation.

The fact that Shirone was receiving all information unfolded in chronological order, Omega.

And the fact that an elemental bomb would soon be dropped on Bashka under the Holy War's leadership.

"An elemental bomb."

Miro, chin in hand, raised her index finger.

"So you're saying if we're on the battlefield now, we'll all die? Therefore we need to preserve our forces?"

Kang Nan shouted.

"Gaold is going there too!"

Blitz nodded.

"Gaold is moving together with members of the Ivory Tower after making contact. If you want, I'll tell you his location."

"The Ivory Tower?"

Miro had thought that given Gaold's personality, he would never travel with others.

'He can't move alone.'

Just how much of a wreck had he become?

Miro, who had seen it with her own eyes, could imagine, but that didn't change anything.

"I don't care about Gaold's circumstances. I have my own work to do, and I need to go to the central continent."

Kang Nan glared fiercely.

"You, is that something to say right now? Whose fault do you think it is that Gaold is fighting like this? If he dies..."

"He won't die."

If he were someone who would die from a bomb like that, she wouldn't have torn him from her heart while shedding tears of blood.

"That aside. What I'm really curious about is how you knew. The elemental bomb. The Holy War isn't so easy-going that it would fail in security management, right? And if it had failed, the plan would have already been canceled. How did you do it?"

"Nothing."

Blitz stated the facts.

"There's no need to do anything to know certain information. Lord Caratosa's Omega is..."

The information Shirone is currently receiving is...

"The log (operational records) of the Akashic Records."

"Log? So you mean all records from the moment this world existed until now?"

"Correct. All dragons can access the core, but only the log cannot be viewed. There was probably an agreement with Guffin before the first reset began. Omega is enormously vast and dangerous. It's why Lord Caratosa chose eternal sleep."

"Hmm. And you're saying Shirone is currently receiving that log."

Imagining omniscience of all the world's information combined with Yahweh's omnipotence gave Miro goosebumps.

'Literally a god. Certainly, with this, we might be able to catch them.'

Blitz said.

"Do not go to the central continent. Now all logs will pass from Lord Caratosa to Shirone. We too will follow Shirone. Help him protect time."

"Thank you. Thanks to you, I understand."

Miro raised her head.

"But I refuse."

Though she felt enormous killing intent pressing from behind, Blitz remained calm.

"Why?"

"I won't help Shirone."

If he was an ally, then he was an ally, but Shirone and Miro's philosophies had different directions.

"Shirone thinks all things have value in their existence. He believes even evil can be made to repent. But I don't. I absolutely cannot tolerate evil."

"Shirone doesn't unconditionally forgive evil either."

"I know. We might occasionally meet for drinks and chat. But both Shirone and I are people who have reached extremes in different directions. Especially during war, there's no compromise. I don't know how to fight while thinking about possibilities for repentance. If Shirone interferes with me, then Shirone is also my enemy."

"So? You're stubbornly going to the central continent? Do you think you can survive?"

"No, quite the opposite."

If the operation succeeded, nothing could be better, but the axis of evil had many unknown ability users.

If they sensed even the slightest hint, it would be difficult to lure over 100 million to Bashka.

"I'll make the elemental bomb explode no matter what. Even if I die."

Hadn't she already given up on life?

When Miro finished speaking, all the apostles in the rocky area had stood up.

Seeing them watching her with different emotions, Miro swallowed.

The moment Blitz gave permission, tremendous attacks would pour down - that was obvious.

"I'll give you a choice."

At Blitz's unexpected words, Light Dragon Phaethon bared his teeth and snapped.

"You don't have that authority."

"I do. I will report directly to Lord Caratosa. Until then, I make the judgment."

Leaving behind Phaethon's displeased expression, Blitz spoke to Miro again.

"I've reached this conclusion because you say you're prepared to die. If you're going to die anyway, argument is a waste of time. So I propose this. One option is to withstand a strike from the twelve apostles."

Miro didn't speak carelessly.

"Since it's contractual compliance, we won't attack together. Even so, you'll probably die, but if you can't accept even this much, the sincerity of your words becomes questionable."

"...What's the other option?"

When Blitz turned his neck, blue electricity vibrated and flashed from his pupils.

"Kill all of us and go."
