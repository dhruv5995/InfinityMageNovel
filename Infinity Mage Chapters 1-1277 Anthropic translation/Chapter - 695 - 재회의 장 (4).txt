[695] Chapter of Reunion (4)

The man pretending to receive divine revelations spoke faster and faster.

Though it was merely a collection of sounds made by moving his tongue, the effect was tremendous as all the believers shed tears in unison.

"Um ssalla um!"

"Um ssalla um!"

Everyone emotionally repeated the priest's words, but Shirone's face only grew hotter.

They were lewd and vulgar words.

"I saw plenty of guys like that before entering Radum."

The goblins living in the forest were well-versed in human heretical rituals.

"Usually after doing stuff like that, they engage in quite debauched acts, don't they?"

What the cult leader wanted was nothing more than to dominate and indulge in humans.

He was probably a mage who could cast a few spells, but it was enough to deceive ordinary people's eyes.

Rian frowned and said, "There are all kinds of people in this world. How about we just ignore them and move on? Both the deceiver and the deceived..."

"But there are believers who came in for the first time today."

This was information heard through the fake priest's divine revelation.

"Probably that woman sitting in the back..."

She appeared to be in her late twenties and, unlike the others, was awkwardly copying the movements and words with an uncomfortable expression.

"Oh, God Terapos, please grant me..."

"Emma, if you're that half-hearted about it, God Terapos won't bestow divine revelations upon you."

"Ah, I'm sorry."

"You must pray with your whole heart. Like this. God Terapos, please grant me a divine revelation!"

When a gaunt middle-aged woman shouted, everyone raised their voices even louder in prayer as if competing.

In the heated atmosphere, the fake priest seized the opportunity to drive the final nail.

"Bring forth the sacrifice!"

From the cave behind the altar, hooded figures entered carrying a goat tied to a thick piece of wood with a gag in its mouth.

The goat placed on the altar trembled violently, but the priest mercilessly slashed its belly and pulled out the heart.

"Uoooooo!"

Already excited, the believers fell into a frenzy upon seeing blood.

"This blood will purify us. Everyone, bare your bodies before God."

Regardless of gender, they began removing their clothes, but even in the chaos, Emma realized something was going terribly wrong.

"What are you doing, Emma! If you don't hurry, all the curses will pour down on you!"

"But, ma'am. I don't want to do this kind of thing..."

The believers who had long devoted their bodies and minds to the fake priest were without exception pale and emaciated.

To them, Emma was fresh blood, and everyone was glaring at her with silent pressure.

"I guess I'll have to step in?"

Shirone shared the same thought as Rian.

"Let's cover our faces. Just in case."

"Wait. I have a good idea."

Saying this, Kido immediately jumped down.

"A goblin is better than a human."

His agile body didn't even make a sound upon landing, so Kido raised his voice and shouted.

"Do you know where you are, barging in here! You stupid humans!"

The fanatics turned around and the priest's face twisted menacingly.

"A, a goblin!"

In their already naked state, the fear felt by the believers was immense.

Of course, nothing whetted a goblin's appetite more than naked humans, but seeing their emaciated bodies with only protruding bellies made him lose his appetite entirely.

"This is goblin territory! If you don't get lost right now, I'll cut off your legs one by one and have a taste!"

"Goblin territory?"

It was half true.

If this place wasn't an area managed by the kingdom, it was comfortable enough to think they might find their own kind here.

"R-run away!"

As the cave echoed with the believers' screams, the priest shouted angrily.

"What are you all doing right now! God Terapos will punish you!"

The divine power dwelling in their hearts stopped everyone's movements, and seizing that momentary opportunity, the priest raised both hands.

"It's just one measly goblin! I'll show you the power of God Terapos! Uoooooo!"

All the torches stuck in the cave rose up and began gathering above the man's head.

Shirone was still watching.

'It's nothing special.'

The area where the torches burned was probably the limit of the priest's Spirit Zone, and despite dozens of fires gathering, the firepower was low.

'Really a pathetic mage.'

That's why he couldn't belong anywhere and was playing the role of a cult leader.

"Die, you filthy goblin!"

Just as the priest's arms stretched forward.

"Huh? What did you say?"

The priest's nose bridge split lengthwise and both eyeballs were slashed.

"Ahhhhh! My eyes!"

The fact that his eyelids couldn't even close meant it was that swift.

"Master priest!"

Seeing him kneeling and dripping blood, the hooded figures drew daggers and rushed at him.

"Loyalty? Or..."

Camaraderie from having tasted the same pleasures?

What Kido did to face the enemies surrounding him from all sides was simply lie on his back and spin once.

Spreading his legs like scissors and springing up, the hooded figures grabbed their severed leg stumps and screamed.

"Ahhhhh! My, my leg!"

Kido shouted at the believers.

"Get lost! If you invade goblin territory one more time, I'll throw you into boiling water while you're still alive!"

"Kyaaaah! Someone save us!"

The fanatics who came to their senses fled the cave without even covering their naked bodies.

"Humans really are strange."

Clicking his tongue while watching, Kido looked down at the crying priest.

"This guy's a bad one, so I can kill him, right?"

While traveling with humans, he had decided to follow human behavioral patterns as much as possible, but Kido's standards were only about this much.

"S-spare me, please. Please... just spare my life!"

"Sorry. If I eat you while you're alive, they might get angry..."

He planned to kill the priest, then eat his flesh to find a way out of the cave.

"Ahhhhhhh! Someone help...! Gack!"

As the priest's body suddenly trembled, Kido, sensing a strange energy, hastily stopped his movement.

"We meet again, Hexa."

Shirone and Rian jumped down, and the priest slowly raised his body and opened his eyes wide.

Lifting his eyelids while his eyeballs were slashed was impossible by human standards.

"Could it be... Terapos's Chief Judge?"

"That's right. I'm borrowing this fellow's body to convey my voice. Humans call it divine revelation."

"Can you just enter anyone's body?"

"Not quite. You need to access the Terapos channel, and that's only possible in a trance state. Usually we use dreams. But this fellow showed no signs of entering a trance state."

Shirone looked at the priest with disdain.

"The stronger the channeler, the more high-density thoughts they can transmit. Among humans, Meirei would be the most superior, but even a human like this can manage small talk."

"So... you came in just to chat?"

Did the Terapos Chief Judge live a boring life?

"It's to inform you that any human connected to the Terapos channel can communicate with me at any time. This human's channeling was too weak and only succeeded at the brink of death, but a powerful channeler could accept my entire consciousness."

He recalled performing the Thousand-Armed Guanyin through Meirei.

"You should have told me that sooner."

"It just passed through the council's approval. Also, that means the Terapos race has acknowledged you as humanity's representative."

"Hmm."

As Shirone fell into thought, a groan was heard.

"Ah, ahhh..."

Emma, still unable to leave her spot, was crouched in a corner trembling.

"What about that woman? I mean channeling."

"Her spiritual sensitivity is too lacking. She wouldn't be able to hear my voice even while sleeping. In this place, only this human is capable of channeling."

'So even if he's pathetic, he's still a mage?'

Emma clasped her hands together and asked.

"Are you... are you really God Terapos?"

"We don't have the word 'god,' but I am the being humans call by that name."

"Then, then you must know everything about me?"

"Your name is Emma. Biological partner of Adox, captain of the Kazra border guard. But you betrayed the faith defined by human standards and had biological relations with Miguel, Adox's subordinate, a total of 63 times over a month, and recently you've been planning to poison Adox..."

"Stop! Please stop!"

The terror of having one's shameful secrets spoken by another was tremendous.

"Please forgive me! I'll live righteously from now on! My husband only drinks all the time, and whenever he comes home he breaks things and beats me... And he was the first to have an affair. He fell head over heels for that thirty-eight-year-old tavern wench!"

As venom rose in Emma's eyes again, Kido clicked his tongue.

"This household is troubled too. Well, life is all like that."

Terapos had also classified Emma as evil, but that was because they observed humans from outside of life.

When you actually jump into the stage called life, only momentary emotions are vivid, and you can't tell what came first.

"I am not a being who forgives."

Emma was half out of her mind.

"I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! Please forgive me. If my husband finds out I came here, I'm dead!"

Shirone reassured her.

"Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. But... could you let us stay at your house for a few days?"

"What? Yes, of course! If that can absolve my sins..."

She seemed to mistake Shirone for having such authority.

Of course, having witnessed the miracle of Terapos standing with slashed eyeballs, it was a natural reaction.

"What are you planning?"

When Rian asked, Shirone looked at the Chief Judge and said.

"Tell the King of Kazra, Orcamp, that I have arrived. Through divine revelation."

Kido slapped his palm.

"Aha. That method."

A kind of communication satellite.

If they received Shirone's words from space and transmitted them to believers, they could convey intentions to any country in the world.

"Is that so? Wait."

In the Chief Judge's mind with closed eyes, the locations of Terapos believers existing worldwide were detected.

"There aren't many Terapos channels in Kazra. Even if there are, most are low-grade channels like this one."

'So it won't work after all.'

Each believer would serve as a base station, but compared to humanity's numbers, it wasn't that many.

"I found the nearest channel. There's one Terapos believer within a 1-kilometer radius of Kazra's royal castle."

"Within a 1-kilometer radius... A bureaucrat?"

The higher the rank, the more convenient it would be.

"He's a military officer serving in the royal guard. He keeps being a Terapos believer secret from everyone except his family."

"That's fine. He'll have no choice but to believe. First, transmit the location of Emma's house. Say that Shirone requests an audience. And..."

Shirone carefully chose his words.

"Tell him I have something to report about his son."

The Chief Judge's eyelids trembled slightly, and that was all.

"Transmission complete. He'll receive the revelation after falling asleep tonight. It should be delivered by dawn tomorrow."

It saved tremendous time, but Kido suggested an even more convenient method.

"Why not just enter that officer now like you did just now? Write it on paper or something and then leave."

"Forced trance states disrupt order. Only humanity's representative, only Hexa, can summon me."

Shirone understood.

"Got it. Then I'll wait for contact from the royal castle."

That ended the communication, and as the Chief Judge's expression disappeared, the fake priest covered his eyes and screamed.

"Ahhhhh! It hurts! It hurts! Where am I!"

'He has no memory, I see.'

Meirei had been the same.

Since those with severed legs had already died from excessive bleeding, it would be difficult to escape the cave while blind.

'Spirit Zone. But is it possible in this situation?'

Rian gripped his shoulder.

"Let's get out of here first, Shirone. Nothing good will come from staying long."

"...Right."

Behind Shirone's group following Emma out of the cave, the cult leader's screams echoed.
