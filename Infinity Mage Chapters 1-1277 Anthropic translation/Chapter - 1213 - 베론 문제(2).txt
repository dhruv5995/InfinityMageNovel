The Veron Problem (2)

Even while Kesia's ministers were giving their government reports, Fermi was trapped in his solitary mind.

"...So we sent official documents after consulting with each department. You know, to the International Court."

The ministers, their minds hazy from Angel's effects, remained leisurely even amid the urgent situation.

"This was difficult to handle. With the former king's passing, there's a mountain of work to process."

Fermi's eyes narrowed.

'Just how much of the drug did they take?'

When used properly, Angel reduces pain to levels that allow daily functioning.

Of course, it doesn't disappear completely, so the discomfort must be indescribable...

'Why do they keep ignoring the dosage!'

It was absurd that people who couldn't endure even that much were sitting there as ministers.

'Sigh.'

Fermi concealed his emotions.

"Thank you for your hard work. What about Lanstin's whereabouts? We need information within 6 hours."

There was no answer.

When Fermi looked up, the ministers sat with indifferent expressions, their mouths shut.

"Is there a problem?"

"Well, we haven't had a single day of rest since coming to the Holy Kingdom. Everyone's extremely fatigued."

Fatigue?

'How annoying.'

Of course, human abilities have limits, but aren't ministers the heads of their respective departments?

The chief secretary spoke up.

"Your Majesty, the workload is too much. Everyone's exhausted. We can't hold out like this."

'Right.'

That's what you call defeat.

If they had honestly admitted it and swallowed their tears, he wouldn't have been this angry.

'So what do you want me to do?'

Hoping problems will be solved without the work to back it up is a form of violence.

Because you're expecting others to do it for you.

'They're using being in the same boat as blackmail. If you don't want to sink, you sacrifice more.'

The contradiction of organizational society where those who work hardest must suffer even more.

'Should I abandon them?'

Individual ministers could be replaced, but he had to consider the overall organizational efficiency.

Most importantly, time was running short.

'If I beat them up and throw them out, I'd feel as refreshed as if my lifespan increased by a thousand years, but...'

Since that would distance him from solving the problem, Fermi put on his usual eye-smile.

"You're right. I made unreasonable demands. I know how much you're all working for the kingdom."

There was no emotion in it.

Knowing they actually thought that way made Fermi's stomach churn.

'Endure it.'

The fact that humans are self-centered was something he realized even before learning to read.

'It's fine. I'll do it myself. No need to blame others. I'm doing this because it's what I want.'

The world isn't about what you can or can't do, but what you must accomplish somehow.

'That's what victory means.'

Fermi revised his existing plan.

'Finding Guitarman will have to be left to the working staff. Each department's diplomatic connections are important. I can handle the other tasks. Among the six tasks, arranging the most important agenda items...'

23 minutes.

'No good. Reduce it to 18 minutes. After reviewing each country's diplomatic records, apply Omega 999's records...'

At that moment, Fermi's head spun.

'How can...'

How can they say it's difficult so easily?

'Winning is supposed to be difficult. Even passing kids know that. You're fighting against others who have the same time as us to gain an advantage. But you people, with just...'

Fermi clenched his fist.

'Stay calm. Being swayed by emotions will ruin everything. I can't sink here.'

Former King Manolka defined Fermi this way:

Capable.

A human who doesn't get swayed by circumstances and can endure and endure again until achieving the desired goal.

"The miscellaneous tasks..." Fermi slowly opened his mouth.

"Aren't particularly important, so let's skip them. Please focus all your efforts on finding Lanstin. You may use your remaining time however you wish. Thank you for your hard work."

"Right then."

Having gained nothing more, the ministers left the room with dry attitudes.

Left alone, Fermi hung his head.

"Grrrrr!"

His emotional illness had worsened.

'Damn it.'

The reason he couldn't take Angel was because he needed to maintain 100% brain function.

While Sirone's Agape could delay the condition, that wasn't an option for Fermi.

'I must not get entangled in any way.'

He had to guide the world with 0.1% lies and 99.9% truth.

As a last resort, Fermi gripped his fourth finger tightly and twisted his body.

Crack—the bone broke and pain struck his brain, but this would provide relief for a while.

"Phew."

Unable to even consider treatment, Fermi leaned his upper body against the desk.

'Mother.'

How did you endure it?

The driving force that allowed you to continue the lonely fight alone while everyone else only cared for themselves...

'The law of large numbers.'

She was a person with vision that transcended ordinary people.

'I was being hasty. Because my vision is narrow, fear arises and I become petty.'

While predicting what action a single human will take next is nearly impossible...

'As the sample size increases...'

Statistics become accurate, and populations are drawn in predictable patterns.

'You were a prophet.'

The sample size in Yorga's wide-range vision encompassed virtually all of humanity, and the judgment that came from it was beyond prediction—at the level of prophecy.

'Someone who even knew of her own death. The end of human history—you must have already seen it.'

That's why she left her son's side.

As his emotions calmed, Fermi slowly rose and healed his broken hand.

While wrapping it with bandages, Fermi glanced at the watch on his wrist, and his eyes turned cold.

"...It's Habits time."

"Kehehehe!"

Habits laughed like a madman.

"You don't know who I'll kill, do you? Huh? You absolutely won't know. Because I don't know either."

The reason for his unprecedented excitement was a kind of rage.

Having failed to assassinate Corona's king, he had resorted to killing a maid instead.

While it didn't break the rules, the shame of making the game boring was considerable.

'What's done is done.'

Habits, who didn't dwell on the past, instead planned to use this to his advantage.

"Who is it? Who will die?"

The tension of not knowing himself grew as the appointed time approached.

And finally...

'Found one!'

In Delta headquarters' kitchen, a man carrying supplies caught his eye.

Elicia activated.

"Today's work too..." "Gak!"

As Vanishing broke, the man felt his head separating from his body.

"Haa! Haa!"

Now what will you do?

'Wizard.'

As her location was detected and she appeared simultaneously, Habits licked his lips.

"Come. This time I'll..."

And at that moment, through Elicia's signal, he realized Wizard wasn't moving.

Habits' expression crumpled.

"Grrrrr..."

Because Sirone was standing in front of Wizard.

When Elicia's light enveloped Delta headquarters...

'One, two, three...'

The leaders of each nation froze in place, unable to breathe for 10 seconds.

'Dead.'

The kitchen man's throat was cut.

"Phew, that's it. Now it's done, for the next hour."

Some felt relief.

"Damn it. How long do we have to be on edge like this? At this rate, I'll die of a heart attack first."

Some grumbled.

"Brother."

Wizard spoke to Sirone.

"No, Master."

Sirone remained silent.

While Tormia arranged Code One, the meeting of kings, he had sought out Wizard.

'I had to meet her once.'

But now that she was before him, he couldn't think of what to say.

'First...'

She had grown stronger.

She was perfect when she finished training, but her eyes seemed to have crossed another wall.

But even those intense eyes softened warmly the moment they took in Sirone's face.

"I'm sorry."

She had failed to assassinate Habits.

Of course, she was still fighting now, but it surely wasn't the result Sirone wanted.

"I'll take responsibility and..."

"Wizard."

When Sirone interrupted, Wizard's shoulders flinched as if she had committed a crime.

"I'm sorry."

Since she had already transcended logic, all he could offer was sincerity.

"I made you dirty your hands with blood. Because of me."

While it had to happen once, how much had he hoped that one time would be the last of her lifetime?

"I dragged you into hell. So let's stop now. Leave the battlefield."

Wizard felt frustrated.

'He's disappointed. If only I had been a little stronger...'

In any case, she couldn't disobey.

'It's over.'

On one hand, just as she felt relieved at the thought of escaping from Habits...

'No.'

Her steps came to an abrupt halt.

'This is a dangerous gamble. I can't end it here.'

God's frequency.

The moment she unlocked her heart, Habits would know everything.

'I can't escape.'

Not until the truth was revealed.

At the scene where he committed murder, Habits remained motionless, concentrating on his senses.

'Blocked.'

Just as he was about to sense something through God's frequency, Wizard closed her heart.

'She said she loved me.'

If her heart was directed toward Sirone, the game would automatically be Habits' victory.

'No, if even a trace of affection showed, my heart would lean toward falsehood.'

If that happened...

Even Habits himself couldn't imagine what would emerge from chaos then.

Wizard spoke.

"The mission isn't over yet. Please give me one last chance."

Though he guessed why she suddenly changed her attitude, Sirone firmly shook his head.

"I'm not blaming you. I can't let you play this kind of game with Satan. Leave it to me now."

"This isn't Master's responsibility. From the moment the assassination failed, this has been my fight."

Sirone looked at her with pity.

"I know why you're doing this. But from now on..."

The moment he grasped Wizard's wrist, the avatar of the Merciful God appeared and swayed greatly.

"...Transcendence."

It couldn't be helped.

If she endured any longer, her heart's door would truly open.

'White Self-Force!'

Wizard unleashed her most powerful strike against Sirone with all her might.

Bang!

One frame disappeared, and as the air expanded, the building's walls burst outward.

"Haa. Haa."

Wizard glared ahead.

'I'm sorry, Master.'

At that moment, the dust cloud cleared and Sirone emerged, wrapped in smoke of light.

"Yes, you really are strong."

While Wizard was stunned to see him without a single wound, Sirone smiled bitterly.

"But who do you think taught you?"

"Ah..."

If avatar techniques were manifestations of the self, then Sirone could be called her superego.

"Honestly, I would have been caught if I hadn't known. But I know you well. So..."

Wizard's heart raced.

'I'm happy.'

Just the fact that he blocked her strike lifted half the weight of her cosmic sense of mission.

'Someone I can always lean on... my only adult.'

"So..."

Sirone opened his mouth after thinking.

"This time I'll follow your will. But you must win. Yahweh's disciple can't lose to Satan, right?"

Wizard's fist clenched.

'Yes!'

She had proven it.

Meanwhile, Sirone felt pained watching Wizard's joy.

'A seven-year-old who transcended limits.'

While he had blocked it, it was indeed a technique no one else could imitate.

Sirone offered final advice.

"You can do it. Whatever it is. Right?"

Wizard, who had been mulling over those words, made a cold expression and raised one corner of her mouth.

"Yes."

It was perfect mastery.
