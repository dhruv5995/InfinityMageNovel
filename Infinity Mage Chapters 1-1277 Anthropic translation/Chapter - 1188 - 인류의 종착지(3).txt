Humanity's Final Destination (3)

Son Yoo-jung and Mortasinger ran swiftly through the warehouse grounds of the System Control branch.

"Move!"

Countless black riders pursuing from the sky hurled pitch-black chains toward the ground.

"Yoo-jung! Above!"

Before Mortasinger could finish speaking, Son Yoo-jung quickly swung her two staffs.

Sparks flew from the clubs, and several chains wrapped tightly around her arms and legs.

"Graaah!"

Son Yoo-jung felt her strength draining away as scalding smoke poured from her mouth.

'Cloud Somersault!'

She twisted her entire body and pulled with both arms, dragging the black riders down with her.

"Grrk! H-how...?"

Her flaming eyes ignited, and her blood-red clubs began pummeling the black riders' vital points.

"Think a stone monkey is easy prey?"

As the black riders scattered like smoke, Son Yoo-jung dropped her shoulders and breathed heavily.

"Hah. Hah."

Mortasinger approached.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah... No. These things are really strong. Honestly, they're the type I hate most. It doesn't even feel like I'm hitting them."

There was no satisfying impact.

"By the way, did your abilities disappear too? That Hidden Piece thing, you know what I mean."

Before joining the Satan cult, Mortasinger had been an irregular who could split space like a puzzle.

"I'm still not sure. I've broken free from Satan's brainwashing, but I don't know what's real."

"Right. Well, you can think about it slowly. Let's go for now. We need to find a way out of hell."

When they arrived at the main gate, Son Yoo-jung couldn't take that final step.

"What's wrong? Aren't you leaving?"

Son Yoo-jung touched her golden headband.

'He's not reciting the Golden Incantation. He's really not calling me? Is he underestimating my abilities? Or...'

Rete's face appeared, shouting:

"What are you thinking about? Let's just go! If we run far enough, they'll never find us!"

"Yoo-jung."

Mortasinger approached.

"After falling to Satan's temptation, I experienced countless things in hell. I ended up like this."

There was something he realized after breaking free from the brainwashing.

"But the reason I don't deny it is because I once loved this form too much. Of course, it would be a lie to say I don't regret it, but I've learned the power of the heart. Don't deceive your own heart. You don't need to run away because of me."

"Morty..."

It was Mortasinger's nickname.

"I'm not saying to go back. I'm not saying to leave either. Do what you want to do."

"What I want to do."

For the first time, Son Yoo-jung looked into her own heart.

Rian jumped down.

"Here we go."

As he walked boldly with his great sword resting on his shoulder, the demons hastily retreated.

'Gehenna's chains.'

They would burn up the moment they were grazed.

"Are you okay, Sirone? I heard some strange sounds on the way. What exactly happened?"

Sirone said:

"We have an opportunity."

"I see. So what do we need to do now?"

"True Voice."

The explanation was brief, but what mattered to Rian was where Sirone's ground zero was aimed.

"Good. Let's go, Sirone."

Rete fired purifying flames.

"Don't let them escape!"

Demons slipped between dozens of fireballs, targeting Sirone.

Rian twisted his body and swung his great sword, causing the purifying flames to flicker out.

"Ugh..."

The demons' bodies, split in two, burned with pure magic and seeped into the great sword.

"Graaah!"

Rian, having instantly purified the magic, rolled his eyes back and glared forward.

Rete screamed:

"No!"

As he plunged his great sword into the ground, bubbles began swelling up from the assembly hall floor.

"Graaah!"

Rian's face contorted, and an explosion filled floors 11 through 13.

The black riders guarding the warehouse grounds heard the roar and turned toward the office building.

Restrain the sinners.

Sirone and Rian, who had jumped from the office building, saw black storm clouds covering the sky.

They were all black riders.

"Sirone, that looks pretty serious."

With agents and demons pursuing from the office building, there was no time to delay.

"Run!"

While running, Rian asked:

"You said we're getting True Voice. If we purify her with Gehenna's fire, will she really return to reality?"

"There's plenty of possibility."

Sirone checked which direction the black riders' cloud was moving and changed course.

He continued:

"If the central processing unit is destroyed, it becomes impossible to calculate purification time."

"But the karma doesn't disappear, right?"

"When the system breaks down, anything can happen. Just like the numbers in your bank account aren't actual money. If the banking system is destroyed, the money evaporates."

"...I see."

During their conversation, the black riders had approached to within a few hundred meters.

Escaping the cloud was impossible.

"Damn!"

The black riders stopped at a distance, while agents lined up densely behind them.

'Do we have to fight?'

Seeing Sirone and Rian stop, Rete smiled meaningfully.

"Black riders are programs. They can't be purified by Gehenna."

She extended her hand.

"Take it."

Having already experienced the black riders' power at the Wailing Wall, Rian gritted his teeth.

Foolish sinners.

Just as the cloud of black riders flew toward Rian, a hole burst through with a bang.

"Kraaaah!"

The one who left scorching heat around the hole's edge was Son Yoo-jung, wrapped in cloud somersault smoke.

"Weak things always cluster together. Makes me want to beat them up."

Mortasinger arrived through the hole, and Son Yoo-jung walked over steadily.

"Hey, you."

Her staff pointed at Sirone.

"Why didn't you recite the Golden Incantation? Are you ignoring me? Don't you need my help?"

"Right."

Son Yoo-jung's eyebrows twitched.

"There's someone who needs your help more than I do. Fight for that person."

The monkey's long fangs were revealed.

"Shut up. You and Buddha just spout honeyed words. Then when you need me, you'll call. No matter where I am, no matter what I'm doing, you'll recite the Golden Incantation..."

"Why did you come?"

Sirone saw through her rambling to hide her true feelings.

"If you've already reached that conclusion, why are you coming to me asking such things?"

"You...!"

At that moment, the black riders launched their chains.

'Hidden Piece!'

As Mortasinger activated his irregularity, the landscape split into 98 sections.

"Got it!"

Regaining his magic was also proof that he had escaped Satan's brainwashing.

By changing the black riders' positions like a cube, the chains shot in different directions.

Mortasinger looked back at Sirone and shouted:

"We'll handle this! Go!"

'Some kind of enlightenment.'

Having experienced both extremes, it must have been a firm conviction he could obtain.

While Rian dealt with the agents, Sirone turned his gaze to Son Yoo-jung.

"Well done. You saved Mortasinger."

"...It wasn't me who did it."

"Right. Intelligence eventually finds its way back to righteousness. But your role was the greatest."

"What are you telling me to do?"

Son Yoo-jung lowered her staff and shouted angrily.

"I'm not Mortasinger! I don't know math, magic, science, or anything!"

Sirone smiled bitterly and said:

"I don't know either."

"We call understanding the world knowledge, but even after knowing and learning more, the place we arrive at is... ultimately ignorance. Because this world began from nothingness."

Sirone approached.

"Knowing that we cannot know is intelligence. Not being trapped by prejudice, listening to many voices, and being able to change oneself."

Just like Mortasinger had.

"You are an uncut gem. That's probably why he sent you here. Open the door of your heart. Entrust yourself to all possibilities. If you can still choose even after that, that would be true righteousness."

"True righteousness? Open my heart? Is it that simple? If I've considered all possibilities, would it be right to kill people or mess up the world?"

"Yes."

Sirone spoke with conviction.

"If you truly opened your heart, if you sincerely entrusted yourself to all possibilities..."

He placed his index finger on the golden headband.

"You would never make such a choice."

The golden headband shattered with a clang, but Son Yoo-jung was already in a daze.

'Won't... choose?'

What is righteousness?

Throughout human history, countless people have poured out all kinds of words about righteousness, but...

'Righteousness is...'

Sitting quietly in an empty room, closing your eyes and looking into your own heart.

"Simply what is right."

We already know it.

We're just tired of reality's brutality, sick of human cruelty, and deliberately turning away.

"Son Yoo-jung."

Sirone said.

"You saved one human from hell. There's no reason to restrain you anymore."

Son Yoo-jung caressed where the golden headband had been and raised her head to look at Sirone.

'Yahweh and Buddha.'

At what point did these two people, who are so alike, diverge?

Fire lit in Son Yoo-jung's eyes.

"Kiii!"

She passed Sirone like lightning and struck an agent with her staff.

"Gaaah!"

Just as sound had been muted until now, the noise of battle suddenly rushed in.

"Go."

Son Yoo-jung said with her back turned.

"Whatever you're doing, it would be troublesome with these guys around. I'll handle them, so you leave."

"Please. Rian, let's go!"

As Sirone launched himself, Rete shrieked:

"Catch Yahweh!"

Son Yoo-jung shouted:

"Mortasinger!"

As if he had been waiting, Mortasinger used his irregularity to move the two far away.

"Damn! What is this now?"

By the time the puzzle-like mixed space returned, Yahweh had already left the branch.

"Chase them!"

An agent who received orders had his face crushed before he could rise even 10 centimeters.

The cylindrical depression was filled with the afterimage of a staff, followed by the sound of meat being ground.

The agent's body, hit dozens of times in an instant, was bent in zigzag patterns.

"Grrrr."

As he fell backward with a thud, Son Yoo-jung, exhaling steam, looked back at Rete.

"Go where? I was just getting warmed up."

Rete smiled coldly.

"Hmph, there's only one place to go anyway. I'll tear off your limbs and then pursue."

"Can you really do that? You know, right? A stone monkey doesn't break even when crushed under a mountain."

Son Yoo-jung connected her two staffs in front of her, and her body blazed with golden light.

"Destroy Evil, Reveal Truth."

Breaking the wicked and revealing the righteous - this was the true righteousness she pursued.

'I'm sorry. I won't break again.'

As the severed parts disappeared and were reborn as one staff, Rete frowned.

'Great Sage Equal to Heaven.'

Long ago, with the same aura, she had turned hell into a wasteland...

Son Yoo-jung's face contorted like a demon.

"Kiiiiii!"

As fragments of light scattered, holes began bursting through Rete's upper body.

'That crazy monkey!'

A flash of light pierced through Rete's left eye as she retreated at tremendous speed.
