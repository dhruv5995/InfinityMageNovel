The End of History (3)

Shiina frowned.

'Board?'

To treat a living person like a corpse just because their mind was damaged.

"I don't know what the Illuminati is, but we're not interested. So go back."

No matter what sweet proposal he might make, the ominous feeling that she didn't want to get carelessly involved was too strong.

"Really?"

Crown pointed at Quan.

"That human might be able to regain his sanity, you know?"

"What?"

Shiina's eyes widened.

And she thought that no matter what price she had to pay, she absolutely had to get involved with this person.

"Is there a method?"

"Simple. Just fix it. For instance... the receiver is broken. The signal comes in but can't be processed. But if I board, I might be able to fix it."

"This boarding thing..."

Crown made a circle with his index finger and thumb.

"Just need to drill one small hole. Then cover it back up and it's done. It won't leave any visible scars."

She instinctively knew he meant the brain.

"Are you insane?"

"Hehe."

Crown turned his head toward the battlefield.

Gaolsin and humans were fighting fiercely on the mountainside as if projected on a large screen.

In the sky, Shirone and Nane were clashing, while on the ground, humanity's elite forces collided with Ymir.

Kyaaaaaaaa!

The cathedral building, overlapping with the other world, screamed as it burned from the bottom up.

"What a wonderland."

He had no interest in good and evil.

His interest lay in the fundamental question of life that applied even in the outside world.

Does love transcend death?

Why did living beings choose the system of death in order to leave descendants?

There were newborns in the outside world too.

Even though they had achieved immortality.

Therefore, it was insufficient to see it as a necessary choice to counter viruses.

Crown said:

"To enter the wonderland, you need a body stronger than now. This could be an opportunity for you. Choose. Moderate misfortune, or hope with low probability."

Shiina was silent for a long time.

Crack. Crackle.

The area turning to charcoal continued expanding around where Havitz stood.

Kido, holding the unable-to-stand Uorin from behind, increased their distance.

'This is bad. Even if I activate Vanishing, it's useless if I can't attack Havitz.'

Because what Satan wanted was only Uorin.

"Running away?"

Havitz's non-existent mouth split open with a crack.

"How amusing."

His body burst into flames with a whoosh and shot toward Uorin at terrifying speed.

"Ugh!"

Kido reflexively aimed his spear but flinched, remembering the terrible pain from before.

'If I get hit by that again...'

His legs were already trembling.

"Damn it!"

Like Gaold, he erased his worries and stepped into the pain.

"Here I go!"

Upon collision, the spear immediately began burning, but this time he didn't let go.

'I have to protect her.'

"Kekeke!"

As Havitz's mouth split wider, his cheekbone burst with a thud, scattering fragments.

"Huh?"

As he staggered sideways and turned his head, Natasha stood there with her fist clenched.

"Run away."

Hearing his heart beating incredibly fast, Kido examined her fist.

It had hardened black like coal.

'That must hurt.'

At that moment, Natasha's avatar battle doll forcibly injected power into her hand.

When she spread her five fingers, ash burst out with a pop and pink new flesh sprouted.

She said:

"I'm the one who has business with Havitz. Evacuate the people. If you stay here, you'll experience hell."

"Why?"

Kido had to ask.

"You were on the same side as that bastard too. Revenge? What does it matter now if other people live or die?"

"...Because we're friends."

As if she had spoken very difficult words, Kido couldn't ask any more.

"Go."

"Don't talk nonsense!"

As Havitz ignited his body again and charged, Natasha instantly blocked his path.

Before Kido's eyes, sonic-speed consecutive strikes exploded.

"Quickly!"

Seeing Natasha's face contorted with pain, Kido hesitated no longer.

"Aaaaah!"

As he shouldered Uorin and ran down the corridor, Havitz in the flames let out a shriek.

"Kreeeeeeee!"

Kido felt dizzy.

'Please! Please!'

Don't chase us.

The pain from just having a part of his body burned was enough to make him lose all will to fight.

'If I'm completely consumed by the Death Field...'

Only eternal pain awaits.

It wasn't about force or skill - he had become someone who feared the very act of fighting.

'I have to run away. All of humanity if possible. We need to get as far away from Satan as possible.'

Upon escaping underground, humans and demons were fiercely competing for territory.

What was the point?

"Everyone..."

Kido shouted with all his strength.

"Get out of here!"

"Grrrr!"

Having lost Uorin, Havitz turned his terrifying gaze to Natasha.

With her right arm and left leg carbonized, she was sweating coldly and biting her lips.

"Does it hurt?"

"Why did you have to be so annoying? I said I didn't want to play, didn't I? Who do you think you are to interfere?"

"Hehehe."

Natasha couldn't concentrate.

'I feel like human charcoal.'

But regardless of her will, the Grim Reaper's avatar made her body stand up.

"Aaaaah!"

When Natasha, with her superhuman tenacity, screamed, even Havitz found it entertaining.

"Serves you right. I didn't like you from the start. You were all just pretending to be friendly because of our family anyway."

Natasha seemed to hear it in her ears.

Havitz, Havitz. Sunset child.

Though she had no clear memory, even there Havitz seemed to have been quite a difficult person to deal with.

"Havitz."

She said with unfocused eyes.

"Grow up a little."

Crack, Havitz's face crumpled and black ash fell down.

This worthless world, if he wanted to, he could burn it all down right now.

Natasha said:

"Let's go back now. Our friends left too. Whether our memories are real or not, let's end it here."

Havitz was silent.

'Wizard.'

Even if the memories were true, he would never go back leaving her behind.

"No. If you want to go, go by yourself."

"I see."

Even while feeling terrible pain, Natasha activated the Grim Reaper's Dance.

"Then I'll send you off."

Havitz's mouth opened.

"Kekeke."

Five minutes later.

...

In the corridor, black and burned like a fire scene, one victim's corpse lay alone.

Twisted limbs charred to coal made identification impossible, but...

Creak. Creak.

The avatar, seemingly malfunctioning as it bent joints, revealed she was Natasha.

"I told you, go by yourself."

A corpse with fingers curled, trembling intermittently.

Having no ears to hear, no mouth to speak...

It was eternal agony.

"How is it, want to die? Should I kill you?"

Havitz, who had been irritably watching the corpse's vibrations, stepped on and crushed her face.

"Hmph."

Creak. Creak.

The battle doll folded like paper and fell, then completely disappeared shortly after.

"Be more moderate from now on."

Was freeing Natasha consideration for a friend, or mockery?

"Wizard."

One thing was certain: he would never show mercy to the world again.

"Wherever you are doesn't matter."

If he turns the whole world to ash, the only person left will be you.

"Kekeke."

As Havitz's body burst into flames again, the embers of the already burned building came back to life.

"Kahahaha!"

The Death Field was expanding at tremendous speed.

Kyaaaaaaaa!

At the screams coming from Delta headquarters, the ground forces all turned their heads.

"Wh-what is that?"

The building instantly burned up, and even the earth was widening its black radius.

"Satan."

As if proving the birth of true extreme evil, a massive ship appeared high in the sky.

The Grand Justice announced to the world:

The day of judgment has arrived. Humanity, all the results of the history you have built will come before the judgment seat. In the battle between good and evil...

"Aaaaah!"

Shirone screamed and charged.

"Nane!"

Countless photon cannons were fired, but Nane's sermon destroyed them all.

"Why did you kill them!"

"Shirone, look at the world."

"Why! Why did you kill them!"

"Look at what humans have done! Look at the Satan created by human ignorance and evil, desire and obsession!"

As the Death Field expanded, all the humans within it were turning to charcoal.

Auuuuuuu!

Though they had no mouths, the sound of all their souls wailing seemed audible.

"What more do you want from this world? They can't even die! Living until death with hearts burned black - that's all this world is!"

"Hyaaaah!"

Shirone, finally reaching Nane, grabbed him by the collar.

"Why."

Tears flowed.

"Why did you kill them."

"It can't be undone. That's something you can't take responsibility for! Why! Why!"

"I take responsibility."

"What?"

Shirone raised his head with murderous eyes.

"Then die."

As Photon Cannon Infinity activated, waves of particles spread at light speed.

"Foolish one."

Simultaneously, a sermon containing the strongest logic split the particle waves and pierced Shirone's chest.

"Gasp!"

Watching him fall to the ground with sad eyes, Nane raised his hand.

"I shall save all beings from suffering."

A massive golden sword began rotating in the heavens.

"Shirone!"

Discovering the falling Shirone, Lian pushed past Ymir and threw his body.

Sliding on the ground as he caught him, he immediately checked his condition, but there were no visible fatal injuries.

However...

"Snap out of it!"

There was no sign of consciousness returning.

With Shirone's defeat, not only the elite forces but all those fighting together accepted reality.

"We lost."

Humanity had been defeated.

"Take Shirone and leave."

Miro approached, examining the Death Field.

"Without Yahweh, we can't stop Nane. Even fighting Satan right now would have the same result."

Lian, holding Shirone with one arm and gripping the Great Straight Sword with the other, asked:

"Where should we go?"

Miro could only say one thing:

"As far as possible."

Understanding perfectly, Lian nodded and kicked off the ground simultaneously.

He was prepared to run to the ends of the planet.

"Where are you going?"

Ymir blocked his path.

'Damn!'

"It seems like everything's ending anyway. We should finish things too."

Even if the world closed, he wanted to know who would be the last one standing.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Every time Ymir's attacks hit the Great Straight Sword, it felt like his bones were being crushed.

"Unbelievable."

Such extreme defense.

"So that was your limit? The aggressive momentum, the violent prowess - was it all just bluff?"

"Grrrr!"

It had nothing to do with recovery ability.

He was just afraid of leaving the world helplessly without protecting Shirone.

'I'll protect him.'

The moment strength entered his convulsing hand, Ymir narrowed his eyes.

'This is?'

It seemed like not Lian, but a single Great Straight Sword stood before him.

"Hyaaaah!"

The Great Straight Sword, moving according to conviction, cut through all three of Ymir's right arms.

"Huh?"

Ymir looked at his shoulder with a blank expression, then turned his head again.

"Hah. Hah."

Lian's hand, with muscles gone and only bones remaining, gripped the Great Straight Sword.

"You..."

At that moment, Lian kicked off the ground and fled.

"No."

This won't do.

'You're a Yaksha. A demon. You've come this far and you're running away? You?'

Want to see the giant go crazy?

"Come back."

Come back...

The moment he realized Lian had already disappeared from sight, Ymir's face crumpled.

"Graaaaaaaaah!"

Nane spoke:

"Sermon."

Great Earth Annihilation Wave.

As the golden sword pierced the earth, the products of civilization fell as dust.

"Aaaaah! Retreat! Retrea—!"

Even someone's cry was buried in the spreading dust clouds.

Rummmmmble.

Thus, humanity's history came to an end.

Omega, terminated.
