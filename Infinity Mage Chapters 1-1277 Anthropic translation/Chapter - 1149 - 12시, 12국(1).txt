12 O'Clock, 12 Nations (1)

The midnight bell tolls vanished without a trace, as if such sounds had never existed from the beginning.

A quiet night.

"Hurry up and assess the situation!"

The sectors of each nation in the holy war were in a state of extreme emergency.

'What is this? What the hell is going on?'

There were no reports on how quickly the killing intent amplified by the Moon Kingdom would affect reality.

'It's an assassination plot. There's no other explanation.'

It would be faster than the bell tolls.

"Pony!"

Sirone, who had extracted assassination information from Apocalypse, rushed to Tormia's sector.

The knights stood guard like stone statues, but their expressions alone told the story.

'As expected...'

Going deeper into the sector, the leadership was pacing around anxiously.

Yet it remained quiet.

As if desperately trying to compress boiling water and freeze it, they were desperately suppressing it.

Their bewilderment.

From that point on, Sirone also slowed down and slowly approached where the king was staying.

"Whew."

After taking a deep breath and opening the door, instead of bright lighting, dark shadows from candlelight awaited.

"Sirone."

Lufist and Albino were standing there, and Dante was lost in thought with a serious expression.

"Is he safe?"

Since the bed was hidden by curtains, Lufist realized from Sirone's question.

"Apocalypse? Since when?"

"I found out just now. It seems it's already too late though."

When Dante silently pulled back the curtain, Pony lay there pale as death.

"Miss Lilia."

The one keeping watch beside Pony was Lilia, a mage from the Akeanis Temple.

"I prevented instant death. But I can't guarantee anything."

The totems and shamanic implements placed beside the bed - Sirone exhaled deeply and asked.

"How did you predict this?"

Dante answered.

"We didn't predict it. Couldn't even guess. Lilia read the malevolent energy through the flow of intelligence."

Lilia continued.

"I created shamanic barriers for most key figures besides His Majesty, but this was unexpected. It's incredibly strong. It's like soaking your body in poisoned water."

Cheonibardo's senses detected the form of a ghost swaying behind the bed.

"Get out of Pony."

Miracle Stream enveloped Pony's body.

"Kyaaaaa!"

The unconscious Pony's eyes snapped open and his back arched like a shrimp.

"I'll kill them! I'll kill them all!"

With the boundary as the dividing line, afterimages overlapped and Pony's face transformed into that of an evil demon.

'Damn it.'

When the Miracle Stream was removed, the ghost was suppressed again by Lilia's law.

"This is serious."

Lilia nodded.

"It's not normal magic. I tried exorcism too, but the killing intent is too strong for it to work. If we forcibly break down the boundary, His Majesty will die."

Sirone's eyes filled with determination.

"It must be the Moon Kingdom. I identified a future where they use shamanism to assassinate the kings of each nation."

Lufist asked.

"Who dies?"

"That's meaningless. Since we've already extracted it, the future will change subtly according to changes in reality. However, the initial assassination targets seemed to be six. Tormia, Jincheon, Corona, Tribal Federation, Paras, Gustav."

Dante said.

"Half of the 12 nations. They created a smokescreen so no one would know who ordered it. Anyway, Apocalypse information can't be adopted as evidence. Evidence that each nation can pick and choose to their advantage can't secure objectivity."

Albino muttered.

"Kashan is missing."

Everyone looked at him.

"From the Moon Kingdom's perspective, Kashan's emperor should be the top priority for elimination. Among the traditional three empires, only Kashan is missing. We have to assume they've joined hands."

Lilia asked.

"Couldn't they have deliberately left them out to target that point? To frame Kashan?"

Lufist shook his head.

"Sending killing intent is a kind of declaration of war. If designated as a war criminal nation, other countries also gain justification for royal assassination. In such a situation, deliberately cornering an empire would backfire. Even if they were prepared for it, it would be more beneficial to send killing intent to all 11 nations from the start."

Dante agreed.

"The alliance seems certain. What remains is our response. We too must consider the possibility of an alliance. The quiet will only last until tonight. When dawn breaks, swords will move."

A bloody storm will blow.

"Use Quan."

Albino said indifferently.

"Bring him."

Lilia watched with sad eyes as Dante nodded and left the room.

'How cruel, a life that must win.'

Sirone, sitting on the bed, touched the forehead of Pony, who was breathing sharply.

He seemed to be desperately holding on.

'Hold on just a little longer.'

The moment the boundary collapsed, the ghost would tear Pony's heart to shreds.

'I'll save you.'

To revive Pony, there was no choice but to directly eliminate the demon from the other world.

A knock was heard.

"Association President."

The face of Tormia's Foreign Minister, who entered through the door, was flushed red.

"Code One."

At the word referring to a summit, both Lufist and Albino reacted simultaneously.

"Where?"

"The South. The Tribal Federation."

It was a force that had not shown any particular moves since the holy war began.

Albino rested his chin on his hand.

"Hmm. Code One, you say..."

According to Sirone's words, the South was also included among the targets struck by the Moon Kingdom's killing intent.

'Tormia's king is unconscious. The South wouldn't be different. Could they possibly be unharmed?'

With the same thought, Lufist said.

"It could be a scheme to spy on other nations' situations. Let's proceed with Code Two for now."

"Actually, that's... the South says it doesn't matter if it's not specifically Tormia's king."

Albino's brow furrowed.

"What does that mean?"

"The condition the South presented is Sirone's attendance. They say they'll accommodate our convenience for everything else."

Two things became clear.

'First, this is a meeting with a clear purpose. Second, the South's leader, Entara, is likely unharmed.'

Meaning they blocked the Moon Kingdom's killing intent.

'Alliance possibilities and information about shamanism. Either way, this Code One is necessary. The problem is Sirone...'

Since he was currently drawing a line with Tormia, it was questionable whether he would step forward, but it was needless worry.

"Let's go."

Sirone stood up from the bed.

"They might tell us how to save Pony. Please arrange the meeting as soon as possible."

"Yes. Then."

After the Foreign Minister left the room, Albino prepared the documents necessary for Code One.

"You'll attend, right?"

At Sirone's question, Lufist nodded, but couldn't help feeling bitter.

'For a friend...'

Was that all it took to move Yahweh?

'Or.'

Was that all there was?

At the midnight bell, Fermi stopped working and stretched.

'Collect information from the holy war, and attempt a reversal with information extracted from Apocalypse.'

It was time-consuming work, but once he grasped each nation's weak points, the effect would be tremendous.

"Hm?"

At that moment, the magic of Lampa, the world's greatest information mage, Gold Bird, infiltrated the secret room.

Of course, the caster wasn't Lampa but someone from the Parrot Mercenary Corps.

'Finally.'

Fermi, who couldn't handle simultaneous events, had to choose between Apocalypse and the holy war.

He chose to participate in the holy war, but he hadn't moved without any preparation.

'With Tele Bird, I can receive information in the shortest time.'

What Lampa demanded in exchange for transferring the magic was naturally the extraction information from Apocalypse.

Surprisingly, the deal went smoothly.

Lampa was already over 100 years old and planned to put his outstanding disciple Chong at the forefront.

'Gold Bird is a real-time information communication system. It means the Parrot Mercenary Corps succeeded in extraction.'

Any information would do.

Change - if he could just detect the world's change, Ardino's wide-area vision would derive the answer.

"Shall we turn the holy war upside down?"

With such thoughts, when he touched the Gold Bird, the code was unlocked and a screen unfolded.

The information contained in that screen wasâ€”

"Damn it!"

The chair fell over with a bang, and Fermi immediately left the secret room and ran down the corridor.

'That old man!'

Manolka, the king of Kesia.

He first met him when he was wandering the world after losing to Sirone in the graduation exam.

"What's a young guy doing here?"

An old man approached Fermi, who was working at a mining village in a remote area at the time.

When Fermi, who had been warming himself by the coal fire, looked up, a skeletal old man was standing there.

"Are you mute? This elder is asking. What's a young guy with all his limbs intact doing here?"

"...Working."

When Fermi answered briefly and looked back at the coal fire, the old man sat down next to him.

"Oof. Of course you would be. But this mine doesn't have much profit. You could die from ground collapse at any time. That's why the nation's prisoners do hard labor here, or guys who can't reveal their names gather here, just like you."

Fermi stopped stirring the coal and asked.

"So what?"

"Heh heh! Your eyes are still alive. Mekia Mine is the perfect place for someone who wants to die. But watching you for a few days, you seem a bit different."

The old man stared intently at Fermi.

"Did the world you knew change? You seem to have lost someone precious."

"Long ago."

Yorga's face came to mind.

"But it doesn't matter, since I couldn't protect them. It's natural providence for the weak to have something taken away."

This time the old man was silent.

"By the way, what are you doing in such a dangerous place, old man? You should be watching your grandchildren's antics at home."

"I manage this mine. I have to check how things are going, don't I?"

It made sense in its own way.

"I have no heir. But I have more than enough mouths to feed. Sometimes useful guys come to places like this, so I'm looking around."

"Going to pass down the family business?"

"Not bad. Even if it's an unprofitable mine, you could make a living if you had one."

'Unprofitable mine.'

Fermi pondered the true meaning of those words, then shook his head as if it was pointless.

"Find someone else."

"Think about it carefully. It'll be better than now. You could get a pretty wife and eat meat dishes."

"Why me? The world is full of smart guys. You could grab anyone and make them do it."

"Having a lot of knowledge doesn't make you smart. What use is asserting what you know when no one listens? It would look less ignorant to just hit someone over the head with an encyclopedia. At least then you'd knock them down."

Fermi just listened.

"What must be done to persuade someone? Not many guys think about such things. Because it's a different level of difficulty from knowing something. Enduring and enduring again until you get the desired result. Just like..."

The old man pointed his index finger.

"You."

Silence flowed.

"You haven't given up, have you? If you're thinking of pushing through, come to me. It's not a mine with much to extract, but you won't lose out."

"...In three days."

Fermi stood up.

"Let's go to the royal castle. But I have no intention of inheriting the throne. So if you want to sit at the top of the world before you die, try to live as long as possible."

Listening to the receding footsteps, the old man looking down at the fire raised the corner of his mouth.

"Did I get completely found out?"

Well, it would be strange not to know.

"Yorga's son."

Ardino Fermi, after all.
