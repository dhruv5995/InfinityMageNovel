Living On (3)

The Other Side.

Son Yoo-jung's staff, having attained the enlightenment of breaking through illusions, turned Lethe's body into a honeycomb.

"Huk!"

It was the exact moment she was about to transmit power to the ground.

'What's so fast?'

Just as Lethe was shocked by her inability to react, Son Yoo-jung was equally surprised by her breakthrough of her own limits.

'Why?'

Because it was right.

A single righteousness that anyone could understand by sitting alone in a room, closing their eyes, and falling into deep thought.

'This is wisdom.'

If evil's methodology is easy yet complex, then good's methodology is difficult but simple.

When that simplicity is fully accepted into one's life, good becomes unshakeable.

And this, truly...

This was a sanctuary prepared only for good - something evil could never possess.

As an avatar bloomed from Son Yoo-jung's body, Lethe regenerated one eye and raised her head.

The golden-glowing avatar of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven filled the sky of hell.

'How annoying.'

Lethe bent both legs and searched for an escape route.

'If I stay like this, I'll miss Yahweh. I must prevent him from reaching Jin Seong-eum.'

Even if it means abandoning the System Control branch.

'Now!'

The moment Lethe shot her body like a bullet, Mortasinger used Hidden Piece's ability to pull her space back.

Returning to her original position, she twisted her body to see Son Yoo-jung flying toward her, spewing steam.

Lethe spat out:

"...You'll regret this."

"I won't."

Not anymore.

As the staff that split Lethe in two struck the ground, shockwaves swept through the branch's warehouse.

"Boss!"

Just as the agent was about to run out, flames of the earth erupted and took massive form.

"What's that?"

Demon or god?

A building-sized monster was roaring while dripping flames.

"Insignificant creatures dare interfere with hell's administrator!"

As everything touched by the heat was purified, the agent retreated further.

'Is this form the Mother of Hell, Lethe?'

Lethe raised her head and ground her teeth.

'Yahweh, binding me won't let you achieve your will.'

From the visible edge of the sky, pitch-black clouds began rushing in at tremendous speed.

Probably every demon in hell was flying toward Sirone and Lian.

"Yoo-jung!"

Mortasinger approached with a terrified expression, but Son Yoo-jung looking up at Lethe remained calm.

"It's okay."

The Great Sage Equal to Heaven's avatar blew golden smoke from its mouth and aimed its club at Lethe.

"Because now I can say it." No matter what happens before my eyes...

"I'm the one who's right."

A single flash containing her idea pierced through the monster's solar plexus.

Ymir's Deep Layer 1st Stage.

Miro gazed upon a black sphere that couldn't be any darker.

'Black hole.'

The light flowing along the sphere's perimeter couldn't send signals anywhere.

'Well, if the sun symbolizes law...'

Ultima, the extreme of the heart, should be called a black sun.

Arius said:

"Light being unable to move means there are no signals. In other words, law is perfectly constrained."

Ymir looked up at the sky.

"Right. All matter reveals its own presence within the backdrop of this universe."

This was maternal psychology, so Ymir's language was source information possessed from birth.

"How is it expressed?" Ymir stood up from his seat.

"Weight?"

That's just human standards.

"Hardness?"

Not a perfect definition.

"Existence."

Ymir turned his head toward them.

"How much one projects their existence into time and space. If we were to rank them, stars would definitely top the list. But..."

As Ymir tensed his body, the surrounding scenery felt like it was crumpling.

"There are stronger things too." Projection of existence.

It felt like no law whatsoever could stop what Ymir wanted to do.

As Ymir took a step, the light from the sky was sucked into the black hole, transforming into a gray landscape.

"My existence reaches beyond the universe's veil."

The outer world.

"All questions are answered." Arius said.

"The black hole is a phenomenon symbolizing Ymir's unique mind that integrates 10 billion consciousnesses. That landscape itself is Ultima, but to be precise, the Ultima we're looking for will be at the end of the black hole."

At the singularity of infinite density with no volume.

"In the nightmare created by Mong-ah, Ymir was defined by 10 billion eyes. Why is that frightening? Because if gravity collapses even slightly, Ultima breaks. In other words, Ymir's existence itself is denied." Miro said:

"Simply put, if even one eye turns away from him, we can win?"

"Yes. It seems like 10 billion Gaians define Ymir, but Ymir also controls those 10 billion. It's a law where each refers to the other - number 2. Ymir is both the integration of 10 billion and a single Ultima."

Arius faced the black sun.

"It's in there - what we're looking for."

"Can you do it?"

Arius could steal if he understood the target's mind, but Ymir's mind was an exception.

"I don't mind going in and dying, but even so, stealing would be impossible."

"Do it."

Miro said.

"You not doing it is what's impossible."

Realizing something from her voice, Arius immediately bowed his head.

"Understood."

What would be frightening?

That this woman called Miro's mind was a perfect work of art.

Though her blood, flesh, and even heart had been stolen by Gaold, Arius had no regret about seeing her mind at the cost of losing both eyes.

'Right. I have to go in again.'

Like a sea woman feeling back pain on cloudy days, Arius looked up at the black hole.

"Arius."

Miro said.

"Come back alive."

He knew she wasn't the type to say such things unless it was a farewell.

Even as Arius flew toward the sky with a smile, Ymir didn't move.

"I'll let you through."

His presence, having integrated 10 billion Gaians, wouldn't be shaken by a mere gnat.

'No pursuit.'

Though Arius was relieved for now, he was terrified about what came after.

'Inside there...'

What exactly was waiting in that black hole that had pierced even Ymir's maternal psychology?

Gritting his teeth, Arius opened a door to the center of the black hole at an immeasurable distance.

"Uwaaaah!"

Falling into the deepest part of the universe, Arius felt his consciousness disintegrating.

'It's okay. It's not the body.'

Because this was all in a dream.

But he could confidently say that if he fell for just a few more seconds, his ego would be destroyed.

'Endure. Just endure.'

If only he could confirm Ultima's true nature, the possibility of theft would be much higher.

'Implant.'

He just needed to plant a special shock in Ymir's maternal psychology that craved sensation.

In a state decomposed to minimal units, Arius experienced something that destroyed common sense.

'Ahh.'

With his sense of existence that formed his ego blurred, he finally reached the singularity.

There was...

'Light.'

Because he was blind, paradoxically, he could see more clearly - a massive light was waiting for him.

"Ahhhhh!"

His soul screamed in supreme ecstasy.

Meanwhile, Miro's group, having sent off Arius, was confronting Ymir.

"Right."

Ymir approached.

"Reaching the 1st Deep Layer - you're probably the first. No, not you."

His gaze turned to Gaold on Miro's back.

"Heh, what? Did he lose consciousness from just that much?"

The group faced reality.

Though Gaold had broken through the realm of numbness to open the 1st Deep Layer, from Ymir's perspective, he hadn't even started yet.

"Hmph."

Miro, who had set Gaold down on the ground, walked toward Ymir.

"You're showing off a lot, but not feeling pain isn't something to brag about. You're just strong from birth. But Gaold is different. He came this far in a human body."

After thinking briefly, Ymir asked:

"What's the difference? In the end, strong is strong, isn't it?"

"That's why I'm going to teach you." As the avatar of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara was born, Luffer and Mong-ah carried Sirone outside the radius.

"We'll protect Master Five Stars."

"Yes."

Since Sirone was the one who needed Ultima, it was natural.

As Gang-nan and Sein took positions behind Miro, Ymir raised an eyebrow.

"With just you guys?"

Pole Line, Wolf of the South, Black Line's greatest mental magician.

But the only being who had made Ymir feel the sensation of life was Gaold alone.

"Forget it."

As Ymir's fist shot upward, the longing gas filling the atmosphere exploded, emitting light as powerful as the sun.

Literally, with one gesture from Ymir, a sun had been born.

"I'll wait until that guy wakes up. Dealing with you would only spoil my appetite."

Sein had to acknowledge it.

'This is Ymir's mental world. His ego here is practically a god.'

It was Gaold who had penetrated Ymir's mind that was actually beyond common sense.

Ymir sat down and rested his chin on his hand.

"What are you doing? Everyone sit. There's nothing to do anyway. You can't even attack, so are we just going to stare at each other?" Though it was a good proposal for the group, their feelings about accepting it were different.

'Damn! He's looking down on us.'

Miro turned around and asked:

"How's Gaold?"

Gang-nan, who checked his condition, shook her head.

"He doesn't seem like he'll wake up anytime soon."

"Really?"

Miro nodded and walked toward Ymir.

"That's fortunate."

"Huh?"

The moment Ymir's eyebrow twitched as he rested his chin, the avatar of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara spread both arms.

Time compressed to infinity, and sensing danger, Ymir shot up from his seat.

Considering Gang-nan's eyelids didn't even twitch, it was tremendous speed, but...

'You bastard.'

Miro was faster.

As Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara's palm technique pummeled Ymir left and right, the world shook accordingly.

'Take this.'

Finally struck hard on the right, Ymir bounced off the ground and flew away.

Gang-nan and Sein's mouths fell open.

'The shock got through.'

Looking up, they saw the goblin-like scowling face of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara.

"Anger..."

Was this possible for Pole Line? As they pondered this, Miro walked toward Ymir.

"Listen carefully. If you make one more tear of blood flow from Gaold's eyes..."

"Keueeeu..."

As Ymir, having offset the shock, glared between his arms, she spat out:

"Then forget Pole Line or whatever - I'll tear you apart."

'I see.'

Sein understood.

'Miro isn't Yahweh. Even someone's death can't shake her perfect mind.'

But Gaold was different.

If he had received something that transcended death, Miro had no choice but to respond in kind.

And the intensity of that anger was...

"Come at me. You need more beating."

Enough to completely blow her top.
