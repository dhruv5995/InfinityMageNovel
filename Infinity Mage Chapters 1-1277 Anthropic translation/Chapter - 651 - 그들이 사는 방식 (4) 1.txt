[651] The Way They Live (4)

The complexion of the woman dressed in rag-like clothes looked truly awful, combined with the winter cold.

"Are you alright? Come inside first."

When Sirone offered, the woman obediently nodded and walked toward the carriage.

"Hmph, young people these days..."

Austin grumbled as he extinguished the fire on his hand.

Though she had injuries here and there, the woman was voluptuous and quite beautiful.

She was certainly enough to become a target for bandits, but the problem was that she was also good enough to deceive the eyes of young-blooded men like Sirone and Rian.

"Thank you. I was really... so scared."

When Sirone boarded the carriage, the woman came close and grabbed his arm, shedding tears.

"You'd be shocked if you knew what happened to me. The bandits, they..."

Sirone patted her back.

"You don't have to say it. Rather, what I want to ask is..."

"Wait, Sirone."

Rian spoke from outside the carriage.

"I'd prefer if this woman didn't sit next to you. That is, if you agree."

While helping someone in crisis was natural, when it came to protecting Sirone, he couldn't compromise on anything.

Realizing Austin and Rian's cold attitude, the woman gripped Sirone's arm even tighterâ€”the only one who had treated her kindly.

"Please sit across from us. The carriage is spacious anyway."

"Oh, yes."

When Sirone said this, recalling Austin's words, the woman moved toward the wall and sat in a seat facing the two men.

"Ouch!"

Even as she gently loosened her clothing ties and caressed her painful skin, Sirone and Rian didn't even pretend to be flustered.

'Are these guys even men? Usually when I come on this strong, they pretend they can't resist and go along with it, don't they?'

If they had been suspicious, they wouldn't have let her board the carriage in the first place, so it was more accurate to say they had high vigilance.

'Well, even though they're young, they were said to be quite powerful mages.'

Only after the carriage departed with the window near the coachman left open did Sirone ask about the circumstances.

The woman, who introduced herself as Marie, revealed that she had been captured by bandits while traveling with friends from the capital.

"How many were there?"

"I'm not sure. But there were over 100."

Austin whipped his head around.

"What? 100?"

If the scale exceeded hundreds, it was quite a large organization even among bandits.

Most of all, what worried him most was the high possibility that it was a unit with mages.

"Where are they now?"

The woman pointed to the side of the carriage.

"If they don't know I've escaped yet, they'll be beyond the mountain. I came straight over the mountain and down."

'We'll encounter them on our way.'

Taking a detour would be the best method, but Austin was cautious like a veteran.

"What will you do? We need to decide now if we want to avoid the bandit group."

Sirone asked Marie.

"Is it possible they don't know you escaped?"

"Many other people were captured besides me. And my friends too..."

Watching Marie burst into sorrowful tears, Sirone fell into thought for a moment.

Should they avoid battle, or rescue the hostages?

"Let's continue this way. We need to rescue the captured people first."

"What?"

Marie's eyes widened.

No matter how powerful a mage he was, it made no sense for just three people to attack a force of over 100.

"We have to rescue Marie's friends too. Don't worry. We're not taking Marie with us."

"Oh, no. It's about rescuing my friends..."

Though Marie was surprised for different reasons, she hastily changed her attitude to appear conscientious.

"Don't worry. We'll definitely rescue your friends."

She thought the ones who should be worried weren't the non-existent friends but them, but she couldn't find any trace of tension on Sirone's face.

'Is he really that strong? He's younger than me...'

Marie stared intently at Sirone's profile as he turned his head toward the window.

On the ridge of the Jigger Mountains, 89 members of the notorious Red Blade bandit group from the capital had set up camp.

"Why aren't they coming? Are you doing this right?"

"Reporting!"

A messenger arrived on horseback.

"The carriage carrying Ariane Sirone is approaching the alliance location!"

Red Blade bandit leader Coldpark frowned.

"Tch, was it a dud after all?"

As the main agent of this operation who had even thrown his mistress Marie as bait, he had missed the opportunity to monopolize a fortune.

"Let's go back. We'll join up with the alliance."

The fact that everyone was mounted alone gave an idea of the Red Blade bandit group's scale.

While moving along the mountain path, Banker, a mage and strategist, drove his horse alongside Coldpark.

"Going toward the alliance means he intends to fight. He seems to be a powerful mage as rumored."

Whatever decision Sirone made, whether to fight or take a detour, the bandit group controlled both routes.

This was possible because numerous bandit groups besides Red Blade had participated in this operation.

However, they had thought there might be a chance to monopolize the spoils if Marie frightened Sirone's party enough to make the carriage detour here, but this was ruined when Sirone chose to fight.

Vice-leader Alpasa approached Coldpark's left side.

With a large double-bladed axe strapped to his back, he was driving his horse with his arms crossed, using only his thigh muscles.

"I heard he's an Ivory Tower candidate. Isn't it dangerous even with the alliance?"

Even for one of the three major bandit groups in the Kingdom of Tormia, composed of Schema masters, this was a job that required preparing for total annihilation.

"Business has been going well without having to deal with such big shots. The subordinates don't seem convinced either."

Red Blade's pride was no less than the army's, but if Alpasa himself had doubts, there was no need to even ask about the members.

"Banker, tell them why we have to fight."

At Coldpark's instruction, Banker pulled out a scroll containing information collected from guilds everywhere.

"Ariane Sirone. Confirmed graduate of Alpheas Magic School. Presumed to possess an object called Armand. Rumored to have received it from Kazura royalty. When appraised, suspected to be worth at least 6 billion gold."

"6 billion gold..."

Alpasa and the members' eyes immediately changed.

"Do you understand now? It's money we couldn't earn even if we were reborn and became bandits again. There are rumors that the Ivory Tower even deals with royalty, but that's just organizational power anyway. If we can't cut off a single finger of some twenty-year-old, what kind of bandits are we?"

Based on various information, Sirone's Armand was suspected to be contained in Kubrick.

Coldpark shouted boldly.

"You bastards crazy for money, women, and pleasure! When did we ever do banditry while protecting our lives? Anyone who doesn't want to make big money, get out now!"

Thud thud thud thud! Thud thud thud thud!

Among the sound of hoofbeats shaking the ground, no sound of anyone leaving the path and moving away could be heard.

Coldpark, who had stopped his horse at the top of the ridge, looked down at the forces spread below the mountain and grinned.

"This is Red Blade's greatest war ever."

Jigger's Ear, Beast Lynx, Spear and Death, Blood Master.

237 troops from four renowned bandit groups near Bashka had formed an alliance and were camped below the ridge.

"Let's go, boys! 6 billion gold is waiting for us!"

As the carriage approached the rendezvous point, Marie closed her eyes with a tired expression.

'I need to finish them off here...'

The reason for wearing light clothing was primarily for the honey trap, but there was also a strategy to make the opponent let their guard down.

If they were in their right mind, no man would step forward to search a woman's naked body.

Once she released the sleeping gas, arrows loaded with magic bullets would devastate the carriage, and this was why Coldpark thought there might be room to monopolize the object.

'How about that? First time seeing something like this?'

Having risen this far through honey traps, even with her eyes closed, she knew the typical reactions of ordinary suckers by heart.

'Hehe, as expected...'

When she slightly opened her eyelids as if startled by the carriage's vibration, Sirone was looking out the window with his chin propped up, exactly the same as before.

'Typical naive type. I appreciate the consideration, but if you miss this opportunity, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.'

Giggling inwardly, Marie pretended to fall back asleep and turned her body to the other side.

'Time to start...'

Just then, when she confirmed Rian observing her without changing his expression at all, her heart sank.

'What? Is it coincidence?'

Feeling the need to confirm, she properly made eye contact this time, but Rian's gaze didn't even budge.

'He's watching. Damn it.'

It was a movement achieved through years of training and practice, so he wouldn't be suspicious, but gas dispersal was impossible this way.

'There's no more opportunity. I have to settle this here...'

Marie took the most powerful pose and lifted her eyelids just slightly to watch ahead through her eyelashes.

This was also an advanced skill, but Rian continued his vigilant stance without changing his expression.

'Annoying. What the hell are these guys?'

Honey traps don't fail.

Though they have the disadvantage of only being usable on half of humanity, their near 100% success rate was guaranteed by history.

'I'm not even a woman, is that it?'

Though her pride was hurt given her great confidence in her skilled techniques, she really had no time now.

'The bombardment will start soon.'

Tweet tweet tweet. Tweet tweet tweet.

When birds chirped from the mountain peak, Austin frowned and looked up at the sky.

'Ominous.'

Sending signals with bird-call whistles was a traditional bandit method, but the problem was that it was indistinguishable from actual bird sounds.

'10 seconds ahead.'

Marie, who knew the meaning of the signal in the whistle sound, counted the time remaining until bombardment.

'9 seconds. 8 seconds.'

"Marie."

Sirone, who had been looking out the window until now, turned his head for the first time and stared directly at Marie.

Sirone's face, confirmed through her eyelashes, was so cold that she couldn't think of him as the same person as before.

"What are you hiding?"

Her fingertips twitched at Sirone's question.

'Breathing. I need to control my breathing.'

It was a level reached after countless practice sessions, but her heart couldn't be controlled in front of Sirone's confident gaze.

'Damn it! I missed the beat. I'm already caught.'

The woman who had squeezed her eyes shut suddenly twisted her body and escaped through the window to the driver's seat.

'4 seconds! 3 seconds!'

Even seeing Marie throw herself out of the carriage, Austin looked at the sky first instead of getting annoyed.

Archer units using hang gliders were flying in from beyond the mountain highlands.

"It's an ambush! Quickly take cover...!"

When he turned around and shouted, the passenger compartment was already empty.

'2 seconds. 1 second.'

As dozens of arrows rushed in, Sirone grabbed Austin's back and kicked off the carriage to jump out.

The moment Rian, who had escaped through the opposite door, beheaded Marie with incredible acceleration.

BOOOOOOM!

The carriage hit by the magic bullet bombardment exploded.

"Urgh!"

As Sirone and Austin were blown toward the mountainside by the air expansion, the sound of hoofbeats rushed into their ears.

Dozens of cavalry were charging along the mountain path.

"Begin combat! Kill them all!"

Austin, loading a fireball, grumbled.

"Tch! So it was a trap after all?"

"At least it's fortunate there are no captured people."

"Saying that now...!"

Before he could finish complaining, dozens of 'Spear and Death' bandits jumped down from the mountainside with spears aimed.

"The 6 billion is ours!"

"Dangerous!"

The moment Austin extended his hand, hundreds of eyes flashed open from Sirone's robe.

Akasic Records

Full bloom.

"Urgh! What is this!"

The spearmen who lost their will to act due to Antithese fell like puppets with cut strings and rolled on the ground.
