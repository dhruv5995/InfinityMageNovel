[677] The Five Senses Emerge (1)

The Shirone Mercenary Company had been scattered in all directions by Geumok's explosion.

This didn't particularly matter to Lufist, but Aria's absence was irritating.

"Where did she go?"

Jane, who had followed Lufist into the air, rose higher to survey their surroundings.

"She seems to have gone quite deep. It looks like she'll approach Biomass independently. We should hurry too."

With Quan staying as her bodyguard, nothing serious should happen, but the code imprinted in Aria's subconscious was a matter that required absolute precision.

"Find her. I'll go ahead to Biomass."

Splitting into two would make them perfect.

"Understood."

Just as Jane was about to board the Cosmic Rail and depart, Lufist added:

"Jane."

"Yes?"

"I won't tolerate a second mistake."

No factor other than returning Biomass as national property should be allowed to affect the mission.

"...Understood."

As the Cosmic Rail flew away at high speed and disappeared beyond the buildings, Lufist looked back at Biomass's spire.

"Quiet."

He muttered as he began walking.

"What are they plotting?"

"Kyaaah!"

Aria, who had collapsed beside a building, clutched her head and screamed.

It was a situation where members of Vega, Spectrum's subsidiary organization, were engaged in combat with Quan.

The military might of the Tubo race, with their bovine faces and abnormally developed lower bodies, was supreme even among the subsidiary organizations, but they couldn't overcome the sword of just one man, Quan.

"Where the hell is he!"

None of the Tubos had seen Quan's face.

This was because the clown Pierrot's movements were too exquisite, and anyone who did see his face had their breath cut short.

Just as a strong wind seemed to blow, Quan appeared before Aria.

As she slowly opened her eyes, she could see countless pieces of beef scattered about.

"Are you alright?"

As long as Quan protected her, she would be safe.

However, the heat from the gold jade that Biomass had heated was tremendous, and severe blisters from burns had formed on her wrists and ankles, which had no special defense mechanisms.

"Yes, I'm fine."

Aria's face was pale as she said this.

'She's infected.'

While Quan's sword was useful for killing, it was utterly useless when it came to saving people.

"I can go. The code..."

Aria's condition was rapidly deteriorating.

Radum was basically a dirty place where numerous demi-human races lived together, making treatment difficult without identifying the cause.

"Quan."

Jane, who had descended vertically from the sky, jumped down from the Cosmic Rail.

"Why are you still here?"

"As you can see, the VIP has been injured."

As Aria trembled with chills, Quan offered what wasn't quite an excuse.

"Germs can't be cut."

It wasn't Quan's fault.

"Jane, quickly... my code..."

Aria spoke with desperate eyes.

Since she didn't know when she might lose consciousness, it was better to transfer the code to Jane as quickly as possible.

The problem was that transferring the code without connecting to Biomass's main system would result in Aria's death.

"It's okay."

She had already made her resolve.

"I am also a diplomat belonging to the Kingdom of Tormia. I know that in times of national crisis, I'm in a position that should sacrifice first. Take the code."

Jane looked at Aria with pity.

'A kingdom's accessory.'

According to Lufist's doctrine, humans were merely tools to be consumed to maintain the system.

Two mistakes won't be tolerated.

The Association President's voice seeped into her mind like hypnosis.

"There's one method."

At Jane's words, Aria made a dazed expression.

"What method in this situation?"

"I'll infiltrate Biomass while maintaining a mental connection with you, Aria. If I go to the main system and transfer the code there, there should be no problem."

Since Jane was a mental-type mage, if she maximized her tentacle-type Spirit Zone, she should be able to maintain a mental connection all the way to Biomass.

"But! Then you'll be in danger, Jane!"

There was no way she could display full combat power while concentrating on the Spirit Zone's form.

Moreover, the place she had to go was the center of Biomass, where the upper class of demi-humans resided.

"You're right, Aria. We are the nation's accessories."

Jane placed her hand on Aria's shoulder.

"But we're not a suicide squad. Not trying when there's a method available isn't something humans should choose."

"Jane..."

As Aria's eyes welled up with tears, Jane turned around.

"Please protect Aria. It won't take long."

Since her resolve also required a terrifying decision, Quan bowed his head respectfully.

'Cosmic Rail.'

Jane, who had connected her Spirit Zone to Aria, boarded the Cosmic Rail and flew back up into the sky.

"Impressive."

Despite carrying the mental burden, the speed at which the rail was laid was no different from before.

In a secluded spot in the concealment zone, Meirei was kneeling with her left ear covered.

'They said to gather at Biomass, right?'

Wig of the Gale ran straight toward Biomass as Lufist had instructed.

On the way, he encountered a Pidu tribe unit, but he too was a swordsman recognized by the world as sacred - where his dazzling twin sword technique passed, only pig heads rolled on the ground without exception.

"Whii. Whii."

At first he thought it was the sound of wind, but when he realized it contained a distinctive melody, he immediately stopped walking and took a combat stance.

"Whiiii. Whii."

It was a mournful melody that matched well with Radum's desolate scenery.

"Who's there? Come out."

Wooooong!

At that moment, an engine sound close to a roar came from the direction of Biomass, and all of Radum's concealment devices shut off.

"What?"

Wig, who had been looking around with a puzzled expression, spotted one goblin in his field of vision and raised his twin swords.

'What's with that guy?'

A goblin wearing a shabby red cloak, with a characteristic hooked nose and nose glasses, was sitting on a rooftop railing, whistling.

The whistle sound faded as if seeping into the air, and he pushed up his nose glasses with his finger, looked up at the cloudy sky, and said:

"Is there a need to fight, comrade?"

It was Kido, the General Commander of Speed Killer.

"For what purpose have you set foot in this ruined world?"

"Ptui."

Wig spat on the ground and pointed his twin swords.

"A monkey acting all scholarly. Quit the chatter and come at me. I don't have time."

Kido, holding a 1.5-meter-long spear with blades on both sides, leaped down with his cloak fluttering.

"Life must eat, and to eat, one must fight. Life itself is combat. Pitiful human, are you also a being trapped in the cycle of consumption and reproduction?"

"Don't compare me to you savages. Disgusting creatures who devour their own kind and assault anyone."

"Without reproduction, there is no consumption."

As Kido swung his spear, a whistling sound rang out.

"Eat, eat, eat, until finally only you and one other human remain in the world..."

The afterimage that had been spinning like a top drew a horizontal line and stopped abruptly.

"Answer me. Would you reproduce with that human, or consume them?"

Wig, inexplicably irritated, launched his body forward like the wind.

"Who are you to lecture me!"

As the twin swords approached with flashing blade light, Kido's spear spread afterimages.

Goblin Spear Technique
One Hundred Eight Earthly Desires.

A sharp whistle sound penetrated Wig's eardrums.

"It seems everyone who should gather has gathered."

Arkman, the master of Silverling Guild, said to Ethella.

Yordic from War Chariot Guild, Bian and Elwi from Blood Rose, and the heavily armored swordsman Baikon were all gathered behind her.

Arkman looked bitterly at the corpse of Kon, who had been a guild member.

While Spectrum's subsidiary organizations searched the area, who to save first was purely a matter of luck, and Kon could be said to have had the worst luck.

'Stupid fool. He should have survived somehow.'

"I'll go to Biomass now."

The reason there was no response to Ethella's words was because they knew the reality of this operation.

In a mission where an ancient weapon was intercepting ground targets, there wasn't much they could do.

"I won't ask you to come with me. No, everyone should go back now."

It was a matter for Shirone to judge, but Ethella already knew what choice her former student would make.

"I'll take responsibility. You won't suffer any losses."

She thought that just coming this far was enough for them to deserve the 100,000 gold.

Contrary to expectations, the members looked at each other.

'100,000 gold isn't even enough for retirement funds.'

As people responsible for their respective guilds rather than ordinary mercenaries, mission failure would have a fatal impact on their reputation.

Arkman looked back at Biomass, which was only 300 meters away.

'We've almost arrived anyway, right?'

The core members' skills weren't to be underestimated either, so if they joined up, they should be able to put up some kind of fight.

"If Silverling Guild stays, War Chariot stays too."

When Yordic spoke, Bian didn't back down either.

"It's a guild I've built my whole life on. I can't give up here."

Just as Ethella sighed at their resolve, dwarves with children's faces popped out from the pathway.

They were Filkers, a magic race.

"Found them. Here they are!"

As Shining magic was cast above the Filker's head, goblins, Pidus, and Tubos came rushing in droves.

Being close to Biomass, the number of enemies inevitably increased, and the pathway was instantly filled with enemies.

"Tch! Let's break through!"

The mercenary company members, united in purpose, took combat positions, and the demi-humans surged forward like a wave.

With all three masters of the kingdom's top magic guilds gathered, their firepower was tremendous.

As Bian bound the enemies' weapons with Magnetic Field, Baikon charged in with his heavy body and swung his sword.

"Creatures worse than insects!"

Thinking he hadn't been pulling his weight until now, he charged much faster than usual, when a dagger flew from the side.

"Grk!"

With a clang, a shell-like blade deflected off, and then Shagal, clearly not normal, thrust his face forward.

"Shagal!"

Ethella shouted, but instantly a crowd of demi-humans surged forward, blocking Shagal from view.

'That guy is dangerous!'

As she punched through the demi-humans to clear a path, the distinctive sound of rapid swordplay, "bung," vibrated through the air.

"Am I going to die after coming this far!"

As Baikon twisted his body left and right, Shagal's dagger bounced off the heavy armor.

'Thick.'

Shagal's interest ended there, and with "pup pup pup" sounds, three slashes aimed for gaps in the armor.

"Uaaaah!"

Baikon, with shells embedded in both eyes and the left side of his neck, thrashed about.

"Tighten your muscles with schema! If you leave it like that..."

Before Ethella could finish speaking, blood spurted out from Baikon's neck area with a "swoosh."

Having faster hand movements than expected meant there was no need to even consider the enemy's condition.

As twelve more shells were embedded through gaps in the already dead Baikon's armor, the corpse trembled convulsively and collapsed.

"Baikon!"

Ethella's eyes blazed as she tried to rush forward, but Shagal's dagger flew at her first.

Unlike before, it was clearly an attack aimed at her forehead, causing Ethella to lean back and stop her advance.

'What exactly are you?'

Why was Tia alive?

'How much is truth, and how much is illusion?'

As Shagal blocked the mercenary company, the Filkers behind whispered with innocent faces.

"What? Is he on our side?"

"Whatever! Just fight already!"

The moment the demi-humans, with their spirits rising like fire, charged at the mercenary company members, Shagal drove his rapid sword into a goblin's forehead.

"Kuk!"

"This bastard! He's an enemy!"

As Speed Killer members sharply changed direction, numerous daggers flew up into the air with a "bung."

'Just kill them.'

Once every living thing remaining in this world was gone, things would finally become clear.

Terrible screams erupted in succession, and over twenty beings instantly collapsed, spurting blood.

Ethella trembled as she looked at Shagal, who had reappeared.

"I'll kill every last one."

Shagal was an acquired serial killer.

And he was the worst of the worst.
