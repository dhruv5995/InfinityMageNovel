[620] Scout Reporting (1)

Extreme Survival Assessment Stage 1 commencing. Tier 10 monsters will be summoned randomly.

As soon as the 2000th system activated, students entered the Spirit Zone.

'Extreme Survival...'

It was known among students as a discipline that was hard to judge as favorable or unfavorable, involving the systematic extermination of creatures from Tier 10 to Tier 1 registered in the Red Line Creature Compendium over 10 stages.

"Gather in the center!"

Without anyone taking the lead, all 30 students assembled in the center of the colosseum as the 2000th system summoned creatures inhabiting remote natural environments—King Tarantulas, Sulfuric Wolves, Underground Lizards—at random coordinates.

"What...!"

The graduating class veterans had experienced all six disciplines, but more than half were experiencing Extreme Survival for the first time.

1,429 Tier 10 creatures summoned successfully.

While the core mission was enemy extermination, this was ultimately Extreme Survival.

As insects, beasts, reptiles, and all manner of vicious creatures instantly saturated the vast colosseum, bodies trembled.

"They're coming!"

As if the very earth was convulsing, all the creatures surged toward the students.

"Hehe, as a service..."

As Fermi's Blizzard created a snowstorm across the entire radius, the remaining students cast their specialized magic.

The dizzying display of multicolored lights lasted only briefly—the 1,429 creatures that had appeared vanished within 3 seconds of their emergence.

Stage 1 complete. Stage 2 will commence in 30 seconds.

Each stage allowed 10 minutes for extermination.

If 10 minutes were exceeded, the next creatures would be summoned immediately regardless of remaining creatures, but if extermination was completed within the time limit, a 30-second rest period was granted.

Scouts from around the world became busy with their eyes and hands, and the Tormia Magic Association scout team—Baikal, Elizabeth, and Lara—also began their work.

Elizabeth's retina lit up as she wore a bracelet connected to the 2000th main system.

"Extermination time 3.24 seconds. Total magical power 23,409 magicles. Highest reading is Fermi's 11,000 magicles, lowest is Eden's 0 magicles."

Lara's notebook floating in mid-air opened, and a pen moved rapidly through writing magic.

"Hmm, 11,000 magicles."

While it was difficult to distinguish between students in Stage 1 of Extreme Survival, the precise control of magical power was certainly noteworthy.

"Participant number 1, Ardino Fermi. Controlled ten-thousand-unit magical power without error."

"He did that on purpose, didn't he?"

At Lara's question, Baikal nodded.

"He knows they only check the highest reading in Stage 1. In 3 seconds, he caught the attention of every scout."

"I'd say that's veteran-like. He's achieved good results every year. There are even rumors he intentionally failed before."

The evaluator synthesizes opinions from the analyst and recorder to assign overall grades.

While updated in real-time, since scouts were also human, making a good first impression was most important.

"Judgment deferred."

But Baikal was relaxed.

"We didn't come here just to see something like this, did we?"

Upon entering Stage 2, Tier 9 creatures revealed themselves.

The number exceeded roughly 1,000, and befitting creatures from the upper levels of the habitat food chain, they averaged twice the size of Tier 10.

"Get ready!"

As beasts that ordinary people wouldn't dare hunt—from leopards with sharp fangs to monkeys with razor claws—charged forward, the power of magic surged even higher.

A spectacular scene of fire and cold, lightning and light interwoven brilliantly continued for dozens of seconds.

"Extermination time 46.22 seconds."

"Definitely fast."

The average Stage 2 extermination time Baikal knew was 1 minute 32 seconds.

"Total magical power 76,530 magicles. The highest reading was Fermi's 22,000."

"Interesting fellow."

That was the entirety of Baikal's impression.

"Entering Stage 3. Things will start getting different now."

From Tier 8 onward, creatures from the monster classification branched from the animal kingdom were included.

If up to Stage 2 was simply fighting strong animals, from Stage 3 onward was a collection of monsters one would almost never encounter without deliberately seeking them out.

Kruaaaang!

'Orc!'

The monster Sirone had first applied God's particles to photon output, but the numbers surging from all directions exceeded 200.

In the sky, the monster bird Taikon flew about making eerie sounds, while underground, giant scorpions Scorpion charged forward swinging their 2-meter tails and moving their legs like cockroaches.

A blizzard was laid down as before, but unlike previously, it only slightly weakened their activity.

'No fool would drop out at Stage 3, but...'

From a long-term perspective, managing mental strength from this point where difficulty drastically increased was important, and participants' minds began working frantically.

'Saint Barrier!'

As students watched each other and the encirclement closed beyond a certain distance, Eden's defensive barrier expanded as a spherical shield.

"Participant number 25. Candler Eden. Magical power reading 30,842 magicles. Standard hardness 307.5."

"Not bad. Durability?"

"Measured at standard strength, 27 press per millimeter."

"Oh?"

Elizabeth's eyebrow twitched.

"Raising magical power reading. 38,000 magicles. 45,000 magicles. 69,000 magicles..."

As the Saint Barrier expanded to a 20-meter diameter, the encirclement widened as if pushing away millet grains.

"Standard hardness 1,209. Standard strength 87 press per millimeter. Magical efficiency reaches 187 percent."

Producing nearly double the power with single magical power was truly tremendous omnipotence.

"Faith omnipotence?"

Baikal made his assessment.

"Grade D. Overprotective. No matter how high the efficiency, it's useless if the mindset is wasteful."

Lara recorded Eden's real-time grade on his page.

"Hurry up! Are you just going to watch?"

As Eden shouted, participants immediately took action.

'Tch! If I fall back too much, it'll look bad in the evaluation.'

Some showed off their skills since they were already committed, and the one displaying the most spectacular action was the Battle Mage Screamer.

"I'll smash them all!"

Teleporting and racing between monsters, Orcs collapsed coughing blood with each attack he unleashed.

"Participant number 10, Logan Screamer!"

Elizabeth's analysis began accelerating.

"Teleport cycle 124 RPM! Obsession error 0.9 percent! Average distance 10 meters 3.4 centimeters!"

"Grade C. Lost in narcissism."

"Participant number 4! Karmis Amy! Firepower coefficient 2.4! Heat quantity 875 degrees Celsius! Targeting accuracy 97 percent!"

"Participant number 14 Victor Savina! Rate of fire 7.9 rounds per second! Cutting intensity...!"

The sound of scouts from around the world analyzing every move of participants in their respective languages overwhelmed the spectator seats.

"...Brutal."

Ryan muttered while watching the VIP section.

Reina, attending a magic school graduation exam for the first time, was also overwhelmed by their intensity.

'So they're being evaluated by people like that.'

The harsh reality of this world was that not just magical skill, but everything about a participant was assigned value.

As Olina, watching her son's battle, covered her face with both hands, Vincent placed his hand on her shoulder upon hearing her sobbing.

'Honey, I feel like my heart's going to burst too.'

He kept his son, fiercely deploying magic, in his sight.

What grade would those capable people assign to Sirone?

Initially overwhelmed by the scene beyond imagination, ultimately all of a parent's senses focus solely on their child.

'Sirone, was this the world you dreamed of?'

A son who never once showed it, even when he tried to raise him as a mountain man's child.

How desperate must he have been.

How much mental anguish must he have endured alone to reach the pinnacle of this fierce competition? The thought brought tears to his eyes.

'Please God, let Sirone pass.'

Among the countless prayers rising to heaven, whose voice would God listen to?

"Extermination time 4 minutes 55 seconds. Total magical power is 323,000 magicles."

It was the point where hundred-unit magical power readings became meaningless.

"The total is high for Stage 3. Who's the one overpacing?"

Elizabeth's gaze caught a boy.

"Highest reading 110,000 magicles. Participant number 27. Arian Sirone."

Baikal's brow furrowed.

"I thought he wasn't a fool."

He had expectations since Flu had introduced him, but this was unexpected behavior.

'I need to push forward from now.'

At the point of passing Stage 3, Sirone completely released his tactical limits.

30 seconds passed in an instant, and Tier 7 creatures revealed themselves.

870 entities—the first time reduced to hundreds, but their abilities were dimensionally different from Tier 8.

Harpies casting sonic magic, Flare Raptors breathing fire, and other monsters with magical properties were included, and above all, they had the ability to solve situations intellectually.

Kieeeee!

As Flare Raptors led the charge, Extreme Survival instantly devolved into chaotic battle.

"Formation is collapsing."

The point of Extreme Survival was that participants became both allies and competitors.

Since the first exam ended when half the participants—15 people—remained according to regulations, psychological warfare was also essential.

'Rampage!'

The moment the light barrier pushed away massive mass, Force pushed away batteries and Shotgun Movement was cast.

Spreading Photon Cannons in all directions while moving freely, scouts' gazes focused all at once.

"Fast Force."

Elizabeth focused on a different aspect.

"Magical power reading has exceeded 220,000 magicles."

"What? 220,000?"

Lara stopped writing and asked back.

"It keeps rising. 260,000 magicles! 320,000 magicles! 440,000 magicles!"

As if proving Elizabeth's analysis, Photon Cannons firing from the sky were devastating the ground.

"440,000 magicles."

Already a figure exceeding professional standards.

'Still not enough!'

The number of monsters Sirone was handling alone reached 32 percent of the total, and the number kept rising.

"What's with that student? He's hogging everything by himself!"

Even parents gave up looking for their children's positions and were captivated by Sirone's martial display.

"Hmph! There's always one kid like that. Kids who sprint at the beginning when they can't even finish the race."

Unlike most parents who viewed it unfavorably, Iruki's father Albino was smiling.

"Magnificent. I expected it after hearing Iruki's words, but honestly I didn't think it would be to this extent."

"Indeed. It's still early stages, but so far he definitely stands out among participants."

The scout section had slightly different opinions.

"Something's a bit strange. What could have happened? It says he has a cautious personality..."

While some focused on visible numbers, others wondered about the excessive response ignoring difficulty level.

Baikal was one of them.

"Why did he make that choice? I told him waste doesn't get good scores."

"It seems like a personal issue."

He had a vague idea of what situation Sirone was in.

"Unfortunate."

Displaying power wasn't everything.

"If he wanted to captivate scouts, he should have chosen a different method."

"Evaluator... it's still rising."

Elizabeth's voice was trembling.

"Magical power reading 520,000 magicles. 610,000 magicles. 69... Immortal Function signal detected! 870,000! 940,000!"

'No one...'

Sirone gritted his teeth.

'Can decide my future!'

As tremendous Photon Cannons reaching 300 rounds per second poured down, ground monsters collapsed like bugs hit by hammers.

The last remaining Flare Raptor fell with a gasp, and Amy stared at Sirone in bewilderment.

'What on earth is he thinking?'

Baikal's expression became serious.

"Magical power reading."

Elizabeth snapped to attention.

"Ah, yes. 1.63 million magicles."

"..."

Baikal covered his face with his hand and frowned.

"That's exactly it, Sirone."

Simultaneously, high in the spectator seats, the corner of a hooded woman's mouth rose slightly.
