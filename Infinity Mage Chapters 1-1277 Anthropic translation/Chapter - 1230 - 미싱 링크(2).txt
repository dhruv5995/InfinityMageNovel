Missing Link (2)

Abel was horrified.

The expression on Cain's face as he stood indifferently in the rain was an emotion Abel had never felt toward another person.

Run away.

That was probably the kind of signal it was, but Abel composed himself and forced a smile.

"What's wrong? Why do you look like that?"

"Abel."

Though he hadn't yet acted on anything, Cain felt a thrill just from that alone.

'How free are we?'

If God is indifferent anyway, what would change if he acted on his thoughts?

'I can't do that.'

Cain discovered the only brake residing within that thrilling insight.

'Killing my brother would be... strange.'

So strange that it seemed to constrain even this infinite freedom that God had spread before them.

"Abel, I..."

Just as Cain was about to speak, a sound came from the room.

"Who's here?"

When Rulua came out of the bedroom, Abel looked back at Cain with an awkward laugh.

"She said she was scared because of the thunder... Ugh!"

Even now, after so much time has passed, Cain doesn't remember what happened in that moment.

"...Brother?"

For an instant the world was pale, and when he came to his senses, there was a knife embedded in his brother's chest.

The first murder.

Abel couldn't understand what had happened to him.

"...Why?"

As his large body collapsed with a thud, Rulua blinked for a moment, lost in thought.

'What is this?'

Why had Cain stabbed Abel with a knife?

'Why isn't he breathing? Is he dead? Like an animal, like the ones we eat... is he dead?'

The emotional aftermath pierced her lungs as massively as it was unanalyzed.

"Ahh!"

Rulua collapsed weakly, and Cain stared at his brother's body growing cold.

'I killed him.'

Many thoughts came to him.

Perhaps these were emotions that would take a lifetime to fully contemplate.

'Now Rulua is mine.'

Cain deliberately turned away from that fact and focused on staying true to his original purpose.

"Rulua."

Even as Cain approached, she couldn't even think to resent anyone.

That's what firsts are like.

Even when something has actually happened, you doubt the facts rather than the results.

"Abel is gone now. He's disappeared from this world. Now only you and I remain, just the two of us."

"Brother."

Rulua was confused.

Having never defined anything as bad or evil, Cain's words were also persuasive.

"Come here."

But as she was led by Cain's hand toward the bedroom, she steeled her heart.

'I love Abel.'

Even if she had to live her whole life with Cain, that fact would never change.

"No. No, brother! I can't become your wife!"

"That's not true."

With only about 60 siblings, humanity just beginning had few choices.

"It's already done. Abel can't come back to life. Now you'll become my mate."

His brain was about to explode with animal desire.

For just a moment, it seemed he had surrendered to that desire, half out of his mind.

But the moment he heard her pitiful sobbing, everything began to become clear for Cain.

"Rulua."

The way she looked at him, the one who had killed Abel...

'I, I...'

It contained a disgust that could murder a person's soul even without a knife.

'What have I done?'

Cain hurriedly pulled away from his sister's body as if he had touched a heated stone.

"N-no."

Just because he could do it, that's why he did it.

"Rulua, please..."

Don't look at me with those eyes.

"Ahhhhh!"

Clutching his head, Cain burst out of the room and slipped on the blood on the floor.

"Huuuh!"

Abel's open eyes were staring at him.

"No!"

The moment he burst through the door and left the house, thunder and lightning stretched endlessly across the sky.

Crash!

The raindrops that instantly soaked his body like being submerged in water felt like Abel's blood.

Crash!

"No!"

Cain couldn't see ahead.

Everything was frightening, and he only wished time would stop like this.

As if someone were chasing him from behind, Cain knocked on Lilith's door.

"Mother! Mother!"

In the end, there was only one person he could rely on.

"Who is it?"

Lilith stared intently at Cain's condition, which looked heavier than being soaked by rain.

Including the ominous bloodstains on his chest.

"Mother."

Cain sobbed.

"I killed someone."

Lilith, who had been contemplating those words with a calm expression, grabbed Cain's wrist.

"Come in first."

Meanwhile, in Abel's house that Cain had left, Rulua's crying echoed mournfully.

"Abel, Abel."

What she finally realized was that something that should never have happened had occurred.

"Ahhhhh!"

Rulua clutched Abel's corpse and wailed.

"No! If you leave like this...!"

Her mind became distant from shock, her pupils rolled upward showing the whites of her eyes.

"Uh, uhh?"

At that moment, the door creaked open.

When she saw a silhouette much taller than a human, Rulua's focus returned.

"Ahhhh!"

Lightning swept away the darkness.

"Dad."

"Drink this."

Lilith handed warm tea to Cain.

"Thank you."

After drying himself with a towel, Cain sat on the bed and sipped the warm tea.

"Hahhh."

His hands were still shaking, but just being in his mother's house was comforting.

Actually, he had never visited before.

Whatever Lilith did in this house, her children just naturally accepted it.

"What happened?"

At Lilith's question, Cain spoke honestly.

His jealousy toward Abel, the expectation that if his brother disappeared, Rulua would come to him, and then the flash.

"I thought it would be okay." Cain shed tears.

"Because I could do it, I thought that meant I should. Mother, what should I do now?"

Lilith was sad.

She knew the desire to possess a beloved better than anyone.

"Come here."

When Lilith spread her arms, Cain embraced her with a despairing expression.

Lilith's pupils shook at that intensity.

"Ahh..."

How long had it been since she felt human warmth?

"It's okay, my son. Mother is here. This mother will protect you. Understand?"

Cain realized.

"Mother."

That if just one person supported him, he could live again.

"Hah."

Making a thin moaning sound through her teeth, Lilith caressed Cain's chest.

It was a kind of attraction.

She could make endless excuses, but in truth, there was no room for any excuse.

Both bodies gradually lost their reason as they surrendered to irresistible tremors.

Cain had nowhere to rely on and was thoroughly excited by murder and sexual impulse.

That was probably why.

'This is insane.'

The reason Lilith desperately came to her senses.

'Let's stop here. I can stop now. Cain will listen to me.'

Her mouth opened.

"Now let's..."

At that moment, Lilith saw the crystallization of desire that was fading even from memory.

'Snake.'

It seemed like the most beautiful snake in the world was whispering.

Take me.

"Ohhh."

When the deep desire she had suppressed until now surged up, it was like becoming an active volcano.

'I'll have it!'

So she embraced the firm body and accepted it with her whole being.

Lilith's scream spread through the room.

"Ahhhhh!"

Extreme pleasure that could never be felt normally flowed into the other world.

Covet! Steal! Kill!

In the demonic whirlpool that crossed the boundaries of reason, both people had a flash of realization.

'Sin.'

This is sin.

As much as fear and shame filled their entire bodies, pleasure doubled and surged in.

'We've touched the forbidden fruit.'

Good and evil.

For the first time since humanity's birth, right and wrong were defined.

"Lilith!"

The moment Adam shouted, Cain was startled as if struck by lightning and fell from the bed.

"F-Father."

Even the witch of lust couldn't handle this shame as Lilith pulled the blanket over herself.

"W-why are you here..."

The light of the Gaians flickered in Adam's eyes.

"Have you finally become beasts? Kicking away even the last chance to go to heaven?"

Lilith glared fiercely.

"You only think about heaven! Do you think Gorphin will call you if you make the Gaians prosper? It's already over! I don't exist just to bear children!"

"Ohhhhh!"

Tears of light poured like a waterfall from Adam's eyes.

'I'm sorry.'

He failed to keep Gorphin's will.

Since the last law of the Gaians was broken, Ultima could no longer exist.

"We've created sin!"

Adam leaped over Cain in one step and immediately applied pressure as soon as he grabbed Lilith's neck.

"Guh!"

As her neck broke helplessly, Cain sat collapsed, his legs trembling.

"F-Father."

Adam looked down at him.

"...Leave."

Who could he blame?

All the siblings on this earth were the result of being born between Adam and Lilith.

"I too must bear sin."

Under Ultima, whatever they hunted, whoever they had relations with, that was righteous.

'Murder and incest.'

Now there were things that shouldn't be killed and relationships that shouldn't be formed.

Good and evil were defined.

"We are no longer perfect righteousness. We will endlessly commit sins in the bonds of feeding and reproduction."

Adam said.

"No one will be able to escape this cause."

It's called original sin.

As Adam left Eden, Cain lay face down on the floor clutching his head.

"Ahhhhh! Why! Why!"

Cain had just lived farming the land while Abel tended sheep.

"Why me! Why Abel!"

What could be done about the cold world, its laws, choosing Abel instead of Cain?

"Huuu..."

How long did he cry?

When the storm finally stopped and dawn began to break, Cain suddenly raised his head.

'I have to leave.'

He couldn't bear to face his siblings.

'But where to?'

Though it was a world where no one lived except his siblings, Cain realized he had nowhere to hide.

It felt like the entire world was condemning him, and someone would kill him.

It was the first guilt.

Cain left Eden before daybreak and wandered the world aimlessly.

He wasn't free anywhere, and even as his body grew gaunt, he thought.

'Why did I do such a thing?'

If it could be resolved by dying, he would gladly end his life even now.

Dry tears flowed down.

'I should have restrained myself. There were dozens, no, hundreds of opportunities. Why did I...'

Cain fell to his knees.

"Stop now. Let me go. I can't endure even a moment! Stop it!"

In the snare of guilt, he was going mad.

"What did I do wrong! Abel could have killed me too! Anyone could do it! Is that evil!"

He wailed again.

"God, please save me. If only that hadn't happened, if only I hadn't committed that act..."

Then thick mist settled before Cain's eyes and a building made of gold appeared.

Cain stared as if entranced.

Perhaps because he was mad, it seemed like the building was speaking to him.

Come. No one will be able to condemn you.

It was Melchizedek, the hall of evil.
