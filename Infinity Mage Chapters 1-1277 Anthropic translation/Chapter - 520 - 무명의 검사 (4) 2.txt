[520] The Nameless Swordsman (4)

Arriving at the entrance of Arch Mountain, Rian fell into thought.

'I cannot save everyone in the world.'

Moreover, even if one wanted to save someone, lacking the ability to do so would be tantamount to suicide.

"I know, Sirone."

That this wasn't like him.

Charging into enemy lines knowing death awaited, dying a glorious death in battle—that wasn't his way.

"Right, that's not it."

Rian smiled.

"I just need to go where my heart points."

The scenery was beautiful, and clear birdsong spread refreshingly throughout the valley.

But the aura of death waiting for him halfway up the mountain distorted all that scenery to a dizzying degree.

The more it did so, the faster his steps became as he pushed through the undergrowth.

If he was going to settle this anyway, he didn't want to drag it out.

Living five more minutes wouldn't change the history he had lived thus far.

As he approached the bandits' stronghold, two bandits on outer patrol drew their swords and blocked his path.

"What? Who are you? Do you know where you've come?"

Rian continued forward without slowing his pace.

After confirming his trained physique and the great sword strapped to his back, murderous intent finally filled the bandits' eyes.

"Stop. If you don't want to die. Who are you?"

Instead of answering, Rian reached back and grasped the handle of his great sword.

"This bastard...!"

Not to be outdone, the two bandits charged down the slope with their swords aimed at him.

"I am Rian."

Rian's face contorted as he gritted his teeth, hot air seeping between them.

"Sirone's sword."

The bandits' eyes shook with shock.

A massive flash was rolling in like a tsunami rising beyond the horizon.

Silvia was gripped by a strange terror and felt the pressure that she needed to say something, anything.

"But why are you looking for that person?"

Ramdas leaned back in his chair and twirled his mustache.

"Hmm, according to rumors, he has reached Divine Transcendence."

"Divine Transcendence?"

"Moving the body through the power of will. Of course, it's unclear whether such a thing is even actually possible, but it's certainly an intriguing topic for a swordsman. The reason I left on this knightly journey at this age is to confirm the reality of Divine Transcendence. That's why I want to meet him. To see if the Knight of Maha can indeed cut me to pieces."

Liz glared and asked.

"Are you saying you'll kill him?"

"Kekeke! It's unknowable, little lady. Whether I'll kill or be killed—that's something you only know after crossing swords. If he's truly the yaksha from mythology, even my black iron armor would be no more than paper."

Having said that, Ramdas aimed his gaze at Silvia.

"Now, please tell me. Where is the Knight of Maha?"

He didn't seem like the type to harass women and children.

But his even more eccentric temperament hinted that he would surely kill if she kept her mouth shut.

"That person is our family's benefactor. He did kill Fox, but he didn't seem that strong. It might be someone else."

The reason Silvia deflected was because she truly didn't know where Rian was.

"Yes. That's just the right amount of rationalization. You've done your best. Where is he?"

Silvia said tearfully.

"I don't know. I asked for help last night too, but he refused and left this morning."

"Oh ho, how pitiful. If that's true, it's truly sad. The fact that the Knight of Maha was nothing but a coward."

Contrary to his words, Liz shouted at Ramdas's cold face.

"It's true! Big brother abandoned us and left!"

"Kekeke! Then is it also a lie that he cut down that Fox fellow with a single stroke yesterday?"

"Th-that's not, but..."

Ramdas, who had been rocking back and forth in thought, asked again.

"Then tell me. You were there, so you'd know. Didn't you notice anything strange when that swordsman cut down Fox?"

As if struck at a vital point, Liz's face hardened.

She couldn't remember the scene from that time.

Not because she was surprised or scared, but because in that moment, it felt like the world was distorting.

Ramdas thought Liz's expression was definitive proof.

"As I thought, you saw it. Deny."

"I don't know. I didn't see anything."

"You didn't fail to see it—you were shocked. It's a kind of shockwave that destroys human common sense."

Ramdas began to get rapidly excited.

"Among sword practitioners, they call it Axing. Among those, the Axing that the Knight of Maha uses is precisely Deny."

As murderous intent rose from Ramdas, Liz pulled at Silvia's collar and said.

"I don't understand a word you're saying! And it has nothing to do with us!"

"Right. But it has something to do with me. So you need to know too, what kind of person the Knight of Maha is."

Ramdas slowly rose and leaned his upper body forward.

"His sword denies the principles of the world."

* * *

"Block him! There's only one enemy! Archers, hold your positions!"

The 120 members of the Red Spear Bandit Group moved in perfect unison.

Perhaps because their leader was a former soldier, their organization was different from other bandit groups from the ground up.

Arrows rained down from 16 watchtowers, and infantry armed with swords and spears repeatedly gathered and scattered, targeting Rian's life.

The swords were threatening, the spears too distant, and arrows were falling from blind spots.

"Hiyaaah!"

Swinging his great sword in an X-pattern to scatter the troops, Rian struck the pillar of a watchtower built with thick logs.

Where the great sword passed was cleanly cut, and the watchtower slowly tilted before rapidly collapsing.

"Aaaah!"

Finding an archer in the watchtower's debris, Rian drove his great sword into the man's back.

Simultaneously, eight spears thrust in from different directions.

"Damn!"

Rolling on the ground to evade, Rian looked around.

Wherever he looked, he saw nothing but enemies.

'Right, this is what a hundred men means.'

Anyone with extensive war experience knows how vast the gap is between a hundred men in one's head and a hundred men in reality.

He had eliminated three in ten minutes, but this meant he could never annihilate them all.

Even eliminating one every three minutes, total annihilation would take 300 minutes.

In other words, he'd have to fight a battle harder than an all-out sprint for five hours straight, risking his life.

Of course, this was only an idealistic minimum figure.

"Surround him! Don't give him time to rest!"

The enemies also knew this fact, so rather than charging recklessly, they were cornering Rian and only unleashing killing moves when decisive opportunities arose.

'I can't win like this anyway.'

Finish it within an hour.

The enemies who had grasped Rian's strategy increased their distance.

But even faster than that, Rian leaped in like a wild beast.

'What...?'

As the world suddenly began to ripple and distort around Rian, the bandits' eyes widened.

Movement that destroyed the common sense of inertia.

How could the landing speed be faster than the jumping speed?

"Hiyaaaah!"

Swinging his great sword wide, he cut down three men's torsos.

An unblockable attack that even shields couldn't stop.

The bandits were horrified, but emboldened by their overwhelming numerical advantage, they advanced again.

"Kill him! If our numbers decrease, we'll only be in more danger!"

The vice-captain's words had great resonance, and the bandits steeled their resolve as if facing a monster that had attacked their village.

"Damn! He wasn't just some kid after all!"

From the bandit group's perspective, Rian's balance was excellent.

But a full 200 eyes were watching him, and several among them precisely exploited openings to inflict wounds.

"Kugh!"

Two arrows lodged in his shoulder and back, and a spear grazed his side.

'There's no end.'

The number of enemies he had cut down so far was 40, but Rian couldn't feel the difference between 120 and 80.

'This isn't it.'

As fatigue accumulated, no matter how much he swung, the thirst that couldn't be filled tormented him again.

The central axis of his thinking had already tilted, and it felt like whatever he did, he only produced wrong answers.

'It's fine to die. But...'

Born as a swordsman, he wanted to feel perfect cutting just once.

"Hiyaaah!"

Rian charged forward with a roar.

If he lacked the mind to comprehend, he had no choice but to accumulate countless failures through his body.

'...What?'

How much time had passed?

Rian was puzzled to realize that the enemy numbers had considerably decreased.

'How many times did I swing?'

He couldn't remember the battle.

No, he hadn't been conscious of it.

The moment he felt the cutting sensation with a *slice*, a thrilling shiver ran up his spine.

'This is it!'

The first perfect cut he had entered while conscious.

And the conclusion Rian reached after accepting that cut with every cell in his body was...

'It wasn't tilted.'

Nothing had been wrong from the beginning.

The sword simply advances wherever it goes.

Therefore, what had been tilted wasn't the sword, but...

'Me.'

Swordsmanship doesn't save the world.

The sword doesn't cut people.

What saves the world and what kills—in the end, it's humans.

Therefore, the sword is simply something to be swung as humans desire.

'I advance solely for myself!'

Where the great sword passed, five fountains of blood from necks spurted up in succession.

* * *

"The cutting has become sharp."

Paycon, who had been watching the battle from the platform of the stronghold, spoke.

He was so large that the stone chair felt narrow, and a spear reddened with actual human blood leaned against the armrest.

"It might be luck. Enlightenment doesn't come easily."

Breeze, one of the bandit group's vice-captains and their only mage, spoke.

He was a man in his mid-sixties with a roughly grown beard that looked like it had been scribbled with a brush.

"There's no such thing as luck. Especially not with swords."

Paycon clearly recognized Rian's transformation.

"If realizing before swinging makes one a genius, then realizing after swinging 10,000 times makes one a fool. But those 10,000 times are frightening. It's a question of who returns with money—an excellent gambler with 1 gold or a stupid gambler with 100 million gold. Being able to swing 10,000 times is another asset that a genius cannot possess."

Breeze stroked his beard and said.

"Then I should step forward."

With the sword's momentum at its peak, it would be difficult for infantry alone to handle him.

Agreeing with that thought, Paycon gestured for him to go ahead.

"Go give him a shot. For a skilled fighter of that level, we'll have to accept troop losses."

As Breeze stepped forward from the platform and raised both hands, crimson flames gathered above his head and blazed.

If he blew away the radius like this, his subordinates would also be sacrificed, but if he couldn't stop Rian, who had turned into a beast, now, things would become more difficult later.

"Quite skilled for such a young age, but..."

Breeze took the magical action of extending both hands forward and cast a massive fireball.

"You've come to the wrong pond to play in."

"It's a fireball!"

The moment the bandits shouted, Rian turned his head in a hunched posture.

The instant he saw the massive flames flying toward him, devouring the air, his eyes bulged wide.

Divine Transcendence.

Yaksha.

As the afterimage of a wrathful deity manifested like expanding air, Breeze, who had been watching Rian, felt his hair stand on end.

"Graaaah!"

Contorting his face and twisting his waist with all his might, Rian swung his great sword toward the flying fireball.

Axing.

Deny.

As a thunderous roar erupted and strong winds arose, the fireball lost momentum and split in half.

Breeze, who witnessed this, wore a dazed expression.

"My, my magic..."

Even Paycon, who had been watching, leaned forward with an expression of incomprehension.

"...He cut magic?"

Even he, who had lived on battlefields for decades, had never directly witnessed such a scene, nor even heard rumors of it.
