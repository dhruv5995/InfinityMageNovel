Living On (4)

The Other Side.

Sirone and Lian, who had been rushing to obtain the True Voice, turned around at the heat wave blowing from behind them.

"That's incredible."

A massive-scale mirage was shimmering above the horizon where the Fire Engineering System Control branch was located.

"Now that Son Yoo-jung has gained enlightenment, Lete won't have it easy either. We need to put as much distance as possible between us in the meantime."

Lian shared the same thought, but seeing the demons swarming ahead, it didn't seem like it would be easy.

'They keep getting stronger. Is this really okay?'

Even if they obtained the True Voice, once the Spirit Realm opened, all the demons from hell would emerge into reality.

"Let's do what we can."

Sirone, reading Lian's thoughts, spoke.

"Someone embracing everything and sacrificing themselves - I'm sick of that now."

Lian fell into thought.

'Sirone, I'm not that smart. So I can't explain it precisely, but there's a contradiction in your words.'

Because it was Sirone who was trying to embrace and sacrifice even that True Voice.

'If you're thinking of ending it all by yourself...'

Lian charged forward.

'I won't let that happen!'

Gritting his teeth and swinging his Great Straight Sword, a heart-stopping roar erupted as demon flesh was swept away.

"Block them! Don't let them advance!"

The demons made themselves into meat shields.

Sirone, feeling something was off, looked at the black clouds beginning to cover the sky and had an intuition.

'Black Victory. He's not going to let us go easily.'

Just from the size of the domain, he could gauge the first move, and the numbers were so meaningless that counting the digits was pointless.

"Lian!"

At the same time as his warning, Miracle Stream activated.

Bind the sinner.

The moment light exploded from Sirone's body, the black clouds descended unrealistically and covered the ground.

"Mama. Mama."

When Ethella regained consciousness, a landscape she had never seen before was spread out.

Intestine-like long tunnels stretched on, and rotten-smelling liquid was pooled here and there in the corners.

She felt a burning pain in her ear.

"Mama. Mama."

A fetus with half its face melted was gnawing on her ear.

Looking down, Ethella saw countless fetuses clinging to her body.

"Why did you abandon me?"

The voice echoing in the tunnel couldn't be attributed to any specific person, but in reality, that wasn't important.

"I'm sorry."

All the life in this tunnel was her children, and she had already made her resolve.

"Come. Follow me."

This place was probably a process of the system that handled karma, and what awaited at the end was eternal extinction.

'It's okay.'

Purifying all limbo was her righteousness, but the only thing that weighed on her heart was...

'Shagal.'

The Taegeuk Chain hadn't disappeared yet.

'I believed you could have been a good person.'

But too many lives had already died by his hands to turn back now.

'This is also a step for you. I don't know how long this journey will be, but...'

May peace come to him as well.

Every time Ethella moved forward through the tunnel, countless limbos clung to her body.

As terrible pain was transmitted through the Taegeuk Chain.

"Aaaahhh!"

Shagal clutched his entire body and rolled on the floor.

'It hurts.'

It was the pain Ethella was feeling.

"Damn it!"

Shagal, lifting his convulsing body, rushed down the corridor again.

'Wait! Just let me see you!'

Opening the door to the engine room, a brain was floating between massive cliffs.

"Hah! Hah!"

Confirming that the chain extending from his chest was connected to the center of the brain, he poured out his quick-draw swords and leaped across the cliff.

"Come out!"

When he stabbed with his dagger, a fetus with swollen eyelids opened its mouth without even being able to open its eyes.

"I said come out!"

Shagal threw the fetus pierced on his dagger down the cliff like garbage and swung both arms.

Even as the brain was torn apart, his heart was beating anxiously.

'Where? Where are you!'

The dagger embedded in the inner wall passed through the opposite wall without any particular resistance.

With a half-crazed expression, Shagal looked back at the path he had entered.

'She's not here.'

The visible brain was just hardware; Ethella had already disappeared into the entire system of the Other Side.

"Why isn't she here!"

Shagal, who had been frantically slashing the brain, suddenly flinched and collapsed to his knees again.

"Aaaahhh!"

Through the Taegeuk Chain, Ethella's emotions of terrible despair were transmitted.

Remaining purification time: 87 years, 2,875 kyung, 3,241 trillion, 120.3 billion, 19,000 hours.

An unwanted message was heard without being requested.

'Why, why are you doing such a foolish thing? You could have just talked! You could have threatened to do this, to commit such acts! Why did you have to...'

He actually knew.

How much Ethella had sacrificed during their time together.

"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"

Shagal, consumed by self-hatred, took his dagger and stabbed his thigh.

'I want to destroy my existence.'

No, I want to grind it up in a machine.

"Die! Die!"

In a fate where he couldn't die until his karma was purified, Shagal stabbed knives all over his body.

"I said die!"

Even as blood spurted like a fountain from the shell of his quick-draw swords, his ego only became clearer.

He suddenly had this thought.

Maybe it wasn't that he couldn't die, but that he didn't want to die.

"Huuuuu..."

Maybe if he tortured his body and caused himself pain, Ethella would stop him like before.

"Why are you doing this to me..."

According to the karma of Taegeuk, Shagal's pain also traveled through the chain and struck Ethella's heart directly.

"Mama. Mama."

The fetuses, unable to suckle and devouring bodies like hungry ghosts, had now multiplied enough to fill the tunnel.

"Let's go."

Ethella walked with tears flowing.

"I'll save you all."

Shagal screamed.

"Screw it all!"

Shagal, pulling the blades from his body, escaped outside the brain's hole.

"So you're going to get revenge like this? Think I'll just take it lying down? No, I'll chase you! I will... definitely find you..."

And drag you back to hell.

'I'll make you stay by my side forever!'

Taking a deep breath, Shagal activated the Scent of Incident.

'There's no smell.'

If Ethella had become a process, it meant she had either disappeared from the Other Side or was in all spaces.

'I can find her.'

Shagal's sense of smell became endlessly sensitive, and he finally detected the specific location of the process.

At the same time, the Taegeuk Chain stood rigid and extended to an unknowable place.

"I'm going."

Even while bleeding profusely, Shagal launched his body and pierced through walls following the chain.

'I'll kill her. I'll slap her face as soon as I see her. I'll torture her slowly. Until she screams!'

The most terrible thoughts he could have about Ethella filled his head.

Remaining purification time...

His pain was still being converted into karma.

The Twelve Apostles who participated in the species war pressed Uriel from all sides.

When Golden Dragon Metira blocked Uriel's Paradise Staff, Poison Dragon Poine spun her body and burrowed into his embrace.

Her back kick sent the massive archangel flying, breaking trees.

As Uriel, pushed back after breaking rocks, steadily regained his center, Poine smiled with her eyes.

"Times really have changed, haven't they? Even archangels are out of fashion now."

Of course, since it wasn't true, it was simple provocation.

Thunder Dragon Blitz surveyed the battlefield.

'Even though we've arrived, the battle between elves and faeries is still neck and neck. We have to see Uriel's influence as that significant.'

Though the Twelve Apostles had each reached the pinnacle of different attributes, the true power of dragons came out when they transformed into their true forms.

'Not being able to use breath attacks is the biggest problem.'

If all Twelve Apostles fought in their true forms, even the vast Green Ocean would be reduced to scorched earth.

Blitz recalled the orders received from the Messiah.

'More important than winning the war is protecting the elves and fire tribe who are on the verge of extinction.'

If they went extinct, the variables that could change the future of the Apocalypse would completely disappear.

'We've already lost a considerable number of elves. We can't lose any more. We must protect them here.'

A resolute determination appeared in the eyes of the Twelve Apostles.

Meanwhile, 3 kilometers away from Green Ocean, there was a temporary fairy camp.

"Crown-nim."

A fairy executive dragged two bound elves into the laboratory.

"Let go! What are you planning to do with us!"

When the male and female pair of elves entered, Crown turned around.

"Oho?"

"Just kill us! Even if you torture us, I won't bend..."

The elf who had been shouting defiantly screamed upon seeing the scene inside the room.

Crown put his finger to his lips.

"Shh. Don't the children get startled?"

"What... what the hell are you doing?"

Creatures living in Green Ocean were hanging on the walls, all with their heads split open, exposing their brains.

"Hm? What am I doing? I'm just... taking a look."

Crown sat in a chair on the table.

"Don't just stand there, come sit. We need to have a deep conversation about the future of life."

The two elves were drawn by fairy power to kneel under the table.

"Future of life? This is slaughter. You're killing living beings!"

Crown was calm.

"Originally, elves were faeries."

"The same as us, meaning they were my subordinates who obeyed me. Then they combined with humans and became the current species."

"What's your point?"

"No, it's just curious. Reproduction - it's impossible without mechanical mechanisms."

"Don't think of us the same as other animals. Elves are a species born from the fruit of pure love."

"I know. It's called agape, right? Virgin birth, creating life without mechanical mechanisms was originally the exclusive privilege of Archangel Kariel-nim. I've been thinking. What exactly is it? How can I become like that too?"

After a silence, he continued.

"I don't know."

Seeing Crown's eye-smile, the elves became anxious.

"I think, before being biological, the concept of life itself. There seems to be a special inertia invisible to the eye. Otherwise, that tragic mechanism of creating offspring and then perishing oneself couldn't be explained."

He believed the core of that special inertia was agape.

"Let us go."

The elf spoke with force in his eyes, but honestly, he wanted to ask to be killed.

Crown flew up onto the table.

"I deny that mechanism."

And approaching the bear hanging on the wall, he inserted his small hand into its large brain.

The bear rolled its eyes back and convulsed.

"If I transplant my brain into this beast, I become the creature called bear. I'll reproduce as countless bears. When I age, I'll just transfer to another creature. Whether tiger, eagle, or human..."

Crown smiled with madness.

"Or elf."

"Aaaahhh! Aaaahhh!"

The two bound elves wailed.

"Enox. When I board the body of the elf leader, I won't need something like agape. But I need quite a lot of data before that."

Crown turned to the elves.

"You will be the first step of my experiment."

It was also the first step of Fairy Biomimetics, which would dominate the future of the Apocalypse.
