[523] A New Contract (2)

Kashan.

A powerful empire occupying one-third of the human realm's territory.

Aganos, the massive palace where Kashan's ruler Theraze resided, was equipped with all defensive facilities against magic, law, and physical attacks, and was a military and cultural fortress that had established its own independent living sphere.

"Wow, it's really been a long time."

Miro's party, having entered Kashan's capital, looked up at Aganos's towers from the fountain in the city square.

The sight of hundreds of towers soaring as if trying to pierce and kill the sky was truly spectacular.

'Theraze...'

During the one year given to her after being selected as humanity's shield, Miro had traveled around various countries of the world, meeting diverse figures.

Among them, the most impressive had been Kashan's Empress Theraze Mistra.

It was officially the first time in her life she had looked at someone and felt they were strange.

Unofficially there was Guffin, but he had already been erased from her mind.

"Ma'am, how much is this?"

Finding it boring to wait until the appointed time, Miro wandered around the shops surrounding the square, shopping.

Armin and Kuan remained motionless in front of the fountain, while Arius followed behind Miro, carrying Sirone who was covered with black cloth.

"That? 2 gold."

"What? How is this worth 2 gold?"

What Miro had chosen was a bracelet made by braiding three different colored leathers.

"Cowhide, horsehide, camel hide, braided together. At this price, you're getting it incredibly cheap."

"Ah, cow, horse, camel."

Miro placed one gold coin on the stall.

"Give it to me for 1 gold. It's just a tiny bit of leather anyway."

The merchant woman looked at her as if dumbfounded.

"What? Do you know how precious leather is in Kashan, asking for half price? That's pure thief mentality!"

Miro forced an eye-smile.

"Ma'am, do you know who I am?"

"Who are you, miss?"

"I'm someone who came to meet Theraze. You know? The empress here. So I'm a state guest of the empire. Can't you give me this one thing cheaply?"

The merchant woman's eyes widened.

"You wicked thing! How dare you carelessly call the Empress's name! No matter if you're a foreigner, this is Kashan's capital! Get lost right now! Before I report you to the patrol!"

When even Theraze's name didn't work, Miro employed her last resort.

"Listen here, ma'am. Empress or whatever, I'm the person who protected the world alone for 20 years! If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be able to do business here either!"

The merchant woman's face was swept with shock and horror.

"Isn't this completely crazy? People! Please call the patrol here quickly! A crazy woman has appeared!"

"What, crazy woman? This lady is really...!"

As a commotion broke out, everyone focused on the stall.

Meanwhile, Kuan and Armin in front of the fountain just hoped they were strangers.

"She's like a walking thunderbolt."

At Kuan's words, Armin smiled bitterly.

"I heard she was a famous eccentric even as a student. People's personalities don't change easily."

"...But is this okay? I understand that matters concerning Miro are classified as global secrets."

"Well... if we can buy local specialties at half price."

When Kuan turned at the nonsensical joke, Armin shrugged awkwardly.

"What can we do when the person herself is like that?"

As Kuan sighed and turned his head toward Miro, a group of soldiers walked from the square entrance, making clanking sounds of metal.

They were all in heavy armor, with amber gems glowing golden at their waists.

Aganos's Royal Guard - Far Division.

The royal guard protecting Theraze was divided into three units: Near, Middle, and Far, representing the range of the empress's protection.

Though Far meant those who protected Theraze from the greatest distance, for residents who had never even seen the palace guard appear, it was impossible not to be tense.

"Hey, miss! If you've been drinking since broad daylight, go home nicely and sleep! What's this harassment of a small merchant!"

"No, why won't you believe me? I'm Adrias Miro! The empress here called for me!"

The captain of the guard who arrived at the square found the woman arguing with the merchant and sighed.

"She said there was no need to search..."

The order Theraze had conveyed through the chain of command was 'bring the noisiest woman in the market.'

As the guard approached the stall, the merchant woman, who belatedly came to her senses, froze with all color drained from her face.

"The, the royal guard..."

Not the patrol, but Aganos's royal guard.

What was even more shocking was that the guard captain stepped forward and showed Miro the highest courtesy.

"You've arrived. I've received orders to escort you respectfully to the Empress. I'll guide you."

"Hmm."

Miro, who had been looking at the captain with drowsy eyes, suddenly grinned and turned her head to the merchant woman.

The startled woman's lips trembled.

The leather bracelet with three colors twisted like a pretzel was properly fitted on Miro's slender hand.

Nothing blocked Miro's party as they followed the guard captain into Aganos's castle.

Maids and servants fled to clear the way, and all gates opened without even needing to knock.

The sight of impregnable gates that even a nation's elite forces couldn't breach opening frantically was a thrilling shock to those who had spent their lives in the imperial palace.

The royal guard bearing amber insignia couldn't go to the 20th floor, so the captain withdrew at that point.

After climbing the narrow stairs to the 20th floor, Aganos Royal Guard - Middle Division bearing diamond insignia was waiting.

The guard captain in white iron armor approached Kuan and politely extended both hands.

"From here, you cannot carry weapons. Your sword..."

Kuan didn't even pretend to listen.

As Miro's party turned the corner and walked down the corridor, the guard captain followed without any particular restraint.

Upon reaching the 23rd floor spire, 10 members of the Wind Brigade wearing owl masks were guarding the door at the end of the corridor.

The remaining 90 members had already been dispatched around the world to search for Ankera's incarnation.

But the 10 remaining were the Wind Brigade's executives, and their collective killing intent was so pervasive in the corridor that even a considerable master might suffocate and die from the pressure.

"Wow, how terrifying. Did they spray poison gas?"

Miro approached jokingly and spoke to the one at the front of the Wind Brigade.

"Could you move aside? What's the point of calling me and then blocking me?"

"...No one except you may enter."

Kuan frowned upon hearing a voice he could never forget even after 10 years.

Miro also didn't act carelessly this time.

Even within Aganos, which was like a fortress, this room was special, and Miro had her own reasons for needing to enter alone.

"Wait here for a moment. I'll go in first."

As the door opened, expanding the space inside the room, Miro's eyes gradually grew cold as she stepped forward.

The sound of the door clicking shut came first, and then she saw Uorin sitting with her legs crossed in a chair.

"It's been a long time, Miro. You're still the same as before."

"I'm seeing you for the first time though?"

She knew that Theraze was Mitochondrial Eve.

However, it was disappointing that the person before her didn't have Mistra's face.

"Hehe, sit down. Shall we have tea? Or alcohol?"

"Before that, I want to talk just the two of us. That's why you called me separately too, right?"

Though Miro's gaze saw no one other than Uorin in the room, it was something she could anticipate without seeing.

"Crouch, step outside."

A moment of silence flowed.

"It's fine. Since I've already called her here, she's not at a level you can handle alone."

As soon as the words ended, the window to Miro's right opened and closed quickly with a thud.

"Is that good enough?"

As Miro slowly sat in the opposite chair, Uorin, who had been staring intently at her face, burst into laughter.

"You look like you're dying to slap me."

"From the beginning... everything was your plan, wasn't it?"

Miro asked Theraze Mistra, who would still be alive in Uorin's memories.

"Of course. Thanks to that, you also escaped from that tiresome dimensional wall, didn't you? Right, has it been about 20 years? How does it feel to be out in the world? Oh, that bracelet is pretty."

"It's not particularly bad. The world I came out to after so long is interesting too. But..."

Whoosh!

The incarnation of Simjeokchowol Banya rose from Miro's body like flames and flew toward Uorin.

Though Avalokitesvara's face was benevolent, dozens of arms each forming different hand seals surrounded Uorin as if to crush her.

"You shouldn't have touched my friend."

She had tried to embrace all of humanity's sins and proceed alone, but unintentionally dragged Sein and Gaold into it.

Especially Gaold, who had been a devout believer, had become an evil spirit and was still wandering hell at this very moment.

No human could fail to feel fear at the killing intent emitted by humanity's strongest Banya, but Uorin knew Miro too well.

"I understand what you mean. So there's no need to pretend to be angry. I understand your feelings, but..."

To the Banya of Musangshim, anger was also just another worldly emotion.

As Avalokitesvara's incarnation disappeared instantly, Uorin looked at the cubic zirconia she had attached to her nails this morning and said:

"I didn't sacrifice Gaold. It was because only Gaold could do that job. Just as only you were qualified to sacrifice yourself for humanity."

Miro pouted her lips.

Indeed, all outward attitudes were meaningless to Mitochondrial Eve.

Uorin, who had adjusted the position of the cubic zirconia, raised her head.

"Right, you probably didn't come to argue, so what's your reason for wanting to see me?"

"You should know."

"Hmm?"

Uorin tilted her head as if she truly didn't know.

'What an annoying woman.'

It was a silent suggestion that if she had something to ask for help with, she should act accordingly.

"I remember now."

The leader guarding the front of the Wind Brigade spoke.

"You were that swordsman from back then."

As she removed her owl mask, the face of the woman who had appeared in Kuan's nightmares was revealed.

Her face was white as snow with light eyebrows, and the sharp gaze hidden beneath thick eyelids was exactly the same as 10 years ago.

As the price for rejecting her proposal, his Achilles tendon had been severed, and Kuan's life had completely changed.

Facing such an enemy just a few meters away, it was natural for murderous intent to boil up.

"You're still holding a sword. I'll acknowledge your stubborn persistence."

As the woman made a whistling sound with her mouth, recalling the situation when she had cut his Achilles tendon, Kuan's eyes flashed.

At the same time, the woman's eyes gleamed as if finding something bizarre.

'What is this...?'

The world was gradually tilting to the right.

10 degrees, 20 degrees, as it tilted up to 30 degrees, he automatically put strength into his right foot due to the illusion that he might slide.

'It feels like I'm going to fall.'

Kuan spoke quietly.

"Don't irritate me. I'm desperately holding back."

He had definitely realized something.

But what kind of realization could twist a human's temperament so bizarrely?

'Even back then I acknowledged his talent, but...'

This was a completely different level.

The swordsman named Kuan, whose Achilles tendon had been severed 10 years ago, no longer existed in this world.

'I should capture him for now.'

The woman slowly shifted her center of gravity to the left.

Then the gradually tilting world began to find its place, and eventually returned to perfect horizontal.

'It's certainly not easy.'

The reason Kuan didn't readily draw his sword even with the enemy who had ruined his life before him was not just because he prioritized the mission, but because the opponent was from the Wind Brigade.

'Wait. Someday I'll cut off all your legs.'

While Kuan was planning for the future, the woman was completely focused on the bizarre temperament she had felt moments ago.

'What exactly was that?'

Unable to contain her curiosity, the woman opened her mouth.

"You..."

At that moment, Miro's voice cut off the woman's words.

"Arius, come in."

The woman, who frowned regretfully, covered her face with the owl mask again and stepped aside.

As Arius entered the room, Uorin raised her hand.

"It's been a long time, Arius."

Though they had formed a connection at Kazra Royal Castle, their circumstances were vastly different from back then.

Uorin, who had been a princess of a nation, had become one of the Three Emperors, and the tomb raider of the Seven Mages had become the faithful servant of the strongest Banya, Miro.

"Lay him on the table."

As Miro grabbed the end of the cloth and pulled it back sharply, Sirone, wearing Armand's robe, was revealed with his eyes closed as if asleep.

'Sirone...'

For a brief moment, Uorin's gaze became tender.
