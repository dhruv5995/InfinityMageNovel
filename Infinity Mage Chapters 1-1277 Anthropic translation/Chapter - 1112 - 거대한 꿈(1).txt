A Grand Dream (1)

The royal guards gathered there felt the world sway with each step Kuan took.

It was neither fast nor slow, a step that seemed almost pitiful in a way.

'It's tilting.'

It was difficult to maintain balance, as if they had climbed aboard a ship being battered by waves.

"Hmm."

While Natasha touched her lips with an intrigued expression, Pungzang was displeased.

Leader Yula spoke.

"Block his approach."

Among all the killing intent being directed at everyone, the strongest aura was aimed at Pungzang.

"Yes."

Just as the 99 swordsmen were about to scatter like the wind, Kido stepped forward first.

"Stop."

Kuan's steps halted.

"You're a swordsman from Tormia, aren't you? This is a place where those without security clearance cannot enter. Go back."

Because Tormia couldn't be hated.

"I have business at headquarters."

Kido looked around at Delta's building, then looked back at Kuan and shook his head.

"Then I can't let you through even more. After the holy war begins, no one can enter or leave."

Rai interjected.

"He can enter. He belongs to Tormia's special forces and carries an entry permit."

Kido bit his lip.

'There's killing intent but no hostility. Of course, if this aura turns into hostility, it would be tremendous...'

Even though he had an entry permit, Kido thought it might be fine to just let him through.

'He must be killed.'

Yula was resolute.

Though not as much as Kido, Pungzang was also in a position to observe Uorin's intentions from the closest place.

'That man is a threat to Her Majesty. Perhaps this is a good opportunity. Even if we cut him down here, it won't affect the holy war.'

Since Kuan was the one who crossed the line.

"I don't know why you're late, but this is a security zone. You can't go through here."

"Then where do I go?"

"That's up to you. But this is the only way into Delta headquarters."

He intended to trap him somehow.

Kido, knowing Yula's personality, spoke to Kuan with a desperate expression.

"Please, go back."

Kuan calmly received that gaze, slowly raised his eyes, and muttered.

"How fortunate."

"Huh?"

Jester Pierrot.

Chogieum.

Suddenly the ground tilted sharply toward Kuan, creating a slope of over 70 degrees.

At the same time, the royal guards unleashed external gravity.

"Catch him!"

Natasha fell naturally, Kido stuck to the ground, and Pungzang flew like the wind and drew his sword.

'I can't let him escape.'

Kuan seemed to be falling down a cliff, and if they lost him even for a moment, it would be over.

At that moment, the 70-degree tilt flipped to the left.

"Damn it!"

North and south reversed again, and now everything was spinning wildly like a sphere.

Only Kido, who was stuck to the ground as an earth-bound spirit, could confirm Kuan's movements.

"Phew! This is really strange."

Meanwhile, Natasha was enjoying the feeling of the world spinning as if she were on an amusement ride.

'As expected, it's not easy.'

Using Chogieum on a single target would make it easy to escape from view.

'But it's difficult to shake off everyone.'

There were hundreds of swordsmen here, and each one was among the kingdom's finest.

A member of Pungzang reported to Yula.

"Captain, he might have ulterior motives. If we move as a group, there might be gaps in our defense formation..."

"..."

"...?"

The fact that all of them were being led around by just one swordsman was sufficiently humiliating.

'But he's that kind of man.'

She recalled the image of young Kuan crawling up mountain paths with his Achilles tendon severed.

'Has he reached this level?'

Suppressing her desire to applaud him as a fellow swordsman, she gave her orders.

"We'll finish this in one strike. Deploy the death formation."

"Yes."

The 100 members of Pungzang crossed like a net and began rotating around Kuan.

'If caught, there won't even be bones left to collect.'

It wasn't an exaggeration.

But Kuan's expression facing Kashan's finest swordsmen was colder than ever.

'I'm just doing what I must do.'

The reason he refused the position of royal guard captain was because protecting someone didn't suit him.

'I am a jester.'

A pierrot who would do any foolish thing to make her smile.

'What was I expecting?'

Did he have the delusion that he could be with her because he was still human?

"Keke."

Within the dark curtain of Pungzang closing in, he recalled Siina's face.

"Smile."

Because it's amusing.

"Strike!"

A hundred blades created a fierce wind and devastated the spot where Kuan stood.

The landscape's tilt returned to normal, and Pungzang's members formed their formation again.

Kido's expression went blank.

"He's not there."

He couldn't see him.

For a moment the landscape distorted, and the next moment Kuan's body had evaporated.

"Move aside."

Rai came running.

In the center where grass swirled like a whirlpool, red drops of blood were dripping.

"...Did we cut him?"

Yula was not mistaken.

"No. None of us managed to cut him. Just before our swords reached him, he disappeared first."

"Then whose blood is this?"

"Probably..."

Yula pointed to her head with her index finger.

"His ear."

By rupturing his own eardrum, his hearing had now also become half-functional.

'Sir Kuan.'

Facing the situation where he had single-handedly broken through the camp where royal guards from all 12 nations were gathered.

'Are you truly trying to become a ghost?'

Rai had some idea of what must be sacrificed to become the strongest swordsman.

The Pope gave his podium speech.

"Lamism is a global religion. However, not everyone in the world believes in Lamism."

The atmosphere was reverent.

"Faith always comes with a price. It is the act of burying one's soul, and knowing that there is a transcendence higher than any rationality."

The Pope's gaze turned toward Sirone.

"What can be gained in return is strength. The peace that can be obtained by believing that I am not my own. Perhaps that's what this world needs."

His gaze was withdrawn.

"Perhaps the value of Lamism should be the courage, sacrifice, and hope that those who cannot fight can lean on."

Gis muttered.

"Oh, Lord."

"No one is God. As the Pope of Lamism, I earnestly pray to God Cria that a leading nation capable of fighting solely for humanity will emerge."

Applause filled the conference hall.

For the Kingdom of Tormia, which had to borrow Yahweh's power, this was an uncomfortable situation.

"It can't be helped."

Rufist rested his temple against his fist.

"As the official religion of the holy war's leading nation, they have strong influence. Above all, they have justification that the kingdom lacks."

Flu agreed.

"Though not blatant, they're subtly using wording that negates Yahweh. They must have done it deliberately."

"..."

"...?"

Though everyone's inner thoughts might differ, the official atmosphere was one of being moved.

"Next, the International Court's proposal will begin."

Chief Socrates climbed onto the podium with his fat, bulky body and wiped his sweat.

"Whew. Phew, it's hot today. No wait, is it just me? I'm wearing a lump of fat for clothing."

When no one responded, he burst into laughter close to shouting.

"Just kidding! Puhahaha!"

The atmosphere was terrible.

"Ahem. Then I'll make my proposal. I, Bebeto Socrates, director of the International Court..."

He glared and declared.

"I resign as of today."

Officials from each nation showed no reaction, but those working in the holy war stirred.

"Mr. Socrates, what do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said. Resignation. I'd rather eat one more piece of bread. Eating is what remains. I recommend Mito Sirano as my successor. That's all."

"Sirano?"

Socrates stepped down, and a gaunt middle-aged woman climbed onto the podium.

Her nickname was the Swamp-colored Witch, someone who had once served as the Magic Association president in the Kingdom of Stang.

"Thank you, Mr. Socrates. For passing this shitty position to me."

Her mouth was crude as usual.

"Then I'll make my proposal. I resign from the director position as of this moment."

"What the hell! Is the holy war a joke!"

Finally, some officials rebelled, but Sirano was unfazed.

"Shut up. It's not about looking down on mages, but don't drag us into this childish political game. Everyone knows anyway, don't they?"

Amid the silence, the moderator spoke.

"But... if even Ms. Sirano resigns, there'll be no one to make proposals. Even when resigning, presenting agenda items would be courtesy to the nations."

"Proposal."

Sirano spat out.

"The strong eat the weak. That's all."

As she stepped down from the podium, the politicians were dumbfounded, but some were smiling.

They were mages.

'They have their particular stubbornness. They're a breed that absolutely won't swallow what disgusts them.'

King Munryong of the Mun Kingdom stood up.

"How absurd! To raise the banner of survival of the fittest at a gathering to promote world peace!"

The moderator tried to calm him.

"Please calm down. It's just one director's statement. Besides, she's no longer a director..."

"Do you think such words will suffice! The International Court is the organization that oversees all regulations and laws of the holy war!"

The intensity of his statement was certainly strong.

"First they let that villain Havitz participate in the holy war, now they say the strong eat the weak. Does the holy war want to smell blood? If taken literally, it means they won't intervene even if a king's head is cut off!"

"That's too harsh!"

When assassination of kings was mentioned, even those who had been watching reacted sensitively.

"This is a gathering for peace. King Mun, who thinks such vile thoughts, is the one with ulterior motives!"

"What did you say? How dare you...!"

Since the topic was what it was, everyone rose up, and the atmosphere of the holy war turned combative.

'Assassination will be attempted anyway. Whichever side loses here will be the first to get beaten.'

Amid the flurry of countless words including displays, bluffs, and threats, the conference hall doors opened.

Everyone was surprised by the mere fact that the entrance opened, and it became instantly quiet.

"What, what is it?"

The one-armed swordsman bowed his head.

"I apologize if I've caused a disturbance."

As he limped down the stairs, the bewilderment of the watchers increased.

'Sir Kuan.'

While Siina watched with complex emotions, the moderator stopped Kuan's actions.

"Wait. Who are you?"

"I am Parca Kuan of the Tormia Kingdom Special Forces. I'm late due to circumstances."

"No, how can you call that now..."

The moderator, more curious than scolding Kuan, stopped speaking and asked again.

"How did you get in here?"

Once the general assembly begins, each nation's royal guards are supposed to guard the only exit.

Kuan looked back at the door and answered.

"I walked..."

"That's not what I mean! I'm asking how you got in! All headquarters doors are sealed and you absolutely cannot enter the building without passing the royal guards..."

At that moment, the moderator realized.

"Don't tell me?"

Had he broken through all 12 nations' royal guards?

At that moment, blood burst from one of Kuan's ears and fell to the floor.

Siina's eyes widened, and everyone who knew him showed shocked expressions.

'Pressure. He sacrificed one ear.'

The balance had tilted further.

While the audience maintained silence, sensing this fact, Kuan began walking again.

He stopped at Tormia's teaching council.

"Excuse me."

"Ah, yes."

Quick-witted Sad moved aside, and Kuan slowly sat in his chair.

It was the seat next to Siina.

"Why...?"

"This is my place."

Kuan couldn't be unaware of what Albino and Uorin were expecting.

'Any nation that touches Siina... dies first.'

While that silent threat pressed heavily on the hall, Albino nodded.

'If you can't protect, cut down everything. If you've truly let go of everything...'

Kuan was now a sword ghost.
