Fine Tuning (1)

Where Bardvelv had vanished, a massive pit of unknowable depth had formed.

Shirone, who had been staring into that darkness, turned to Nane.

"Why did you come here?"

Nane, who had likewise been lost in serious thought, approached with a smile.

"I have legs too, don't I? So I can go anywhere."

"Don't dodge the question."

Shirone spoke firmly.

"If your heart doesn't move, your legs won't move either. You who had never been shaken by anything until now—why did you suddenly come to this place?"

"There's... something strange over there." Nane pointed to the inner castle of the Northern Front.

"An existence with different universal constants from this world. And this means fine tuning has been applied."

"Fine tuning?"

"There are limits to the results of events that occur in the universe. For example, if you create a world where a small ball moves, it's impossible to set that ball's speed, mass, and direction to infinity."

"Because it exceeds the scope of creation."

"Exactly. Therefore, if all characteristics were converted to numerical values, the limit of those values would be exactly the same as the limits of this world's settings. The existence closest to that limit is Ymir."

Nane raised his index finger.

"Of course, in terms of pure power, there are supernovas and black holes, but they're slaves to the laws that follow nature's circulation. In overall totals, Ymir is greater. Free will is such an overwhelming ability."

"So even a small child could burn down a mountain...?"

"Right. But the New Humans are outside those numerical values. Physical, sensory, mental, logical—beings with fine tuning applied to everything. They won't be easy to stop."

Shirone had realized this through Bardvelv as well.

'If it hadn't been for Nane, the battle would have been much harder. The same goes for Nane. But...'

The question still remained unsolved.

"Why are you helping me? Wasn't closing this world what you wanted?"

"The situation has changed. In a closed state, I would be the only truth, but you opened the ceiling. In an open state, the truth of this place loses its absoluteness. Even from my position as Buddha, this is unwelcome."

Nane headed toward the inner castle.

"Let's go. There's something I need to confirm before making a decision. You should see it with your own eyes too."

The terrible truth.

* * *

When Borvbor opened her eyes, she found both hands tied to a rope hanging from the ceiling.

As she blinked, dozens of grasshopper-human faces filled her vision.

"Keeee. Enemy... of comrades."

Though they had no special weapons, only brandishing their jaws and claws, they were sufficiently threatening.

Borvbor felt bitter.

'I'm alive.'

If life is suffering and death is fear, then what exactly is dying and coming back to life?

A grasshopper-human approached.

"Don't think we'll kill you easily."

The one with a larger build than the other New Humans appeared to be their leader.

It thrust out its vicious jaw.

"We'll chop you into little pieces. Watch as your flesh goes down our throats, you inferior livestock."

'Once again...'

All human deaths would be lonely deaths.

'I have to keep living.'

A lonely life.

A life of digging in empty air, where nothing would change whether she lived desperately or disappeared right now.

'It's annoying to die, but living isn't sweet, is it? It's not like the world is coated with honey.'

"Bark! Bark!" 

When the grasshopper-human's claws pierced her side, electricity flashed in Borvbor's eyes.

Her expression didn't change.

"Hehe! You're holding up well. Then how about this?"

As flesh tore and bone scraped against something, a scream burst from Borvbor's mouth.

"Aaaaah!"

The grasshopper-humans burst into laughter.

"Good! What a lovely sound!"

Excited by his comrades' laughter, the leader drove his claws even deeper.

"Now! How's this? This...!"

The leader stopped speaking because he saw Borvbor's still-cold eyes.

'What?'

In her pupils, the face of an insect incapable of any expression was clearly reflected.

As the leader slowly tilted his head, Borvbor's head dropped at exactly the same angle.

'No, no.'

The leader was confused.

'It seems like I'm copying this livestock?'

Borvbor, who couldn't find her identity without borrowing someone else's emotions, spoke.

"Gouge out my eyeballs."

The leader couldn't tell if the voice he'd just heard was hers or his own.

"Y-yes!"

At the point where the boundary between friend and foe disappeared, he reached both hands toward Borvbor's eyes.

"I'll gouge out your eyes!"

"Huh? Huh?"

The grasshopper-humans were horrified.

"Hey! Wait! What are you doing right now?"

At the same time he shouted, the grasshopper-human leader gripped his own eyeballs with his claws.

"Uaaaah! Die, you filthy livestock!"

Borvbor screamed.

"Uaaaah! Die, you filthy livestock!"

Pop—the grasshopper's eyeball burst, and the leader staggered with thick chunks in both hands.

"Haa! Haa! I did it! I got my revenge!"

"Are you insane?!"

As the grasshopper-humans watched in bewilderment, Borvbor slowly turned her head.

"Next."

* * *

When they opened the door, what awaited Shirone and Nane was a girl with an innocent appearance.

The girl eating someone's arm had black eye sockets with small lights embedded in them.

Shirone felt chills.

'I don't know.'

Neither Shirone with Omega nor Nane with the Akashic Records could define her.

"Certainly peculiar."

Nane approached with a smile.

"No matter how the laws change, something like this couldn't be created. A being outside of truth—what are you?"

While deliciously tearing at flesh, Piri spoke.

"God."

No proof was needed.

"From the moment I existed, everything is beneath me. So just offer up your limbs nicely."

The moment Piri finished speaking, a killing intent unlike any they'd experienced before filled the inner chamber.

'A calamity.'

The reason Yahweh and Buddha could divide philosophy was also because the closed world had ordained it.

'It's philosophy for humans, a world defined by humans. No other beings should define it.'

Nane approached while deploying his Sword of Dharma.

"Shall we see your skills?"

Shirone also shattered Hexa and summoned Hand of God, but Piri remained calm.

"Hmm, you're going to fight me?"

"Should we call it a fight? Is there even a point where you and we can collide?"

"Well..."

Piri, who had taken her last bite of flesh, threw away the bone-only arm and stood up.

"Come at me."

As her mouth corners grotesquely tore, Shirone and Nane charged.

'Please...'

Shirone, with Hand of God mounted over his shoulder, gritted his teeth and swung his arm.

'Let there be something left.'

In the silence that transcended roars, the city of the Northern Front blazed with flash.

Rumble rumble rumble!

At 500 meters above ground, Ashraiker and Gaitan watched the battle below.

It wasn't a situation they could interfere with.

Gaitan, holding the unconscious Borvbor's wrist, spoke with a serious expression.

"She has unusual eyes."

Ashraiker agreed.

"Mm. It seems that when she receives photon signals and imagines with quantum signals, it becomes reality. She's ignoring causality."

A mountain was cleanly sliced away.

Perhaps Piri was imagining giant scissors and mutilating the landscape?

"It's like combining Yahweh's subjectivity with Buddha's objectivity. But even so..."

The one being pushed back was actually Piri.

"A wondrous cooperation. If even the slightest mental gap had occurred between those two, it would have already been over. That the one who understands Yahweh best is Buddha—how ironic."

As magic circles formed in Ashraiker's pupils, the ground scene magnified greatly.

"...It's over."

"Haa! Haa!"

Piri's condition was pitiful.

Left eye missing, both legs severed below the knees, right arm grotesquely broken.

"You two, how..."

Because she ignored this world's signals, any wound was abnormal.

"You can speak?"

99.99 percent of the language humanity uttered was just the sound of beasts barking to Piri's ears.

"Did you hear?"

Only Shirone and Nane approaching now were using logical language.

"Then it's an honor."

As a massive sword materialized behind Nane, Shirone unleashed Miracle Stream.

Hand of God grasped the Sword of Dharma and aimed at Piri from the top of the sky.

"N-no."

She couldn't accept it.

"You're livestock! You can't possibly harm me, the leader of the New Humans! This is false!"

"Dharma."

Nane spoke.

"Heart."

Shirone performed.

The red flash descending from the sky bisected the world while ignoring time.

"Kek!"

Piri's death rattle was cut off, and her severed head rolled along where the sword had struck.

"It's... false."

Shirone understood her feelings of being unable to accept defeat even at the moment of death.

"Should I say she was strong? If another being like this appears, we won't be able to handle it then."

"This is a setup, Shirone."

"A setup?"

"If it were simply to subdue you, they could just create monsters beyond imagination. But for that, everything would have to be redesigned from the universe's initial stages. The second-stage filter is to annihilate you while maintaining this world. One step further from here, and they'll eliminate all of humanity."

Perhaps because it was Nane, Shirone finally realized the identity of his unease.

"What are you thinking? Why did you come to the Northern Front? You said there was something you wanted to confirm."

"The world has opened. Therefore, I must find the answer to one question. Answer me, Shirone. Am I Nane who devoured Ankera's dream?"

Looking back at Shirone, Nane asked.

"Or am I Ankera who devoured Nane's dream?"

"What wasn't important in the confined world has now become most important. I will go to the outside world. If I'm still human there—"

A smile formed on Nane's lips.

"I might also become a god with a heart. I will eliminate the suffering of all beings."

"Nane..."

Perhaps in that outside world, what the two of them wanted was the same thing.

"But."

The smile disappeared.

"If I'm a program, then the human called Nane won't exist. In that case, I leave the rest to you. And..."

Amy.

Though Nane swallowed his words, Shirone knew.

'I opened the outside world, but Nane could have closed the opened ceiling again.'

If he killed Amy.

But what he chose was ultimately heart—and therefore, he was prepared for eternal annihilation.

"I'll go instead. It's the world I want to protect. So I think it's proper for me to go."

Nane shook his head.

"Only I, who devoured Ankera's dream, can pass through the filter. If you leave the photon system, humanity will perish. I can't just waste the last chance."

"But..."

"I opened the spiritual realm. Since it's suffering caused by me, let me end it."

"At this point, who was first..."

"Please."

As Nane turned around, his body blazed with light and countless Swords of Dharma shot outward.

Listening to the sound of swords that had flown to the edge of the universe returning, Shirone asked.

"Won't you regret it?"

Nane, with his eyes closed, smiled gently.

'I will.'

The face of one person he couldn't return to emptiness until the very end flickered in his mind.

'Attachment.'

He was leaving with his heart intact.

The moment Nane's eyes opened, the Swords of Dharma crumpled space as they rushed in and pierced his body.

"Graaaaaah!"

Light burst from Nane's pupils, turning the entire world white as paper.

'Let's see. What is there.'

When the scenery regained its original colors, Nane had evaporated without even leaving a sound.
