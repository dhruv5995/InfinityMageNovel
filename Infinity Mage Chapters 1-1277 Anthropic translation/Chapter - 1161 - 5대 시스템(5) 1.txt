The 5 Great Systems (5)

Green Ocean.

300 angels arrived at the entrance to the elves' stronghold with the help of the fairies.

Having lost their Holy Luminous Bodies, their faces were filled with fear of the unknown.

'Hmm.'

Crown, the king of the fairies, stroked his chin.

'They're useless.'

He had felt something was strange from the moment Uriel, the Archangel of Destruction, came to ask the fairies for help.

'But I didn't expect it to be this bad.'

To think angels had fallen to human status.

Getting their help was out of the question now, but in another sense, this was fortunate for the fairies.

'Becoming the king of humans. The greatest obstacle on that path has disappeared.'

Moreover, Uriel was still intact, so depending on how he used this situation, it could become a great source of power.

'If I take the angels hostage, even Uriel will have no choice. It's important to take a strong stance.'

The reason the angels couldn't reach the humans.

'A fairy's mind doesn't change easily. It's a crystallization of justice built up over countless years. But angels are different. When God's perspective changes, they have nothing left.'

Of course, he still couldn't believe such a situation had actually occurred.

Uriel silently watched the angels who had descended to earth hesitating and wavering.

Crown's lips curved upward.

'Of course he must be lamenting.'

The angels who had lost their standards were like children, requiring Uriel to personally care for them.

"The task you requested is complete. It was difficult to extract the fairies due to the wartime situation."

"...Thank you."

Even though he was the king of fairies, these were words he wouldn't have dared speak in the past.

"But I'm worried. Since the angels have fallen to human status, they'll need everything necessary for human survival."

They would need to eat and sleep.

"Can you take care of them?"

"Of course we should. But there's a small problem... We plan to launch a surprise attack on the elves' stronghold at dawn tomorrow. Since a fierce battle is expected, withdrawing our full strength is difficult for us to accept."

"I will fight."

Crown inwardly cheered.

"If I enter the battlefield, how many troops can you spare? The angels need help. Until Satiel recovers the Holy Luminous Bodies."

Though he understood the meaning of the last words, Crown viewed even that negatively.

'God's justice has been shaken. Even if he's an archangel, the situation has already slipped from his grasp.'

With such thoughts, he answered.

"That's a difficult question. Uriel's military might is incomparable to the fairies'. However, considering the wartime situation, we could probably spare about 300 troops."

One fairy to attend to each angel.

It wasn't nearly enough, but for the angels right now, even one fairy was precious.

"I accept."

"Thank you. Uriel's joining will be of great help. You there, escort the angels to the barracks."

At Crown's instruction, a high-ranking fairy led his subordinates to guide the angels.

"Please follow us."

The angels forming a line toward the fairy headquarters looked anxious.

"The light... could you turn up the light a bit more? It's too dark to see."

For those who had transcended time and space to 'look down from above,' human vision was like being blind.

"We're at war right now, so we can't brighten the lights. Please bear with it a little."

"I, I see."

Another angel spoke.

"My stomach feels strange. I feel something like pain. Call a fairy with healing abilities."

A rumbling sound emerged.

"That's called being hungry. I'll give you some fruit, so please eat this."

The angel who received the small fruit that fairies ate just stared blankly, waiting for instructions.

The fairy pointed to his mouth, looking frustrated.

"Put it in your mouth and swallow."

"Ah, right. Sorry. It's my first time trying this."

The fairies naturally sighed at the sight of angels eating fruit with awkward movements.

'This is maddening, really.'

It seemed better to fight elves than to attend to superiors who couldn't do anything.

Suddenly, a fairy's lips curved upward.

"Wait, wait! This is a place where enemies can easily spy on us. So it would be better to crawl."

"Ah, really?"

The angels wondered if this might be quite an embarrassing action and looked around cautiously.

But with the absolute divine standard gone, they lacked the courage to choose.

"Should we do that, then?"

As the angels began kneeling and crawling one by one, it was actually the fairy who was bewildered.

'They're really doing it?'

Like prisoners who had followed a warden's orders their entire lives suddenly being released into the world.

'They can't bear the fear of making their own decisions. So they'd rather follow my standards...'

Watching the angels moving away, the fairy grinned wickedly.

'Hehe! This is great! All the angels who always looked down on me are obeying my words!'

Jin, a 4th-rank fairy, flew over.

"What are you doing?"

"Jin sir!"

Jin's face was filled with anger.

"Are you insane? Even if the angels lost their Holy Luminous Bodies, Uriel is still intact. Only handle what you can manage."

"I'm sorry. I really didn't know what to do. I just... suddenly had a fun idea."

Jin sighed.

The reason fairies are called mischievous is because they commit malicious acts without malice.

"I understand your intentions, but restrain yourself. If the angels have become like this, we're next. You mustn't forget why Crown is waging this war."

"Yes. I'm sorry."

As the anger drained from Jin's expression, the fairy looked back at the angels and said.

"It's really scary. Not having standards. Will we become like that someday too?"

"Probably. That's why Crown wants to become human. Human life has no standards to begin with. They think endlessly and choose for themselves. Those who make wrong judgments are eliminated, and only those who make right judgments survive in a harsh environment."

The fairy gaped blankly.

"We must become like that too. The future of fairies depends on this battle. Tell the other children not to play cruel pranks either. There's always the possibility of 'what if.'"

"Yes, Jin sir."

As the two fairies followed the angels, Uriel finally stopped his 'looking down from above.'

Watching the fairies play pranks on the angels, this thought suddenly occurred to him.

'Is this the reality that has befallen us? No, perhaps this too is predetermined fate.'

From the age of God to the age of angels, from the age of angels through the age of fairies...

'Finally, humans.'

The world was moving toward uncertainty.

Ymir's Deep Layer 1.5.

In the virtual world created by Lufar, Shirone was simply gazing at the sea.

A year had passed since arriving here, but perhaps that day was only a few hours ago.

Behind Lufar, who was observing Shirone from the beach, stood Gaold's party.

They now knew this place was a dream, but they didn't think it was false either.

"It's like a spot-the-difference game," Lufar said.

"One picture alone is perfect, but comparing two makes it strange. The biggest problem is that you can't distinguish which picture is real."

Sein asked.

"Isn't the picture called reality the real one?"

"Yes, if you're human. But that's only when you're in reality. The reason you feel confused is because this place is perfect. None of the 5 Great Systems that make up this world are imperfect."

Lufar turned around.

"Based on real humans, logical reason goes to Drimo, while illogical emotion goes to the Other Side. These are called ideals and desires."

The two are distinctly different.

"Drimo combines the two, sending necessary information to reality and unnecessary information to the Abyss. Ultimately, reality is just one system where specific logic applies. Drimo can be called a buffering system that mediates that information."

Sein said.

"So that's why time doesn't flow."

"Right. Even Under Coders have time flow, just slower than reality. But Drimo is different. If information isn't processed, time doesn't flow."

Kang Nan asked.

"How does information from the Other Side reach Drimo?"

"Through Under Coders. The REM domain refers to a half-sleep, half-awake state. So there are two ways to access it. Are you closer to sleep or closer to awakening?"

In fact, the two are separated by a hair's breadth.

"The former is falling asleep and then awakening, while the latter is falling asleep from a wakeful state. Demons also sleep, but they don't greatly affect Drimo. Their ideals are weak. On the other hand, the latter type of Under Coder is quite active. Massive amounts of hidden code come up."

"Since the nature of information is different, the pathways are different too."

"Yes. In fact, Under Coders are just pathways that transmit information. There's no administrator. Anyone can create a new world within them. If logical Under Coders are humanity's exclusive domain, illogical Under Coders are mostly created by demons. They're specialized in hidden code."

Lufar looked back at Shirone again.

"Reality isn't everything. A battle involving all 5 Great Systems is being fought. Going out like this will only result in death at the hands of Ymir's avatar. Unless the Five Stars revive their will to live right now..."

Shirone showed no sign of wanting to move.

"In reality... you lived a truly difficult life. You lack the will to deeply delve into any thoughts. You've lost the driving force to move yourself. Living comfortably, even if only in this dream, wouldn't be entirely bad."

Living here.

While the entire party had no particular complaints, they still had lingering attachments to reality.

And those attachments would gradually amplify and eventually drive them mad.

Miro, holding Arius, said.

"That brother hasn't given up."

"Huh?"

"He said he was waiting, didn't he? If he had really given up, he wouldn't even be looking at the sea."

Sein said.

"That could be true. Then what do you think that brother is waiting for?"

"Hmm."

Miro, lost in thought, said.

"A dream."

"Haha! That's a wonderful thing to say. But this place is a dream. Dad can hardly believe it himself."

"He's waiting for a dream."

Sein's expression finally became serious.

"Why?"

"Being unable to do anything means having nothing at all. That brother has become completely empty. To fill himself again, he needs to draw from something other than himself. What could do that? Only dreams."

The party was stunned.

They were all thinking of Miro from reality, not the nine-year-old Miro.

'Dreams and reality. Regardless of which is the real picture, her insight remains intact?'

Sein patted Miro.

"Now that I hear it, it makes sense. Yes, right now he can only dream."

Lufar stroked his beard.

'A dream. A dream... Could it be?'

Within Shirone dwelt not his own dream, but someone else's dream.

Kang Nan asked.

"What dream is he waiting for? A dream of meeting a lover? A dream about the world he wanted?"

Lufar opened his mouth.

"Perhaps..."

If that's how it's passed down.

"It might be the dream of a single flower."

The magic sword Armand.

The faces of a human who had dreamed the greatest dream and the Hwajok who loved him came to mind.
