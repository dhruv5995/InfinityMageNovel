[727] Face-Off (4)

As the one second of time repeated, the luck slot began changing into new cards.

'I need to make a quick decision.'

Since thinking itself consumed time, he wouldn't be able to spin the roulette forever.

'This is harder than during Scramble Royale.'

Back then, he only had to choose between black and white, but White-Black had far more types of cards.

'I only get one chance.'

Even if CPR came up, if he got caught up in the momentum and activated Temporal Explosion, everything would be ruined.

'This is it!'

As the card's light peeled away, he could faintly see the two characters "CPR" next to the S-rank card.

'Stop! Stop! Stop!'

As he slammed the brakes on his rapidly accelerating thoughts, electrical signals shot up his spine and struck his brain.

"Puuuuuu!"

That was one second.

"Th-this can't be..."

What the White participants had witnessed in that brief moment was Shirone's card flickering like crazy.

"How on earth did he do that?"

A CPR card, steaming hot like freshly baked bread, was clutched in Shirone's hand.

Briz gulped.

'It really came out.'

He didn't know what kind of magic it was, but it was clear that Shirone could manipulate probability.

"Now, take back the remaining cards."

When Shirone held out the cards, the four participants flinched as if they were about to bolt, then looked at each other nervously.

Even Ballard, who would normally have acted immediately, couldn't move a muscle in front of Shirone.

'He's not just any mage.'

Like the true meaning of the word magic, nothing seemed impossible for him.

"Distribute them yourselves."

Shirone handed the cards to Briz.

"M-me?"

She was the only one who had shown gratitude when he represented the White zone to achieve Harmony of Laws.

"They're cards I don't need anyway. But this CPR card - can it be used here?"

Artria shook her head.

"I don't know either. I've only heard about it, never seen one. It's not like we received training like the Black zone..."

Briz interjected.

"Weapon cards have a designated activation area. Probably a circle with roughly a 2-meter diameter centered on the card."

Without activation areas, bizarre battles would break out with people fighting with cards from opposite ends of Mount Anarchy.

"Then I need to go back to Kai."

As Shirone turned around, Briz spoke up.

"Can I come with you?"

While the other three participants looked puzzled, Shirone said:

"I'm Black. As long as Kai is in Black, I have no intention of changing the law. You'll have to fight me eventually, won't you?"

"It's not because of the survival exam. I need one more CPR card. If you delay reviving Kai until the very end, I'll try to find a way. I'll somehow get a card that can replicate it..."

Marco frowned.

"Hey, what are you talking about? CPR? Besides, that guy is Black. You think he'd do something like that?"

"How would you know?"

"Ugh!"

As Marco shrank back from her fierce gaze, Shirone asked Briz again:

"Why do you need CPR?"

To a seeker who had already realized the contradiction of White-Black, distinguishing people by law was meaningless.

"That's... I can't reveal it."

Even though it was clearly a matter of life and death based on the card's effect, Briz bit her lip and shook her head.

'A secret worth risking her life to protect?'

In any case, if she couldn't reveal the reason, Shirone couldn't help her either.

"I can't accept that proposal. Sorry."

Turning away from Briz's sad, downcast expression, he firmly cast spatial movement.

'It can't be helped. Saving Kai comes first.'

Arriving at the location he remembered, Shirone immediately searched for the tree where Kai's body had been laid.

"What?"

The body had vanished without a trace.

'It was definitely here.'

If spatial movement had been cast successfully, there was no possibility of mistaking the location.

"Looking for Kai?"

At the voice from the bushes, Shirone turned around with a Photon Cannon ready.

"Come out."

"Wait! Calm down! I'm not here to fight!"

The figure who revealed himself was a short man in his mid-thirties wearing large glasses.

'Is this a weapon card's ability?'

Otherwise, there was no explanation for why he hadn't been detected by Spirit Zone until now.

"I know what you're thinking."

The man said.

"My profession is detective. My special ability is surveillance. When I'm not moving, no one can sense me."

"...Where is Kai?"

"I want to make a deal."

The man pulled out a weapon card.

Echo Player (Function)

Description: The better the performance, the longer the afterglow lasts.

Effect: Can replay sounds that occurred within a specific area in the past 2 hours.

"Perfect card for a detective. I found Kai's body and used Echo Player. I heard the sounds and learned what happened here. I also know you made contact with White zone participants. Coming here means you got CPR, right?"

"What do you want?"

"Currently, we're on the same side. We're both Black. But you're a seeker - who knows when you might switch to their side."

That Shirone's side would win was now accepted as fact in White-Black.

"So I want to propose this: bring me all the White participants' cards. Then I'll hand over Kai."

He wanted to tell him to kill them all, but pushing too hard would backfire.

"You already know cards have activation areas. If I don't reveal where I've hidden Kai... ugh!"

Shirone's gaze turned ice-cold.

"Why should I accept that proposal? I could just ask you right here and now."

No weapon card could subdue Shirone.

"Y-you need to think carefully. Kai is..."

The moment Shirone's eyes widened, the man pulled out a weapon card.

"You fool! You'll regret this!"

Old Position (Consumable)

Description: Everyone has moments in life when they think: Oh, why did I do that back then?

Effect: Returns you to your position from 1 hour ago.

"Activate! Old Position!"

The man's voice echoed through the mountains.

"..."

The man's eyes shook with shock as he stared at his hand where the card had disappeared.

'H-how?'

He had only seen a flash of light pass by.

"Not just anyone can do it."

Turning around with a dazed expression, he saw Shirone waving the Old Position card he had snatched away.

Snatching a card while moving with teleportation was a technique only high-level mages could perform.

"You have to concentrate until your head feels like it'll split. So I'm in a really bad mood right now."

At Shirone's most frightening threat, the man backed away with an awkward smile.

"Ahaha, well..."

"Where is Kai?"

"Damn it!"

A being standing outside the laws of White-Black.

That was the man's realization of what a mage truly was.

Labyrinth Andre.

In the landscape of the reverse world where heart-like structures were connected like fruit...

"Huuuuu."

Shirone sat in lotus position.

'Is it still far off?'

Shirone's mind, which had to maintain the Wheel of Emptiness, never lost concentration for even a moment.

'About 6 days have passed, I think.'

The moment the entrance to Andre guarded by Kido was breached, Shirone had activated Bardo and hidden in the reverse world.

'Is the battle over?'

His current location was 10 meters underground from Andre, based on the real world.

The sounds from outside were indirect, as if he were submerged deep underwater, but now even those couldn't be heard.

'I feel like I'm suffocating.'

The Shirone here couldn't know the emotions felt by the 19,000 Shirones in their respective worlds.

However, certain intuitions beyond the realm of logic continued flooding in through the circuit of insight.

'I'll go crazy if I stay like this.'

Each time complex emotions that couldn't be clearly defined in language accumulated, his frustration grew worse.

'This is a first.'

Even when developing Divine Punishment, Shirone hadn't felt this stifled, and he had eventually broken through.

"So this is Andre? Surprisingly underwhelming."

At the voice from above ground, Shirone's head shot up.

'Who is it? Kido?'

Rising from his position and climbing the slope of the reverse world to the surface, unfamiliar figures came into view.

'Asians?'

Based on their appearance and attire, they were from the East, with dozens of soldiers following behind a woman.

'Amazing. That gait...'

What struck the mage's eye was the perfect distance maintained without even an inch of error, centered on the woman in front.

"Your Highness, I sense no human presence. Perhaps Shirone has already finished exploring the labyrinth?"

'They know about me.'

At the words of the man who clearly looked like a master, Shirone climbed up a hill in the reverse world.

Finally, as his view aligned with the real world's surface, he could observe their faces in detail.

"Foolish, Mungyeong."

It was Seongeun's party, who had extremely compressed space to jump directly from Jessica to Andre.

Seongeun's large eyes moving slowly were clearly visible even to Shirone, 20 meters away.

"Just because something isn't caught by the senses doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Don't assassins also exploit blind spots in intuition?"

Mungyeong knew that assassins used the ability Equalizing to hide their presence by blending with objects.

But that was still within human realm - hardly worth mentioning to a warrior protecting the princess of the Jincheon Empire.

"Your Highness, this Mungyeong is not so dull."

How many assassins in the world could fool the senses of one granted three bows by Jin Seongeun, the strongest sorcerer?

Seongeun glanced sideways and said:

"Then tell me this. Can you tell what color my heart is right now? If you guess correctly, I'll give you a reward."

It was truly a reward he wanted to receive, but Mungyeong could only tilt his head in confusion.

"I don't understand what you mean."

"Really? I'll show you directly."

Turning forward, Seongeun slowly raised her hand.

"Reveal yourself, one who dwells in the heart."

As Seongeun's arm moved from left to right, reality's space fell away in large tetrahedrons.

"Th-that's...!"

Not only the Three Bows, but even Jix watching from behind showed expressions of shock.

Like viewing a cross-section of fruit, where reality's space had fallen away, an entirely new landscape was spread out.

"Who are you! Reveal your identity!"

The Three Bows members who spotted Shirone simultaneously drew their swords and took fighting stances.

But their eyes still couldn't comprehend.

'Impossible. How can there be a person there...'

If the blonde boy had been an assassin, anyone other than the Three Bows would have been helplessly defeated.

"Choeui Bardo, one who crosses the boundary between life and death."

Jin Seongeun immediately grasped the esoteric truth contained in Shirone's technique.

"Are you Ariane Shirone?"

Seongeun's voice, more excited than usual, was most shocking to Mungyeong.

'Her Highness is... nervous?'

Shirone's lips also trembled finely as he smiled.

'I see. This is the level of an Ivory Tower candidate.'

Though he hadn't received any explanation, just seeing reality and the reverse space separated was enough to be certain.

"Jin Seongeun."

It was the first meeting between Ivory Tower candidates.
