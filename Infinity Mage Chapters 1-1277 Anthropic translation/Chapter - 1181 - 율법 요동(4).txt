Law Fluctuation (4)

Kitra's coffin, which had been moved to the secret chamber where the Zodiac resided, creaked open.

"Your Majesty."

Kitra raised her upper body.

"..."

The reason her heart wasn't beating was because she was already an OPArt possessing the law of death.

"The time has come."

Endless waves of time surged forth, changing the laws of the pyramids erected across the world.

The Great Adjustment.

The reason it took longer than expected to change the concepts carved inside the pyramids was because of them.

'Satiel and Rayel.'

Two archangels were maintaining the existing laws from the core of the sun.

'All concepts derive from the eight archangels. Therefore, their power is two-eighths of the total. That is, one-fourth.'

While not a negligible amount, it was insufficient to stop the cosmic changes of the Great Adjustment.

"The time has come."

As light ignited in Kitra's eyes, the Great Adjustment device rotated and cracks appeared in its outer shell.

Light burst through the cracks, and a pitch-black sphere was born, devouring the outer shell.

"Ugh, uaaaah!"

All objects in the secret chamber were sucked in, and the members of the Zodiac were no exception.

Rumble, rumble.

Hearing gravitational waves that humans couldn't perceive, Kitra gazed at the black sphere.

'Nothingness exists within that.' Paradoxically, it contained all possibilities of the world.

"Come forth, God."

Kitra rose from the altar and spread both arms.

"Final Adjustment."

The inscriptions carved inside the pyramids erected across the world emitted blue light.

As the stream of light rushing like waves gradually accelerated, a strange phenomenon occurred.

Massive electromagnetic fields with diameters exceeding 80 kilometers formed around the pyramids.

"Huh? What's that?"

A husband drinking tea in an ordinary home felt a faint electric current.

"Suddenly getting goosebumps..."

At that moment, he realized that the scenery inside his house was overlapping with other scenery.

A mansion, a shabby one-room apartment, an operating bar, even a coffin buried in a grave.

'What kind of trick is this?'

His bewildered expression was brief, as he intuitively grasped the correlation between himself and the scenery.

'According to my heart...'

Everything in the world was changing.

"Honey, what are you doing?"

The woman walking from the mansion scenery was indistinguishable from reality.

No, to be precise, the reality he had lived seemed more like an illusion.

"You, you are..."

The husband remembered the woman.

A classmate from the same school when he was twelve, his first crush in life.

"Why do you look like that? Were you thinking dirty thoughts? Hehe!"

Her appearance, clutching her stomach in laughter, was exactly as it had been in childhood, but he couldn't understand why.

'What's happening?'

At that moment, transcending space and time, the laws twisted and the logic of cause and effect was reconstructed.

'Ah, that's right.'

When they met at a reunion ten years later, he had confessed and that's how they got married.

'Right, right. That's what I did.'

All memories seeped into his mind as if he had truly regressed to the past and lived through it.

'What's really real?'

But his real wife also remained as an afterimage.

'Like probability.'

Though he was ignorant of mathematics, it was the precise word to define what he was feeling.

'The real wife at 60 percent, the current wife at 40 percent reality...'

They were overlapping.

"Honey, let's go shopping. Remember those clothes you said you wanted to buy? I'll buy them for you."

As his real wife became even fainter, the man instinctively shook his head.

'No. I like the current wife better.' No, more than that.

With a sudden thought, the scenery began overlapping again.

'The woman I truly loved was a colleague I met at twenty-six.' He pictured the beautiful woman in his mind.

'Why? Why isn't she there?'

Though countless scenes were overlapping, events with her weren't being perceived.

'Did she hate me that much?'

Even if he wanted it, if the other person didn't want it, there would be no future.

'I really liked her.'

She had married a colleague who was far more capable and well-off than himself.

'If only I had power and money.' Simultaneously, he could feel himself as a successful businessman who had overcome fierce competition since childhood.

'I can meet her.'

Through his five senses, in the probabilistically unfolding events, she coldly bowed her head.

"President, it's meeting time."

The man was disappointed.

'Just a secretary? Even after trying so hard.'

If he couldn't win her love no matter what he tried, there was only one method left.

'It'll be fine. Yeah, I can change it again anyway, right?'

The man used his authority as president to kiss her, and shortly after felt a dull impact.

The woman, feeling humiliated, had struck the man with a metal trophy from the table.

"Kyaah!"

The man collapsed, bleeding, and looked at the scenery in his fading consciousness.

The events disappeared, leaving only darkness.

'I'm dying.'

What he had overlooked was the misconception that this phenomenon was happening only to him.

"Save, save me, honey." As he called to his wife, who now remained at only 1 percent, she smiled and turned around.

Another man, not himself, approached and embraced her, kissing her affectionately.

"Sob. Sob."

As his probability of death exceeded 99 percent, memories of his children disappeared from his mind.

'No. Why suddenly...?'

He tried desperately to recall his original family, but they had already left to pursue their own desires.

'Let me live. I can't die.'

Then the darkness lifted and several choices penetrated his consciousness again.

Of course, he could never again see the beautiful scenery he had experienced so far.

"Someone save me!"

As he shouted, he bolted upright in a shabby house in the slums.

"Gasp! Gasp!"

Since everyone had chosen to live according to their own desires, he had nowhere to return to.

'At least I'm alive.'

Looking around, the scenery was still covered in a colorful haze.

'Hehe. Hehehe.' Then I can't lose either.

With just a few overlaps, his humanity had completely changed from the beginning.

"It's okay. I can change it again. If I put my mind to it, even this damn reality can become heaven."

The laws were fluctuating.

Realizing he couldn't read Wizard's heart, Habitz opened his mouth.

"Draw."

There was no choice but to play the game.

"Good start. Is it your turn to propose this time? Let me hear it."

Wizard was faithful to her purpose.

'She took the bait.'

The key to the game Zetaro had proposed depended on how much Habitz enjoyed it.

'If the kiss is effective...'

This situation where the truth could never be known would drive Satan to death.

"I will..."

Wizard said.

"Love you for today."

"And I will hate you for today. The standard for a day is until midnight. This is my proposition."

One of the two had to be true.

"Didn't the game rules say that actions or evidence that can prove the truth must be involved?"

"That's right. If it's true that I love you, I'll kiss you again."

"If you hate me?"

"I'll break one of my fingers."

While a finger wasn't directly life-threatening, Habitz realized.

'I could die.' Under the premise of a game, Wizard could perceive Habitz's Vanishing.

Conversely, Habitz couldn't capture Wizard's Super Gap - the missing 1 frame.

'I need at least 2 frames. But that means I can't even get close.'

It wouldn't be easy against an awakened Wizard.

'Eventually one of them will be proven. Either a kiss or breaking my finger.'

The warm sensation of Wizard's lips that had touched his still remained.

"Approved."

Wizard's eyes grew coldly calm.

'As expected, you...'

Don't know how cruel this game is.

"Then it's my turn. I will kill Sirone. I will also kill Uorin. Until the midnight you proposed."

Since he had to conduct an assassination game in parallel, he set a long time frame, but it was an extreme move.

Wizard thought.

'My heart was read only once in yesterday's battle. I never thought information leakage would come back like this.'

If Habitz targeted Sirone, Wizard would have no choice but to hate Habitz.

'A proposition to establish standards for common sense judgment. He's desperate to know my truth.'

Habitz, Satan.

'So pure it's almost laughable.'

Though the variable called Sirone had emerged, everything up to this point was exactly as Balkan had predicted.

"Fine, I approve."

"Then it's decided. Until midnight, we must each prove our truth. If you lose..."

Habitz grinned wickedly.

"You can look forward to what I'll do."

"Habitz."

Wizard approached with large strides and said.

"I love you."

As Habitz made a puzzled expression, she twisted her waist back forcefully.

'Now it begins.'

Gritting her teeth and using all her strength to strike his ribs, Habitz's eyes widened.

"Gaaaah!"

With magical power added, even Satan's body felt terrible shock.

'Neither kiss nor finger...'

It was merely bait to drive Satan to this point.

"Habitz."

As the kneeling Habitz slowly raised his head, Wizard smiled and said.

"I love you."

Killing intent flashed in her eyes as her small fist struck Habitz's jaw hard.

"Gaak!"

Sliding across the floor with his head turned, he glanced at Wizard over his shoulder.

Wizard approached.

'Right, you can never read me.'

Except for kisses and fingers, he was free to do anything during the game, but...

'You're already consumed by the system.'

Balkan had said this.

"The existence outside the law, Hell is annoying too, but Satan's greatest weapon is Vanishing. If we just bind that, he can never be absolutely invincible. Of course, this is only effective with you, Wizard."

"What if it doesn't work?"

"It will work."

Balkan's lips curved upward.

"Satan. That pure chaos. Humanity didn't know how to handle the concept that appeared in reality. But now it's different. There were countless sacrifices to understand Habitz."

Though they failed.

"Abella, whom Habitz loved. Justyn, who hated Habitz. The assassination attempts during the world war. All that information defines Habitz." The sacrifices weren't meaningless.

"Humans are the species that fails more than any other creature. But as those failures accumulate, they finally solve the problem. That time is now. So..."

Balkan said.

"How about trying this?"

Habitz coughed up blood.

"Cough!"

Even as Wizard approached, his Vanishing couldn't take effect.

It was a game, after all.

"Why?"

Habitz, who had gotten up against the wall, looked back at Wizard with an expression of incomprehension.

"Well, that's..."

Wizard smiled warmly.

"You'll have to find out yourself. That's the kind of game this is." Habitz, breathing roughly through his nose, limped away down the opposite corridor.

"Why are you running away? You like me, don't you?"

"Hell."

Twelve shadows appeared on the floor, and Habitz instantly vanished.

'Was I too strong?'

No, he would definitely come looking for her again.

"Where did you go?"

In a situation where any killing intent became a joke, Wizard hypnotized herself.

"Play with me, Habitz."
