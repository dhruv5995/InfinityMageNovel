Final Chapter (1)

The space of infinite nothingness.

'Everything is an illusion.'

But because the heart was drawn to it, it was a phenomenon that couldn't simply be called an illusion.

'This is where I begin.'

The first illusion Shirone chose was the moment when Cheolguk was planted in this world.

He didn't really need to confirm it, but he wanted to be absolutely certain on this long journey.

The Great Earth Sanctuary of the Ivory Tower.

When he opened his eyes, what he saw beneath his feet was his own planet, beautifully blue.

'And...'

Beron, who had just planted Cheolguk, was receiving Nane's sermon from the ground.

Nane's sword grew endlessly massive, and grazed the planet, leaving a straight scar across the earth.

Taesung asked.

"What do you think? Now that you've faced him directly, you should know. If it were Shirone, could he stop the current sermon?"

Her words were proof.

'I've returned.'

Taesung frowned.

"...Shirone?"

More than the lack of response, the problem was Shirone's eyes that seemed to know everything.

"Taesung-nim."

"Ah, I..."

As if experiencing a system crash, she showed unprecedented confusion.

'If I tell the truth, history will change.'

Of course, the trinity of the 12 Apostles, Uorin, and Richard would maintain the existing history.

"I'll be going."

It was a meaningless task anyway.

His body dissolved into the light of Miracle Stream and instantly arrived at the altar on the ground.

Beron, facing death, said to Shura.

"Go to Hexa. Don't let the meaning I left in this world become meaningless."

"I refuse! You know how much I hate that brat! What about the Council of Ten?"

In this slightly twisted history, Shirone could hear their conversation for the first time.

'Did he know?'

Eventually Shura came to him, and the Cheolguk he left behind became humanity's only hope.

Shirone looked up at the sky.

'Nane.'

The moment he saw his face, indifferently contemplating the world, fire boiled up inside him again.

'If I defeat the Buddha...'

The unhappy future won't come.

Shirone, drawing his mental abilities to their fullest, headed toward Nane at high speed.

'Hand of God.'

Even then they had clashed over the truth of the universe, but looking back, how immature it had been.

'It's not like that. Truth is...'

Not something that could be defined by mere logic, but the hearts of all humanity and the suffering that came with it.

"Nane!"

When the Photon Cannon was born on the giant palm of light, Nane's eyes widened greatly.

"That is..."

What kind of enlightenment is that?

But his surprise was brief, as Nane's body trembled and his eyes became vacant.

"Shirone."

A slightly angry tone.

Toward the Photon Cannon piercing through the atmosphere at tremendous speed, Nane extended his palm.

Great Sun Tathagata.

The Buddha's realm, comparable to Yahweh, made Nane's body shine bright as the sun.

Pang!

The Photon Cannon was futilely destroyed, and Nane asked with a sad expression.

"Yahweh, is it truly something you cannot give up?"

'Tachyon.'

Nane had also arrived at this point by transcending space-time through imaginary signals.

'As expected, it won't be easy.'

Shirone said.

"You're the one who should give up. Try to understand humanity's desperation that makes me go this far."

"That heart too is merely an illusion once you awaken."

Nane's two arms moved.

"If you cannot cast off your worldly desires, you'll have no choice but to endlessly repeat the cycle of samsara."

Kukukukuku!

The avatar of Great Sun Tathagata rising over the horizon began to join palms as if embracing the world.

Painful memories surfaced.

'No.'

"Namu."

Even the incantation Nane chanted made his mind reel like trauma.

"Gwanse..."

Shirone turned around.

"Amy!"

The two palms of Great Sun Tathagata gently covered the world and completely met.

"Om."

One life was extinguished.

Though he didn't see it directly with his eyes, it was vivid in his mind as if he had seen it.

"Ah...?"

Shirone, frozen as he turned his neck, saw Nane's face shedding tears of blood.

"Do not turn away from the truth, Yahweh."

"Ahhh...?"

The next moment, Shirone, filled with tremendous killing intent, shot toward Nane like an arrow.

"Naneeeee!"

And.

"Sermon."

The world blazed brightly, and Shirone's consciousness was cut off.

"Huk!"

In the realm of infinite nothingness where nothing existed, Shirone opened his eyes of consciousness.

'Illusion.'

His heart felt like it was being torn apart.

'I'm sorry, Amy.'

Thus the first journey ended without even being able to meet the person he loved.

'But now I know.'

The moment Shirone tried to change Nane's life, Nane would also track him down.

'There must be a way. If only Amy stays alive, I can fight at Yahweh's level. If I just defeat Nane...'

Things would work out more easily than expected.

"I'm going."

As he created his second illusion, the universe began to be born again in the realm of infinite nothingness.

As long as Cheolguk existed, there was no worry of losing his way.

Uorin's brow furrowed.

"Ugh!"

As Shirone's tachyon acted on Cheolguk, she was directly exposed to time waves.

"The first round is already over?"

Kido's expression wasn't good either.

Being hit by waves faster than normal time felt like life itself being consumed.

"How fast?"

Uorin shook her head.

"I don't know. It's in the form of vibrations so there's no fixed value, but roughly 8 hours passed per second."

It was tremendous speed.

Kururururu!

At the vibrations pressing in from outside, they looked up to see Fuama checking toward the entrance.

In the distance, crowds of demons could be seen.

"It's beginning."

Those who had won the war between good and evil were coming to claim their final spoils.

"We will begin the vote count."

With humanity's destruction entering its final countdown, the World Leadership vote ended quickly.

The counting would take about 10 minutes, but in fact they already knew the result.

While people playing card games with Rampa dealt their hands, Armin was lost in thought.

'Siina.'

She wasn't included in the survivor list, but even before that, her identity hadn't been confirmed.

'Please be alive.'

As Armin clasped his hands together, Kaira approached him.

"Drink."

Armin smiled as he received the tea.

"Thank you."

"You don't need to pretend to be calm. Anyway, your love for your sister is admirable."

Armin said again.

"Thank you."

Kaira, who burst into a chuckle, sat next to Armin and asked while looking at the ceiling.

"What will you do when the war ends?"

It was inappropriate for the situation, but perhaps such thoughts were okay.

"I'll paint."

"Haha! You mean that thing from your spy days? Well, you were pretty good at it. But will that be okay? You'd be better off as a mage to feed me."

"There's something I want to capture on canvas."

"What?"

"I don't know."

"What?"

"I can't decide yet. I'll wait. A scene, a moment, a situation that I want to show all of humanity. I'm waiting to paint that."

"I see."

A smile formed on Kaira's lips.

"That's so like you."

The door opened.

"The vote count is finished."

Sirano, who had taken the World Leadership podium, announced.

"With this, all kingdoms will make their final stand centered on Tormia. We register Pony, King of Tormia, as the leader of the World Leadership."

The plaza filled with applause.

Even if she was called the king of the entire world, it would be the harshest position, so there were no objections.

Even the Lami Church's Vatican, which had competed with Yahweh, had no choice before the truth of Melchizedek.

"Then let us hear your declaration."

Sirano stepped aside and Pony took the podium.

"I am..."

She stopped speaking for a long while and looked at the people.

'I'm the world's leader.'

Even if it was a position with only responsibility remaining, or rather because of that, she was satisfied.

'I've achieved my dream.'

So, let me say what I want to say.

"As the King of Tormia, I have always tried to be humble toward other nations."

The hall was quiet.

"Not because Tormia was weak, nor because other nations were strong. Behind me were the citizens I love and respect so much, their lives, their very existence."

If that was responsibility.

"And now, in a position responsible for all of humanity, I will be the most humble again. The authority in my hands was given not by God, but by all of you."

Pony opened her palm.

"If someone's death could end this war, I would gladly sacrifice this one life!"

The moment she clenched her fist and shouted, thunderous cheers erupted.

"Let's fight! Let's fight!"

Morale was sky-high, and each person's eyes held the solemn resolve to never lose.

'We're approaching.'

Ultima.

And at this moment, only one person kept his mouth shut with a bitter expression.

It was Zetaro, the last survivor of Gustav's 4th Company.

Kuan said.

"It's not a problem of immortality."

More precisely, it was Crown who had boarded his body.

"At the end point of reincarnation, death doesn't hold special meaning. But why do we continue to live?"

Siina was listening.

"This is a problem of existence. How far can we exist? If we stay too long, and if there's nothing new there anymore, we too will collapse."

It was the providence of the universe.

"Missing Link. Forgetting is necessary. The Illuminati are fighting against nothingness. If there was nothing to begin with, then it just becomes nothing."

It wasn't Siina's concern.

"What happened to Kuan? You promised. You said you'd fix the broken parts."

Crown said while limping.

"This body is really uncomfortable. How did he fight with this? Don't tell me I was scammed?"

"Don't change the subject!"

Crown laughed.

"I repaired the severed nerves with my own. But the mind isn't something I can touch, is it?"

"Lies! You're the fraud! If you're preventing Kuan from coming out..."

"Well, there's no way to prove it. But it's true. Honestly, I'd like to hear a manual too. How do you operate this thing? I can't fight like this."

"Just who are you fighting..."

As Siina was about to argue, a roar erupted from the sky.

"Hmm."

Twelve dragons attacked the Terraforce ships intercepting from the ground.

"It's begun."

Merit and demerit weren't important to the Illuminati.

They simply wanted to find something in this world's error that occurred with miraculous probability.

'A world that refuses to forget.'

Perhaps the outside world had reached the current stage too easily?

'A way to surpass infinity.'

The moment Siina stopped with a start, Terraforce combat units revealed themselves from all directions.

"Humanity, judgment is over. We will judge you according to God's will."

"Do something about it. Since you created God, you can persuade them too."

Crown shrugged.

"That doesn't make me God. You see, God is something that calculates multiple universes..."

The combat units charged.

"Eliminate!"

"Kuk!"

Siina cast ice magic, but the abnormality of alien technology surpassed magic.

"Terraforce is strong."

"You!"

As Crown spoke as if it were someone else's business, the moment Siina glared at him fiercely.

"Do not resist! There will be no pain!"

A combat unit crushed her and pointed a plasma sword at her neck.

"Kuan!"

Hearing Siina's voice, Crown felt his consciousness completely flip.

"...Huh?"

Something tremendous was rushing in.

"Huh?"

Protect Siina.

One signal was received in his mind, and the world's scenery shattered like fragments.

"Wow."

Before a fact that only the Illuminati could guess at, Crown felt a thrill.

'This guy's thinking breaks the universe's symmetry.'

The pole of asymmetry.

The next moment, following the drastically tilted axis of the world, all the combat units tumbled down.
