[664] The Five Senses Are Insufficient (3)

"That won't do."

Before Rian could respond, Sirone cut him off decisively.

"We are clearly the examiners and we select the personnel. It's Wig who needs to demonstrate his skills, not Rian. If you don't like these rules, you're free to give up on the evaluation."

Since every word was perfectly reasonable, Wig was left speechless.

However, having already drawn his sword, his pride wouldn't allow him to end things like this, and he was certain that Rian would react differently than Sirone.

"The mage's judgment may be so, but I wonder if Maha's knight thinks the same way?"

Knights may not have muscles for brains, but they're ultimately people who can abandon any efficiency before their beliefs.

Having made a name for himself as a rising swordsman on equal footing, he couldn't possibly flee when challenged.

"Of course I don't think that way."

A smile appeared on Wig's lips at Rian's words.

"But if my lord refuses, then I won't do it."

Wig also knew the weight of a knight's oath.

"How about thinking differently? If you back down here, you'll be tarnishing your lord's honor."

This time it was Rian who smiled.

"You... haven't taken the knight's oath yet, have you?"

"That's correct, butâ€”"

"The sword doesn't judge. If Sirone tells me to cut you, I'll cut. If he tells me to be cut, I'll gladly be cut. No matter what words you use to shake my emotions, the will behind my actions isn't mine."

Wig's sword slowly lowered.

"Wig, I understand your feelings, but you need to assess the situation properly. This is my mercenary group after all, and I decide who passes or fails. If you really want to compete with Rian..."

"If I want to compete?"

"Prove why you're a swordsman I absolutely need. If you make me think I want to take you along no matter what the situation, then I might allow a real sword match with Rian."

"...I understand."

Wig, yielding to logic, bowed his head deeply.

And when he raised his head again, his usual free-spirited smile had vanished, replaced by a cold chill in his expression.

"Then let me show you my swordsmanship. I am Wig of the Gale."

If the purpose was to capture the examiners' attention, his initial provocation had been successful, and all three watched Wig with cold eyes as if to see just how impressive he was.

The dual sword technique began.

After demonstrating the basics, Wig soon began cutting in all directions with dazzling movements as if bored.

Even while running, leaping, and spinning upon landing, his sword's trajectory never broke once, and instead grew even faster.

'His mobility is certainly tremendous.'

Wig could operate four schemas, a number that ranked among the upper tier even among swordsmen.

People who haven't opened a schema can't know how their body moves or what posture they're taking even while making a simple vertical cut.

That's why Rian repeatedly performed the same actions countless times in front of a mirror to catch errors.

In contrast, if one could simultaneously detect physical changes in four different areas, they could not only perfect their posture but even rank from 1 to 10 which of their ten toes was bearing more weight.

'Is this enough?'

Up to this point was the realm of talent.

Wig began operating his schema in earnest.

'Mitochondria Build.'

The Mitochondria Build, which promoted overall physical activation, had strengths in balance.

It was broadly divided into regeneration and acceleration, and judging by how Wig's movements had quickened, he seemed to have chosen acceleration.

'Folding here.'

'Folding' was the act of folding a schema in half to concentrate control further, and reaching the 7 folds known as the human limit would record an astounding efficiency of 128 times.

From that point on, it was the realm of martial gods that could no longer be called human, but there had been no precedent since the great swordsman Cadel first reached it 300 years ago.

Wig's limit was 3 folds, and when he folded his mitochondria schema, strong winds swept with each movement.

"Wow."

Even Sirone couldn't help but be amazed this time.

With fundamentals incomparable to bandit groups, and efficiency soaring 8-fold, afterimages were visible even with the help of Armand's neural enhancement.

'I'll finish with this.'

As centrifugal force intensified, Wig's body began rotating like a whirlwind.

With physical activation as the base and muscular, nervous, and sensory systems controlled simultaneously, a terrifying gale swept through.

When he finished his closing stance before the examiners after instantly sweeping the clearing, an eerie sonic boom pierced through six ears like an awl.

"That concludes my demonstration."

Wig, having sheathed his swords, slowly stood and stepped back to his original position.

'Rian...'

Sirone waited carefully for judgment.

Unlike the other applicants, even he as a layman could see it was impressive skill, but that's precisely why Rian's opinion was crucial in this situation.

"Splendid technique. The reputation of Wig of the Gale isn't empty fame."

"Thank you."

Wig said as he strapped his twin swords behind his back.

"I'd like to hear Sirone's opinion as well. Do I pass?"

"...Yes."

Having emphasized fairness until now, he couldn't lie.

"Then now I'll make a proposal. If you want me incorporated into the mercenary unit, there's something that must be addressed. While Sirone may be the captain, I can't risk my life under a vice-captain weaker than myself, can I?"

Sirone scratched his cheek.

Though he hadn't seen all the applicants' specialties yet, there seemed to be no one with skills matching Wig's except Kuan.

"Sirone, no need to worry."

Rian spoke.

"If he's someone you need, then use him. That's all I care about."

As if already expecting the answer, Rian stood up from his seat.

"And no swordsman follows a weak commander."

Sensing Rian's will, Sirone nodded and said:

"Fine. I permit the real sword match. It may be presumptuous of me to say, but please don't let it interfere with the mission. I trust you'll control yourselves well as professionals."

Wig readily agreed, but inwardly he was thinking something else.

'Because we're professionals, we can't compromise.'

Having applied to Sirone's mercenary group to raise his reputation, he had no intention whatsoever of holding back.

"We don't have much time."

Rian slowly drew his great sword and entered the clearing.

"I'll give you about 5 minutes."

'Completely dismissive. Acting high and mighty while living off your friend's reputation.'

Both Wig of the Gale and Maha's Knight had made their names as rising stars around the same time.

Yet the reason Rian could evaluate him was surely because he was the knight of Sirone, a candidate for the Ivory Tower.

'But do you know? From now on, even your precious lord can't protect you.'

With a sound like flowing water, the twin swords emerged, and Rian aimed his great sword with one hand.

"Come at me."

He could tell the brute strength was considerable, but couldn't find any particularly outstanding advantages.

'There are quite a few openings?'

Having climbed this far through natural talent, Wig's aggressiveness outweighed his caution, and he immediately activated his schema and charged.

"Taha!"

It was precision on a different level from his sword demonstration, and even Rian twisted his body with a surprised expression.

'What?'

He had prepared for a counterattack, but even his initial reaction was somewhat clumsy.

'Don't tell me... is he really all bluster?'

He immediately began testing, and the gale swordsmanship mercilessly assaulted Rian.

Though he managed to block or evade somehow, his technical clumsiness was grasped in an instant.

'Ridiculous.'

That very clumsiness actually surprised Wig.

'It seems like he can't use schema?'

Schema was important in that it allowed precise control of the body.

Even swinging a sword once required numerous sensations simultaneously - center of gravity, posture adjustment, strength distribution - but observing Rian's movements, it seemed he was just following instinct.

'This is supposed to be Maha's Knight? Can you even see me?'

Though efficiency inevitably dropped to half from the next chapter of schema onward, to him operating four schemas, Rian's swordsmanship was like that of a beginner.

'His trajectory changes with every swing. He doesn't even know how he's cutting.'

Sloppy matches always leave a bitter aftertaste.

Feeling irritation rise slightly, Wig closed in on Rian to end it.

"Five minutes."

At Rian's words, he couldn't help but snort.

'What nonsense.'

It was enough time to expose that Maha's Knight was a fraud.

"Tahaaa!"

Just as Wig charged with his twin swords held horizontally, Rian's body rotated at a speed on a completely different dimension from his previous reactions.

Perfect.

That was the word that flashed through Wig's mind like lightning, and in the time too brief to formulate in language, an ominous feeling suddenly arose.

'Only this technique right now is perfect.'

Mastery.

Something engraved into the body through countless repetitions.

Just as most adults have mastered the 'act of walking,' this movement too was possible because it had been practiced a number of times comparable to walking.

'Block it first...!'

That's what he thought he should do.

And that was Wig's only misjudgment, and there would be no more opportunities.

The moment the great sword's broad surface struck the twin swords, consciousness flew away.

What he realized at the edge of unconsciousness was the speed of the sword strike that couldn't be explained by schema, and the fact that he would die if he flew like this.

'This is Maha...'

Even as his arrow-like body crashed into the building's wall, no screaming was heard, and Wig fell beneath the spider-web cracks in the wall.

"Wig!"

Sirone rushed out to check Wig's condition, and fortunately his breathing was fine.

Rian sheathed his great sword and said:

"I pulled back before he lost consciousness. If the impact had been delayed even slightly, he would have died."

His skull would have been shattered.

"Sorry. I couldn't hold back properly."

"No, we're fortunate it was only this much. Honestly, I wanted to establish the hierarchy properly before departing too."

Though he had clearly won without injury and knocked him out in one blow, Rian didn't feel good as he returned to his seat.

'I merely won.'

He tried to steel his heart that winning was everything, but after competing with someone like Wig who relied on technique, it left a bitter taste.

"Sirone, let's continue."

After Wig was carried away by guild members, the evaluation continued.

From Silvering, Con received a passing judgment, and one each from War Chariot and Blood Rose also passed additionally.

With the addition of an archer, survival and trap specialist, spearman, and healing mage, the mercenary unit began to take proper shape.

Number 199, Kuan, dropped Aria below her chair with just his presence as if drawing his sword wasn't necessary, and finally Merey, the last applicant of the final second evaluation, entered.

Since he'd been curious about many things, Sirone set aside the evaluation momentarily and asked:

"You said you can hear Ra's voice?"

"Yes."

"Can you hear it now?"

Merey covered both ears with her hands and raised her head toward the sky without answering.

"...Yes, I can hear it."

Though he couldn't understand why Ra's voice drifted as electrical signals, he was curious about what was being said for now.

"Ra's voice isn't always clear. It's mixed in with countless noises."

"What kind of noises?"

"Screams."

Merey narrowed her brow as she analyzed the sounds.

"Cries of pain, roars of rage, things like that. Always he..."

She twitched her eyebrows and stopped speaking.

"What's wrong?"

"Wait a moment. He's speaking."

Slowly raising her eyelids, Merey conveyed what she heard.

"Carte mu sielr, cartision ve raveca purvel."

Aria tilted her head.

"I don't know. It's the first time I've heard such words."

"It's ancient language. Very old. The meaning is..."

If you wish to find me, seek the hell within you.
