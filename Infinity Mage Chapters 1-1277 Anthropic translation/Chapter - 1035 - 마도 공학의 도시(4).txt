The City of Magical Engineering (4)

The Demon Race is a species born from low-quality magic and corresponds to the beast army in hell.

However, they have fierce temperaments and some intelligence, so they sometimes attack cities.

'In reality, they're about the level of monkeys.' Sirone had no idea in his dreams that the actual intruder was a monkey.

'Let me not worry about it. They'll catch it soon enough.'

According to Satan's maxim that there are no enemies in hell, Labyrinth's gates had lax security.

However, the city's own military force was truly formidable, and especially the administrators were comparable to hell's army.

'So this is the street of magical engineering.'

Arriving at a street lined with countless shops, Sirone entered a two-story building.

"Hello."

A purple-skinned woman organizing items on the shelves turned her head.

"Welcome. This is an organ specialty shop... huh?"

After examining the customer's appearance, she flapped her bat wings and flew to the counter.

"How old are you?" Sirone made up an age based on facts he knew through Ultima.

"102 years old."

"Wow, you're really young! But coming to a place like this. You're an Intelligent Species, right? Where were you born?"

"At the Furnace of Ambition. You're also an Intelligent Species, right, miss?"

Demons inherit certain characteristics from Satan, and the Intelligent Species was the most intellectual type among them.

Archduke Magrit was also an Intelligent Species, and their appearance changed with age.

"Hoho! I once even applied for the administrator exam. Of course, I failed and am here now."

"I see."

Sirone answered halfheartedly and handed over a list.

"I'd like to buy some items. Please give me everything on here. I'll pay in Des."

Since using the Archduke's credit card would leave records, cash was better.

"I've seen some of these before. Don't worry. There are no stolen goods among the items here. Huh?"

The owner's eyes sparkled as she checked the list.

"You want to buy hearts? These are very difficult organs. Can you... actually handle them?"

"Of course. I've even won prizes at competitions hosted by the Alchemist Society. I'm buying this with prize money too."

Of course, it was a lie.

"...Alright, I understand. Wait a moment. First, 2 hearts of witches burned at the stake, and 1 heart of someone who drowned in ice water."

Hearts could be utilized differently depending on the emotions just before death.

She put everything in one large box and slammed it on the counter.

"That's 700,000 Des total. But what competition gives such generous prize money?"

"It's a secret."

While she could have made something up, speaking this way would make the owner think for herself.

"Don't tell me the Alchemist Society made you a scouting offer? You must be really smart."

"Well, something like that."

Sirone first checked the quantity and condition.

"You'll make tons of Des. That's good. I'm going through all this trouble to earn that too."

The woman, who had been resting her chin in thought, suddenly frowned and smacked Sirone.

"Ow! Why did you hit me?"

"A young one already getting cocky. An Intelligent Species should have big dreams. Don't you think about passing the administrator exam and leading hell instead of joining the Alchemist Society?"

Sirone hugged the box and pouted.

"What's it to you, miss?"

He deliberately acted childish, worried that arguing might expose his true identity.

"Sigh, fine. What business do I have saying anything? I once dreamed of a title too. A territory with my name. In that sense, Labyrinth is really wonderful. Not just the Archduke's aesthetic sense, but functionally..."

Just as a long speech seemed about to begin, her eyes filled with murderous intent.

"But that Yahweh, that detestable human came here. You heard too, right?"

"Huh? Oh, yes. I heard."

"Even tearing him apart wouldn't be satisfying enough. I want to skin him alive. If I could hear that vermin's screams, I'd do anything."

It was a situation where he had a mouth but nothing to say.

"Why do you hate Yahweh so much?"

"Huh?"

"No, I know you dislike Yahweh, but I don't understand. It's strange to hate someone from the moment you're born."

The owner tilted her head.

'They say very outstanding Intelligent Species have reason that transcends instinct. Maybe this child is like that too.'

Archduke Magrit was a prime example.

"A reason for hatred. I've never really thought about it, but maybe it's because we..." She rested her chin and chuckled.

"Maybe we love too much?"

When Sirone couldn't respond to the unexpected answer, she continued.

"Actually, I don't know. But when I look into the nature of the hatred I feel... it seems close to betrayal."

"Betrayal."

"Just, how should I put it, in human terms it's like seeing your beloved partner sleeping with someone else? Usually humans go almost insane in such cases, don't they?"

This was reasoning possible because she too was an Intelligent Species.

"From the moment of birth, that event itself seems to work as some kind of betrayal for us. That's why we want to tear him apart, why we want him to be miserable no matter what..."

The owner's expression relaxed momentarily, but soon burning murderous intent filled her eyes.

"I'll kill him! I'll split his belly open, pull out all his intestines, and chew them up in front of him! That damn bastard!" 

After calming her excitement, she handed over the change.

"Anyway, don't forget. Yahweh is our main enemy. You seem outstanding, so I'd prefer you become an administrator rather than join the Alchemist Society. Someone like you could even aim for a Duke title."

"Yes, thank you."

Sirone pocketed the Des, bowed to the owner, and left the shop.

'Betrayal, huh.'

His steps toward the laboratory were heavy.

That night, at Labyrinth's barracks.

The temporarily installed barracks looked like they were built by randomly kneading biological organs.

Inside that space with terrible vitality, seven demons sat around a round table.

Labyrinth's Seven Generals.

Though their current rank was Security Chief, they were battle-hardened veterans who had assisted the Archduke for 100 million years.

"We lost her in the end. We searched the city thoroughly, but couldn't find that woman. It's some kind of ability."

Son Yu-jung was hiding somewhere in the city.

"I received a report that Yahweh entered two days ago. We granted passage initially, but there's no record of him leaving the castle so far. If he's definitely in the city, he might be connected to this incident."

"Hmm, the two might have made contact by now. Whatever they're plotting, we can't wait. Let's report to the Archduke and ask for full authority."

"Isn't that a bit embarrassing? How can the Seven Generals who conquered countless territories say they couldn't catch just one person?"

"If she's really Yahweh's ally, this is serious. Besides, that woman is quite strong. According to the black box footage, her speed when she struck the gate exceeded Mach."

A moment of silence followed.

"...So who will report?"

"I'll do it."

Execution Captain Itaka.

A woman with jet-black hair so long it spread across the floor like shadows.

"And from tomorrow, we'll strengthen security. Gate security will be reinforced to more than 20 times normal."

"That's your decision, but I don't like your commanding tone. We have no reason to follow your orders."

"Then you all report it yourselves."

The meeting ended.

The next morning.

"Kiiiiiii!"

A strange bird specialized for high-speed flight landed gracefully in front of Labyrinth's gate.

"Whoa there."

Then Rete, president of the Alchemist Society, jumped down.

"It's been a while, Labyrinth."

As she pulled down her robe from under her chin, a beautiful face worn with fatigue was revealed.

"Halt! We'll fire if you move!"

Demons shouted from the castle walls, and two armored security guards approached her.

"Who are you? Identify yourself."

"Huh? Identity?"

Seeing Rete tilt her head, the security guard's face twisted with irritation.

'This is killing me when I'm already struggling.'

They had been working all night due to the breached gate.

"What territory are you from! What's your name! State your business in Labyrinth!"

Rete squeezed one eye shut and snapped back.

"Shut up! Ask one thing at a time! Do you think I have ten mouths? I'm here to see the Archduke! What are you gonna do about it?"

"What?"

The security guard grabbed Rete's chest.

"Are you really insane! Do you know what the situation is right now? If you wag your tongue wrong, you'll..."

*Smack* - a crisp sound rang out.

The security guard's head turned to the side.

It was grounds for summary execution, but none of the demons on the castle walls moved.

'What? What just happened?'

No one knew.

It was the world's fastest slap, and it was miraculous that his neck didn't break.

"Where do you think you're touching! Should I just blow you away!"

"Everyone, attack!"

Just as the demons on the walls aimed their weapons according to protocol, the gate split open left and right.

*Thud! Thud!*

An armored knight emerged with heavy footsteps.

"Stop."

Labyrinth's Seven Generals, Kimara.

True to his nickname as an Armored Knight, even the armor he wore was born from magic.

Rete placed her hand on her hip.

"Hey, Kimara. You need to manage your kids better."

Seeing someone call the Security Chief, who was over 100 million years old, by name to his face, the demons' hearts sank.

"Excuse me... who might you be?"

Before an answer could come, Kimara planted his great sword in the ground and knelt on one knee.

"My apologies, Lady Rete. The city's situation is complicated, and we've committed a discourtesy."

"Huh? Rete?"

Realizing her identity, the demons' faces turned pale, and they all prostrated themselves.

"Mother of Hell!"

"Ah, shut up! I'm busy as hell, so what's going on? Everyone's scared and blocking the road."

"The gate was breached last night. We judged it might be Yahweh's doing and strengthened security."

"Yahweh? Ah, that's right! Yahweh!"

Too impatient even to help Kimara up, Rete crouched down to face him.

"Lian's here too, right? You know, that ridiculously strong human who carries a big sword on his back."

"...I heard there was a disturbance at a restaurant. He seemed to be looking for the Archduke, but his whereabouts have been unknown since yesterday."

'Yesterday, huh. That was close.'

Relief appeared on Rete's face.

"The Archduke's at the castle now, right? Guide me. And tell Monorath that I'm here."

A puzzled look flashed in Kimara's helmet.

"The Archduke will welcome you, Lady Rete. But the Chief Secretary has never entered the city."

Rete groaned as she stood up.

"What do you mean? If Yahweh is here, then naturally Monorath should be too."

"My defense perimeter extends far beyond Labyrinth. I can state with certainty that the Chief Secretary hasn't even approached within 100 kilometers, let alone the city."

The bundle in her hand dropped with a thud.

"Lady Rete?"

At that moment, Kimara clearly understood what the wrath of an unapproachable goddess was like.

"That pig bastard, really!"
