Different Beliefs (3)

"Cough! Cough!"

The place where Sirone emerged through the intestines was a secluded alley in downtown Rabiet.

"Ugh, this feels really weird."

After experiencing intense intestinal movement for 20 minutes, he felt like he had become excrement.

"Hm?"

Smoke was rising from various parts of the city visible through the gaps in the alley.

"What's going on?"

At the same time, a group came running from behind the alley.

"There's not just one intruder! Search everywhere and slaughter them! Show the abilities of the stealth unit!"

Distinctive demons with mixed animal features quickly passed by Sirone.

"Hey! You!"

A demon with a lion's face jumped down from a building and landed in front of Sirone.

"What are you? You look like a demon, but don't you know what situation the city is in right now?"

"Ah, well..."

The lion's face contorted menacingly.

"You, don't tell me you ran away?"

Since Crossade, one of the 7 generals, was a demon, the shock would be natural.

"You pathetic bastard! Even so, how could you! What demon runs away from the battlefield!"

Just as the demon drew his blade-sharp claws and was about to mercilessly slash his throat.

"What's all this commotion?"

A female with a cat's face approached from the alley entrance, bristling the fur all over her body.

"Ah, Captain!"

It was Oris, Rabiet's 7th General and Stealth Unit Commander.

"When the city is in turmoil and we need to join forces, what kind of disgrace is this - demons fighting among themselves?"

"No, Captain. This guy is a deserter. He said he got scared and ran away."

Oris, examining Sirone, had the same thought as her subordinate.

'A demon. And an intelligent species at that.'

No matter how she looked at him, he wasn't a combat soldier, and judging by his appearance, he was quite young.

"A leader's death is always sad. But it's not like Buddha has come, so how can a demon be paralyzed with fear?"

"Ah, I'm sorry."

If it could prevent suspicion of coming down from the mountain, becoming a deserter would be fine too.

Oris patted Sirone's head.

"Don't worry. Even if Crossade was the strongest in terms of force, war isn't fought with strength alone, so your intelligence will surely be helpful too. Come, I'll return you to your unit."

As soon as she finished speaking, Oris grabbed Sirone and shot forward like an arrow.

"Whoa."

In terms of speed, Sirone was no slouch either, but what surprised him was her amazing sense of balance.

'They're definitely different from humans.'

"Hehe, nothing to be so surprised about. If you train hard, you'll be able to run as fast as me someday. Though demons are problematic because they rarely make the effort."

Oris, wanting to leave Sirone with glorious memories, continued.

"You're an intelligent species. The fact that you overcame instinct and ran away means you're highly intelligent in some sense. But demons must not run away leaving enemies behind."

"Yes. I won't run away anymore."

He was sincere.

If running away would actually make him more conspicuous, fighting would be more comfortable.

"Hoho! But don't worry too much. This Oris will take care of all the intruders."

Arriving at the city center where the 7 generals' combined forces were stationed, Sirone joined the special operations unit.

"...You deserted?"

Squad Leader Ishak of the 7th Division, after hearing the explanation from the stealth unit member, sent a contemptuous look.

'Tch, weak intelligent species.'

He was probably the type who would normally be stuck behind a desk playing with numbers if it wasn't an urgent situation.

"You should be killed immediately, but considering Lady Oris's reputation, I'll let it slide this once. Get in quickly!"

"Ah, yes."

When Sirone squeezed in among the demons of the 7th Division, it looked like giants and a dwarf.

"What's with this kid? Can you even fight with that body? Even if demons are supposed to be strong..."

"Leave him alone. His mind is already rotten, so what difference would it make if he became an adult?"

Ishak shouted.

"Quiet! A report came in that enemies have been spotted 200 meters to the west. Is everyone ready?"

"Yes!"

The demons' response rang out powerfully, and Sirone's voice added to the sound waves.

"Let's finish this!"

In sync with the 7th Division's battle cry, 200 demons charged forward at tremendous speed.

'Just who are these intruders causing all this chaos?'

Even while matching their pace, questions wouldn't leave Sirone's mind.

At first, he heard they were a human species.

But defeating one of the 7 generals was a result that broke the limits of what a species could achieve.

"Over there!"

Among Gimara's subordinates in armor forming a barricade, a woman was rampaging.

"Kieek! Kieek!"

Sirone's expression turned bewildered.

'Son Yoo-jung?'

Who would have thought that the one who invaded Rabiet was not a human species but an actual monkey.

"Kiek! You're all too weak!"

Each time she swung her twin clubs, the security force's armor shattered to pieces.

"Attack! Deal with her before she breaks through the encirclement!"

Following Ishak's lead, 200 members of the special operations unit simultaneously charged toward her.

'This isn't right.'

Even while being inevitably swept up with the army, Sirone instinctively felt the meaninglessness of the battle.

'The great-granddaughter of the Monkey King.'

According to Omega, Son Goku was a war god who held the record for the longest bloody battle against Ymir.

'But why is she in hell?'

Above all, she wasn't real.

What he sensed with Ultima was merely a special signal in the stage before being defined as a living being.

'A clone. Then there must be a main body somewhere else...'

The String ability was similar to Hexa but differed in that it could never truly exist.

'Though that existence is everything, really.'

Ultimately, half-powered force.

Nevertheless, Son Yoo-jung's prowess was overwhelming the entire special operations unit and security force.

"Kekekeke! Over here! Over here!"

Son Yoo-jung, who had been running all around the city, changed direction and approached Ishak.

Ishak also generated electricity from his horns and threw a punch, but instead his arm was severed.

"Graaah!"

He prepared for death, but Son Yoo-jung seemed to have adopted a principle of one strike per person and slipped away.

"That bastard...!"

Ishak, enraged by the monkey's mockery, turned his head but was soon dumbfounded.

His 200 subordinates couldn't even engage in a single exchange and were being pulverized by the clubs.

"What the hell is that thing?"

As his subordinates fell to the ground one by one, Sirone's figure stood out.

Ishak shouted with bloodshot eyes.

"You idiot! Fight!"

From his perspective, being at the extreme end of belligerence, Sirone looked more hateful than the intruder.

"You absent-minded bastard! I should have killed you with my own hands...!"

As if representing his feelings, Son Yoo-jung swung her club toward Sirone.

'It's over.'

It really looked that way.

But when he escaped the optical illusion, an unbelievable situation was transmitted to his mind.

"What, what?"

Sirone had dodged a strike that even he couldn't see by simply twisting his waist.

'Quantum movement.'

For the first time encountering something her club couldn't hit, Son Yoo-jung's clone looked on with interested, gleaming eyes.

"Ooki?"

Sirone recalled the suppression rate of 7 percent that Margritt had mentioned.

'If I get more than 93 percent close to Yahweh, the hidden code will be unlocked. I need to stay in the city until Rete leaves.'

Son Yoo-jung's clone showed irritation.

"Kiiiiiek!"

No matter how many attacks she continued, she couldn't hit Sirone, let alone even graze him.

'As expected, clones have significantly reduced intelligence. They can only mechanically utter a few words.'

If she couldn't use Geundu-un, which belongs to transformation techniques, a clone was actually less than half an existence.

'What were the demon attributes again?'

Fire and electricity.

'Then I am...'

As he moved positions with quantum movement, Son Yoo-jung's clone made a startled expression.

Probably animal instincts.

She was experiencing and being wary of probabilities of phenomena that couldn't exist in nature.

It was merely approaching from behind, but Son Yoo-jung's clone let out a shriek.

"Kiiiiiiii!"

And with all the strength the clone could muster, she twisted her body and swung the club.

A red afterimage passed futilely over Sirone's ducked head...

'Electric Photon Cannon.'

A sphere crackling with blue electricity flickered menacingly above Sirone's palm.

'Take this.'

As he drove it into her abdomen, all of Son Yoo-jung's hair stood on end.

...

Unable to even let out a scream, she stood with her mouth wide open before toppling forward.

"Phew, this is troublesome."

To find out how she came here, he would need to meet the main body, but that foreshadowed another problem.

"You, you..."

Meanwhile, Ishak was staring at Sirone with a dazed expression.

'Controlling fire and electricity is a characteristic of demons. But no matter how I look at it, those movements are...'

It wasn't an ability granted to an ordinary demon.

"Name, no."

Ishak, who had gotten up while holding his severed shoulder, knelt before Sirone.

"May I ask your name, Your Highness?"

"What?"

"I apologize for not recognizing you sooner. Someone with magic of a different class from us ordinary demons. A being who inherited not Satan's flesh or blood, but his spirit, and I was rude to you."

It couldn't be explained unless it was a hidden code that only a few bloodlines could inherit.

Ishak raised his head again.

"Please grant me the honor of hearing your name..."

Sirone searched through all of Omega's records to find a name that suited him.

"Yupie."

"Oh, how magnificent. An intelligent name that perfectly fits Your Highness's appearance."

In hell, there were over 4,000 words meaning lies, and the nuance of "Yupie" was 'short lie.' When someone asks in passing how you're doing, and you just answer that you're doing well, that's yupie.

"Lord Yupie, please become the commander of the special operations unit. I will serve you with all my heart and soul."

He would have preferred not to stand out, but thinking about it, demon nature was the complete opposite of reality.

'If I refuse here, it would be even stranger.'

It was like an employee who insists on working more even when the boss tells them to go home.

'The strong must rule.'

It was hell's iron law.

"Fine. If there's no one stronger than me in the special operations unit, I'll lead you all."

"I can say with certainty. Though I'm not weak in the unit, I don't even reach Your Highness's toes."

Ishak discarded his severed forearm without regret and returned to the city center with Sirone.

Since Son Yoo-jung's clone had swept through the area, demon corpses were visible everywhere.

'What a real mess. At this rate, Rabiet will be annihilated in a few days.'

"Please wait a moment."

After saying that, Ishak lifted the tent flap of a temporarily set up command post and entered.

"Based on current time, they're being detected in blocks 13, 27, and 66... What are you?"

When Executor Itaka interrupted his explanation, the three generals simultaneously turned around.

"Ah, I have something urgent to report, so I took the liberty of coming here despite the impropriety. I apologize."

A giant demon with skin distorted like burn scars all over his body blocked Ishak's way.

It was Defense Commander Moonom.

"If you know it's improper, don't do it. What's the matter? And what happened to your arm? Did you get beaten?"

His face had melted down leaving only one eye, and his lips were burned away, exposing all his teeth.

"Yes. But I took down one of them."

Itaka's eyebrows twitched as he listened with his fingers interlocked in a gloomy manner.

"So I have some information to share..."

Oris interrupted.

"You took one down? Really, you did?"

If the incoming reports were accurate, this was the only unit that had successfully neutralized an intruder by force.

"No, it wasn't me. By Satan's grace, there's an outstanding demon in our special operations unit."

Gimara asked.

"Where is he now?"

"Waiting outside the tent..."

Before he could finish, Itaka blurted out.

"Bring him in."

Shortly after, when Ishak brought in a demon child, silence fell over the tent.

'He's small? Demons' strength is their physical ability. How did he defeat an intruder?'

Then Oris's eyes widened.

"Huh? You?"

As everyone turned to look at her, Sirone awkwardly raised the corners of his mouth.

"Haha, hello?"
