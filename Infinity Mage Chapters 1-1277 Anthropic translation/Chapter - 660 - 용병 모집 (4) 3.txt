[660] Mercenary Recruitment (4)

Yordig, the master of the War Chariot Guild, arrogantly lifted his chin and approached Arkman.

He was a stern-looking man in his mid-fifties, wearing a brown robe with an embroidered carp coiling around his body.

"The Silvering Guild has really fallen behind. Well, what can you expect from people who only chase after money? Their skills are bound to be lacking."

Though Arkman's eyes widened, having just shown such a devastating defeat, opening his mouth would only make him look more pathetic.

"Ho ho ho! That's exactly why you need conviction to run a guild. You can't last long if you're only thinking about filling your guild members' bellies."

As if seizing the opportunity, Evian, the master of Blood Rose, provided supporting fire.

She was a woman in her mid-thirties wearing a tight-fitting top that revealed her cleavage instead of a robe, along with a short skirt and a blood-red neck cape.

"Isn't there a saying? If you can't tame a bird, let it go. This has proven that Silvering is unqualified to have an Ivory Tower candidate as a guild member."

Though Arkman was upset by the humiliating words from his enemies, he had something to say as well.

"So you're saying you can do it? I'll give you one chance - why don't you prove it here?"

Both of their mouths shut tight like clams.

Having also watched the battle, they had no disagreement that Shirone couldn't be held down by force alone.

As the conversation died down, Shirone asked about something he was curious about.

"But who are you?"

Evian gave a modest curtsy.

"Hello. I'm Evian, master of the kingdom's strongest guild, Blood Rose."

"Ah."

As expected, they were masters of competing guilds.

"Then what about this side?"

When Shirone turned to the man with thick sideburns, he extended his hand.

"I'm Yordig, master of War Chariot. Even a rookie should have heard my name."

He had never heard of it, and as a member of Silvering Guild, he wouldn't make the mistake of shaking hands with a competing guild's master.

"Hmph!"

While Yordig withdrew his hand in displeasure, Evian chose a friendly strategy.

"That duel just now was obviously a master verification process. But Blood Rose won't impose any conditions on you. So please visit our guild as well."

It was a strategy of taking half if she couldn't have it all.

With this approach, Yordig was the one at a disadvantage.

Being a war maniac who held supremacy through the logic of power, he had no intention of giving up the master's position to Shirone.

"Nonsense! Isn't it an unwritten rule that overlapping membership between competing guilds is strictly forbidden? Let's just have a war at this point. Let's determine the strongest of the three major guilds."

The core issue wasn't about Shirone, but that the balance of power would collapse with Shirone's involvement.

In that regard, Shirone felt somewhat sorry toward the three major guilds, but it wasn't something he needed to take responsibility for.

'Actually, this works out well. I can save a bit more time.'

Just as the masters thought about their guilds' positions, Shirone focused only on his own mission.

"How about this?"

When Shirone spoke up, all three masters paid attention.

"Actually, I'm thinking of organizing a private mercenary group."

Evian's face brightened as she spoke.

"If that's the case, please leave it to me. Blood Rose Guild has many capable mages."

"No. I won't accept just anyone. It's work where you could lose your life."

The Radum investigation was classified, but it was good to properly convey the difficulty level.

Finally finding his chance to intervene, Yordig actively stepped forward.

"If you're afraid of dying, you can't last long in this business. Danger doesn't matter to War Chariot's guild members. What's really important is this."

Yordig rubbed his fingers together asking about compensation, but Shirone didn't have clear criteria established yet.

Even though he had been given full authority by Rufist, without understanding the guild situation, it was difficult to determine an appropriate level.

"Um, so..."

"10,000 gold."

Then another voice was heard from the building direction.

"Huh? Miss Aria?"

Shirone showed a surprised expression at the unexpected person's appearance, but Aria approached casually as if they had made an appointment.

"Hello, Shirone."

"What brings you here?"

"I told you then, see you next time."

Yordig asked.

"I don't know who you are, but 10,000 gold? Is that the commission fee for this job?"

For guild members who risked their lives for even 100 gold, it was like golden rain pouring from the sky.

"Wrong. To be precise, it's 10,000 gold per person."

Not only the masters but even the Silvering Guild members stirred, but from Shirone's perspective, it was just troublesome.

"Miss Aria, what exactly is this..."

"Don't worry. I already finished talking with the VIP."

If she had Rufist's permission it was fine, but why it was Aria was still questionable.

As if reading Shirone's thoughts, Aria said.

"I heard from my lover. You're forming a mercenary group? I decided to join too. There will be things I can help with."

Shirone immediately refused.

"It's too dangerous. You could die. Miss Aria doesn't even have combat ability."

"What are you talking about? I'm an official diplomat. I can at least protect my own life. Want to see?"

Aria demonstrated the self-defense techniques she learned at the royal castle.

"Ha! Ha!"

The thrusting and kicking were quite clumsy, but not being one to judge unfamiliar fields, he turned to Rian.

"Hopeless. She couldn't even catch a dog."

At Rian's assessment, Aria stuck out her tongue.

"Hehe, was I found out? I practiced yesterday. But don't worry. I've prepared my own secret weapon."

"What's the reason you want to go this far?"

The smile disappeared from Aria's face.

"Because it's my job. Just as you work hard in your position as a mage, I'm just doing my job too."

Though Radum was under the Ministry of Internal Affairs' jurisdiction, involving personnel from there carried high risk of leakage.

Moreover, since Radum was extraterritorial, there were many things Aria could do, and most importantly, her low rank pleased Rufist.

Aria linked arms with Shirone and stuck close to him.

"And you'll protect me, so what's there to worry about? If I can be protected by Shirone, even hell wouldn't be scary."

Having gathered information about Shirone since the Gold City terrorist incident, she had collected intelligence that he was the kingdom's greatest talent who had become an Ivory Tower candidate.

Remembering Brooks' face, Shirone hurriedly pulled his hand away and grumbled.

"If you're going to charge in thinking I'll protect you, quit now. You never know what might happen..."

"Hehe, I told you not to worry."

Having already made her plans, Aria slowly looked around at the three major guilds' masters.

"Let's commission all of Silvering, War Chariot, and Blood Rose. From this moment, we'll organize the Shirone Mercenary Group and recruit members. The method will be a first round public test and second round private test. It's a classified mission, with compensation of 10,000 gold. 3,000 gold will be paid in advance as contract money. Please spread this through the guild network as quickly as possible. We'll hold the first round public test here in one week."

No master opposed, and they were even thinking of personally applying for the first round public test.

Rather than moving for money, it was because the balance of power would be redistributed depending on how many from their guild passed.

"Very well. We'll convey that."

After the masters left, Shirone grabbed Aria's wrist and took her to a corner.

"Aren't you making this too big? It's a classified mission."

"That's why I'm making it big."

"What do you mean?"

"Did you think the VIP would really entrust this only to you? Through this test, they'll also send supporters from their side. Conversely, I'll identify those with unclear identities through document screening and interviews."

"Hmm."

Aria's responsibility was heavy.

'Well, it's not like the Association can move on this matter either.'

Aria placed her hand on Shirone's shoulder.

"Using the guilds was the right judgment. Without something like 10,000 gold, skilled people won't gather. Even so... most will probably die."

Aria's boldness in taking on this job despite knowing this was also extraordinary.

"I understand. I'll do my best to protect Miss Aria. But... I can't guarantee it."

"That's enough. Don't try to take responsibility for too much. It's something decided by each person's judgment. You don't need to worry about whether they live or die. Including me."

It was a statement befitting a royal castle executive, and finally felt like graduating from magic school.

"Yes. Please take care of me."

During the week waiting for the test, Shirone and Rian received briefings from Aria in the hideout at Brooks' mansion, cutting off all channels connected to the outside.

They were educated on the estimated population of sub-races, each species, their characteristics, and memorized Radum's complex roads.

"Once you actually enter Radum, high-level concealment facilities will be disrupting the structure. So use the map only as reference."

When teaching Shirone, Aria was undoubtedly a professional, but after work ended, she invariably sent flirtatious signals.

From Shirone's perspective, refusing was the most difficult part of each day.

"If you ever change your mind, tell me anytime. I won't eat you up, so don't feel burdened."

After saying that, seeing her go off to enjoy secret meetings with Brooks again, she was clearly someone with different life values.

Even Brooks, the world's greatest playboy, was gradually becoming obsessed with Aria, which is why his gaze toward Shirone wasn't always kind.

"Finally, today's the day. Let's go."

When test day arrived, the three people left Brooks' mansion from dawn and headed to Silvering Guild.

The ground that had collapsed from Photon Cannon's rapid fire had been restored, and tables prepared for the public test were arranged on one side.

Around sunrise, all the test applicants who had been staying in Baska flocked in, creating a sea of people inside the guild.

The total number of applicants was 273, each wearing a badge with a number based on their registration order.

"Alright! Now we'll begin the entrance test for Shirone's Mercenary Group! The first round is a public test where we'll evaluate your fundamentals. Please do your absolute best to show your abilities."

As they entered the clearing in order from number 1, Aria put on her glasses.

Her role was document screening, while Shirone handled magic-related aspects and Rian covered physical combat abilities.

Being a public test, they focused on basics rather than individuality - for mages it was Spirit Zone, and for swordsmen or martial artists, they demonstrated their specialty for about a minute.

Aria whispered to Shirone sitting in the center.

"Excluding us three and considering the assistants the VIP will send, we can ultimately accept about 13 to 15 people. Since the second round will have about three times the number of successful candidates, we need to eliminate over 200 people in the first round."

Shirone nodded, having grasped the rough criteria.

'200 people. Isn't that too harsh?'

But such thoughts disappeared once the public test actually began.

Though these people applied aiming for 10,000 gold, many fell so short of standards that they would die without accomplishing anything if taken to Radum.

"Taha! Taha!"

While a muscular man holding two hammers swung both arms over his head showing off his skills, Rian was indifferent.

'No good. His strength is fine but his technique is too poor. He'll die like that.'

Rian checked the fail box on applicant 27's documents and passed them to Aria.

'Hmm, 27 people have passed but not even one has come out yet.'

Just as he was starting to worry slightly, applicants 28 and 29 entered simultaneously.

Aria, who first examined the documents, looked up with gleaming eyes.

'Assistants.'

When she signaled that they were Association personnel, Shirone also watched carefully.

It was a male and female duo wearing plain black masks, and their atmosphere was indeed extraordinary.

"Greetings, I'm applicant number 28."

"Number 29."

As the man and woman bowed in turn, Shirone's eyes narrowed drowsily.

"Yes... hello."

They were the voices of Magic Association's Rufist and Secretary General Jane.
