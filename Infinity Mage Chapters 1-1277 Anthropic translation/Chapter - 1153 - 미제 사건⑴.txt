Cold Case ⑴

Melkidu, Dorian Village.

Sirone's group entered the tavern and ordered simple meals and beer from the staff.

The man who identified himself as a detective was named Curtis.

He said he was from the Iron Kingdom and had been in Melkidu for two years already.

The food came out after 10 minutes.

"How do we pay?"

When Sirone asked, Curtis, who had been gulping down his beer, wiped his chin and said:

"Kuh. No need to pay. Money doesn't exist here. This is a sanctuary for murderers."

"Then?"

"We just leave. As long as you have Crime Points, criminal acts aren't recognized by people. Having a beer and running would consume 2P."

"Ah?"

He roughly understood.

"Stabbing someone with a knife is 5P, so it's quite expensive. Of course, as you go through cycles, Crime Points accumulate, so later it won't be a burden."

Iruki asked:

"By cycle, do you mean Melkidu is structured in an orbital form?"

"That's right. Precisely, it's 2 tracks. Divided into outer track and inner track. The outer track has 468 blocks, and you mostly perform missions. However, when you reach certain blocks, you can enter the inner track."

"What kind of place is the inner track?"

"It consists of 197 blocks, where you can strengthen your Crime Dice or buy special items at shops. The characteristic is that you can only go around the inner track once. When you finish all the blocks, you're forced back to the outer track. But there's an exception to this too - when you enter Melkidu itself."

Eden asked:

"Isn't this place Melkidu?"

"Of course it is, but the only place with symbolism befitting Melkidu is the Core. All players gather points on the outer track to enter the inner track, and their goal is to reach the Core during one cycle there. If they can't reach the Core, they come back to the outer track and continue this crazy killing spree."

"Why do murderers want to go to the Core? Is it to avoid pursuit?"

"...It's not that simple."

Curtis held his beer glass and fell into thought for a moment, then drained the rest of his drink.

"I've never been there myself, so I can't tell you exactly. But I've heard rumors. I've been going around the track for two years because of those rumors."

His eyes became clouded.

"She was twenty-seven, my daughter Edrina. She loved to travel. That day too, she was excited about going to the beach with her friends. I remember it wasn't different from usual. Packing her bags, putting on makeup, kissing my wife and my cheek."

'So it was his daughter.'

"She was supposed to go with her friends. They were all close. Nia, Belita, Daisy. They were supposed to meet at Seaf Square and leave together, but—"

"They disappeared."

When he attended magic school in Tormia, he had read about it in the international section of the newspaper.

"Right. It was broad daylight. Nia and Belita lived downtown, and Daisy lived uptown. According to witness testimony, they saw my daughter at Seaf Square. She looked very anxious, and another witness said she was reading something at the square's bulletin board. But that's where the information ends. My daughter has never appeared in the world since then."

"Could it have been someone she knew, or—"

"What do you think my profession is? I tried everything I could investigate. But it was useless. What's even more surprising is that her friends disappeared at almost the same time. Even though they lived in the same city, the square was 2 kilometers away."

Curtis lit a cigarette.

"I searched for three years. Dark alleys of the underworld, human trafficking, magic, sorcery, etc. Then I heard rumors about Melkidu and came here."

"Can you find your daughter's whereabouts in Melkidu?"

"Yes."

He exhaled cigarette smoke boldly.

"Melkidu's Core is where all crime cases that happened in the world are recorded. It's the headquarters of permanently unsolved cases. If only I could clear this murder game."

"What do you mean—"

"Why is it a sanctuary for murderers? If you clear this game, what you committed in reality becomes a perfect crime. Conversely, it becomes a permanently unsolved case."

It didn't sound logical.

"How does that happen? Unknown cases aside, when there are witnesses and evidence... Ah."

One thought crossed his mind.

"Crime Points."

Crimes committed using Crime Points in Melkidu aren't recognized.

"Right. I think this place is some kind of system. The act of collecting points while going around the track seems to work as a special power that can affect reality. Murderers who reach the Core can manipulate their records and return to reality. In other words, they can commit new crimes in a safe state."

Iruki said:

"It feels like Harvits' Vanishing. The nature of the hidden code would be similar. Like exporting objects from Drimo to reality, it seems to be a system that can apply Crime Points collected here to reality."

Curtis extinguished his cigarette.

"I will find my daughter no matter what. I'll collect Crime Points and enter the Core. It's not easy. There are two ways to enter. Either collect an enormous amount of Crime Points, or be extremely lucky. They say if you perform special missions on the inner track, you can enter the Core regardless of Crime Points. Of course, there's almost no information sharing, so it's currently dismissed as nonsense."

'The Devil's Bible.'

It seemed related to Kiyorgi's ability to help Catacomb members escape.

While he was lost in thought organizing the information he heard from Curtis, the tavern door opened.

"Buy candles. Buy candles."

"Huh?"

Nade's eyes widened.

"That woman is?"

It was the person who had been stabbed in the neck and killed by a murderer on the street just 30 minutes ago.

Curtis turned around.

"Most non-players in Melkidu revive. Of course, there are also event-type non-players who don't revive. Revival time varies depending on the mission."

"Hmm."

Sirone's group felt much lighter thinking they weren't human.

"It is unsettling though. Even if they're fake, the feel and reactions are exactly like real humans. At first, I also cleared missions by only catching villains. This place is really just like real society. But this method is inefficient. At some point, I became as numb as other murderers."

Perhaps that was Melkidu's reason for existence.

"There are many other methods. You can set buildings on fire, or mow down the city center with multi-shot crossbows. But those crimes consume a lot of Crime Points. That murderer earlier stabbed a passerby with a knife bought from a weapon shop, right? Dorian's C-rank missions don't give big rewards. No matter how well you roll the dice, it's hard to get more than 200P. So he killed in a way that saves Crime Points."

Sirone understood.

"The reason he didn't fight us was also to save his own points."

"Right. The rule where Crime Attack between players automatically deducts points until one side reaches 0 is to prevent disputes between murderers. Who would play this game if they openly killed each other? But there are guys who fight accepting the risk. To steal items."

Nade asked:

"What happens when points reach 0?"

"The whole world learns about all the crimes you've committed so far. Guards will pursue you. You'll be imprisoned, pay a certain price, and restart from the starting point. Let me be clear - don't get into such a stupid situation. You guys can't do anything. Without Crime Points, you can't even attack guards."

Eden asked:

"How many Crime Points are needed for magic?"

"That's quite a difficult question. I've heard from 1,000P to 100,000P. The reason I don't know details is because nobody tells their point total. Remember this for sure. Points are everything. There's no such thing as combat efficiency between players. The moment you clash, your points are deducted by the amount of the opponent's points."

One moment's mistake could lose all the points collected so far.

"So when attacking someone, you should only execute when you're 100% certain. Also, you don't just kill anyone even when certain. It's when the opponent has expensive items, you need to kill a player for a special mission, or you kill due to personal desire regardless of points."

Curtis rummaged through his pocket and held his Crime Dice between his fingers.

There were 3 total: one 8-sided die and two 6-sided dice.

"If you enter the inner track early, I recommend strengthening dice rather than buying items. Of course, items are essential in Melkidu, but they're not efficient early on. Rather, you'll just become prey for the point tycoons."

"I see."

"This is also a time game. If you don't collect points as quickly as possible, you'll get eaten. Now I'm moving to another block. Ask if you have any questions."

Sirone asked:

"What's your reason for helping us? According to what you said, Curtis, isn't this a waste of time? We're not accomplices either."

"That's true. But what I realized after going around the track for two years is that connections are surprisingly necessary. As you know, a player's moves are decided by dice. But that's exactly why you need to make more connections."

You never know when and where you'll meet.

"Having Crime Dice means I've already cleared Dorian village's mission. At Melkidu's starting point - when the first player jumps to villages 2 through 12 - they usually stay for one to two days. Veterans are good but their true intentions are hard to figure out."

Sirone's group understood.

"So if we encounter each other on the same block later, there's room for cooperation."

"I don't choose just anyone. You guys have been through all sorts of battles, right? I can tell from your posture and eyes when facing enemies. A detective's eye can't be fooled. Let's exchange information or items, or perform cooperative missions. We'll be able to get more Crime Points."

"Yes. We'll also try to gather necessary information. I hope you find your daughter's whereabouts."

The fact that he wasn't a murderer was appealing.

"Right. May the god of dice be with you. That's a common greeting in Melkidu."

Curtis pulled out a card with his left hand.

"Wind God. Activate."

The card glowed and evaporated, and three dice rolled across the tavern floor.

The numbers 3, 2, 6 appeared, then two X marks were added between them.

'Multiplication. Did he use an item?'

As the three numbers combined to become 36, Curtis looked back at the group.

"Oh, one more tip. In Melkidu, get in the habit of always closing doors behind you."

As soon as he finished speaking, his body glowed brightly and disappeared like an explosion.

Looking at the empty beer glass left alone, Iruki said:

"36 spaces. Even though the god of dice turned away, he went far. So Curtis is currently staying at block 42."

Sirone stood up.

"It's impossible to chase him with the dice we have. Well, we can just tackle it from the beginning."

A system voice was heard.

The tavern owner is watching you.

"Huh?"

When they turned toward the counter, the owner was looking at the group with suspicious eyes.

'Come to think of it...'

The victims of the murderer had recognized the crime, unlike other non-players.

"Should we?"

Nade asked.

"We have no choice."

One, two...

"Run!"

As the four people simultaneously ran toward the exit, the owner glared and chased after them.

"Stop there! You thieves!"

"Aaaaah!"

Remembering Curtis's words, Sirone slammed the door shut as he went outside.

"Haa. Haa."

He looked back at the door nervously, but the owner didn't come outside.

"What? It's quiet?"

After exchanging glances with his friends, Sirone walked back and cracked the door open...

"Welcome. This is Dorian Tavern."

As if nothing had happened, the owner was at the counter with a smiling face welcoming them.

Iruki muttered:

"A perfect crime."
