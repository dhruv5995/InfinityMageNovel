[623] Scout Reporting (4)

"Haaaah!"

Sirone's pupils dilated completely, and his mind expanded enormously as if everything in the world was being sucked into them.

In the amplification that could only be called explosive, he felt like a giant who had swallowed the world.

'Photon Cannon!'

A flash of light that could swallow a human whole burst forth, striking the basilisk's face dead-on.

With the single blow, the reptile's face was buried into its neck and its entire body was pushed backward.

"What... what is that?"

No one at the school had ever seen the power of close combat through Ataraxia before.

"Impact force. What's the reading?"

At Baikal's question, Elizabeth remained silent.

The 2000th main system never lied, but the numbers it conveyed were too unrealistic to speak aloud.

'I absolutely won't stop!'

Having dealt with the enemy before him, Sirone launched himself toward the center of the battlefield.

With just a single shotgun movement, the colosseum was split into eight sections.

The path of the flash was swept clean as if erased, and the sight of centerless rampages flickering in spherical forms was reminiscent of a planet's explosion.

"That crazy bastard! That's cheating!"

Sirone's body hadn't changed, but the participants felt as if they were facing some enormous being.

The wyverns caught in Shining Chain had their necks and spines broken simultaneously as they crashed to the ground, and ogres were crushed by Photon Cannons raining down like meteors.

"Impact force! Report!"

When the frustrated Baikal shouted, Elizabeth hurriedly collected herself and spoke.

"Ah, yes! Single Photon Cannon impact force 2.3 million crash! Magic power reading...!"

It took time even to read the numbers appearing on her retina.

"Currently exceeding 170 million!"

"170 million?"

He had increased power, changed systems, and now had completely transcended scale itself.

"Evaluator, at this level..."

"I know. My eyes aren't crooked."

Now even Baikal had to acknowledge it.

'This isn't power he could originally wield. And yet... he's enduring it?'

The thought of how much vastness the human mind could contain sent chills through him.

"Please evaluate."

Elizabeth's voice was full of excitement.

"F."

At the unexpected evaluation, Lara tilted her head.

"No matter how transcendent the power, it still negates the meaning of survival through perseverance."

"But this is..."

"However, I'll add one thing."

Baikal continued.

"If number 27 can keep going until the very end..."

If he could destroy the existing system.

"Even without me, he'll receive praise from scouts worldwide."

It was the only method Miro had suggested.

'I need to climb to the highest stage possible!'

While everyone was stunned, the number of creatures called kings of various species was rapidly decreasing.

'Sonic Explosion!'

By casting magic directly on coordinates rather than targets, several monsters were caught in the storm of mass and annihilated.

Tier 5 was almost completely wiped out, and as even Tier 4 numbers dropped to the tens, participants could finally view the battlefield from a scout's perspective.

'They think we're fools!'

At first they thought they'd just wait for him to tire himself out, but at this rate, they'd end up as Sirone's supporting cast when the first evaluation ended.

'Fight.'

Just as the participants who had changed their stance were about to charge at the enemies, Fermi cast one of his trump cards - the earthquake magic Super Eruption.

The entire radius under the 2000th system split apart, and giant monsters were crushed as they were swallowed by the earth.

"Why?"

The participants who looked at Fermi quickly realized.

'I see. It can't be maintained for long anyway.'

If Ataraxia was a magic amplification array, Sirone's expanded mind would inevitably hit its limits, and intuitively, that time wouldn't be very long.

'Now, Sirone. What will you do?'

The aftermath when the mental expansion of close combat ended was beyond imagination.

Therefore, Sirone would want to skip as many stages as possible in this state, and if so, Fermi just needed to block that desire.

'Enjoy the rest you so desperately wanted. It would be troublesome if only you were running wild, wouldn't it?'

When the creatures were annihilated, 30 seconds would be given, and during that time, the mental power amplified by close combat would also settle down.

When Super Eruption stopped activating, the 2000th system restored the ground to its original state.

As participants stared blankly at the cleaned colosseum, Fermi clapped and said:

"Well then, after resting a bit..."

Entering Survival Through Perseverance Stage 8.

"What?"

Fermi's words stopped, and participants looked around the corners of the colosseum.

"Grrrr!"

Sirone, still caught in the power of amplification, made rough groaning sounds while clenching both fists tightly.

"Above."

A single basilisk wrapped in Shining Chain slowly descended from high in the sky.

"I won't be swayed by you anymore."

Fermi said with a rotten smile.

"Even so, nothing will change."

Sirone silently brought his hand to the basilisk's face.

'Dark Sphere.'

As a black sphere was born, the monster's limbs trembled before decomposing into code and being sucked into the darkness.

"Get it together! We're at stage 8 now!"

Tier 3 creatures had already infested the colosseum.

They weren't as massive or hideous as Tier 4, but this actually proved they were demons based on magic - mental domains rather than biological functions.

"Why are there so many!"

Dream demon succubi, half-soul vampires, sleep demon sandmen, evil spirit larvae - 240 mid-level Tier 3 demons were summoned and began attacking the participants.

The number of summoned entities was higher than the previous stage because they were mid-level demons, but considering their special magic power that couldn't be quantified, it was an unreasonable difficulty.

"Damn it! Let's fight!"

It wasn't a level they could endure for 10 minutes with psychological warfare, and participants were scattered by the powerful demons' attacks.

'Saint Barrier!'

As dozens of vampires cornered Eden and swung their claws, fierce winds raged like being caught in a storm.

A short distance away, succubi shot pure magic power concentrations - magic storms - pounding Eden's barrier.

"He's simultaneously withstanding vampires' physical force and succubi's magic power. Magnificent."

Despite the praise, Elizabeth's voice lacked vitality.

'Spiral Hunter!'

With Luman's crowd control magic, the ground twisted like a whirlpool and swallowed the succubi's lower bodies.

'Wall of Wailing!'

Then he erected a giant wall to block the surroundings as Binder fired regulation magic in rapid succession.

"Wind Cutter!"

Even though it was magic anyone could do, with Suabi's buff the power was tremendous, and finally one succubus was annihilated.

"The combination of numbers 16, 18, and 20. A decent team."

"Seems like mid-level graduating class students formed an alliance. Each of their strengths is properly utilized."

They had taken down a Tier 3 demon, which deserved praise, but Baikal said nothing special.

He had observed countless graduation exams, but today was the first time he felt the standards themselves collapsing.

'In the end, everyone's watching only one person.'

Not just the audience, but even foreign scouts were only talking about participant number 27.

The demons surrounding Eden exploded with a single rampage, and the value of one Photon Cannon exceeded Binder's team's full power.

"With that, there's no need for strategy or tactics."

Making the value of technique meaningless - that was the true meaning of Unlocker, scale magic.

Survival Through Perseverance Stage 8 has ended. Stage 9 will begin in 30 seconds.

The moment the 2000th system's announcement was heard, Sirone, whose close combat amplification had ended, collapsed to his knees.

"Ugh..."

Even the pain of his entire body feeling like it would shatter was nothing compared to the shock of his mind being torn to pieces.

'30 seconds. I need to recover my mind within 30 seconds.'

He tried his best to concentrate, but his thoughts were hazy as if half his brain had been blown away, and his consciousness was still far away.

"This one is serious."

Looking at the panting Sirone, Baikal said.

"It's a 30-second opportunity earned by risking his life. But can he recover?"

'26 seconds. 25 seconds.'

Like a dried well, there was no sign of magic power being replenished, and with each passing second, it felt crushing.

'21 seconds. 20 seconds. Please...!'

Sirone grabbed his trembling wrist and squeezed his eyes shut.

'Please recover! You have to recover!'

19 seconds. 18 seconds.

Not only the participants in the colosseum, but scouts and audience members were all watching Sirone.

"Hng! Hk!"

Swallowing the tears that burst out unconsciously, he tried his best, but it was like pouring water into a bottomless jar.

"Sirone..."

Amy bit her lips, and Iruki stared at Sirone without even blinking.

"Help Sirone!"

Nade shouted.

"Suabi, please. Cast recovery magic on Sirone!"

Since her utility was monopolized by Binder, it was an impossible request.

"Pony! Please, Refresh..."

Then Nade approached Pony and pleaded.

"I can cast Refresh. If there's appropriate compensation."

"I'll compensate you! Whatever you want me to do...!"

"But the person involved won't want it. I don't want to become Sirone's enemy from the first evaluation."

Iruki said in a cold voice.

"Nade, the more you do this, the more you'll ruin Sirone's future."

"I'm... ruining it?"

Nade looked at Sirone, who was crouched and regulating his breathing.

'He's struggling so much...'

Why on earth?

How great could a wizard's license be?

"That student has really been quite a spectacle."

While the audience seriously observed all participants, Nade alone seemed like a circus monkey.

"Exactly. It's an exam with their lives on the line, so they should be serious. Everyone's fighting desperately, but she alone pretends to care for her friend. She lacks basic attitude."

At the criticism pouring from parents, Nade's mother Teria's face reddened.

"I'm dying of embarrassment. That's why I said I wouldn't come. Even seeing her poor mother like this, she doesn't think about earning money, just looking for excuses to attend school."

"I'm proud."

Looking at his son, Ballroom smiled with pity.

"Of course you would be. That's why you can't earn a penny."

To stay with Teria, one had to learn patience.

'16 seconds. Please. 15 seconds. Please!'

At the halfway point of rest time, despair began to cloud Sirone's face.

"What's the magic power reading?"

Elizabeth's eyes lit up.

"Still 0. It seems difficult to recover in time."

"...Will it end with just 'it was a good attempt'?"

'12 seconds. 11 seconds.'

The mind is dominated by the heart.

'The Secret of Musang!'

Suddenly recalling the technique Zulu had taught him, Sirone slowly closed his eyes and filled his lungs.

'Breathe in. Breathe out.'

Focus on breathing.

Let go of the graduation exam, competition, magic recovery, and the wizard's life - focus only on being alive.

"Hoo... Hoo..."

As his worries disappeared, his torn mind began to miraculously stick back together.

'Nothing in this universe is important.'

That was Musang.

"Evaluator, the magic power reading... is rising again."

Shock filled Elizabeth's eyes.

"1 million Magical. 2.2 million Magical. Incredible recovery speed."

"Impossible."

For the first time, Baikal shook his head.

After already breaking through limits and exploding, the human mind couldn't recover in such a short time.

'Sirone, just what kind of life... have you lived?'

It was top secret.

'Breathe in...'

The world is sucked into a point.

"Breathe out..."

The world expands infinitely.

Though the 2000th couldn't detect it, the audience was instinctively feeling as if he was swallowing and exhaling the universe.

7 seconds.

'Breathe in.'

6 seconds.

'Breathe out.'

"That's strange. Why do I keep... getting goosebumps?"

Only a few could properly understand what was happening in the colosseum.

'Yes, Sirone. That's exactly who you are!'

Rian clenched his fist, and the eyes of the hooded woman sparkled.

'Everyone's overlooking it. Visible skills aren't everything. Before being a wizard...'

For the first time, she spoke.

"Sirone is Prajna."
