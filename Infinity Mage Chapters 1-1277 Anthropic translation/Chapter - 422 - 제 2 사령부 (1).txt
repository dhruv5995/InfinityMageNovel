[422] The 2nd Command (1)

Sirone headed to the 2nd Command with Flu.

Clove and Gardrak took charge of guidance, and while they narrowed the distance riding spots of light, they could hear various information.

"According to research, the angels' 'looking down' doesn't seem to be the observer's gaze departing, but rather pulling the desired location right before their eyes. It's similar to opening a drawer in a room and rummaging through its contents. Then how did the rebels avoid the looking down?"

Gardrak's words were translated through a drone received from the command.

While drones produced in heaven didn't have the languages of earthly nations, the 'night blindness' equipment was programmed with countless languages of border people.

"Hmm, putting a lock on the drawer?"

At Flu's words, Gardrak nodded.

"That's the Mecha tribe's method. They disrupt the landscape with their self-developed magnetic field to prevent focusing."

Sirone said.

"Then the second method would be making many drawers?"

"Correct. The 2nd Command we're currently heading to operates scattered like a cell organization. It's a classic hiding strategy, but the risk is much lower accordingly."

Flu asked.

"What kind of place is it? The 2nd Command, I mean."

"I've never been to the command either. I worked in the 13th Battalion before being incorporated into the 1st Command. However, compared to Mecha who value leadership, Nor prioritizes individual ability. They believe that those with power should become commanders."

Sirone said.

"Then the commander must be an incredibly strong person."

"So I've heard. She's a woman named Raysis, and according to rumors, her Spirit Force is as much as 32 percent."

Spirit Force was an indicator of affinity for jeong, a mental state much closer to essence than Spirit Zone.

Flu asked.

"How amazing is 32 percent? If it became 100 percent, could one freely manipulate jeong?"

"That would be impossible. It's just affinity after all. With 32 percent, it would be like providing drinking water for 100 people with a single drop of water? Ordinary Nor only have 7-8 percent affinity. Even a 1 percent difference makes magical power grow exponentially."

Sirone vaguely pictured the 2nd Command's commander in his mind.

"Anyway, I'm in favor of this journey. Mecha are strong against giants but weak against fairies. On the other hand, Nor people are strong against fairies. Alliance is essential for survival."

While having such conversations, Sirone's group arrived at the spot of light.

Light particles were floating gently above transparent stream water that sparkled like diamonds.

Gardrak entered the stream, pushing through the water with splashing sounds, extended his fist toward the spot and prepared the light magic Elizer.

Watching the light seep into his fist, Flu asked.

"Do we have to go further from here? This is already the third time."

"This is the last one."

It was something he had been saving to say, as information could leak if they were attacked on the way here.

Flu nodded and approached Sirone.

While she felt more at ease than when there were stellar seniors around, now she had to protect Sirone entirely on her own.

She recalled the conversation she had with Gaold last night after finishing negotiations with Crude and leaving the bunker.

"Flu."

"Yes, Association President."

Gaold, who had called Flu, glanced at Sirone briefly before speaking.

"I'm worried. Other teams have veterans mixed in, but you and Sirone are different."

Flu readily acknowledged this.

Of course, she also knew that what Gaold was worried about wasn't Sirone and Flu's safety, but the failure of the project.

"I'm fully aware. I'll risk my life to ensure I don't become a burden to the seniors."

"If, by any chance, the situation goes wrong..."

Gaold stopped speaking.

This was truly remarkable for Flu.

The fact that he, who could be compared to a machine with broken brakes, had hesitated made her feel as if she had already been rewarded.

Flu smiled gently and said.

"Don't worry. I know that if one person's life must be lost in this project, it should be mine. As a supporter, no matter what happens, I will definitely ensure Sirone's survival."

Sirone, who had joined the team in the terminator position, was the master key of the task force who had to survive until the end even if most team members died.

The very act of weighing the lives of such an important factor and herself as a supporter was shameful as a mage.

Gaold looked at Flu silently for a moment. Then he turned around, wickedly tearing the corners of his mouth.

"Keke, I'll trust you."

The last words seeped deep into Flu's heart.

She, who had been staring at Gaold's broad back with a blank expression, raised a military salute with a beaming smile.

'I don't mind dying. I've joined the best team.'

"Excuse me..."

At that moment, Crude, who had been watching the two from afar, cleared his throat and walked over.

Being someone who believed that humans should live humanely even in wartime, he carefully expressed his emotions.

"If there's anything uncomfortable..."

"There isn't."

Flu withdrew her smile as if nothing had happened and turned around with a cold expression.

Sirone was playing around, stirring up minnows with his feet.

If he weren't performing a mission in such a place, he would be unmistakably nineteen years old.

She would do her best to protect Sirone.

But it was also true that words like "best" had no meaning in actual combat.

Only completing the objective by any means necessary was important, and for that, Sirone also needed resolve.

"Listen carefully. Since you've come this far, you're also a mage. You haven't graduated yet, so you're an unofficial mage."

Sirone looked at Flu with bewilderment.

"So from now on, I'll treat you as a professional too. Don't be swayed by emotions and stay faithful to the mission. I'm not asking you to do unreasonable things. In fact, we can't even distinguish what's unreasonable. That's what war is like. If confusion arises, stay faithful only to the mission."

Sirone couldn't not understand.

Sky-like seniors would willingly sacrifice their lives to protect him, who didn't even have a mage license.

What was most nerve-wracking was that knowing this fact, he still had to drive them into danger without hesitation.

'I must survive. That's my mission.'

Sirone nodded with a resolute expression.

"Yes. Don't worry."

No one wants to take on unpleasant tasks.

If he couldn't do it, someone else would eventually have to bear that burden.

Sirone resolved. No, he prayed.

Please don't let him hesitate no matter what situation arose.

"Departing."

Elizer's massive flash shot up into the sky.

As the world was enveloped in warm light, the forest scenery shimmered.

When the light cleared, the scenery had changed from the valley with the stream to the middle of a forest where dense woodland was established.

Flu looked around and asked.

"Is this the command?"

"No. A gatekeeper from the command will escort us. We'll probably have to go much further from here."

It was a measure to avoid being followed. They could see how thoroughly and meticulously they were hiding.

Gardrak put his finger to his mouth and whistled.

As the sound magic Ferry was cast, sounds like hundreds of birds chirping flew up into the forest canopy.

Shortly after, one man revealed himself from behind a tree.

"Where did you come from? I haven't received any reports today."

He was a man with a cold impression.

He had blue hair with upturned eyes and had shaved the left side of his head. His right hair, reaching down to his shoulders, covered one eye.

Gardrak pointed to Sirone and said.

"We came from the 1st Command. You must have heard the rumors, this boy here is..."

"Ah, I see."

The man raised his hand and cast magic.

Forest magic Oprica.

The trees behind shook rustling, and countless tree vines began flying toward Sirone's group, showing rapid growth speed.

"Kugh!"

While the frightened Clove and Gardrak lost their balance and fell on their bottoms, Sirone and Flu didn't move.

The trajectory of the incoming attack wasn't aimed at them.

Perhaps anyone could have figured this out if they had maintained just a little more composure.

The vines struck and embedded into the ground with thudding sounds, then grew in arches from those spots.

In an instant, Sirone's group was trapped in a prison woven with arch-patterned trees.

'This is ancient plant magic.'

According to the afterimage from fighting Boson in Kazra, even a certified 4th-grade mage couldn't produce such rapid growth effects.

That didn't mean he thought that man was stronger than Boson, but the advantages of ancient magic using jeong affinity seemed definite.

'Anyway, this won't be easy.'

The fact that groups who showed force from the first meeting rarely had proper negotiations bothered him.

The gatekeeper cast Oprica anew, bringing other branches to aim at the group.

"What business do traitors to Nor have with us?"

Clove grabbed the prison and shouted.

"What are you doing? Do you know who this person is? The Light of Zone 73, Sirone!"

The more hostile the relationship, the more active intelligence warfare becomes.

The gatekeeper also knew that Sirone had returned.

"So what?"

"So what? Aren't you going to fight the war? Don't you know how much the rebels' morale would rise with Sirone here?"

A spear-like sharp branch penetrated through the prison gaps and stopped in front of Clove's nose bridge.

"Kuk!"

Clove, who hastily retreated, hit his back against the opposite prison wall.

Oprica was magic that couldn't be cast without affinity exceeding 10 percent.

With only 7 percent affinity, he couldn't offer any resistance to the man's power.

"What does the Light of Zone 73 matter? When did you criticize and condemn Nor, and now you want to fight together? We don't need the power of those Mecha bastards. How can we fight angels with guys who merely depend on machines?"

"How do you know that?"

Sirone said.

"We came to meet your commander, not you. I don't think you have the authority to decide something that stakes the fate of the entire Nor tribe."

The man turned his gaze to Sirone.

He had heard Sirone's heroic tales until his ears were calloused, but the Nor tribe, which had absolute standards of power, wasn't simply bewitched by myths alone.

If he thought that merely defeating fairy captain Igirin would work here too, the Light of Zone 73 was either quite stupid or just a brat intoxicated with his own power.

"That might be so. But I have authority as a gatekeeper. Whether Nephilim or Light of Zone 73, what's important in war is power. I don't know how it was in Mecha, but whining while trapped in a wooden prison won't make Nor people even snort."

"Really?"

Sirone pressed his palm against the prison with a thud.

As light began concentrating in his hand, the gatekeeper hastily retreated.

According to what he had heard, Sirone could freely manipulate light regardless of affinity and could destroy objects with it.

"Hmph! Even so...!"

The gatekeeper was also a practitioner of ancient magic entrusted with the important mission of guarding the path to the rebel command.

Drawing in all the surrounding vegetation, he twisted vines to make them sharp like spears and prepared to counterattack.

'What is this?'

But the situation for counterattack never came.

The light gathered in Sirone's hand gradually turned dark, and the wooden vines began twisting grotesquely.

Dark Sphere.

The gatekeeper could only drop his hands and stare blankly at the sight of thick trees twisting.

Crack! Crackle!

Making sounds like bones being crushed, the hemispherical prison that had been tangled together was torn from the ground.
