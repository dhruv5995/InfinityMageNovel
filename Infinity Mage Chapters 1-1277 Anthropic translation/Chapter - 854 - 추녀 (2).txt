The Ugly Woman (2)

Anchal couldn't hide his emotions.

"I know it's unreasonable. But what other method do we have besides this? Maybe... we might be able to turn things around."

It was their first hope.

'There's definitely a chance of winning. If we close the spirit realm... the army of hell will just be large in numbers.'

Sirone fell into thought.

'An absolutely unforgivable act. This will make the demons even stronger. But this time...'

He would be trapped in Seong-eum's mind forever.

"Sirone, this is different from what you chose in Kashan's capital. This will seal the demons forever. Send the princess away. You have your own fight." If they couldn't strike the Gustav Empire, they couldn't make the demons in the central continent retreat.

'Amy.'

The families in Tormia would die.

"I'm going to Seong-eum."

How could he accept this?

"You've all lost your reason. It's not just dying - you'll be trapped in hell forever. Could you do it?"

"Yes! I've lost my reason!"

Anchal shouted.

"Being calm in this situation would be the crazy thing! Not everyone is as strong as you. You're the crazy one! We're the normal ones!"

Was that really true?

Facing the crisis of someone you love, turning away from your family's death to save Seong-eum - was that crazy?

Anchal grabbed Sirone by the collar.

"Stay still. Just... don't think about anything. It'll be over soon. After it's over, you can think about it then."

"Let go."

Sirone's eyes turned cold.

"Unless you want to see what real madness looks like."

Anchal's shoulders flinched at the throat-cutting murderous intent, and he released the collar.

"...Do you really have to go?" Murderous intent began rising from Anchal as well.

"I'm going."

"It's because of you that we'll be destroyed. Because of you, all of humanity will suffer. Because of you, all because of you!"

He couldn't argue back.

'Seong-eum's choice is the strongest move. Certainly, I can't produce better results than her.'

Practicing ultimate love.

'Such beautiful words indeed.'

Everyone dreams of such a world, but in the end, what returns to Sirone is the condemnation of all humanity.

'Nane.'

Ironically, the person who came to mind at this crossroads with not a single ally was Nane.

'What would you have done?'

He seemed to hear Nane's answer.

'Yes, what's right is me. But...' Tears flowed down Sirone's cheeks as he raised his head.

'You can never be wrong.'

It wasn't about being wrong.

Wasn't it about protecting this world to the end, not because it was right, but because it wasn't wrong?

"Get a grip, Anchal."

Sirone said through gritted teeth.

"What more explanation do you want? Whatever philosophy, whatever beliefs, whatever emotions I put forward..."

The murderous intent disappeared.

"Saving Seong-eum is right."

"I'll kill you."

Anchal removed his eyepatch and opened his demon eye.

"For the Jincheon Empire, I'll... you..." Anchal's throat seized up and he stopped speaking.

Red blood trickled down beneath the demon eye that was emitting an eerie light.

"Save her..."

The voice squeezed out like it was being wrung.

"Save her, our poor young lady..."

What should be done at the crossroads - everyone actually knew.

Anchal fell to his knees and wailed.

"Save the young lady. Please..." The moment the words fell, Sirone's body transformed into a flash of light and flew to the great hall.

"Opening amplifier number 12! Space-time interceptor Gwangcheonseong has completed preparation for operation!"

A black pillar shaped like a coffin placed in the great hall.

Wires connected in all directions, and blue electricity crackled on the walls.

When the door of the pillar named Gwangcheonseong opened, a space barely big enough for one person appeared.

All of Jincheon's officials were at their posts, but none could meet Seong-eum's eyes.

"Father."

Only Jincheon's emperor, Jin-gang, was looking down at his daughter who had chosen eternal damnation.

"You must win."

Sitting crookedly with his head leaning, Jin-gang said nothing.

'Let's not be afraid.'

Since everyone knew the horrible outcome, Seong-eum also moved coldly without leaving any more affection.

When she entered Gwangcheonseong, the door closed with a clang.

When Seong-eum fully opens Immortal Function, Gwangcheonseong will precisely control the space of the entire planet.

In that state, they would close the spirit realm and make the distance between Gustav and Jincheon Empire, separated by sea, zero.

Thus, the strategy was for Jincheon's forces to launch a surprise attack on Gustav's capital through land.

"The princess has opened Immortal Function."

The managers of Jincheon Space Agency received signals from Gwangcheonseong and reported.

'Not even a second's hesitation.'

He was proud of his daughter, and finally emotion showed on Jin-gang's face.

"Your, Your Majesty..."

That emotion - his face twisted like a monster - was that of the most enraged person in the world.

'I'll strip the bones of every last one.'

Kill, kill, and kill again.

To his daughter who would wander in hell forever, he would keep sending the horrible corpses of demons.

"Mental levels rising! 60%! 70%!"

While reports continued, the door to the great hall burst open with a bang as Sirone entered.

"Seong-eum!"

Sirone quickly scanned the surroundings, but couldn't see Seong-eum - only the black coffin standing there.

"Damn!"

It might not be too late yet.

Just as Sirone rushed to Gwangcheonseong and placed his hand on the pillar to apply force—

"What the hell are you doing!"

Jin-gang roared.

At the same time, Jincheon's five dragon generals, lacking Seong-eum, surrounded Sirone with their respective weapons.

"Stand back. Even if it's you, we'll have no choice but to kill you."

Sirone glared at Jin-gang.

"Stop this. Please. Don't create something you'll regret for life."

Time was short so his words were brief, but the emotion contained was enormous.

"I will regret it."

Jin-gang stood up.

"I will, and Seong-eum will regret it until the moment we die. No, Seong-eum can't even die."

"That's why—"

"So what?"

Jin-gang's eyes emitted abnormal madness.

"What does regret matter? Just accept it. I will, my daughter will bear it and go on!"

"You're insane."

"That doesn't matter either."

Jin-gang extended his hand.

"Drag him out."

Yeo-dal, leader of the five dragon generals, charged at Sirone swinging his weapon, the Goengjang-gon.

'There's no time.'

He had no choice but to use Time Vibration to take down Yeo-dal in the shortest distance.

Bang!

At that moment, the ceiling collapsed and Lian landed next to Sirone, twisting his waist.

"Hup!"

The great sword swept horizontally, and four of Jincheon's greatest masters simultaneously retreated.

Rumble!

At a height of 3 meters, straight lines were carved into the walls on all sides as dust rose.

He had cut through the entire great hall, but it didn't collapse due to the perfect horizontal cut.

The ceiling remained in place, and the power and precision broke the five dragon generals' fighting spirit rapidly.

'Knight of Mach.'

Sirone shouted.

"Lian!"

"I don't know what's going on, but just do it. I'll handle this."

He didn't know the details, but if it was something Sirone chose, there was no room for doubt.

"Immortal Function opening complete!" The moment a Jincheon Space Agency employee shouted, Sirone approached Gwangcheonseong and yelled.

"Seong-eum! Wait! No!"

With a hum, Gwangcheonseong's roar diminished.

The managers turned with surprised expressions, and reason momentarily returned to Jin-gang's face.

"Seong, Seong-eum..."

As Sirone called out, blue light burst from the completely sealed Gwangcheonseong.

"No!"

A Jincheon Space Agency manager shouted.

"Gwangcheonseong operation beginning! Sealing the spirit realm and connecting Gustav and Jincheon territories!"

"Young lady..."

Anchal, who arrived late, fell to his knees, and the five dragon generals also bowed their heads solemnly.

"We won't forget the princess's sacrifice."

Lian shouted.

"Sirone! Is it over?"

Of course not.

"I'll be back!"

Once Immortal Function is fully opened, one can never return to reality, but...

'I can't let her go like this!'

Sirone was an infinite mage.

Yahweh's light spread brilliantly as Sirone's mind expanded into the infinite realm.

The feeling of information intertwining was tremendously vast, but Sirone didn't lose track of Seong-eum.

'There!'

Since they were in mental form, there was no standard to distinguish friend from foe.

But expressing it in Sirone's feelings, he was certain he had grasped Seong-eum's hand heading toward the other world.

"Don't go."

At the entrance where hell's flames blazed, Seong-eum slowly turned around.

"You came, Sirone. That's just like you."

"There's no need for this. No matter how hellish the world becomes, someone becoming like this is wrong."

Seong-eum shook her head.

"It's already too late. I'm not an infinite mage. And... I have no intention of returning."

"I won't let go."

Sirone gripped Seong-eum's hand even tighter.

"I'll definitely take you back."

Though it was just a feeling occurring at the mental level, Seong-eum seemed to smile.

"You, Nane, and me."

The three competitors who had the highest Kar.

"We each had admirable beliefs. But Sirone, I believe that persistence isn't everything."

Sirone's mind trembled.

"What are you saying? Don't do this. Let's go back first. We can talk after we return."

He felt like he was holding Seong-eum's hand, but he wasn't actually grasping anything.

"I hope you won't hate Nane too much. Both you and he understand the world better than anyone."

"Alright. I'll do that if you come back. If I let you go like this, the people remaining won't be able to live."

"That's not true."

As long as hell couldn't be eliminated, Buddha and Yahweh would be in eternal opposition.

"I once thought it would be nice if the three of us could drink tea and chat together..."

Seong-eum's mind began to fade.

"...I thought that would be nice." Sirone desperately tried to hold on.

"Wait. Please."

She, fragmented so finely that she couldn't be broken down further, slipped away from Sirone's mind.

"Nooo!"

Seong-eum's last words were heard.

I respect you, Sirone.

Her purity in failing to convey her true feelings to the end made him even angrier.

Sensing Seong-eum falling into hell, Sirone concentrated all his reason into one point.

"Aaaaah!"

Sirone, coming to his senses in the infinite realm, grimaced and bent over.

"Aaaaah! Aaaaah!"

Rage.

Uncontrollable rage exploded, and Yahweh's light surrounding Sirone began to burn black.

"Th, that's..."

Anchal's face turned pale.

'Yahweh's avatar is disappearing.'

Clearly human emotions - tremendous rage above all - was everything that comprised Sirone.

"...The spirit realm?" It was a low voice, but the Jincheon Space Agency manager was dizzy with fear.

"It's, it's closing."

"Let's go, Lian."

Lian shouldered his great sword and asked.

"Where to?"

"Gustav."

Sirone's eyes glared menacingly ahead.

"I'll kill them all."

The cold mage who had lost his universal love - his words froze the air in the hall.

The moment everyone felt that cold energy, one image came to all their minds.

'Monster.'

Contrary to expectations, he wasn't violent.

'He's waiting.'

He was simply smiling coldly at the world, as if pleased that the prison door had opened.
