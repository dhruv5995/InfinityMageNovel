Raid Control (1)

Little Witch, a ranker from the Western Nation.

Sirone knew of her too, having steadily checked the rankers while leveling up.

'If she knows me... that means we've met somehow in reality.'

Little Witch turned her eerie eyes to examine the friends behind Sirone.

'What, what's this?'

Little Witch was familiar to Destruction God 707's party as well, but the moment their eyes met, they felt chills.

'She's just a machine, but something feels strange.'

Sirone was also sensing the odd atmosphere emanating from Little Witch.

'I understand now.'

It was Mitochondrial Eve.

Having reached the박지 realm in High Gear, Sirone could read the consciousness contained within matter.

'And if that's the case... it means Uorin is also understanding the real world based on this world.'

"Everyone... please step out for a moment."

Destruction God 707 looked puzzled, but Sirone didn't take his eyes off Little Witch.

"Fermi, you too."

When Olga's son shrugged and left the room, Destruction God 707 followed without complaint.

The door closed, and Sirone asked.

"You..."

Little Witch brought her hand to her lips.

"There's no need to talk about reality. All our actions and conversations become logs."

The designers could technically check everything that happened in High Gear.

'The only thing they can't check is the mind.'

Because the quantum world cannot be observed.

"Fine. Why are you here? You're with the Ascension Guild, aren't you? This is the Eastern Nation's hideout."

"I requested it. I wanted to meet you. Are you planning to take down the Operator?"

Little Witch smiled dryly.

"Haha. That girl was paying incredible attention to you, you know? But it'll be difficult. Even if she acts like a teenage girl, she's definitely the strongest within High Gear."

"So, what do you want to say?"

"Should I help you?"

Sirone read madness in Little Witch.

"You're saying you'll betray the Operator?"

"What hurtful words. I may use people, but I don't betray them."

Thinking about the difference between the two, Sirone realized there was no need and shook his head.

'Kashan's Empress, Uorin.'

The moment he tried to define her with something, she would exploit that gap to dominate his mind.

"Then how are you planning to help? Even you can't beat the Operator here."

"Hehe, still so naive."

Though that's why I like you.

"You should know who I am. The Operator probably suspects too. Just as you have special senses, I also have a secret weapon."

"Secret weapon?"

Little Witch pointed at Sirone like a gun.

"Real-world murder."

"Should I tell you who the Operator is? I guarantee you'll never find her. Even dream walkers can't track down to the Under Coder's floor. But I can."

History Search.

"Even now, if you say the word, I'll help. We can drag the Operator over and excavate Apocalypse, right?"

'That bastard Fermi...'

He didn't know how far they'd exchanged information, but it was obvious both sides were satisfied with the negotiation.

Since he was in the same kind of relationship anyway, he had no complaints, but it was unsettling that his counterpart was Uorin.

"What kind of deal did you make?"

Little Witch blinked for a long time before opening her mouth.

"I don't really know much. The situation with Apocalypse, and in return I..."

"Not that."

Sirone cut her off.

"What deal did you make with Havitz?"

Silence flowed.

"You disappeared in Kashan. You probably met him, and there must have been some kind of transaction. Otherwise, it would be very strange for you to be alive."

"Outside affairs don't seem like something to discuss here. You have things you don't want to reveal too."

"Of course. But from the moment you mentioned real-world murder, such things don't matter. I need to hear what happened with Havitz. It's related to the holy war, isn't it?"

"You can just ask."

Little Witch's voice became tinged with sadness.

"Come directly... come to Kashan and ask me. Do you think I wouldn't tell you? Why? Now that you know what Mitochondrial Eve is, do you not even want to see my face?"

'Why is that?'

Yahweh wasn't narrow-minded, but it was true that his heart hadn't moved since learning everything through Omega.

Little Witch said:

"Let me be clear - I didn't ruin everything. I did my best. Don't blame everything on me."

Little Witch still had no expression, but to Sirone, it seemed as if she was crying.

She placed a card on the table.

"It's a pass to the Western Nation's raid hunting grounds. Olga's son said you'd need it."

That was the deal.

"And I'll say it again - I won't discuss anything with you here. If you want to hear it, come to Kashan. That's the only condition."

As Little Witch left, Sirone checked the card she'd left behind.

'Western Nation Free Pass.'

Shortly after, Olga's son entered.

"Did your talk go well?"

Since there was no need to report to Fermi, Sirone didn't tell him anything.

Fermi shrugged and approached.

"Well, fine. Anyway, you got it. With that, you can obtain two of the four legendary items. Of course, you'd need to be very lucky or use some tricks."

"What is this?"

"Exactly what it says - a pass. The countless hunting grounds in High Gear are monopolized by specific guilds. They issue passes and sell them to users from other nations. Especially a Free Pass lets you enter all hunting grounds occupied by the Western Nation."

Sirone pocketed the Western Nation Free Pass.

"But friction with users will be unavoidable, right? I'm from the Eastern Nation. Are you telling me to party with them?"

"Can't help it. There are three things you absolutely need to beat the Operator: skill, level, and equipment. Setting aside skill for now, we can help with level in our guild. But there's still a 183-level difference. Especially from level 300 onwards, even a 1-level difference is significant."

"So I need to make up that difference with equipment."

"Right. There are four pieces of equipment absolutely necessary to face the Operator: Energy Gun Michelan, Heavy Armor Raphael, Metal Wings Da Vinci, and Liquid Eye Donatello. They're called the four legendary items, and equipping them should reduce the gap somewhat."

Sirone understood.

"What do I need to find in the Western Nation?"

"Michelan and Donatello. The Western Nation probably won't like it, but that's why you need to go now. 'Mythic' grade raids adjust their difficulty based on the average level of users. Of course, however they adjust it, it's hellishly difficult."

"What does difficulty adjustment mean?"

"It means going to a hunting ground isolated from the outside like Mid Gear. Once you enter, even other members of the Ascension Guild can't get in. Though I can't take responsibility for what happens inside."

"Got it."

Sirone stood up.

"What about Destruction God 707?"

"He'll be helpful for the Golden Ring. We need to get him to at least Magnan level to be useful in the solar war, so we'll handle that. You focus on finding the legendary items."

Since time was equally pressing, Sirone immediately left the room and came out to the tavern.

Destruction God 707 asked:

"Did your talk go well?"

Fortunately, he didn't seem discouraged by Little Witch's cold stare.

"Yeah. I think I need to go to the Western Nation."

After briefly summarizing his conversation with Fermi, Destruction God 707 nodded.

"Hmm, certainly an ingenious method. I think that's the only way to compete with the Operator too."

Death Princess said:

"It's so difficult the success rate is fifty-fifty. Plus, the probability of legendary items dropping is terrible, so you won't get them in one try. Still, I'll pray they definitely appear."

He could roughly guess the structure.

"Alright. Then..."

Recalling the time remaining until the solar war, Sirone followed Aegis outside.

"Taking Atogram's train would be fastest. To be faster than the train, you'd need to be at least level 200. I'll guide you."

When they reached the plaza, reporters swarmed them, but Aegis's electronic attacks prevented them from even approaching.

After buying tickets and boarding the train, people were unanimously entering Mid Gear.

"Ah."

This way, they wouldn't feel the tedium of travel.

There were users enjoying the journey using seats, but they were all from the Western Nation.

"Huh? It's Yahweh2. Didn't you board the wrong train?"

To avoid their suspicion, Sirone opened the door to Mid Gear and entered.

'Energy charging.'

Wires attached, and even with his eyes closed, blue electricity passed through his vision.

Charging complete.

The Western Nation.

Democracy, the capital of the Western Nation.

It was the first city that users who left their homeland of Atogram to choose the Western Nation would visit.

Sirone, who could now distinguish parts quite well, saw that various level tiers existed.

Most were from the Western Nation so guild marks couldn't be confirmed, but he occasionally saw users from the Eastern Nation too.

'There are more people than in Atogram.'

The rumor that 40 percent of Western Nation users gathered here didn't seem to be an exaggeration.

The scenery was half buildings, half holograms, with countless advertisements cluttering the view.

When he reached the plaza as Fermi had instructed, he saw people recruiting raid parties.

Recruiting for Gambler's Sanctuary! Only level 280 and above please apply!

Going to Bullet Valley. Need 3 more. Preference for those with Aegis option activated.

The streets were actually quiet, but wide-area communications rang loudly in Sirone's ears.

'Dizzy.'

Only after adjusting the frequency did silence arrive, and he entered 'Ergos' using the filtering function.

Waiting for those who want to attempt Ergos. Low levels welcome. Please communicate with codename Mafia.

He heard several more people's voices after that, but Sirone responded to the first information that arrived.

When he requested communication, a man answered.

Yes. Are you going to do it?

For now, yes. But since it's my first time, could I start while learning?

Hmm, what level are you?

Level 100. I'm equipped with Suicide Speed Machine parts. All selective options are open.

His effort to not seem like a beginner worked, as Mafia responded positively.

Let's see first. Where are you?

I'm... under the clock tower.

We'll come to you.

After waiting about a minute, a group of people walked through the crowd from the east side of the plaza.

'Codename Mafia.'

There were other codenames visible too, but since they were from the Western Nation, detailed information couldn't be confirmed.

"Huh? Eastern Nation?"

Mafia's party, realizing the same fact, stopped walking.

"Wait, that's... isn't that Yahweh2? You guys, didn't you check the forums? There was chaos yesterday."

"Don't know. I was hunting all day. What happened?"

"That guy's from the Golden Ring."

A man using the codename Dex Emotion approached Sirone.

"Hey, didn't you board the wrong train? Why are you in Democracy? You should go to the Eastern Nation."

"I came here knowing. I heard I could get Michelan by catching Ergos. Can we do it together?"

After looking at his friends, Dex Emotion burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! This guy's really weird. Stupid, how can the Eastern and Western Nations hunt together? Hostile action penalties don't even apply - you think we won't stab you in the back?"

"That's why I'm asking. Let's do it together."

Looking dumbfounded, he tapped his silver metal head and said:

"Just go. What nonsense are you talking? If we go with you, they won't even issue us passes."

"I have a pass."

"Huh?"

Sirone pulled out a card.

"Here."

Leaning forward to carefully examine the card, information appeared in Dex Emotion's AI.

Western Nation Free Pass. Ascension Guild Approved.

As if his operation had stopped, he didn't move for quite a while.
