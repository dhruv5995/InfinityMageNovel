The Age of History (1)

Through the stargate installed on Zephyr, Ikael and Ashur arrived at the seventh planet.

Blue skies no different from heaven, but everything was smaller.

Looking down at Mount Toa from the sky above Galiant Island, dark-skinned natives with solid muscles, shorter than heaven's Kergo, were fighting fiercely.

"Step back, you indulgent heretics! We are priests who follow God's command!"

Most of the angel faction were emaciated with unfocused eyes, while the anti-angel faction had sharp gazes like wild beasts and strong bodies.

"Foolish ones! We cannot entrust the future to you who chew hallucinogens while the tribespeople starve! Now we shall rule!"

Ikael rested her chin on her hand.

"Hmm."

Ankera received no material compensation from her subjects.

However, sacrifice was important in confirming the faith of humans on distant planets.

The angel faction held massive sacrificial ceremonies every year and sought to feel God through their bodies via Luphra, a hallucinogenic drug.

'Aren't they truly fine humans?'

Just believe in God.

Then Ankera would guide them to heaven and grant eternal life.

But the anti-angel faction prioritized living.

They warned of Luphra's addictive nature and said the money spent on sacrifices should be used for starving tribespeople.

"Utterly arrogant creatures."

Ikael's cold-eyed expression was unmistakably that of God's messenger.

Ataraxia unfolded, and the halo covering the sky amplified her voice.

"Humans, listen!"

At the thunderous sound like the sky itself crying out, everyone looked up.

"Th-that's..."

Even the angel faction, who lived with God in their hearts, couldn't distinguish whether the scene before their eyes was hallucination or reality.

But it didn't matter.

"God's messenger, God's messenger has come!"

The angel faction prostrated themselves flat.

"Indulgent heretics are persecuting us! Please look down upon us with mercy!"

The anti-angel faction, about to ruin their nearly won battle, grimaced.

"Damn! An angel?"

Since Kergo came from heaven, there were legends about Ankera.

But only Nephilim could pass through heaven's gates, and this was the first time an angel had appeared.

Ikael continued speaking.

"Stop fighting immediately and repent. Otherwise, God will punish you."

The angel faction jumped up and raised both arms toward the anti-angel faction, screaming triumphantly.

"Uwaaaa! Uwaaaa!"

How joyful must they be?

This was a situation where the God they had believed in, even giving up their lives, had responded.

"Punishment?"

The leader of the anti-angel faction twisted his face menacingly.

"What have we done so wrong! Is living a sin! Is wanting to protect our families a sin!"

"It is a sin."

Ikael was resolute.

"Stop spouting nonsense!"

The anti-angel faction leader threw his spear, but Ikael was too high up.

"You show not even your nose when tribespeople starve, and now you come saying we've sinned? My wife killed herself from Luphra overdose! My colleague's child died! Is that God's will!"

"It is."

Ankera merely maintained the system so humans could use the world.

"How could you understand God's profound will?"

What sacrifices heaven made to regain its current stability, how dangerous humans who deny God are.

They do not know.

"Those who deny God cannot exist in this world. But those who follow God shall gain eternal life."

"Screw eternal life!"

A bearded, muscular middle-aged man shed tears.

"Who said they wanted to live forever! Bring back my son, bring back my son! I can die right now, so my son... *sob*!"

Ashur, looking back at the silent Ikael, noticed her fists trembling.

The muscular middle-aged man pleaded sorrowfully.

"Please just save our son. Why must that young child die? Whatever punishment there is, just give it to me. Why our son..."

Ikael's eyelids trembled, and the massive Ataraxia flickered as if about to disappear.

'Why?'

She couldn't endure it.

'Why does it hurt so much?'

From within the archangel's chest, which no one had ever been able to wound, pain seemingly transcending the universe was surging.

"Lady Ikael."

The moment Ashur spoke with worry.

"Shut up."

Ikael bit her lip and spoke.

Even her quiet voice shook heaven and earth, and her eyes were filled with inexplicable rage.

"Everything is God's will."

She hated herself for only being able to say such words, as if they were programmed into her.

"God's will?"

The anti-angel faction leader shouted.

"What exactly is God's will? He's great, isn't he! Omniscient and omnipotent, isn't he! He can give us eternal life too, can't he!"

Hot tears flowed from the leader's eyes.

"We've lost our loved ones! Our hearts hurt so much! We're going crazy! Yet how heartless must this God you speak of be!"

All the anti-angel faction rose with their weapons.

"Can't he spare us even a single tear, not one bit of compassion!"

The moment their hearts were conveyed, Ikael's upper body jerked back as if struck by a cannon.

"Gasp!"

Ataraxia shattered, and the returning holy light body vibrated terrifyingly.

'What is this?'

The wound in the deepest part of her mind itched.

She wanted to scratch until it bled, dig out the flesh and scrape the bone to reach it.

'No!'

Ikael gritted her teeth.

'I am a noble archangel.'

The moment Ataraxia expanded again, Galiant Island shook.

As Ataraxia amplified volcanic activity 20,000-fold, tremendous lava exploded from Mount Toa's crater.

"Oh! God!"

The angel faction, out of their minds from hallucinations, praised the sky, while the anti-angel faction was thrown into panic.

Ashur had no time to discern Ikael's true intentions and evacuated the angel faction using Signal's ability.

'Either way, it's the mission.'

Everything was covered in hot lava, and volcanic ash fell from the sky like heavy snow.

It was easy work.

But tears wouldn't stop flowing from Ikael's eyes as she returned after punishing the humans.

'*sob* *sob*!'

It was always like this, but this time was severe.

'It hurts. It hurts too much to bear.'

Only Ankera's cold eyes could ease her pain.

'Oh, God. What terrible sin have I committed? What terrible sin must it be for you to inflict such pain upon me?'

Ankera's voice did not return.

250 years later, a human came to Galiant Island, covered in volcanic ash.

With steel-made hair and towering height, he introduced himself as human.

"Maclean Guffin?"

The Kergo were wary, but after seeing the Nephilim's abilities, their attitude completely changed.

After God's punishment, the angel faction's status soared to the heavens.

Guffin looked around at the civilization still not restored.

"Terrible."

This was Ikael's power.

"My wife gets scary when she's angry."

Not understanding Guffin's words, the young chief Kang knelt.

"God's messenger, I await your command."

At that point, Sirone felt strange.

'That person is the future Cadum.'

The appearance of a character actually seen within Omega meant they were getting closer to the present.

"The volcanic eruption was long ago, yet it remains backward. Poor."

At Guffin's words, Kang, who had been following behind, bowed his head.

"What does it matter? We only praise God's greatness. Everything is God's will."

"...Right."

After a long silence, having circled the island once, he turned around.

"Gather people. Time to get to work."

"Pardon?"

Kang blinked.

"We're restoring this place. You have to live somehow, don't you?"

Guffin dug into the ground and found old ruins buried in volcanic ash.

Every 10 meters forward, human bones appeared, and the natives quietly offered prayers to God.

'Found it.'

In the deepest part of the ruins, a red orb emitting its own light was glowing.

"What's that?"

"A coordinate recorder."

It was probably material from the stargate the natives used when they first came here.

"A signal body that tells this location's coordinates from outer space, you could say."

As long as this signal body was here, heaven's army could invade at any time.

'This must be the last one.'

The number of signal bodies Guffin had found on this planet so far was 73.

As light emanated from Guffin's body, the Kergo knelt and bowed their heads.

"Oh, Ankera! Please look down upon us!"

As Miracle Stream activated, the earth disappeared and a massive space was instantly created.

"I-incredible!"

"I will create a door here."

Kang asked with emotion.

"By door, do you mean the gate to heaven that was lost in the volcanic eruption?"

"Yes."

Guffin's reason for rebuilding the door wasn't for exchange with heaven, but to create a shield.

By collecting heaven's coordinates in reverse, creating a dimensional wall that couldn't be penetrated by any means.

The Miracle Stream that devoured the signal body caused matter conversion and became a massive stone gate.

Later, it would be Guffin's Gate.

'73 gates I installed on the planet. Enough to create a dimensional wall.'

Kang asked.

"God's messenger, then can we now go to heaven too?"

"Opening this door requires the Key of Infinity. Remember this. The door inscribed with Guffin's name must not be damaged."

"I will engrave it in steel."

Since the human called Ozentra appeared, Ankera's wariness toward humans reached its peak.

'The heaven expansion project must be considered a failure.'

According to Guffin's investigation, countless humans had disappeared from the universe, and this place's turn would come soon.

'It starts here.'

Leaving Galiant, Guffin looked down at the surface from a height where the planet's diameter fit in his view.

Small, but warm.

It was the perfect starting point to carry on his and Ikael's hearts.

"Humans, Omega's end is not far off."

As Guffin raised both hands, all of Guffin's Gates across the planet activated.

"Become strong."

Pillars of light shot up from across the continents.

"Pursue righteousness. Don't repeat. Remember that everyone has a heart."

The pillars of light gathered in Guffin's hands, and he clenched his fist.

*Pop* - space rippled and an intangible energy enveloping the entire planet spread out.

It was a dimensional wall.

'I can't rely on this forever.'

To finish the last task before leaving, Guffin descended to the human world again.

In Omega's flow, Sirone discovered a place his five senses recognized familiarly.

'The Kingdom of Tormia.'

It was Creas City, where his alma mater Alpeas Magic School was located.

"H-how could you come without notice!"

The Creas Magic Association branch manager came running frantically.

The world's greatest wizard, Maclean Guffin, had come - even bringing all staff wouldn't be enough.

"No need for a fuss. I have business I want to handle quietly."

"Yes, of course!"

Even a king would bow his head.

Guffin sat on the sofa and sipped coffee.

"I stopped by the cathedral a few days ago and heard an interesting story. There's a magic school student with amazing talent, they said."

The branch manager, thinking of the Three Emperors, Seven Star Kings, Two Monarchs - the pinnacle of power, quickly found the desired answer.

"Ah, you mean Alpeas Magic School. Yes, this time there was someone who passed the 7th level of the survival test for the first time in school history."

Guffin put down his coffee cup and said.

"Could I... see that child? Preferably without anyone knowing."

Two days later, at a shabby inn where no one knew Guffin was staying, there was a knock at the door.

Guffin, who had been looking out the window, closed the curtains and turned around.

"Come in."

A small muttering sound came from outside the door.

"It's not even our first meeting, but he's speaking informally. How annoying."

It probably wasn't meant to be heard, but it couldn't fool Guffin's ears.

He chuckled as the door opened.

"Excuse me. I heard a very high-ranking person here was looking for me... Huh?"

A young woman still with girlish features blinked at Guffin's non-human appearance.

"Miro of the Adrias family?"

"Yes, that's right, but..."

Guffin's first impression of Miro at that time was conveyed through Sirone's sixth sense.

Still a greenhorn.
