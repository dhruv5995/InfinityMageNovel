[612] The Hottest Place (1)

Once application submissions ended at noon, association guides went around to each room where students were waiting to announce the next schedule.

"You'll have lunch until 2 o'clock and then tour the association museum. The cafeteria is prepared in the first-floor annex, so all students please move there promptly."

"Is it free time until 2 o'clock?"

"Yes. You may rest or look around the building. However, if you cause any disturbance, you may be punished according to association regulations, and going outside is prohibited."

Being able to move around freely was quite generous treatment, but there wouldn't be anyone who would act recklessly anyway.

"Let's just eat first. I'm hungry."

While Iruki and Nade were moving to the cafeteria following the procession, Shirone said:

"You guys go eat first. I have somewhere to go for a bit."

Since Shirone had stayed at the association for over two months, there would be quite a few people he should greet.

"Alright then. See you later."

Shirone went against the flow of students and headed to the desk in the center of the third-floor corridor.

"Shirone, it's been a while."

An association staff member greeted him warmly.

"Hello. Have you been well?"

"Hehe, association work is always the same. Make sure you pass this time."

Students heading to the cafeteria glanced over with surprised expressions at the sight of him chatting casually with the staff.

Though it was due to instructions from Gaold, who was the association president at the time, staying at the association for several months as an outsider was certainly a special experience.

"I have to do my best. By the way, where is Senior Flu?"

"The manager? She's probably resting in the staff dormitory. She worked incredibly hard for two days."

The people who really suffered from this inspection ceremony were actually the staff rather than the students.

"Go on. The manager talked about you a lot too."

"Yes. I'll see you later then."

Shirone bowed in greeting and turned toward the staff dormitory.

'She's definitely there.'

"Ah, I'm tired."

Flu, who had entered the dormitory she used whenever working night shifts, took off her uniform with a relaxed expression.

She had barely had time to sleep for a week while cooperating with other departments to thoroughly check security devices throughout the entire association.

'I need to get some sleep.'

After changing into a comfortable top, she pulled down her skirt as if shedding skin and went to the closet.

"My pants..."

She opened the closet and took out pants, bending her waist to put one leg in when the door burst open.

"Senior! I'm here!"

"Oh. Oh."

Startled, Flu's balance wavered and she hopped on one leg before falling sideways.

"......"

While Shirone clenched his fist and held back laughter, Flu glared with fierce eyes as she got up.

"Hey! Do you want to die? Coming in without knocking while I'm changing clothes?"

"Ah, I'll turn around."

"Forget it. Acting mannerly after you've already seen everything."

"I'm sorry. I didn't think about it. I was just so happy to see you..."

Flu understood that feeling at least.

"Well, it has been a while. You finished preparing for the exam properly, right?"

As expected, the first question was about the graduation exam.

"Yes. I trained under Miro during the vacation. My condition is fine."

Though Flu left for the association right after returning from heaven, she had heard many things through her own channels.

"I see. I heard you gave up on the evaluation. I think that's right too."

Though it wasn't revealed on the surface, the Heaven Project had affected the entire world.

"How are you, Senior Flu? After we parted like that before... I was very worried."

Since she had been a member of Gaold's personal guard, she would have looked bad in Lufist's eyes.

"I'm fine. Though there was friction with the former association president, the current association president only makes personnel decisions based on ability. Thanks to that, Ms. Isabel was also reinstated."

He had heard about what sacrifices Isabel, the head librarian of the magic library, had made for Gaold.

"That's really fortunate."

"That's fine for us, but the problem is you. Tell me honestly. Are you really confident about this graduation exam?"

Shirone shook his head.

"I'm not sure yet. I heard a strategy from Miro, but whether it's feasible..."

Considering Shirone's situation, there weren't many organizations that would embrace him just for passing the graduation exam.

'It needs to be at least association level.'

Having made her decision, Flu said:

"It's lunch time now, right? Follow me. Let's go to the fourth floor."

"The fourth floor? Why there all of a sudden?"

"There's someone I want to introduce you to."

Following Flu to the fourth floor, Shirone entered an office with a sign reading "Mage Personnel Management Department."

With the graduation exam just around the corner, they passed through staff frantically sorting documents and entered a conference room at the end of the office.

"Haven't you eaten yet?"

Three people were sitting at the end of a rectangular table reviewing documents.

Shirone glanced over and saw profiles of Alpheas Magic School students and application forms that had just been filled out.

The man sitting at the head was black-haired with a cynical impression that revealed his pessimistic personality, a woman with long eyelashes and a calm impression sat on the left, and a freckled woman with brown hair tied in twin tails sat on the right.

"What? We're in a meeting right now."

The man snapped, but Flu boldly led Shirone over.

"I have a junior to introduce. Shirone, say hello. This is Evaluator Baikal, who will be attending the Alpheas Magic School graduation exam as a scout."

'Scout!'

Shirone's mind sharpened.

"Hello. I'm Arian Shirone from the graduating class of Alpheas Magic School."

Flu also introduced the women on either side.

"This is Analyst Elizabeth. And this is Recorder Lara."

Lara, who had cute freckles, smiled with her eyes and waved her hand.

"Hi? This is our first time meeting, but I've seen you a lot in documents."

Baikal showed his displeasure when a graduation exam participant entered.

"What are you doing right now? Bringing in a graduation exam participant. It's not even lobbying."

"It is lobbying though. Please give generous evaluation scores during the exam. I'll buy you a meal."

Though Shirone's face reddened at the blatant request, Flu didn't mind and pulled out a chair to sit.

"Mr. Baikal is a certified 4th-class mage. He's been doing Royal Magic School scouting work for over ten years, and I was also selected by Mr. Baikal to enter the association."

'Ah, so there's that connection...'

Baikal leaned back as if embarrassed.

"I just picked the most capable student. You were the Royal valedictorian anyway."

From the short conversation, he could tell this wasn't someone lobbying would work on.

"Still, graduation ranking and scout evaluation are separate things. Anyway, since you've been assigned to Alpheas Magic School this time, it won't hurt for Shirone to make an impression too."

"Yes. Please take care of me."

When he honestly revealed his intentions, Baikal also relaxed his stern expression.

"Fine. I'll keep a special eye on you. Work hard."

Raising a scout's expectations would certainly help with evaluation, but it was a double-edged sword that would bring great disappointment if he failed to meet them.

"You said you've been in charge of Royal Magic School for over ten years, but why this time..."

At Shirone's question, Elizabeth said:

"Because it's the hottest place in Tormia this year. The competition is unprecedentedly fierce, and I heard all the students' abilities exceed the graduating class average. So the evaluator personally petitioned the association to make the change."

It was an honor not just for Shirone individually, but for the entire Alpheas Magic School graduating class.

"I decided based on documents alone. But the numbers in documents don't accurately reflect reality. I hope you won't disappoint me."

Shirone, who sat in the chair Elizabeth offered, pointed to the profile documents on the table.

"Are these one year's grades?"

"No. These are all records from enrollment to present. Since it's about the kingdom's future, we can't judge carelessly. We're trying to be as objective as possible. Have you ever watched a graduation exam?"

"Yes. Last year."

"Then you must know what scouts do too."

"Ah, that's..."

At the time, he had been absorbed in the fierce battles of the graduation exam and was also shocked by Amy's early elimination.

"It's okay. Knowing how scouts evaluate will be helpful. First, when the graduation exam starts, an analyst like me visually observes participants' detailed ability values."

Elizabeth's eyes glowed blue and a target-like symbol appeared on her retina.

"...Is that a tattoo?"

"Yes. A magical tattoo. The most important thing for an analyst is to judge students' ability values in detail. Whether the distance of teleportation's repetition compulsion is 10 meters, 10 meters 1 centimeter, or 10 meters 1 centimeter 1 millimeter."

"...Ah, yes."

Shirone was dazed at the thought that this could be confirmed with the eyes.

"All that analyzed information is immediately transmitted to the evaluator here. Then the evaluator grades students' ability values according to the situation and discretion. Judgment B grade, neural transmission speed A grade, like that. Then Lara here records the evaluations of all 30 people."

When Lara made a V sign, dozens of notebooks stacked beside her flew into the air and fluttered.

Then the same number of pens automatically moved and pretended to write something in the notebooks.

A writing ability user who could record in thirty notebooks simultaneously.

When Shirone looked on in admiration, Lara shrugged her shoulders with a pleased expression.

"Just being skilled doesn't get you a good evaluation."

Baikal offered advice for the first time.

"The personnel the nation requires are mages who can perform assigned missions 100 percent. Most students obsess over power, but from the kingdom's perspective, if one person isn't enough, they can send ten. It costs some money, but it's a replaceable figure. What we want is talent that can't be converted to numbers."

Baikal pointed to Flu.

"Flu's final evaluation in the graduation exam was overall A. Of course, if we expanded the scope to other countries, there were A-plus and S grades too. But when limited to the kingdom, Flu was indeed Tormia's best student."

"That's a compliment, right?"

Flu protested, but Baikal ignored her and continued.

"One reason I rated Flu highly was because there was no waste. She moved her consciousness toward achieving optimal efficiency in all areas - time, spirit, psychology, actions. This is far more important than casting tremendous magic or overwhelmingly defeating someone. Because it's not a factor that can be replaced by money or number of people."

"I see."

He had to acknowledge that individual achievement and what the kingdom required were different.

'I'm just one of countless mages after all.'

Baikal continued:

"If you want to get good scores in evaluation, reduce waste. Even if you're smarter than the scout, the scout can evaluate you. Because we measure results based on judgment."

Shirone realized why Flu had introduced him to Baikal.

"Thank you. This was really helpful."

Lara clapped her hands and said:

"Well, it's time, so let's go eat. We're doing this to eat anyway, right?"

Elizabeth suggested to Shirone:

"Shirone, you haven't eaten lunch either, right? Eat with us."

"No. I'll eat with my friends. It would seem like special treatment if I ate alone."

Lara looked blank then burst into laughter.

"Why, why are you doing that?"

As Shirone's face reddened, Elizabeth, who had been laughing while covering her mouth, said:

"Indeed, numbers don't reflect reality. It's so different from what I imagined from the documents."

"Um... what do you mean?"

"I mean you're pure. When you become a mage, you'll understand what real special treatment is. Now, let's go."

Following the scouts out of the conference room, Shirone ate lunch in the staff-only cafeteria.

Since he had often used this place before, his tension quickly eased and he was able to get a lot of information from Elizabeth.

Then the cafeteria door burst open and a man in uniform appeared, looked around, then came straight to Shirone.

"What are you doing here? Do you know how long I've been looking for you?"

Shirone, who was intimidated, put down his utensils and said:

"Ah, I'm sorry. I'll go back now."

As he tried to get up, the man shook his head and said:

"Not there, go to the 18th floor."

"What? The 18th floor?"

The man's voice became noticeably quieter.

"The association president wants to see you."
