[764] Lord of Destruction (3)

'These guys are truly vicious.'

The nanobodies commanded by Marduk were called 'weak force' - the cleaners of the other world where microorganisms could not exist.

'Beings that exist outside the law.'

The reason demons aren't bound by laws is because they belong to the spirit realm created by humans.

Marduk's magical power that seemed to ignore physical forces was also the power of weak force operating in the other world.

'If I hadn't blocked it with Dark Sphere...'

I would have died.

"Whooooo!"

As the Initial Bardo was released, the scenery of the other world burned away like ignited paper.

In the ruins that would have taken humans at least a month of fighting to create, Marduk stood solemnly.

"...That was an excellent judgment."

Sirone glared at Marduk, but the aftershock of 100,000 overlapping Quantum Super Positions made his mind dizzy.

'It's really difficult to surpass this point. It's better to think of this as the current available limit.'

The only way to maintain personality in an infinitely expanding mind was to drastically lower the Kar value.

'The depth of enlightenment.'

If Miro or Beron had reached Yahweh's realm, it wouldn't have been just this much.

'Why am I so shallow?'

Even plotting 100,000 events was already beyond the realm of humanity, but Sirone only felt regret.

"Only annihilation can stop destruction."

Marduk approached, letting his sword droop.

"Hahahaha! Hahahaha!"

Though the laughter was terribly unpleasant, for Sirone whose mind wasn't yet stable, it bought him time.

"This is supposed to be Yahweh?"

The moment the laughter stopped, terrifying black flames rose from Marduk's body.

"With such pathetic light..."

Marduk, who had vaporized his physical body, was suddenly in front of Sirone swinging his sword.

"No demon will ever repent."

Sirone couldn't react.

'My mind isn't...'

The reason for applying 100,000 overlaps to Dark Sphere was simply because he needed a gravitational field size of 8 meters.

'Valhalla Action!'

As events increased, control became more difficult, so the concentration of power inevitably decreased.

'Calculation impossible!'

But this was also Sirone's way of efficiency.

'Valhalla Action!'

The possibility of perfection.

If all variables could be eliminated, it was his unique trait that becoming perfect instead was the fastest and strongest method.

'Got it!'

Perhaps that's why he reached the realm of infinity.

"Haa! Haa!"

Continuously perfect, and surpassing that perfection again to reach this place, what remained for him was...

"You use interesting laws."

What indeed?

"It's certainly not human."

Marduk looked with interest at the magic circle of Valhalla Action floating above Sirone's head.

'Calculation is impossible.'

Since demons exist outside laws, Valhalla Action couldn't propose equivalent exchange either.

'Avoiding was all I could do.'

Sirone's second calculation attempt was merely avoiding the position.

'Even without abilities, he's just strong.'

What Sirone exchanged for avoiding Marduk's sword was a respite of 1.87 seconds, even with his enlightenment.

Angels who couldn't break laws and such.

Minerva's words finally made sense.

'Ataraxia, Valhalla Action. The pinnacle of laws that can be created with angelic senses, but...'

Demons were beings positioned as the antithesis of laws.

'That's why chaos.'

Marduk charged.

"What do you desire?"

It wasn't at a level that could be handled with time compression, so Sirone reactivated Valhalla Action.

"Ugh!"

The 16.7-meter distance moved while ignoring time demanded a respite of 4.3 seconds.

"Human happiness?"

Marduk seemed to be enjoying it rather, leisurely pursuing Sirone as he flew.

'I can't keep avoiding forever!'

Like compound interest, the time Sirone had to pay kept increasing each time Valhalla Action was chained.

But if he didn't avoid it right now, his neck would be severed by Marduk's sword, so he had no choice but to endlessly roll over his debt.

"You have succeeded, Yahweh."

As Marduk gathered all the weak forces of the other world, black smoke rose from his body.

"To make a demon feel sympathy."

The magical power called Great Destruction swept through, engulfing a 4-kilometer radius around where Sirone was.

There was no sound, but an area that could house a small town completely disappeared from the world.

"Graaah!"

From 4 kilometers away, Sirone crouched and couldn't take any action.

"Pain and pleasure are sensations, but..."

Marduk approached in an instant.

"Where does the delusion of happiness come from?"

Even knowing it was irreversible, Sirone cast Quantum Super Position with Valhalla Action.

Thousands of Sirones moved, but this wasn't an opponent who could be suppressed by numerical superiority.

"No matter how you struggle this way and that..."

Each time Marduk swung his sword frantically, countless events were annihilated.

"You can't find what doesn't exist, can you?"

Marduk, moving faster than time compression to catch a clone, stabbed Sirone's forehead.

'It's okay. Since this isn't the main body.'

The moment the cold sensation penetrated into his forehead, Sirone's life was cut short.

"Graaaah!"

Zet's sharp spear tip entered Corps Commander Beshum's mouth and pierced through the back of his head into the ground.

"Graaah...!"

Minerva, who had already dealt with the other three corps commanders, sat against a collapsed wall while holding Zet's staff.

"Whew."

Blood flowed from her lips, and her clothes hung like rags, revealing her bare skin.

With Zet stuck in his mouth, Beshum spoke.

"...You're strong."

Even from a demon's perspective, she couldn't be considered human.

"I'm not strong."

Minerva tore the clothes at her waist and stopped the blood flowing from her shoulder.

"I just fight well."

"..."

Beshum, who had been pondering her words, turned his gaze to watch the battle between Sirone and Marduk.

"Why don't you kill me?"

"I will kill you. When I feel like it."

"Not making excuses?"

"Excuses?"

With his jaw split open, Beshum's mouth corners tore.

"You can't beat our legion commander either. Are you planning to preserve your life by saying you've done your job?"

Minerva's eyes pierced through Marduk.

"...I won't deny it."

There was no need to risk her life unnecessarily.

"But honestly, I'm in a bad mood. Just... watching that kid."

"Yahweh is annoying."

Minerva laughed.

"Hahaha! Right. Those who should die die, and those who should live live - isn't that life? That's also a form of obsessive-compulsiveness in another sense."

"You like that guy."

Minerva looked down while resting her forehead against Zet.

"Why do you think so?"

"There are only two types who deny Yahweh. Those who hate him terribly, or those who love him terribly."

"Don't you think it's the former?"

"It's the same thing anyway."

Why do demons... hate Yahweh?

"Hehe, for a corps commander, you're quite something."

As Minerva grabbed Zet and spun it around, Beshum trembled in all his limbs in agony.

"Graaah..."

Minerva, who let go of Zet, put her pipe in her mouth.

"At first, everyone wants to be perfect."

Savoring the pain receding, Beshum turned his pupils to the sky again.

"Anyone can arrange pencils neatly. And then they think: It's beautiful."

Minerva's pipe drew pictures in the air.

"That's how the journey toward perfection begins. Building houses, adding floors - I must be happy, there must be no flaws in my life."

The drawing dissolved into smoke and collapsed.

"Then one day you suddenly realize: Can I really become perfect?"

"Humans are stupid."

"Right. Only the longing for perfection remains while the self disappears. They could just give up a little and live, but..."

Minerva looked back at Sirone.

"If you think not a single pain can exist in this world, that's definitely obsessive-compulsiveness."

The 2,458th Sirone, stabbed by Marduk's sword, met death in agony.

'It's okay. Since I'm not the main body.'

In truth, they were all Sirone.

"That's why I'm angry. Yahweh's heart that loves the whole is noble, but..."

Minerva's cigarette smoke spread out long.

"Sirone, where are you in that whole?"

Having cut down all the Sirones, Marduk finally grabbed the main body's neck and lifted him up.

"Kekeke, pathetic Yahweh."

Minerva shook her head.

"That's why you can't win."

If it's universal love that can't love oneself, that too would be arrogance about sacrifice.

"Because of your obsession with perfection, everything falls to impossible probabilities."

Sirone is strong, but he doesn't fight well.

"Taking <Law Kill> to punish extreme evil, saving the world, closing the altar, with not a single casualty..."

She liked that Sirone.

"But let it go."

Even the filth that couldn't be hidden before any saint seemed to become equal before Sirone.

"It doesn't matter if we all die today."

That's why she liked Sirone a little more than Nane.

"It's not your fault, Sirone."

But if he couldn't realize it, thinking she should hand the world over to Nane at this point, Minerva looked down at Beshum.

"May you attain paradise..."

He was already dead.

"Kahahaha! Kahahahahaha!"

Marduk, holding Sirone's lifeline with both hands full, burst into triumphant laughter.

The cruel demonic nature completely contrary to his beautiful appearance was fully revealed.

"To think I'd see Yahweh's crying face."

Hot tears flowed from the eyes of Sirone, who was on the verge of death, bound by Valhalla Action's debt.

'I'm sorry, everyone...'

He couldn't protect the world.

'Because of me... because I was weak...'

Like Jaycee losing her husband, countless people would shed tears of blood in suffering.

"Don't you have any last words? I'll record them as an indelible record in demon history."

Amy.

At the mention of last words, the first thing that came to Sirone's mind was Amy's face.

'I want to see you.'

Because she was the only person Sirone loved more.

'If only I had listened to you then...'

If only he hadn't ignored the voice in his dreams screaming not to go.

"I'll record it like this."

Marduk, having reached the limit of his patience, said.

"Yahweh couldn't even make a peep."

Sirone trembled and raised his head.

"The reason I realized universal love is..."

The reason for loving everything that exists.

"Only because I don't want a single person to disappear."

An unapproachable vibration traveled up Marduk's arm that was gripping Sirone's neck.

"Die! You abominable thing!"

Marduk put all his strength into breaking the neck, but a greater force was pushing his fingers away.

"Th-this is...!"

Sirone's body itself began to emit light, revealing a presence incomparable to Quantum Super Position.

"Yes, Sirone. If you truly want to save the world with Yahweh's light..."

Minerva, watching from afar, murmured.

"You must transcend fullness."

The ninth sense that living beings could reach - resonance - was awakening in Sirone's body.
