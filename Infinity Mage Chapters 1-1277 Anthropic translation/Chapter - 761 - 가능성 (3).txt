[761] Possibility (3)

"The laws of <Legal Kill> aren't omnipotent. Unless the target is a fool, they'll try to avoid the laws."

Minerva said.

"Cause and effect are endlessly intertwined. Axing is what twists that to the extreme. But even if there's an axing that cuts through everything, there's also an axing that blocks everything, right?"

Minerva crossed the index fingers of both hands.

"When they collide, a new law is born that overlaps those two."

<Legal Kill> doesn't force its law through, but must work in conjunction with the target's laws.

"Statistically speaking, it takes an average of four months to circle a planet once."

"Huh? That's surprisingly fast?"

Compared to having to follow the tail of causality, it was an incredibly fast trip around the world.

Minerva agreed.

"Yeah. It's quite a powerful axing. But in severe cases, it can take over a year. For example, what if the target of <Legal Kill> travels around the world without rest?"

It would become an endless game of tag.

"There was actually such a case. The target was a diplomat. What I realized then was that no matter how fast <Legal Kill>'s law is, it can't be faster than the speed of someone moving to accomplish a specific purpose. So what do you think I did?"

"You went directly."

"Correct. That's why 'reset' is important. You erase the target and then artificially design the event."

"But is that possible? Even if the owner of <Legal Kill> dies, the law has already been activated, right?"

"There's one method. It's what I call 'target change,' and using this can trigger a reset."

"Hmm."

Shirone fell into thought.

"It's quite a tricky weapon."

"That's the characteristic of S-class objects. Rather than tricky, it's so effective that there's a lot of room to maximize it. Armand is the same way, right? Anyone can become strong, but to unleash 100% of its function, you need to understand it perfectly."

Shirone understood Armand perfectly.

'And the person who can handle <Legal Kill> best in the world is only one...'

The very person who created the weapon, Miracle Minerva.

"Alright. Let's move together for now. If we need to use <Legal Kill>, please explain it to Uorin."

If it was Kashan's Empress, she would design the optimal method based on Minerva's explanation.

Meanwhile, while Shirone and Minerva were discussing <Legal Kill>, Jayce had a dazed expression.

"Is it really... possible?"

In the landscape where demons had been cleanly swept away, workers were enjoying joyful reunions with their families.

"Then why... why on earth...!"

Did my husband have to die?

"If you have such amazing abilities! Why on earth! Why didn't you save our husband!"

Hearing Jayce's voice, Shirone turned his head, and Minerva's eyes coldly narrowed.

'Possibility...'

Just by showing the possibility of saving everyone, Shirone could be called godlike.

'But he can't save everyone.'

In the end, someone would suffer, and that suffering would endlessly cycle according to the eons of reincarnation.

'This time it caught me, but...'

Minerva had become a witch.

'Tomorrow it's you.'

Whether struck by an incurable disease, natural disaster, or losing one's life in an unexpected accident.

Life for living beings was like passing around a bomb called suffering, never knowing whose turn would be next.

Therefore, watching from the end of time, this world was simply filled with nothing but suffering...

Nane was still right.

'Those who think they've drawn a good lot right now won't understand Nane, but...'

Jayce would have been the same.

'Do you know? The current Jayce...'

And Minerva.

'Finds this world so resentful.'

Jayce cried out.

"Why me! Why! Everyone else is happy, so why do I have to suffer like this!"

Shirone bit his lip.

'It's because of me.'

It was suffering that arose because he had stood against Nane, and the number of bombs would only increase in the future.

'I want to become stronger.'

No, if he could turn Nane's heart by kneeling and begging...

But knowing he couldn't do that, Shirone clenched his fists terrifyingly and steeled his resolve.

"It's not your fault."

Minerva placed her hand on Shirone's shoulder.

"It's not Nane's fault either."

Contradiction.

What would happen when an axing that cuts through everything collides with an axing that blocks everything?

The law says this:

"It's just that kind of state."

A state of contradiction.

"Just because we can't imagine it doesn't mean there's no result. This is the result. Accept it and move forward."

Minerva laid the exhausted and crying Jayce on her lap and bit her pipe.

"Sleep for a while. This will help."

As the witch's breath seeped through her lips, Jayce's pupils peacefully relaxed.

"If we leave her like this, she might make bad choices."

Minerva, who had floated Jayce in the air with magic, turned to Shirone and said.

"Let's go to the capital. We need to finish this matter."

The witch's broom Jet shook off Godan's corpse and flew in quickly.

"Want to ride together?"

Since they had to carry Jayce, the space seemed cramped.

"No. You go ahead. I'll follow."

Despite knowing that Jet was registered in world records, Minerva laughed at his words saying he'd follow.

"Alright. If you're too late, I'll handle it my way?"

As soon as Minerva leaped onto Jet, powerful gas shot out and they soared into the sky.

Following the sound of metal being cut, a sonic boom erupted, and Shirone looked back at Verdi.

She nodded as if she knew what he wanted to say, then bowed deeply again.

'Thank you.'

Shirone, who had pulled himself together from his crumbling heart, looked back at the sky and bent his knees.

Wings of Light.

As wings of light stretched out dozens of meters long, the eyes of watching people widened.

"My, my goodness..."

It was tremendous overkill just for flying, but to follow Minerva, this much was necessary.

As everyone looked up at the pair of wings soaring to the sky, light descended at a terrifying speed.

Whoooooosh!

With a roar, Shirone's body pierced through the clouds and disappeared in less than a second.

"Good heavens..."

Shortly after, another sonic boom erupted.

'She's fast indeed. I'm also flying at Mach speed.'

Every time the Wings of Light struck the air, Shirone's body was pushed forward hundreds of meters.

Only after doubling his cycle could he catch sight of the smoke created by Jet's flames in the distance.

"Oh my? You really followed?"

As if meeting an acquaintance while passing by, Minerva looked to the side and waved her hand.

It was no longer a situation where voices could be transmitted, so Shirone and Minerva conversed by reading each other's lip movements.

"Are you taking her along?"

Jayce was hanging like laundry and looked precariously close to falling.

"Don't worry. The ride is surprisingly comfortable. Jayce is..."

Minerva looked down at the rapidly flowing mountain scenery, then released Jet's law.

"We can leave her here."

Shirone hurriedly turned his head, but Jayce was already a distant dot.

"...She'll be okay, right?"

"Who do you think I am?"

Having no words to refute, Shirone turned forward as Minerva increased Jet's propulsion.

"Loser grants the winner's wish."

As Jet stretched out to 10 meters and Minerva began gradually overtaking Shirone.

"Any wish at all."

She winked and shot forward as if disappearing, making Shirone's competitive spirit boil.

"Now that's more like it..."

He didn't particularly have a wish, but he desperately wanted to avoid the situation of granting her wish.

As the Wings of Light increased in mass and struck the atmosphere with solid strength, Shirone's body shot out like a cannonball.

'There!'

The capital of North Eymond came into view.

Capital Pasia.

The Presidential Palace where the President resided was a multipurpose fortress with 780 buildings all connected.

Revolution Square was one of the world's largest artificial structures, large enough to accommodate all 3 million residents of the capital.

"Cramming in" would be a more accurate expression, but Igor believed that all citizens should directly praise him in person.

Of course, that was when Igor was human, but even now that the President had become a demon, that thought remained valid.

"Legion Commander, preparations are complete."

24th Legion Commander, Maraduk of Destruction.

He was a man beautiful enough to captivate many women's gazes, with light purple hair flowing down to his shoulders.

Golden patterns were carved along the edges of his black armor that clung to his body, and on the left side of the throne, a sword was leaning toward its master.

"How many have gathered?"

"The total number of troops that escaped from the spiritual realm is 8 million."

It was a number equivalent to dozens of times a nation's army, but considering Satan's army numbered 2 billion, it wasn't even legion-class.

"It's sufficient to strike humans."

As Maraduk, who had equipped the sword at his waist, descended the stairs, four division commanders stepped aside in unison.

Though the room had perfect soundproofing, the glass windows were vibrating from the cheers outside.

"I shall become the vanguard and destroy the world."

As soon as he opened the window, the blocked sound shot in like a cannon.

"Kill the humans! Kill the humans!"

An army of 8 million spread beyond the Presidential Palace was roaring with evil-filled cheers.

Shirone looked down at the scene of Pasia.

"...What is that?"

While most streets were empty, the area around the Presidential Palace was swarming with demons more numerous than ants.

Minerva said.

"The capital should be considered finished. Not even resistance forces are visible. The capital defense forces have probably already been annihilated."

"Aren't there any survivors?"

"There would be. But not around the Presidential Palace. If people got mixed up there, they'd be devoured immediately."

"We need to find survivors."

"That's also a good choice. But now isn't the time. If the second-generation demons from the Presidential Palace cross the border, the situation becomes complicated."

They would infiltrate society and move in secret.

"It was possible to experiment because it's a closed society, but that's also why we have an opportunity. Let's attack first."

"Attack?"

The number of forces gathered at the Presidential Palace seemed to easily exceed 5 million even by unit area calculation.

"Where will we start?"

Minerva bent her index finger.

"Right here."

As Shirone followed her gaze along her fingertip, Minerva's body floated up and separated from Jet.

"From beginning to end."

As resistance acted on Minerva's body, Jet relatively surged ahead and rushed toward the entrance of the Presidential Palace.

'Is she really doing this?'

Facing an army of 8 million with just the two of them was impossible by human common sense.

"Get ready! We're going straight in!"

Though she had separated from Jet, tremendous inertia still pulled Minerva's body toward the Presidential Palace.

Screeeeech!

At the sonic sound made by Mach speed, the demons at the entrance looked up at the sky.

"It's a surprise attack...!"

Before the words could finish, Jet crashed down, sending the second-generation demons in the area flying into the sky.

"Kraaaah!"

Remaining forces:

7,999,954 (seven million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred fifty-four).
