The Right Choice (2)

"What?"

Vulcan's crowd detection delivered an unbelievable fact.

*The vanguard's trajectory has changed.*

In an instant, they turned at a tremendous angle, and immediately a messenger came running against the march.

"Urgent report!"

It was content that didn't even need to be heard.

"Hohoho! What? You failed in the end? That's just like humans. The worst as military commanders."

Paimon's mockery couldn't be heard.

*No. This can't be.*

Following Zetaro, Smodo, and Natasha, even Vulcan was being toyed with by the enemy's strategist.

"...We're changing direction again."

Vulcan, having made up his mind, widened his eyes and spoke.

"We must not go to Bashka. Being this desperate means there's definitely something there."

Paimon was fed up with Vulcan's shamelessness.

"So what is it then?"

"I can't imagine. But in the end, we should assume there's something unimaginable there. I command the entire army! Turn the flags' direction right now... Gack!"

A dull impact exploded against the back of his head, and Vulcan's vision spun.

"Spouting nonsense."

At Paimon's voice, he twisted his body, but her claws were flying at him again.

"Urgh!"

Vulcan leaned back and swung his sword while on horseback, but his sense of distance was off.

"Hohoho! You do have one skill at least. But you'll be fine, right? It's a lethal dose of poison."

As soon as she finished speaking, Vulcan staggered.

*Damn it! Betrayal...!*

He was using Schema to control his blood flow and slow the poison's spread, but he wouldn't last long.

"Doing this to me means... you're betraying Habitz too, right?"

He squeezed out his last strength to warn her, but Paimon only sneered.

"What are you talking about? Everything is according to his will."

"What?"

As his spinal nerves became paralyzed and Vulcan collapsed on his horse, Paimon approached and lifted his head.

"Satan has grown tired of you all. He doesn't deal with toys that have lost their interest."

"Habitz..."

With only conclusions he still couldn't accept remaining, Vulcan's eyelids slowly closed.

"Hmph, pathetic weaklings."

As Paimon threw down Vulcan's head, the demons who had been full of complaints until now approached.

"Should we kill him? Or should we show him the terror of demons?"

"Hmm."

According to the messenger's report that Paimon had heard, Habitz's humanity had completely disappeared.

*That doesn't mean he's not Habitz though.*

She gave her orders.

"Imprison him for now. Having those four idiots locked up side by side will be quite a sight."

"Understood. But what about Natasha? She'll be trouble when she comes to."

Her combat power was at a level that even made demons gasp.

"Hehe, no problem."

Paimon's eyes blazed purple.

"Irregular Formula, Ban."

It was an ability that created an isolation zone in a specific space and robbed those trapped there of their mobility.

"Take him away."

As a demon picked up Vulcan and flew toward the rear, Paimon mounted Vulcan's horse.

"Whew. It's like a rotten tooth has been pulled." Everyone felt the same way.

"Lady Paimon, please lead us. We desire blood. We desire human suffering."

"Hohohoho!"

Paimon raised her hand.

"From this moment, ignore formations and such. Scatter completely! Find the shortest route and gather at Bashka!"

"Kraaaaaaah!"

The demons' roar created a thunderous sound.

"Let's go! It's a festival of blood!"

Like cockroaches on rotten food scattering at light, hell's army spread in all directions.

The Holy War's command was in uproar.

"Demons are entering Bashka! Currently confirmed forces are 3 million! No, 4.5 million..."

Iruki raised his hand to cut off the report.

*This is only the beginning.*

Now that the flower garden, Bashka's front yard, had been breached, it was only a matter of time before an army of 100 million gathered.

"Please call Lucky Boy."

The time had come.

"Understood."

Reality finally felt tangible, and the commanders left the command post with terrified expressions.

In the quiet room after people had left, Iruki focused only on closing and opening his eyes.

"Iruki."

Nade entered with a bright expression, but he couldn't muster the courage to look at him.

*Pathetic.*

He loathed himself for dragging even his friend into something that would leave a disgraceful mark on history.

"I heard the story. Hell's army is coming to Bashka. Finally, an opportunity for a comeback."

His heart trying to speak positively came through.

"I'm sorry."

Nade gently asked back.

"For what?"

"When you came to me saying you'd do this job, I stayed silent. Because it's an operation with no second chances. So I kept my mouth shut. Even knowing about your family, Liz, and what you had to protect, because of my desire to be perfect."

The Holy War had many technicians too.

But Iruki wanted to send someone he could be certain would take responsibility in any situation.

"If you had told me to go back, I would have gone back."

Iruki looked at Nade for the first time.

"I would have returned home and protected my parents and Liz. Because they're more precious to me than anything. But."

Nade put strength in his eyes and spoke.

"I would never have seen you again after that. Because that's all I would have been to you."

"Nade..."

"You weren't the only one who worried. I thought countless times on my way to the Holy War too. But the conclusion is one. If not me, you can't entrust this job to anyone else."

Iruki lowered his head.

"What if there's a defect in the device? The detonation mechanism might not work. What if there are unforeseen variables remaining? What if the carrier changes their mind? What if we're giving up early without even trying our best?"

Heavy breathing could be heard.

"But if it's me, if it's Nade, no matter what worst-case scenario strikes, we'll definitely succeed. That's what you thought, right?"

Iruki couldn't answer.

Suppressing his rising tears, he only heaved his chest as his lungs drew in breath.

"When you stayed silent, honestly I was really relieved. If you had told me to go back, I would have died of embarrassment. Hahaha!"

"Keke."

Iruki burst into laughter mixed with tears.

"Don't worry. I'll do well. You've worked hard all this time. Now leave everything to me."

With Nade's single sentence, Iruki felt thousands of tons of weight lift from him.

"Nade."

Nade, who had been heading toward the door, stopped and looked back.

"Yeah?"

"Make it succeed no matter what."

Even before this statement that pushed humanity's weight onto him, Nade smiled and gave a thumbs up.

"No problem."

Opening the door and leaving, he said:

"I'm Lucky Boy, after all."

The allied forces who had broken away from the demon flow watched the situation without letting their guard down.

*Good. They don't seem to be thinking of changing direction.*

They didn't know that Paimon had already given orders to gather at the capital.

Dante spoke.

"Wouldn't it be better to evacuate? If the operation succeeds, it won't be safe here either."

It was within the elemental bomb's range.

The fact of evacuating while leaving Bashka's citizens behind was unpleasant, but it couldn't be helped.

"Let's go."

Miro spoke as if taking responsibility.

"Everyone feels the same way. No one's going to applaud us for staying here. Let's go now."

Amy asked.

"Where are we going? If the demons advance to Bashka, don't we need to follow them in?"

Dante clicked his tongue.

*Come to think of it, she became a corps commander in this war. She doesn't know about the operation yet.*

Amy asked again.

"Why are your expressions like that? There's something I don't know, isn't there?"

In any case, they couldn't proceed with the operation while ignoring a mage who had reached the Fire Realm.

"In Bashka..."

Just as Lufist was opening his mouth, Miro felt an eerie presence and turned around.

"What's that?"

Beyond the horizon, a group of armies surrounded by light was flying toward them.

"Heaven's army."

Angels and Maras flew swiftly, with fairies carrying giants through the air following behind.

"Huh? Huh?"

As giants fell from 1 kilometer above, the allied forces felt dizzy just watching.

The giants who crashed into the dry ground with a thud, raising dust clouds, slowly raised their upper bodies.

*They're huge.*

About 8 meters in height was below average, and the really large giants approached 80 meters.

"Does it start from here?"

As Ymir moved forward while caressing his fists, the demons in the area blocked his path.

"What are you?"

Some demons knew of heaven's existence, but most here were seeing giants for the first time.

As Ymir wrinkled his eyebrows in displeasure, a demon with scythe-like arms walked over.

"Sniff sniff. What's this? Why does it smell like this? It's too different from humans. Looks stupid too."

The demon who lifted Ymir's chin with his scythe brought his face close and bulged his laugh lines.

"Keke, completely frozen. Hey, say something. Call your big brother behind you or something."

The demon thought the 80-meter giant was the leader, but in reality their faces were pale with terror.

"I've decided."

As Ymir grabbed the demon's scythe, the arm bent like taffy.

"Aaaaah! My arm! My arm!"

As the demons' eyes blazed with fury, Ymir stretched and moved forward.

"I'll have to clean up the trash first."

"Kill him!"

The moment the demons raised their respective weapons, bared their teeth, and charged:

"Heuuuup."

Ymir took a deep breath, inflating his lungs, then raised both arms above his head.

A startled Gircin reached out his hand.

"Lord Ymir! Wait...!"

Before his voice could even finish, Ymir lowered his stance and struck the ground with both arms.

The world's sound was erased.

*Is time moving slowly? Or fast?*

The allied forces watching from afar all felt as if they were drugged, thinking:

*What is that?*

The earth rose high like a tsunami, and whirlwinds appeared in the sky, mixing colors.

*I'm sleepy. I want to go home.*

Strangely, they yawned.

Their eyelids slowly closed and their vision narrowed.

"...Do it!"

Someone's voice entered their ears in a thin, earthworm-like form and they could see it coming out.

*Hehe, interesting. I can see sounds?*

Mental confusion from the shockwave.

KWAAAAAAANG!

And those who experienced that state disappeared from the world without exception the next moment.

Kiiiiiiiii!

The flash of Mass Teleport landed in an area 2 kilometers away.

"Is everyone okay?"

They had made an emergency escape with Miro's magic, but couldn't save everyone.

Also, there was no time to mourn.

"Again! Again!"

As Mass Teleport shot into the sky, tremendous seismic waves swept through that spot.

Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.

The sound of earth splitting with Ymir at the center spread in endless echoes.

"Tch, how annoying."

There were no demons left in the flower garden, and even the angels in the sky watched with disgusted expressions.

*A monster is a monster.*

The question that arose when Ymir was first born permeated all of heaven's army.

*Why is something like that... necessary in this world?*
