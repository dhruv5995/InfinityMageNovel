[542] The Forbidden Sanctuary (2)

A metal arm suddenly protruded through the elevator ceiling.

Eunkyung's handaxe began clanging as it carved through the ceiling, and as the ceiling collapsed, Sirone and Yo jumped down.

"It's not as deep as I thought."

Judging by the height, the elevator had stopped at basement level 1.

"How about we break through the floor?"

Since they had seen mucus blocking the stairs, it seemed dangerous to go too deep from the start.

Suddenly, electricity sparked from the ceiling with a crackling sound, and the elevator buttons lit up.

"There's electricity...?"

Before they could calm their startled hearts, the elevator doors opened by themselves.

Following the long corridor, ceiling lights illuminated sequentially, and the monotonous landscape of a research facility greeted them.

Though mucus was scattered here and there, there was enough space to move around.

"Let's examine this area first."

Sirone walked through the research facility corridor with Yo.

Each room had pneumatic locks, and inside the glass walls, numerous electric cages were stacked like blocks.

'Isolation facilities. Was this a place for animal experiments?'

When they entered the only room with an open door - the central control room - stale air stung their noses.

Faint bloodstains remained on the walls, and mucus that had seeped in from above was half-flowing down the walls.

"There must have been a battle."

Destroyed equipment was scattered everywhere, and there were bloodstains on the floor as well.

"It wasn't a battle. It was a one-sided massacre."

The scene was convincing enough to make such a judgment.

"The fact that there's electricity..."

Sirone pressed the administrator button in the central control room, hoping against hope.

With a humming sound, hologram monitors turned on all around, transmitting numerous three-dimensional images.

"Un-underground people...!"

As Yo hardened both arms and took a combat stance, Sirone raised his hand to stop her.

"Don't worry. They're just holograms."

Sirone seriously examined the images floating in the cylindrical hologram.

A human and a monkey were rotating side by side, and after a moment, the holograms overlapped and were synthesized into a creature with underground people characteristics.

'What the hell is this?'

When Sirone manipulated the hologram device options, documents appeared on the side monitor.

"Is it ancient language? What does it say?"

Sirone read along, recalling memories from before hibernation.

"Dynamic Human Project. Official government approval."

Having said that much, Sirone closed his mouth and read only with his eyes.

He was beginning to understand why the Children of the Sun and the underground people had avoided this place.

'My God...'

The contents written in the document were shocking.

Due to the aftermath of nuclear war, 80 percent of humanity suffered from mutations, deformities, and biological dysfunction.

Humanity, filled with recessive genes, had reached the point where they could no longer reproduce healthy offspring, and thus the Dynamic Human Project was attempted.

Combining artificially cultivated primate and human genes to create humans far stronger than before.

They thought that way, at least they could survive in the ruined world.

"Consul, what does it say? Are the underground people going to be punished soon?"

This place was literally a forbidden sanctuary, and Sirone couldn't find words to explain.

"Are you alright? You don't look well."

At that moment, mucus silently flowed down from the wall behind them, and two eyes suddenly opened in the gelatinous mass at a height of 2 meters.

When the eyes that had been looking around spotted Sirone and Yo, the gelatinous substance surged forward and began to emerge in human form.

"So what this means is..."

At that moment, Sirone, who had sensed something through Spirit Zone, quickly turned around.

"What!"

There was nothing there.

Yo, who had turned around with wide eyes, relaxed her expression and asked.

"What's wrong?"

"There was definitely something there..."

"Maybe you're too tense?"

"No. The shape of the mucus is different."

Even though it had risen to the ceiling like when they first came here, the form was completely different.

But Yo's eyesight couldn't confirm that much.

"If you're worried, should we just leave?"

Sirone bit his lip and fell into thought.

Now that he realized what kind of place this was, he couldn't just return to the colony like this.

'There's definitely an answer here. If I'm lucky, I might be able to recover my memories.'

Having made his decision, Sirone said.

"Let's explore a bit more for now."

The two people who left the laboratory began searching for a way down to the basement.

"The explosion sounds have stopped."

At Miro's words, Fermi accelerated.

"I'll check it out."

Riding his air skate, he quickly passed through the blocks and checked around the corner, then sent a signal that it was safe.

Ryan, who arrived later, looked up at the tall buildings and said.

"Only this area isn't severely damaged."

Marsha nodded.

"Still, there's more caution than before? Anyway, this scenery is definitely strange."

While walking and guarding their assigned directions, Miro pointed to a building.

"Do you see that?"

It was a skyscraper covered in mucus.

"Someone went in."

The fact that there was a crude path in the mucus that had spread extensively was definitely an artificial trace.

"Mucus is troublesome. Especially with this amount..."

There was no telling how much gelatinous substance was inside the building.

"But we have no choice but to go see, right?"

When Miro took the first step, the remaining three followed.

The lobby was surprisingly clean, and only the stairs going up were filled with mucus.

"Should we break through?"

When Miro pointed to the stairs, Fermi turned the corner and headed toward the elevator.

"It seems they went that way."

Marsha, who walked there, grabbed the wall and looked down the elevator shaft.

A faint light was shining inside the metal box.

"There's light. Abyss Walker?"

"We'll know if we go down and see."

At the same time the four people descended down the elevator shaft, something fell from the lobby ceiling with a thud.

A human made of mucus.

Though grotesquely hideous as if its skin had been peeled off, its features were clear and its eyes were distinct.

It was commonly called a Mucus Man.

"..."

As the Mucus Man looked toward the elevator, gelatinous substance slowly flowed down from the top of its head, then grabbed its face like absorbing water droplets and pulled it up to the ceiling.

Sirone, who had come down to basement level 4, took a deep breath of the fresh air.

"Wow..."

Yo looked around with eyes filled with wonder.

It was an arboretum that you might see in the tropics, with leaves of numerous trees growing up the walls.

"An ecological environment underground. No, more than that, how has it survived until now?"

It would be impossible without constant temperature, humidity, and light.

"Let's just go down. This place seems..."

He was reluctant to check the 4th floor with Yo.

"There's a bigger tree over there."

But she was now taking the initiative herself.

When they entered the large arboretum sealed with glass walls, numerous computer devices were operating, and a huge tree stood in the center.

Sirone, who followed later, could guess her expression just by seeing Yo's back as she stood dazed.

"Uh, uhh?"

What stood before Yo's eyes was definitely a Tree of Life, smaller than what they had seen outside but unmistakable.

Fetuses with stems were hanging in clusters from the branches, and the flat glass container that enclosed the roots was filled with mucus.

"How could this... we are..."

As Yo muttered, the gelatinous substance in the glass container rose up and grabbed a fetus, pulling it down.

Seeing the stem snap and the fetus fall into the mucus, Yo screamed with a pale face.

"Kyaaaah!"

"Calm down! If you make loud noises...!"

Yo was not in her right mind.

"Consul! What is this about! Why is there a Tree of Life here? Ra, the sun is..."

Sirone had no way of knowing either, but there was a way to check.

When he pressed the option button on the control device, holograms turned on again and explanations continued.

'Human Extinction Prevention Project. Unofficial government approval. As expected...'

Like the Dynamic Human, the Children of the Sun were also not humanity that had evolved naturally.

The contents written in the document revealed facts even more shocking than what he had seen on the first floor.

With more than 70 percent of animals and plants extinct and resources depleted, humanity finally realized.

Humans should no longer be involved with energy.

Human greed had ruined everything!

Humanity needed special managers who wouldn't be swayed by desire, and thus was born the Local Energy Circulation System Mucus.

The reason for Mucus's existence was to digest animals and plants with slime and generate the energy needed for the ecosystem.

But when even local energy eventually dried up, it began to destroy and expand the limits of its territory.

The system, which judged that maintaining the ecosystem was more important than preserving specific individuals, even digested humans.

In the situation where the planet had dried up, humanity's conclusion was that the human power mechanism needed to be redesigned from scratch.

Silence Artificial Hibernation Corporation, which was conducting the Human Survival Project under government leadership, contacted the descendants of the few remaining fairy folk and established Fairy Biomimetics.

The result was the Tree of Life using solar power.

The belief was that if there were organisms that could live on photosynthesis and water alone, humanity would not disappear even if the world was destroyed.

And now, the future they could never have confirmed was unfolding before Sirone's eyes.

'Mutants were manifestations of fairy characteristics. Humanity's obsession with species is truly terrifying. But...'

Sirone looked around the laboratory with sad eyes.

'Is this really the future they dreamed of?'

Thud! Yo fell to her knees.

"No."

Tears flowed down her cheeks.

"It's not true, right? I'm dreaming, right? We... the Children of the Sun are a race blessed by Ra, right?"

Long ago, both Dynamic Humans and Children of the Sun must have known of this place's existence.

But it was a fact that should never be known, and this became instinct, finally becoming a forbidden sanctuary.

"Consul! Please tell me! What are we? Are we really human?"

"That's not important. What's important is that your people are the ones who survived in this world."

"But all this time we have...!"

At that moment, the mucus submerged under the Tree of Life wriggled, and a Mucus Man burst out.

"Dangerous!"

At the same time Sirone embraced Yo and rolled on the floor, mucus flowed down from the ceiling and wallpapered the walls.

"What is that thing?"

Sirone, who turned his head while embracing Yo, was horrified by the grotesque appearance of the Mucus Man.

"High-efficiency energy..."

As the Mucus's arm stretched like rubber and charged, Sirone threw his body and fired Photon Cannons in rapid succession.

When the Mucus Man with exploded shoulder and abdomen leaped up, gelatinous substance came down from the ceiling, grabbed him, and absorbed him.

"Damn it!"

It wasn't over just by catching what was visible - the entire mucus filling the building was the enemy.

The Mucus Man, having obtained a new body, crawled around the walls like a spider, and whenever Sirone attacked, it immediately dissolved into the slime.

'How am I supposed to fight something like this?'

When the Mucus Man that surged from the floor swung its fist, Sirone threw his body to the opposite side.

At the same time, thick tentacles stretched out from the slime on the wall.

"Consul!"

Just as Yo, who had belatedly come to her senses, was about to jump out, the arboretum door opened and a large man passed by her side.

Ignoring acceleration, he blocked Sirone's front and swung his great sword, cutting through the tentacles with a thud.

"Sirone! Are you okay?"

When the blue-haired man turned his head, Sirone had a dazed expression.

Then new memories flooded into his mind like a tide and began connecting with numerous other memories.

"...Ryan?"

Sirone Information Recovery Rate.

69 percent.
