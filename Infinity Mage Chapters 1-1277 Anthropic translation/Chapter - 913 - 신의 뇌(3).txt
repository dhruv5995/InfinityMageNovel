The Brain of God (3)

Omega Year 201.

Hundreds of angels and thousands of Maras had occupied the heavens.

Each time the Judicial Halo flashed, the laws trembled, and the violence of the Maras was inflicted upon the earth.

"OOOOOOOOH!"

At the same time, golden light ignited in the eyes of the Gaians.

'Ultima System.'

As the quantum signals of 300 million beings unified into one, the veil of the world was stripped away.

"What the—?!"

A massive current of light, vast as the Milky Way, made a great detour and surged toward the angelic forces.

"Attack!"

Angels flying with flapping wings of light threw themselves at the signal with all their might.

BWOOOOOOONG!

Shockwaves larger than planets spread out into the universe, and the White Palace conference room of the Archangels trembled.

"Damn humans!" The Archangel of Union, Methiel, bared her white teeth.

"How long are we going to just wait? Why don't we go out and destroy them ourselves?"

Despite her pure face framed by golden hair reaching down to her waist, her eyes were filled with murderous intent.

The Archangel of Birth, Kariel, chimed in.

"I feel the same way. If we stay like this, we'll be overthrown before we can even attempt a reset."

While Guffin was acting independently, the Gaians had also strengthened their Ultima system.

To prevent another cosmic disruption, Ankera's conclusion was initialization.

Uriel spoke.

"Let's wait a little longer. If the reset succeeds, the future where Gaians existed will also disappear."

They would redesign from the beginning of the universe to prevent such a situation from occurring.

RUUUUUMBLE!

As the White Palace shook again, the Archangel of Decomposition, Satiel, furrowed her eyebrows.

"Still, it's truly amazing. It's hard to believe this is human power."

Union and decomposition were sister concepts.

Therefore, Satiel's appearance also possessed heavenly beauty like Methiel's.

The only distinguishing features were her short hair and innocently large eyes.

The Archangel of Existence, Metatron, spoke.

"Watch your thoughts, Satiel. Does a being with the rank of Archangel praise inferior creations?"

Satiel pouted her lips.

"We should acknowledge what deserves acknowledgment. You know, when you break down any existence, they all become the same, right?"

Methiel showed displeasure.

"So we're the same? No, we're not. Your mind is too childish. With that attitude, you cannot rule over humans."

"O-okay."

Satiel hastily bowed her head.

Born with the concept of decomposition, she had a tendency to treat all things equally.

This was why she inevitably found it difficult to deal with Methiel, the Archangel of Union who symbolized individuality.

As the atmosphere grew heavy and the Archangels fell silent, Ikael spoke up.

"The angelic defense line has collapsed."

Her eyes, having fought countless battles against the Gaians, overflowed with the authority of an Archangel.

"To that extent?"

Milk-white vapor flowed from the body of Uriel, the Archangel of Destruction, seeping into the White Palace.

"I'll go out. Today I'll destroy Ultima once and for all."

"No. Everyone participates."

The moment even the slightest crack appeared in Ultima, Ankera would initialize the world.

'Not being able to get even close means the Gaians' mental power surpasses the angelic army.'

Total deployment was the only answer.

"Do I really need to go too?"

Phiel, the Archangel of Annihilation, couldn't accept that the situation had been pushed this far.

'Phiel.'

Shirone, passing through the records of Omega, took interest in the Archangel he had personally annihilated.

'He really was strong.'

It took paying a price of over 127 years with Valhalla Action to defeat him.

Even considering the debt of time, thinking that less than five years had passed since then, he had been a terrifying adversary.

"Everyone deploys."

Ikael warned Phiel.

"Don't underestimate the enemy carelessly, Phiel. That's why we're paying the price now."

"I acknowledge the enemy."

Ultima was strong.

"What I want to say is, do we really have to move according to your will?"

Rayel, the Archangel of Light, asked.

"What are you saying? Are you doubting the Archangel who directly carries out Ankera's commands?"

"Mclain Guffin."

Ikael's brow furrowed.

"When the Gaians first tried to escape the photon system, the Archangel failed to stop them."

Though it was an event from the distant past, angels had no forgetfulness.

"So what? Are you saying that if it were you, you could have stopped the Gaians?"

Only Phiel, being the concept of symmetry, could boldly present counterarguments to Ikael, the leader of the angels.

"Of course Ultima is strong. What I find suspicious is why Guffin saved you."

Guffin's act of flying over and blocking Ikael the moment the photon cannon was fired had become a topic among the angels.

"Saved? Even if he hadn't intervened, I wouldn't have been damaged by such an attack. And regarding my failure to stop the Gaians, Ankera has already given sufficient rebuke. It's not your place to interfere."

After receiving Ankera's stern scolding, Ikael's resolve had become even stronger.

In any case, since Ikael was the Archangel, Phiel had no further grounds for rebuttal.

"My command is Ankera's command. All Archangels, listen. Deploy immediately and stop the Gaians."

"We obey the command."

The eight Archangels simultaneously melted into the barriers of the White Palace and disappeared.

"Strike! Hit them harder!"

Lightning that split the sky into thousands of pieces raced down and struck vertically into the group of Gaians.

"Weak."

Looking up at the electricity dispersing in all directions at a height of 2 kilometers above ground, Mysin lifted the corner of his mouth.

As the eldest and representative of the Gaians, he was fighting Heaven with leadership rivaling Guffin's.

"This is more like it." As he pointed forward with two fingers, the Gaians' minds unified into one.

"Lightning."

KRRRRRRRUMBLE!

As the world opened and lightning struck down, the screams of angels could be heard.

"AAAAAAAAH!"

Before the energy of disruption, even angels as conceptual beings had their sacred light bodies destroyed.

"Hehe, reset."

Among the crowd walking toward Ankera, there was one sitting on a rock smoking a cigarette.

A massive build with wolf-like features—Leo, the battle commander of the Gaian race.

"Ankera. What a pathetic dream." As he muttered while exhaling white smoke, a woman with steel-colored hair hanging down to her ankles passed by.

"Hey! Everyone's moving but what are you doing alone? Ever since becoming commander, you've gotten lazy."

"Ah, would it really matter if I'm missing?"

"If everyone thinks like that, who's going to walk? Aren't you getting up?"

Though they were bantering back and forth, their conclusion was ultimately the same.

"That was good."

Leo threw away his cigarette with a flick and walked over to the woman with his hands in his pockets.

"Penny, if you're free tonight—"

A piercing high note cut off his words.

"Worthless humans!"

Where the Gaians' gazes turned, a fierce-looking angel was glaring with bulging eyes.

"How dare you defy God's command! Great calamity will befall you!"

Leo's expression turned cold.

"What's with that angel?" Penny said.

"Ikasa. The Angel of Desire."

With her Judicial Halo Valhalla Action capable of reversing causality, she was prepared for annihilation.

"Come, angels! We cannot let our world be stolen by worthless creations!"

Confirming that the angels' eyes were changing, Ikasa charged toward the ground.

"Great Ankera!"

As black and white information accumulated in her halo, a massive result came rushing in.

'I absolutely cannot let them take it!'

The winning side becomes god.

Conversely, the losing side would have to taste the abyss of existence on a dimension incomparable to slavery.

"Die, humans!"

Shirone thought.

'Impossible. Even if you reverse causality, you can't bring about a result that takes life.'

As someone who used the same Judicial Halo, he knew this fact, but after realizing nothingness, he understood it perfectly.

'Because the codes are different.'

This world was composed of photon code, which served as the physical background, and the mind that dwelt within it—quantum code.

'Time belongs to photon code. Meanwhile, the subject that triggers actions—the mind—is quantum code.'

Therefore, photon code cannot access quantum code.

'I'll kill them! At least one person!'

However, Ikasa's emotions were genuine.

The future she brought forth for that result was every punch she could throw until her body shattered.

"This world belongs to us!"

Leo's eyebrows twitched.

"...You're greatly mistaken."

The moment he raised both shoulders and clenched his fists, fire ignited in the eyes of 300 million Gaians.

Simultaneously, Ikasa activated Valhalla Action.

"DIE!"

As causality reversed, countless shock waves of punches swept down to the ground.

"Your world?"

Leo lowered his center of gravity and took a stance to throw his right fist toward the sky.

"No, we are the ones who use it."

The world's signals cannot influence the mind, but—

"Divine Transcendence."

The extreme manifestation of mind dwells in the world's signals and creates powerful phenomena.

"Instant Strike!"

Before the phantom of a fist that crumpled the landscape as it approached, Valhalla Action's shock waves shattered.

"Wha—"

As space overlapped, time became meaningless.

The will of Divine Transcendence pierced through the torso of Ikasa, who was making a dazed expression.

"AAAAAH!"

At the sight of her falling with only her upper body remaining, the wings of the angels following behind stopped in unison.

"We can't win." A melancholy vibration surrounded the terrified angels whose sacred light bodies were trembling.

"Do you understand now?"

The voice of 300 million people speaking simultaneously destroyed the angels' vibrations.

"We are one."

As 300 million sound waves resonated, the sound stretched as if time had slowed down.

"L-look there..."

Where the angels pointed, a procession of easily over 100 million Gaians was joining the main force.

"With integrated thinking."

The angels gritted their teeth at the sight of them crossing formations without even brushing each other's collars.

"Beings with different individualities."

The Gaians who suddenly stopped walking took 400 million different poses, no two alike.

"We are the universe."

Processions of Gaians numbering at least 100 million units were approaching from all directions.

"We are truth."

All had fire burning in their eyes, and vertical flashes rising from their bodies connected to the sky.

"That is human..."

The final evolutionary form of society achieved by users.

"Hic. Hic."

Ikasa, with only her upper body remaining, shed tears as she watched the procession of Gaians passing by.

Friends chatting as they walked, a child holding their parents' hands and laughing innocently.

Though their actions were different, the golden light in their eyes contained the exact same emotion.

"No."

We are the masters.

"No! Absolutely not! I am god! I am a noble angel!"

Some of the Gaians who had been passing by indifferently stopped and looked back at Ikasa.

"Ngh."

Meeting the Gaians' gaze head-on, Ikasa stopped speaking, terrified.

"Ah..."

And she realized.

'Good, evil, love, hate—none of it matters.'

If Gaians call evil good, then it's good. If they call void love, then it's love.

'Because they are everything.'

If all beings look at a black stone and call it a white stone, what color is the stone—black or white?

Akashic Records or Ultima System?

'Humans define it.'

Therefore, if the child she was now looking at decided to kill her mercilessly...

'That too would be truth.'

She waited for judgment with terrified eyes, but the child just smiled and passed by.

"Huuugh!"

Ikasa buried her face in the ground and wailed.

"WAAAAH! WAAAAH!" The moment she was defined as a worthless existence, cracks began to spread across her sacred light body.
