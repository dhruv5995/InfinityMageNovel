[645] A Dead End (5)

As Seong-eum's position completely shifted to the Yellow Dragon Hall, the crumpled space unfolded and the scenery returned to normal.

Though it wasn't a sight they saw often, the guards who had been caught off guard several times before all grabbed their sword hilts without exception and shouted.

"Your Highness the Princess! You must follow proper protocol to have an audience with His Imperial Majesty!"

Seong-eum didn't even blink.

"A daughter is merely meeting her father."

Her Kar level was 89.2 percent.

"However, if you do this, we will have to..."

As the captain of the guards approached with an expression of being caught between a rock and a hard place, Seong-eum raised her hand.

Ether Wave.

Distortion.

Space twisted and the captain's body curved like a whirlpool before completely disappearing from sight.

"No matter if you are Her Highness, to use sorcery in the Yellow Dragon Hall...!"

Starting with that, the guards were twisted by the power of distortion and vanished.

A perfect sealed room.

Seong-eum's ability was powerful because it twisted the very foundation upon which phenomena existed.

Since there was no space for sound to spread, no one could eavesdrop on their conversation.

"Father, are you afraid of me?"

"Hmm."

Emperor Jin Gang of the Jincheon Empire leaned his chin on the dragon throne and raised the corners of his mouth.

With a build that rivaled even the guards, abundant hair and beard, his eyes sparkled with a will strong enough to contain the world.

"Is there a father in this world who fears his daughter?"

"Then why do you station troops?"

"Seong-eum."

His baritone voice shook the Yellow Dragon Hall.

"Yes, Father."

"The world is vast and humans are many. To obtain the realm, everything must be made simple. Whether you are my daughter or anything else, prostrating before the emperor is natural."

Looking down at Seong-eum who still kept her back straight, Jin Gang asked.

"Do you think Jincheon cannot embrace the realm you dream of?"

The Ivory Tower was a supranational organization, and if Seong-eum became a star, Jincheon would lose a precious talent.

"It's not a matter of the realm, but a matter of myself."

Jin Gang nodded.

"It would be good to give you time. But don't forget. Always, in any situation..."

Jin Gang's eyes flashed.

"The simple defeats the complex."

With a crack, space split and 200 guards surrounded Seong-eum, with the captain standing one step ahead pressing his blade to her neck.

"Your Highness the Princess, please follow protocol. We cannot tolerate any more discourtesy."

As the spatial constraint broke, Seong-eum glared at Jin Gang with fierce eyes.

"I permit you to take the Ivory Tower's examination. Try your best."

"Hmph!"

The moment Seong-eum spun around, the captain's blade curved like a snake and aimed at his groin.

"What the...!"

The captain, enraged at showing such disgrace before the emperor, chased after Seong-eum, but Jin Gang spoke in a quiet voice.

"Enough. Just let her go."

"But Your Imperial Majesty! Her Highness's behavior just now was..."

"She's just immature. It'll be fine, that place called the Ivory Tower too."

It was a tower that Jincheon would eventually break.

"Go and have fun, daughter of Jin Gang."

With graduation ceremony just one day away, Shirone and his friends ironed their uniforms.

They'd probably look ridiculously ghost-like, but thinking of it as one of the final gateways to graduation made it easier to bear.

After finishing the ironing, they sat side by side and began writing graduation speeches to recite tomorrow.

About an hour later, Nade grumbled.

"I hate writing the most. We fought to death, so why do we have to do this too?"

Iruki said.

"That's how life is. Why, there's even a saying like this: It's not over until it's over."

"Hmm."

Shirone nodded but then looked back at Iruki.

"But isn't that saying used in different situations?"

"Who cares? I don't rely on language."

Shirone craned his neck to see what kind of graduation speech such a person would write.

"Let's see. If you're crazy and stupid, you're an idiot. If you're normal and smart, you're a scholar. If you're crazy but smart, you're a genius... Hey, what is this? Are you really going to recite this?"

"Puhahahaha!"

Nade stuck out his tongue and rolled his eyes back.

"Why not? We've escaped hell. No matter what we say, the demons won't listen."

Nade wiped away the tears that had trickled out and said.

"Still, it's material that'll be stored in the records room, so put some effort into it."

"What about you then?"

Iruki read Nade's speech.

"An angel named Liz. A sun that rose like a miracle above the waters of despair..."

"Hey! Why are you looking at other people's stuff!"

Shirone sighed.

"It's not like it's a love letter, and the underclassmen will keep reading it..."

"That's exactly why I'm writing it. A love letter that'll be recorded forever. Isn't that romantic?"

Then there was a knock and Amy entered.

"Teacher Collie wants everyone to gather in the music room. She says we're practicing the school anthem chorus."

"Ugh, I really don't want to do that."

Just thinking about singing in front of the underclassmen made his face feel hot.

When they entered the music room, all the graduates were gathered.

Even if they chose different paths, they still needed to receive their diplomas, so Lycon and Maya were also present.

"It's been a while, Shirone."

Maya approached and waved her hand.

"Yeah. I heard you got accepted. Congratulations."

She had received numerous scout offers from performance groups, but Maya chose to audition instead, and finally managed to sign with the kingdom's most famous entertainment agency.

Having produced many world-class singers, her future would be just as eventful as Shirone's.

"Thanks. I heard about you too. The Ivory Tower came, right? Ah, I should have seen that."

Though Maya was joking around, her true feelings were completely different.

She had heard he was dating Amy, but ultimately the two had separated again.

Even though she had already given up, the fact that there was now an opening with the man she had a crush on made her heart race.

Moreover, once she became famous, she would tour numerous kingdoms, and just that thought alone made her heart swell.

'Maybe... I might have a chance too?'

It was something she couldn't dare say out loud.

If she gave even the slightest hint of such feelings, how much would Amy's heart be torn, watching from the side?

"Yeah, let's work hard. Someday we'll all become famous and meet again."

The school anthem chorus was the final item in the graduation ceremony, and some seniors would suddenly burst into tears, creating indelible dark history.

It was just singing a song for about 3 minutes, but Collie had a slightly different opinion.

"I'm thinking of including Maya's solo. Since she's a singer and will become a celebrity, it would make a good event."

No one objected.

Not only was Maya's singing excellent, but as long as it wasn't their own solo, they didn't care about the school anthem.

After finishing about an hour of rehearsal according to the graduation ceremony schedule, the students returned to their dormitories and went to sleep early.

The morning of the long-awaited graduation day dawned, and with parents, advanced class students, and teachers gathered, the 10 graduates climbed onto the platform.

When it came time to recite graduation speeches, Iruki confidently stepped forward.

"They say if you're crazy and stupid, you're an idiot, and if you're normal and smart, you're a scholar."

Shirone and Nade broke out in cold sweat.

'He's actually doing it, that crazy bastard.'

The strange logic continued, and at the end of his graduation speech, Iruki spread both arms and shouted.

"When everyone curses me for being crazy, I will proudly shout like this: Am I the crazy one, or is this world that calls me crazy the crazy one!"

Everyone answered in their hearts.

'You're just crazy.'

In the awkward silence that followed, Iruki lowered his arms and turned around.

"That concludes my speech."

Nade rose from his chair, passed Iruki, and stood on the platform.

"Do you know an angel named Liz? To me, who had fallen into despair, like a miracle..."

The students couldn't understand the graduation speech, and the embarrassment belonged solely to Liz, who was sitting in the audience.

'If you didn't want to write it, you should have just not written it.'

She knew how annoying it was to write graduation speeches too.

"So I will become the greatest merchant!"

Nade shouted loudly and turned around.

"That concludes my speech."

Again, no applause came, and Shiina held her head.

"Oh, those boys really."

Ethella covered her mouth and laughed.

"Hehe, I think it's good though? At least the underclassmen are pricking up their ears to listen."

"That kind of thing becomes tradition and produces troublemakers."

Among ordinary graduation speeches, overly emotional speeches, and self-aggrandizing speeches, as the 10 graduates finished one by one, Shirone stepped forward last.

It was an intentional arrangement, and the effect was excellent.

"It's Senior Shirone."

The person who had broken the kingdom's highest records and was now among the top 3 candidates for the Ivory Tower.

Whatever else, they absolutely had to listen to Shirone's graduation speech.

"I don't think I have talent."

Shirone calmly read his speech.

"I don't think I worked harder than others either."

The audience became instantly quiet.

"Things like talent or effort are probably words made up by people who have never truly yearned for something."

He had wanted to become a mage and loved learning magic.

"Because I loved it so much, even failure was enjoyable, and effort wasn't difficult."

Therefore, a mage would be someone who loves magic.

"Even if I had less talent than now, I would have eventually come to this place. Even without deliberately creating the word 'effort,' I would have honed my magic day by day. Even if I possessed nothing at all. Because humans are beings who inevitably go toward what they earnestly yearn for."

Shirone put down his speech and looked at the underclassmen.

"Do work that you truly love. No talent, no effort can defeat what you love. So don't fear anything and listen to the sound of your heart beating. If it's still beating fast, you'll eventually be able to reach that place."

Shirone smiled with his eyes.

"That concludes my speech."

"Thank you for everything! Senior!"

Mark jumped up and shouted, and all the students stood and applauded.

When Shirone, who had seemed like a person from another world, said that anyone could do it, something hot welled up in their chests.

"That's a good graduation speech. It will serve as a model for the underclassmen."

Hearing the teachers' conversation, Alpheas smiled gently.

"Shirone..."

Watching the boy who had audited classes from beyond the wall at age twelve now become a mage who amazed the world and gave advice to underclassmen, he felt the vicissitudes of time.

"Finally, we will have the graduation school anthem chorus."

'Ugh, I wish it would just rain.'

The students, their uniforms fluttering, formed ranks and sang the school anthem enthusiastically to the accompaniment of the music band.

When you hear the music you first encounter upon enrollment for several years, you can't even tell if it's a song or an incantation anymore.

Nevertheless, Maya's skill was the best, and when her solo began, even the parents were entranced by her voice.

'I thought it was really childish.'

As the school anthem continued, sadness filled the students' eyes.

'When this song ends...'

They would truly be going out into the world.

'I've become a mage.'

In Shirone's mind, everything from enrollment until now began to flow without a single omission.

He had met good people and matured by overcoming countless difficulties.

"We are children of intellect. Alpheas Magic School, shine forever."

Eventually Shirone burst into tears, and since the competition had been more intense than in other years, tears flowed from the other graduates' eyes as well.

"We are children of intellect."

All the students sang in unison.

"Alpheas Magic School, shine forever!"

The graduation ceremony was over.
