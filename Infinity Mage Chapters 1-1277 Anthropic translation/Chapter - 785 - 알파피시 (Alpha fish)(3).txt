[785] Alpha Fish (3)

Uorin's room.

While the Ex Machina team sat in a row of chairs, a woman stood receiving their attention.

When Shirone's group entered, Uorin, who had been watching from the corner, approached with her index finger to her lips.

"You're here. We just started."

Shirone looked back at the woman.

'That person is Alpha Fish.'

He had expected a hysterical impression, but she was looking down coyly while fidgeting anxiously.

"She's surprisingly ordinary."

"No."

Minerva looked at the woman with serious eyes.

"That woman... she's the same type as me."

A woman born with a witch's fate.

There was no evidence that any particular impression made one a witch, but there was a common temperament among those born with a witch's fate.

'An aura that stirs up desires.'

An impression that made you want to torment, destroy, and see her clutching blankets while crying before you could be satisfied.

Uorin, who had once lived with a witch's appearance, was also feeling the same thing as Minerva.

"Right, she has a witch's appearance. But surprisingly, she's not a witch. She's currently running a small flower shop."

Minerva narrowed her eyes.

"She's... not a witch?"

If fate could be defied so easily, Minerva wouldn't have created <Law Kill> either.

Shirone asked.

"What happened?"

"First... let's watch."

When Iruki joined the Ex Machina team, Uorin looked their way and nodded.

Receiving the signal, Gudiao spoke.

"Ms. Yuth Abella."

Minerva's eyebrows twitched.

'A survivor of Yuth?'

It was once a massive tribe that competed for ranks 1-2 among the gypsy clans, but was currently known to have died out.

"Yes, please speak."

Abella's voice crawled out.

"Don't be nervous. This isn't an interrogation. We called you because we have a few things to confirm. First, you know why you came to the imperial capital, right?"

"Yes, I heard. The mustache man, no, Uncle Habits..."

Abella raised her head for the first time.

"Is a very bad person."

Her expression showed she understood intellectually that Habits was evil, but couldn't accept it emotionally.

Iruki said.

"That's right. He's killed countless people, is still killing them, and will continue to kill them. You must know about the incident where he buried 70,000 people alive. We need your help."

"How, how could I..."

Mays asked.

"Do you think Habits shouldn't die?"

Abella hurriedly shook her head.

"No! If someone does bad things, they should be punished! I think killing people is wrong!"

Iruki let out a long breath.

'A witch's fate, huh. I can see what that means.'

Even now, wasn't the Ex Machina team unconsciously taking a stance of tormenting her?

"You can speak honestly. Even if Ms. Abella loves Habits, we won't do anything harmful to you."

Though gypsies have no homeland, for her who spent her childhood in the Gustav Empire, Kashan was an enemy nation.

'And she's in front of the Empress, so being nervous is natural.'

Abella took a moment to catch her breath and calm her mind, then looked at Iruki with clear eyes.

"No. I think Habits is someone who deserves to die."

Yet it was strange that this didn't pierce the heart.

"I'll explain from here."

Uorin walked forward.

"The two first met 14 years ago, when Habits was twenty-seven and Ms. Abella was nine."

Everyone focused on her.

"The Gustav royal family's unique tradition of fratricide. Habits was notorious for brutally killing numerous siblings. There were even rumors that the emperor's decision to send Habits XVII to Arcaba, the empire's easternmost point, wasn't a strategic choice. Perhaps... even Habits XVI feared his son."

This was a story Abella didn't know.

"In the end, Habits XVII killed 781 siblings and became emperor. During the three resets, his methods of killing them were always different. He killed his siblings using 2,343 different methods."

That's why he's chaos.

"And at that time, that is, 14 years ago by the Great Purification Era standard, the method Habits used was..."

Uorin cast her gaze down coldly.

"Tying his brother and the brother's wife to the ceiling, then cooking their child and holding a feast."

Abella's body trembled as if struck by lightning.

"14 years ago."

Arcaba, the empire's easternmost point.

"Aaaaah! You bastard! Stop it! Are you even human after doing this?! You'll receive divine punishment!"

Habits' half-brother hung from the ceiling, spitting blood and screaming.

His wife hanging beside him had already lost her mind, making bizarre laughter while soiling herself.

"Hmm, what part is this?"

Habits, who had been slicing meat with a knife, picked it up with a fork and examined it from various angles.

"Aaaaah! Stop it!"

Twenty-seven-year-old Habits didn't look much different from his face after becoming emperor, except he was stylishly growing a mustache.

"Fondue."

After dipping the meat in soup and putting it deliciously in his mouth, he chewed while his brother shed tears.

"Please... I beg you. You become emperor. I'll help you. I'll make you emperor somehow. So please stop..."

"Emperor?"

Habits put down his utensils and wiped his lips.

"Brother, you're strange. What's fun about being emperor? That's boring as hell."

"Then why...? Why even your nephew..."

Habits looked up at the ceiling.

"The process of becoming emperor is what's fun."

"Huuuuh!"

Habits' brother realized.

Though dozens of siblings were still sharpening their swords, the empire's emperor had already been decided.

"Kill me. I understand now, so please end it."

"I'll eat brother for dinner too. Sister-in-law for dessert."

Seeing the face smiling wickedly with flared nostrils, Habits' brother felt the world spinning.

"You bastard! You'll suffer the same fate! My brothers will surely execute you! I curse you! Even if I die, I'll pray from hell for your suffering!"

Habits yawned.

"Boring."

When he snapped his fingers, the rope binding his brother snapped and he fell 20 meters below.

With a thud, another corpse was created, and blood slowly spread outside his brother's spread-eagle body.

Habits asked a maid.

"Isn't there anything fun?"

Neither loyal subordinates who would offer honest counsel nor sycophants who indulged in flattery remained by his side.

Just a terrified maid spoke with trembling hands.

"Your, your brother's family members remain. They're in the underground dungeon, so perhaps some torture would be..."

"Torture isn't fun either, not since I was seven."

The maid's shoulders jerked.

"I'm sorry! I couldn't fathom Your Majesty's deep intentions and presumptuously gave advice! Please forgive me!"

Habits stared at her intently.

"Is there something sad happening?"

The maid who raised her face hurriedly shook her head.

"What? Oh, no. I'm not sad."

"Then why are you crying? Am I scary?"

What people around Habits hated most was being asked questions.

'What, what should I answer...'

She felt like she'd die if she said he was scary, and die if she said he wasn't scary.

Emotion finally won.

"You're scary! Ah! That's not it, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! To lowly me...!"

As her mind gradually became confused and her language went mad, Habits approached.

"I'm scary? Why?"

Habits' face seen up close, no, his pupils, were so clear and beautiful.

"Because I might die."

The words slipped out without her knowing.

"Hmm. Is dying that scary?"

Habits, lost in thought while fidgeting with his mustache, nodded and said.

"Then I won't kill you."

"Really?"

She asked back again.

"Yeah. Is that good now? Since I won't kill you, no one will kill you, right?"

She had never tasted such powerful salvation in her life.

"Thank you! Thank you!"

While the maid kept bowing her head, Habits put on his coat and said.

"I can't stand being bored. I need to go out and play. Oh, and brother's family members, pull out all their kneecaps."

The maid's face turned pale.

"Me, me?"

"If it's bothersome, tell the minister. You can have all of brother's wealth and family members. About 200 people? You can play with them until you're sick of it."

As the maid made a blank expression, Habits turned from outside the door and winked.

"Live with a smile. Enjoy yourself."

The smell of blood wafted through the closed room.

Habits, who traveled by carriage for two hours from Arcaba's royal castle, arrived at the East Sea.

It was a place famous for fishing, but hearing rumors that Habits was coming, all the nobles had vacated the area.

"How quiet. Today's my lucky day?"

Not only nobles but among commoners too, there was no one in Arcaba who didn't know Habits' name.

Habits, who settled in a secluded spot where forest spread out, cast his fishing line without even putting on bait.

"Haaaaam."

From his expression as he yawned languidly, the world's most boring emotion was clearly evident.

Habits' playground is always deserted.

"Everything's boring these days."

What was he waiting for, alone in a playground no one visited?

"Isn't there anything fun?"

This was before he had met Gustav's 4th miracle yet.

"Boo. Maa. Ooo."

Making various mouth shapes and sounds, then looking at the world with crossed eyes...

"Aaaaaaaah!"

He suddenly turned his head while screaming, as if destroying the peaceful silence.

"Boo. Maa. Ooo."

Then a girl's voice was heard from behind.

"Huh?"

When Habits turned around, a dirty girl in gypsy-style clothing exaggeratedly moved her lips.

"Boo. Maa. Ooo. What kind of sound is that?"

Habits, blinking his eyes, pointed at the sea.

"Fish sounds."

"Hahaha! How do fish make sounds? And fish don't get caught here! Are you stupid, mister?"

"Huh? Mister?"

Habits pointed at himself with his index finger.

"I'm not a mister though?"

"You are a mister! You grew a mustache. Haha! Mustache uncle, mustache uncle!"

Habits smacked his lips and grabbed his fishing rod.

"I wish at least one shark would bite."

The girl who had been grinning while watching him approached Habits and yanked his mustache with an "eii!"

"Ow!"

"Oh? It's a real mustache?"

Habits, who had tears welling up, straightened his mustache.

"This is mine. And you're a girl, so even when you become an adult, this kind of hair won't grow."

A shadow fell over the girl's face.

"I know that too. What a woman is."

"Really? What's a woman?"

She smiled brightly again and sat at the fishing spot.

"Mister, I'm bored, want to play together?"

After thinking for a moment, Habits nodded.

"Sure. But what should we play?"

"Let's play with dolls. You're the monster, I'm the beautiful woman running away from the monster."

The girl took out a doll made by weaving cloth together.

"Here. This is the monster."

What she called a monster was just a man, albeit with exaggerated physical features.

"Good, I'm the monster."

Habits obediently took the doll and thumped it on the ground while imitating the monster's voice.

"Graaah! Try running away! I'll chew you up with my sharp teeth!"

"Kyaaaah! Save me! It's a monster!"

Habits moved the doll to chase after her.

"Stop right there! You beautiful...!"

Then he suddenly stopped moving and asked.

"Wait, time out. What's your name?"

The girl also briefly stepped out of the play, looked up at Habits, then showed her white teeth and said.

"Yuth. Yuth Abella."
