[678] The Five Senses Emerge (2)

Brooks shouted at the medical team.

"Hurry! There's no time!"

If the golden hour passed while her heart had stopped, it would be over.

"Th-this is...!"

True to his reputation as a skilled mercenary broker, the people who had flown to Brooks' mansion were specialists in emergency and rescue medicine.

Electric shocks were administered and CPR was performed endlessly, but Venezia didn't move.

"It's no use! She's already dead!"

"Save her! Without this woman, it's all over!"

If Lupist successfully completed his mission, Brooks would gain exclusive rights to manage Radum.

The fastest way to stabilize Radum would naturally be to use Venezia, the head of Spectrum.

"Keep going even if she's dead!"

It was an absurd statement, but the medical team understood perfectly and continued shocking her heart.

After 15 minutes passed, the exhausted people collapsed one by one, completely spent.

"It's over. She's dead."

"Damn it!"

Brooks kicked the door hard enough to wake the dead, unable to contain his excitement as he paced around the room fuming.

"Haaaaaah!"

At that moment, Venezia's eyes snapped open and she inhaled air to the limit of her lungs' capacity.

"Venezia!"

Brooks rushed over, and the medical team also jumped up, forgetting their fatigue.

"H-how...?"

Her heart was beating again.

"She's alive! She's alive, Mr. Brooks!"

"Hahaha! What did I tell you? I said it could be done!"

Though their purposes differed between life and money, their joy was the same.

"Wait, what's wrong with this woman?"

One of the medical team approached Venezia with a serious expression.

Having somehow raised her upper body, she was staring straight ahead with vacant eyes as if her soul had left her.

"La Enemy..."

The Three-Brain race possesses three brains that perceive past, present, and future, but currently the only brain alive in Venezia's head was the anterior brain that recognizes only the past.

This too was a sensory ability with a completely different mechanism from human brains.

Her gaze moved sideways, following the footsteps where La Enemy had passed.

"I must meet him."

As she muttered incomprehensible words and rose, a female medic draped a coat over her naked upper body.

"Venezia! Where are you going?"

Since the brain that recognizes the present had died, she couldn't analyze the current situation, and it was even impossible to predict the future that she absolutely must not meet La Enemy.

And this was precisely why La Enemy had come to find Venezia.

"To Radum."

The eye that sees La Enemy, the vision of the Great Purifier, followed La Enemy's trail as she began walking.

Lupist, who had been waiting for Jane at the entrance to the bioweapon, frowned as the concealment facility's power was cut off all at once.

'This feels ominous.'

An ancient weapon capable of biological feedback wouldn't have its power cut due to some malfunction.

Ultimately it was Spectrum's decision, and it wouldn't be with good intentions toward the humans.

'They're concentrating power.'

Lupist ground his teeth with a grinding sound.

Given the bioweapon's size, at maximum output even the royal capital would be within range.

Though they had set limits on the interception radius from when they first began managing Radum, if La Enemy was directly involved, it was certainly a situation where those limits could be lifted.

'Right now he's the Great Purifier. I was careless because he was born 19 years ago.'

If La Enemy controlled past events, figuring out the release code would be easy.

Lupist infiltrated the bioweapon without waiting for his companions.

'You must succeed, Jane.'

He could only hope she would gain control of the bioweapon in time.

Each time dozens of rapid-fire swords struck, terrible screams from the demi-humans burst forth.

All members belonging to Spectrum's lower organizations were attacking Shagal, and Etella's group could only watch in stunned silence.

'That's not human. It's a ghost.'

Even Yordig, a war maniac, trembled at such slaughter.

"Aaaaah!"

The screaming sounds gradually drew closer to them, until finally Shagal broke through the crowd and revealed himself.

"Hrrrrr!"

His face was twisted like hieroglyphs of murderous intent, and untouchable madness gleamed like oil in his eyes showing the whites.

'I'll kill them! Eliminate all life!'

With doubt disappearing before his clear purpose, his schema displayed its greatest function ever, strengthening his body.

"Stop! Please listen to me!"

When Etella shouted, Shagal's face twisted even more.

'Tia!'

Why did she have to die?

'Don't think about anything! If all life disappears...!'

There will be nothing left to think about.

"Die!"

As the rapid-fire swords' prowess reached disaster levels beyond mere combat, all races attacked Shagal.

As if born to eliminate life, those who entered his range instantly fell with holes pierced through their bodies.

'Trapezius! Clavicle! Deltoid!'

"Kraaaak!"

As the blade struck along the goblin's left neckline, blood spurted outside the rapid-fire sword's shell.

'Sternum! Pectoralis major! External oblique! Rectus abdominis!'

"Gueeeek!"

The Pidu with blades piercing his torso screamed.

'Rectus femoris! Adductor! Vastus medialis!'

"Mmmrrrgh!"

A dagger that ran diagonally down Tubo's thick thigh started from his groin and climbed back up the center of his body, striking vital organs.

'Bladder! Kidneys! Stomach! Lungs! Heart!'

The key was to stab swiftly.

"Shut up!"

Ignoring Raiden's voice that clung like a specter, Shagal twisted his upper body madly, stabbing daggers in all directions.

Juggling of slaughter.

Shagal, who had stabbed the same spots again with daggers, twisting to retrieve the shells, glared at the next wave of enemies.

The goblin whose gaze met his trembled at the jaw.

"R-run awaaaay!"

The moment those words of retreat came from the mouths of beings whose belligerence was unparalleled, the battle was as good as over.

"Damn!"

As Shagal approached at a speed impossible to track with the eyes, Arkman cast teleportation.

'Fire Snake...!'

He tried to cast magic upon arrival, but pain surging from his toes made his pupils shake.

"Krk!"

Somehow rapid-fire sword daggers had already pierced both his feet.

If he cast teleportation again like this, his ankles would be torn off, but it was better than dying.

"Aaaaak!"

Tearing off his ankles and rolling on the ground, what Arkman saw were daggers pouring down like rain.

"Idiot! Get away!"

Yordig swung an ice whip made with Ice Globe, but Arkman's heart already had seven shells embedded in it.

'Damn! Where is he!'

Though Yordig had captured Shagal's movements through Spirit Zone, it was merely the realm of perception.

It took an enormous amount of time for his nerves to produce a logical response, and Shagal pierced through that gap.

"Uh, uaaaah!"

Yordig abandoned thinking and wildly swung his whip, but felt no contact.

Pik.

The sound of flesh being pierced was as clean as a bird's cry.

"Kek...!"

As Yordig, with a dagger shell embedded in his nape, staggered like a crab, Shagal launched his body as if flying.

Extending his arm first, he stabbed the nape three more times with pop-pop-pop sounds, and Yordig's body was pushed sideways in rhythm.

"Aaaaak!"

Blood sprayed due to the pressure.

'At this rate we'll all die!'

Etella ambushed from a blind spot, but Shagal, having caught the scent of the incident, immediately left his position and targeted Ivian.

"Hup!"

Shagal's dagger trembled, unable to advance further in front of Ivian's upturned eyes.

'What?'

The rapid-fire sword's handle was metal.

"Now! Quickly...!"

Before Ivian could finish speaking, Shagal's kick struck his side.

"Hrrrrr!"

Though all his ribs broke, if he released the magnetic force, the dagger would pierce through.

"Hmm."

Shagal, who had turned and landed on the ground, grabbed Ivian's back of the head and pushed it toward the dagger.

With a thud, the blade embedded in his forehead.

"Master!"

As Elui cast magic, powerful poison gas spread.

With all three guild masters now dead, this was the only revenge she could manage.

"Huuuuu!"

Etella, who had held her breath for nearly five minutes, slowly exhaled as the thick haze cleared.

"Mmph! Mmph!"

Shagal, embracing Elui from behind, sat leaning against the wall with his hand covering her mouth.

No matter how powerful the gas, it wouldn't blow toward the caster.

Initially he had held a blade to her, but when she still wouldn't cancel the magic, he had blocked her nose and mouth.

Etella looked at Elui, who was crying in terror, and said:

"Wait. I have something to tell you..."

"Mmph! Mmph!"

Shagal looked only at Etella while stabbing daggers into Elui's upper body.

Thuk-thuk-thuk-thuk. Thuk-thuk-thuk-thuk.

It was mechanical repetition, as if playfully stamping seals, and each time a blade pierced, Elui's body convulsed as if electrocuted.

When her life finally extinguished, Etella closed her eyes in silent prayer.

'Wherever this one goes, only corpses remain.'

Over 100 corpses of humans and demi-humans were scattered about, and blood flowed as if it had rained.

'But why did Master...?'

Why had he willingly given his life to this one?

"Do you hate me?"

Shagal asked.

"If you despise me, then come at me."

As the trembling left Elui, Shagal rose holding the single remaining dagger.

"You're strong. Stronger than me."

Etella honestly admitted.

"But if you were merely evil, you couldn't have killed my master, Archbishop Raphael."

"I am evil."

There was no way Shagal could forget Raphael.

"Were you his disciple? Your master died by my hand. Take your revenge."

"I looked into you. And I learned why my master willingly offered his body to you."

"Hypocrisy."

The corner of Shagal's mouth rose bitterly.

"If you want to dress it up that way, by all means..."

"An organization called Grass Leaf Circus never existed in this world."

"What?"

To honor the dying words Raphael had conveyed through his death, Etella endured her desire to strike down Shagal immediately through superhuman willpower of goodness.

"Your entire life is fake. You were nothing but a brain in a tank."

Sirone, leaping over Radum's buildings while searching the vicinity, said:

"Lian, let's split up."

Since time was pressing, Lian agreed.

"Then I'll take this side. You go to the opposite side. Let's meet at the bioweapon's entrance."

"Yeah. Be careful."

Lian chuckled as if Sirone worried about everything, then launched his body.

'A body that can't die even if it wants to.'

Lian, who had jumped down below the building, ran at full speed from that point while thoroughly searching his surroundings.

Though he couldn't fly through the sky like a mage, the ground left traces only the ground could show.

'Over there.'

Following the demi-humans' corpses, Lian stopped at his destination.

Wig of the Gale.

He lay dead, severed at the waist.

The face that held emotions from the moment of death clearly conveyed bewilderment at not even knowing how he had been cut.

'This wasn't an injury from combat.'

His right arm had disappeared from below the elbow, as if forcibly torn off.

Thuk, thuk, at the eerie sound, Lian looked up to see a bespectacled goblin wrapped in a red cloak, holding Wig's arm and tearing off flesh.

After confirming the jaw movements and flesh going down, Lian aimed his great sword.

"Come down. I'll cut you to pieces."

"If I may make an argument..."

The goblin said, licking his teeth clean with his tongue.

"This one hunted me first."

Wig's arm swayed.

"He would kill me for money, then use that money to buy food. How is this any different?"

The identity of the goblin eating Wig's flesh was the general commander of Speed Killer, Kido the Eater.

He was the one corresponding to taste among the Great Purifier's senses.
