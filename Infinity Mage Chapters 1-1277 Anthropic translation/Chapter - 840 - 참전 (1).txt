**Chapter Entry (1)**

Uorin emerged from the imperial capital of Aganos wrapped in a shabby robe.

She had no attendants to serve her, and only Kido, who would protect her life, followed beside her.

A thunderous sound was heard from far away.

"Did the negotiations fail?"

Kido removed his hood and looked up at the sky toward Aganos's main gate.

Uorin didn't stop walking.

"They probably couldn't even attempt it. More precisely, Havitz will just do whatever he wants."

Havitz's chaos is the pinnacle of spontaneity, running wild outside the laws of the world as he pleases.

Kido followed Uorin and asked.

"If it's impossible to predict Havitz, then what is a predetermined future?"

"Laws are a collection of ideas. Outside the laws is chaos. Ideas and chaos interlock to produce specific results. Therefore, Havitz also has a predetermined future, but..."

"The way he reaches that future cannot be calculated by laws."

Uorin nodded.

"The world has already lost control. The wheel of good and evil is spinning rapidly around humans. The day the world ends isn't far away either."

"But why are you..."

Kido stopped speaking and closed his mouth.

'The world is coming to an end.'

In this world of destruction where there was nothing left to gain, what did Uorin want to leave behind?

A woman's voice was heard from the sky.

"Your Majesty."

Someone wearing a white owl mask circled in the air and then landed in front of them.

When the mask was removed, it revealed the face of a woman with a pale complexion and thick eyelids.

It was Yula, the leader of the Wind Squad.

"How did it go?"

"All directions are blocked. Hell's army of over ten million has completely sealed off the capital."

Currently, the other 99 members of the Wind Squad excluding her were moving around the capital looking for an escape route.

"I see..."

As shadows fell over Uorin's face, Kido tried to act strong.

"Hmph, it doesn't matter. We don't have to face all ten million. Let's break through the weakest side."

"Those numbers are already meaningless. There isn't a single place that shows anyâ€”"

Uorin cut her off.

"Find it. We'll break through there."

"Understood."

Yula immediately flew up into the sky.

"Let's go too. We need to get as far from the imperial palace as possible. We have no choice but to blend in with the crowds."

As they left the alley, demons were brutally ravaging the citizens of Kashan.

'This is hell.'

Black-winged demons filled the sky so completely that even the sun couldn't be seen.

"Let's go."

Kido, who had hidden his spear in his robe, led Uorin.

'It's fortunate there are many humans in the capital.'

The demons' acts were terrible, but if they had been killing machines, there wouldn't have been time to escape.

"Please spare me! I beg you...!"

There was no one to help them.

But for Uorin, who had once ruled Kashan, those desperate cries pierced her heart.

"Don't think about anything. I'll do the thinking, so you just focus on walking."

Kido's movements as he navigated outside the demons' sight were also stiff with tension.

"Kahaha! This one's mine!"

A two-meter-tall demon holding a bloody axe charged at them.

"Run!"

They kicked off the ground and started running, but everywhere they went was full of demons.

"They're escaping! They're escaping!"

Among the resigned people, the demons spotted the only prey full of vitality and attacked all at once.

"Damn!"

Kido stopped running and pulled out his hidden double-bladed spear, his robe fluttering.

"Stay right there!"

Kido shouted to Uorin and rolled on the ground, circling the area at tremendous speed.

The demons were instantly turned into pieces.

"Wh-what?"

Realizing they weren't ordinary fugitives, the demons rushed in as a group and tightened their encirclement.

"Graaah!"

Like a machine grinding them up, demon flesh flew mercilessly outside Kido's radius.

'There's no end.'

Even if it were a machine, grinding up this many would dull and ruin the blade.

"Kido!"

At Uorin's voice, Kido caught sight of the rear through his spinning afterimages.

Three demons had broken through Kido's blade hell and were attacking Uorin.

"Damn!"

He slid forward along the ground and sliced their legs, causing the demon grabbing Uorin's clothes to shriek.

"Kraaaah!"

As her clothes were torn away and Uorin's face was revealed, the demons' movements stopped.

"The Empress! It's the Empress!"

The offering Satan so desperately wanted.

"Contact headquarters!"

The moment the winged demons kicked off the ground to fly into the sky, Kido's eyes widened.

"Hyaaaah!"

The Earth Binding law activated to its limit, pulling dozens of demons to the ground.

"Kugh! Th-this is...!"

Kido, who had pulled the demons down with gravity, spun his double-bladed spear at a terrifying speed.

Whooooom!

The afterimage of the blade formed a sphere.

"Kraaaah!"

Like moths jumping into fire, the demons' bodies that collided with the blade sphere were ground up with wet tearing sounds.

"Hah! Hah!"

When he stopped spinning and looked around, all the nearby demons had been annihilated.

Kido checked on Uorin.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah. But they'll swarm again."

Kido said as he took off his robe.

"Put on my clothes first. If your face becomes known..."

"Your Majesty."

Citizens of Kashan who had been hiding throughout the streets approached with dazed expressions.

"Are you truly... Your Majesty?"

Uorin, who had been looking at them with a pale face, bit her lips and averted her gaze.

Since they had heard rumors that Kashan would be saved by handing Uorin over to Gustav, the citizens' shock was great.

Kido narrowed his eyes and surveyed the surroundings.

'They can't bring themselves to ask directly, but you can tell just by looking at their expressions.'

They seemed to be asking with their expressions.

Where are you going?

Without even attendants, in shabby clothes, where exactly are you going?

The answer popped up automatically in each person's head.

'She's running away.'

Kido, who instinctively grasped the severity of the situation, blocked Uorin's path and shouted.

"Get out of the way! I'll kill anyone who blocks our path!"

Having seen Kido's prowess in tearing apart the demons, the residents hesitated and stepped back.

Yet they couldn't run away because of the anger boiling deep in their hearts.

"Kahaha! They're gathered over there! Enjoy yourselves!"

From the block across the way, a group of demons with menacing eyes were approaching.

"Follow me! Quickly!"

Kido grabbed Uorin's wrist and walked toward the people blocking their path.

'I have no choice but to kill them.'

Just as he was about to swing his double-bladed spear to cut their throats, the crowd miraculously parted to the left and right.

"Please go. We will buy you time."

Kido couldn't understand their decision, but Uorin left silently.

'Because I am the Empress. Because I have a noble life.'

Their judgment, trying to find even a thread of meaning at the end of despair, was so foolish.

'I exist on top of that foolishness.'

If so, she would use it thoroughly. If everyone had reasons to live anyway, she would think only of herself and act accordingly.

"Long live Her Majesty the Empress! Long live Kashan!"

Behind the fleeing Uorin, the voices of citizens being trampled by demons could be heard.

'Havitz.'

Uorin gritted her teeth.

'Havitz!'

All of Teraze's legacy was being destroyed.

"Aaaaah!"

Uorin clenched both fists and looked up at the sky, letting out a scream.

In Sirone's eyes as he descended through the atmosphere, Kashan's vast territory came into view.

'There's no time. I need to get as close as possible.'

The glass sphere he was restoring with Material's ability finally melted away in the heat.

'That's the place!'

At that point, Sirone spread his Shining Wings and flew at full speed toward Kashan's imperial capital, Aganos.

'It's tremendous.'

Even though there were still 20 kilometers to the capital, the sight of hell's army completely covering the sky and earth was starkly visible.

"Commander! A flying object approaches!"

At the scout's report, red light flashed in the eyes of Vanessa, the 3rd Division Commander of the 7th Corps.

Wearing heavy armor reminiscent of a rhinoceros, she dragged a 2-ton iron ball connected by chains as she moved.

"Yahweh..."

The moment she confirmed Sirone's face, her rotten, festering face twisted grotesquely.

"All forces, deploy! Strike down the abominable Yahweh!"

"Kiyaaaah!"

The demons, their faces transformed with disgust and hatred, bared their fangs and all leaped out.

Before the horizon even became visible, Sirone realized the ground was shaking.

'They're coming.'

The black mass that occupied the ends of his vision was charging with tremendous force.

'Compassion.'

He wanted to believe there was no evil that couldn't repent.

'A thousand times, ten thousand times, I can forgive. I could give chances a hundred thousand, a million times.'

However, if that blind love had made the child called Havitz go astray...

'I must teach him!'

Sirone's eyes widened as the Avatar of Light rose high into the sky.

'What he's doing wrong.'

Angel's Punishment.

At the same moment the archangel finished the motion of throwing his spear, a spear of light struck the ground.

KWAAAAANG!

A huge crater formed where the shockwave hit, but tens of thousands of demons filled the space again.

"Kehehehe! It's Yahweh! Stupid Yahweh!"

As the demons' voices became close enough to hear, Sirone drew out Justice.

'I won't run wild.'

With Yahweh's heart that loves everything.

'So just how angry I am. Even just half of half of the rage I must bear...'

Just half of half of that.

"Endlessly enduring, splitting and splitting again."

A fragment of anger smaller than dust, just one particle contained in that anger...

"Just half of half of that!"

Justice, which left Sirone's hand, began vibrating with a width of over 10 meters.

"Get it through your heads!"

Justice, having left Sirone's side, shrieked as if tearing the sky apart.

Kiyaaaaah!

One demon was the first to spot it.

"What is thatâ€”"

The moment he sensed something flying toward them, sounds of demons being pierced could be heard from all directions.

Puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-pung!

No one could see Justice's trajectory.

"Kraaaah!"

Only the screams at the end of annihilation that came too late echoed endlessly like four-dimensional space.

Vanessa gripped the handle of her iron mace and shouted.

"What's happening!"

Every time a black afterimage drew zigzag lines, demons were falling.

Watching her subordinates being erased by the thousands per second, Vanessa's shoulders trembled.

'What is that...'

A black monster that seemed to directly project Yahweh's wrath was moving around the battlefield.

The brigade commanders' trembling voices could be heard.

"Y-Yahweh..."

Vanessa's eyes became serious.

'We're getting scared.'

Of Yahweh, not Buddha.

"Don't talk nonsense! This is proof that Yahweh is no different from us!"

"Ah, aaaaah!"

All the demons lined up behind Vanessa began fleeing with terrified expressions.

Kiyaaaaaaaah!

As Justice howled for the second time, Vanessa's hearing was permanently damaged.

"Graaaah!"

As the blade that had swept through the front flew straight at her, Vanessa swung her iron mace with all her might.

"Kugh!"

But before the iron ball could even rise into the air, Justice pierced through the center of her chest.

In the pupils of Vanessa as she fell to her knees, Sirone with his Shining Wings spread was reflected.

"R-run..."

Sirone passed by in an instant.

"Away."

Vanessa, her face pressed to the ground, muttered weakly.

"Satan..."
