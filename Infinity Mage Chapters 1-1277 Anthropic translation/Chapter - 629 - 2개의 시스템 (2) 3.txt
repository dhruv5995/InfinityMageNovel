[629] Two Systems (2)

Within the Force Dimension, Shirone dominated space-time, and it seemed no one could break the absoluteness of that dimension.

Shirone and Fermi were the two massive axes controlling the battlefield, and the participants' goals couldn't be considered apart from these two.

"It's evenly matched. Both Shirone and Fermi are unwavering."

Ethela responded to Shiina's comment.

"Fermi is facing more opponents. Conversely, you could say the participants are more wary of Shirone."

Alpheas, sitting slouched, raised one corner of his mouth.

"He's hit his stride. 'I am the strongest.'"

When those words first came from Shirone's mouth, there probably wasn't a teacher who didn't doubt their ears.

"He's already broken through the limits of tension. He's probably thinking of nothing but passing."

"No."

Alpheas's thoughts differed from Olivia's.

"Even that's no longer in his head."

As 200 photon cannons overlapped, they pulsed as a wall of matter that made even the term "mass wave" seem inadequate, and Kongger and Frings staggered.

'It's like being hit by a lump of metal.'

In reality, their bodies would have been shattered first.

"Shirone!"

Canis, who had cast Limit of Abyss, charged in with temporary Immortal Function state.

'I'll win! On my master's name!'

As a massive Dark Worm materialized from the shadows of darkness arced down to strike, Shirone's movement hesitated for a moment.

"Oh my!"

Foltar flinched, but Miro was relaxed.

"His rhythm won't break from something like this."

Cracks appeared in the Dark Worm's shadow, then photon cannons exploded, completely dispelling the darkness.

"Victory through brute force."

Arin's mind, which had cast Mind Control, was destroyed when it was counterattacked by the mental strength of Diamond Buddha.

"Victory through mental power."

Shining Chain destroyed all of Kongger's steel wires and flew in to strike his solar plexus hard.

"Victory through precision."

Homing Photon Cannon flew around the ice waves to mercilessly bombard Frings.

"Victory through sensitivity."

Elizabeth felt a thrill at Baikal's evaluation.

"He's overwhelming in every domain."

The situation of suppressing competitors' specialties with the same specialties seemed surreal to the scouts.

"How could there not have been resentment?"

Having once been called a genius himself, Alpheas could understand Shirone's heart.

"How could he not have wanted to give up? He's human too."

Shirone, single-handedly pushing back enemies, gritted his teeth and fired Photon Cannons in rapid succession.

'They said I couldn't become a mage!'

There had been 20 years of thinking that.

"Gaaaah!"

Participant number 6. Has withdrawn from the 2000th system.

Starting with Kongger losing consciousness, Shirone's flashes rushed in even faster.

Participant number 12. Has withdrawn from the 2000th system.

Canis collapsed.

Participant number 8. Has withdrawn from the 2000th system.

Arin fell to her knees.

"Mental strength keeps recovering. 46 percent. 48 percent."

Heart, mind, and body were endlessly circulating around the avatar as the center, creating infinite power.

"It's as if he's asking whether you truly gave your all."

Albino spoke with a meaningful smile.

"It's as if he's asking whether you know the years he's lived."

Elizabeth's voice grew louder.

"Participant number 18! Number 20! Eliminated!"

Binder and Suabi, swallowed by the Force Dimension, lost consciousness and collapsed from Shirone's single strike.

'They're all just dying off.'

Luman fled from the Force Dimension like he was escaping, and even Frings, the only one who survived within Shirone's rhythm, couldn't muster the courage to approach twice.

"The situation's getting interesting."

Miro's gaze turned to Fermi.

'What will you do? At this rate, you'll... really get devoured?'

If Shirone imposed his system, probably all participants would pour a total assault on Fermi.

'Hmm, is this the graduation exam?'

Even so, Fermi was relaxed, and Hersy, who was pressing him, frowned as if disgusted.

"Monster-like bastard."

Even with former Golden Wheel members Lycan and Richard joining in, Fermi was still controlling the situation.

At that moment, Fermi's cold gaze aimed at Hersy.

"Child's play. Something like the 2000th."

Disaster Magic

Black Death.

Black smoke rose from Fermi's body and spread in all directions.

"What...!"

Teachers jumped to their feet and scouts' eyes widened.

"That's black magic, isn't it?"

"I thought it was already lost."

It was the magic of Carnes the Witch, a Black Line mage who once traveled the world and massacred a full 3 million people.

Fermi split his lips in an evil grin.

"This is the power of money."

Smoke spread as if an explosion had occurred at the center, then pitch-black specters burst out from the edges of the billowing clouds.

"Avoid it! If you're caught, it's over!"

All participants escaped outside the smoke, but few avoided the specters.

"Number 15 (Closer) eliminated! Number 23 (Hersy) eliminated! Number 13 (Dorothy) eliminated! Number 19 (Pandora) eliminated!"

With four people eliminated simultaneously, scouts began reviewing the regulations.

"Black magic, is it allowed?"

In reality, the participants hit by specters would have died in agony as their flesh rotted.

"As long as the 2000th can implement it, there's no problem with regulations. However, since it's magic banned by Red Line command, there might be talk later."

Lara said.

"Black Death is evil because it can't arbitrarily designate targets. That's why it's strong. The eliminated ones must be furious."

"You can't really say their luck was particularly bad."

Baikal said, alternately looking at Shirone and Fermi.

"After all, they chose number 1."

When Black Death's effect ended, the battle entered a lull.

With 9 people eliminated by Shirone and Fermi's attacks, the participants' minds became complicated.

'Now there are 16 survivors left.'

If just 6 more dropped out, graduation would be guaranteed.

'I've made it this far.'

That's why Maya, who had to bear the stigma of being the first eliminated in graduation exams every year, felt her heart pounding.

Though she somewhat benefited from Shirone and Fermi's systems meshing, that wasn't an important issue for her.

"Chief, sister might be able to pass."

The mystic tribe members sitting in a corner of the audience seats clasped their hands with desperate eyes.

"Maya..."

Though ignorant of magic, even the chief's eyes could confirm that Maya's skills were lacking.

'Poor child.'

Maya was a genius, but the place where she belonged wasn't a battlefield dominated by cold calculation.

'I'll definitely pass.'

Though she could comply with fate for the sake of her tribe, reality was harsh.

'It's Maya.'

'We need to eliminate Maya first.'

In a situation where even one elimination would dramatically increase the chance of passing, removing Maya, the weakest, was standard strategy.

As Fisho, Luman, and Sabina attacked from three directions, Maya felt her vision go dark.

'I can't drop out here!'

As she gritted her teeth with desperate resolve, Cayden blocked Maya's front and began attacking the three.

"Why?"

The most incomprehensible thing in this graduation exam was Cayden's responses.

She'd heard rumors that the faction centered on Fermi had dissolved, but the biggest reason she, with her inferior skills, could make it this far was because Cayden always appeared and secured positions at crucial moments.

'It must be coincidence.'

In graduation exams where personal feelings weren't allowed, there was no reason for Cayden, who wasn't even particularly close to her, to fight for her.

"The confrontation structure is getting complex."

It was the biggest turning point of the graduation exam, and the moment when the distinction between friend and foe truly disappeared.

'Rapid Stream!'

Intense blue water swirled around Pony, then violently swept in all directions.

'Mother, are you watching? Your daughter forging her own future.'

"Total weight 4.2 tons. Torrent coefficient 3.3. Kinetic energy per unit area 983 water per cubic meter."

Elizabeth analyzed, but Baikal didn't respond.

"Please give an evaluation. Currently, only number 11 doesn't have a grade recorded."

"...S."

"Pardon?"

Lara turned with surprised eyes.

"There were orders from above."

Pony was royalty.

"But..."

"Royal authority surpasses the Association's authority. Record it as S."

Baikal wasn't pleased with the situation either.

"It's the reality of monarchical rule. Don't analyze number 11 anymore. Whatever grade we assign, all magic institutions under the kingdom will bow and escort her."

"...Understood."

As Lara recorded in her notes, Baikal added a comment.

"Of course, she has to pass first."

With the final 10th place coming into view, attacking Shirone and Fermi was a foolish choice, and amid intense psychological warfare, no more eliminations occurred.

'Graduation is confirmed at least.'

Having already finished assessing the situation, Fermi leisurely crossed the chaotic battlefield, waiting for others to self-destruct.

"Hm?"

Then Photon Cannon flashes rushed in.

'Ghost Movement!'

Leaning back his upper body with automatic reaction algorithms, he saw Shirone flying toward him.

'Fermi. I won't let you pass at least.'

Reading Shirone's thoughts, Fermi's eyes filled with wickedness.

'Truly an excellent fool!'

As the two who received S-grade evaluations from scouts collided head-on, the audience's attention focused.

There could be no disagreement about Fermi's skill in facing Quantum Superposition while wielding countless advanced magics like tricks.

"Definitely number 1."

The more so, the greater Shirone's anger grew.

'Unforgivable!'

Every magic Fermi used was purchased with the defeats of students who had done their best for 6 years.

'Yes, I know. You must hate me.'

Having imagined Shirone's anger, Fermi thought of even more wicked ideas amid the chilling thrill.

'If blocking the opponent's desire is victory...'

Disaster Magic

Black Death.

'I'll pass with a smile, Shirone!'

Black smoke rose, and specters born from that evil energy spread in all directions.

If he eliminated 6 people here, even if Shirone killed him, he couldn't prevent his passing.

'Dark Sphere!'

As a full 200 Shirones simultaneously cast Dark Sphere, Black Death's smoke was sucked in, rotating like a whirlpool.

'Really struggling, aren't you, Shirone.'

Fermi snorted and charged at Shirone.

'Even so, you can't eliminate me. Unless it's Ataraxia, no magic will work.'

At that moment, the Archangel's avatar rose massively from Shirone's body as he extinguished the Force Dimension.

"What, what is that?"

At the sight of the avatar, which had only spread through the time period, revealing its form for the first time, observers' eyes widened.

'Faster! Faster!'

As the sequence formula raced at terrifying speed, the Archangel with wings spread wide flew high into the sky.

"Finally integrated."

Miro's eyes sparkled.

True Avatar Arts - it was the moment Shirone's omniscience, the god particle, was grafted onto the Archangel's avatar.

As the Archangel that had flown to the top of the Colosseum raised its spear and aimed at the ground, the time period converted to a space period and tremendous kinetic energy began concentrating in the spear.

'What the hell is that now?'

Fermi, who had been blankly looking up at the Archangel, realized something and cast teleportation.

"Damn it...!"

Avatar Arts

Angel's Punishment.

The spear thrust down by the Archangel raced at a speed impossible to follow with the eyes, connecting the beginning and end of coordinates with a line of light.

"Gaaahhh!"

Simultaneously, Fermi's torso, which had been moving as a flash, was pierced by the spear of light like a fish skewered by a harpoon.

"He got him during teleportation!"

The terminal velocity that transcended common sense - the power generated at that speed raced across Elizabeth's retina, trailing zeros.
