Trigger (1)

Between the 95th and 85th floors of the Ivory Tower, what had once been separate levels had become one massive floor, transformed into a gigantic battlefield.

From hundreds of meters above, Shirone's eyes focused with intensity as he looked down at Baal.

The Hand of God's photon cannon fired mercilessly, and moments later, the sound of tearing air exploded.

Baal's strike, his aura of strength, ripped through the photon cannon while clawing at the tower's inner walls.

"Gugh!" As the Miracle Stream wavered, Shirone exhaled roughly while surveying his surroundings.

'96th floor.'

For the first time, the 95th floor had been breached.

"Open the way, Yahweh." Though Baal's complexion didn't look particularly good either, he seemed to still have strength left.

Shirone thought to himself.

'He said he'd annihilate the Ivory Tower. If that's the case, what he's ultimately targeting is Taeseong.'

Many stars had once dominated an era within the Ivory Tower, but the center of gravity had always been Taeseong.

She urged them on, she soothed them, she made decisions, and it was humanity that she had protected in this way.

'It is intelligence that defines evil. When standards disappear, evil gains legitimacy.'

In the post-apocalyptic world, evil would become the new intelligence for surviving in the world.

Mica transmitted information.

"Thirty minutes have passed. Viper's preparations are complete. She's waiting for Shirone."

Just from that brief moment of electrical current, Baal sensed the enemy's intentions.

"You're planning something." Otherwise, there would be no need to desperately block him in the lower floors of the Ivory Tower.

'They're keeping my demon realm in check.'

If Deadly Cross were activated, disaster would strike not only the Ivory Tower but the entire northern hemisphere.

'The best outcome would be pushing me outside the Ivory Tower. But can they do it?'

As long as his will was rooted in the Ivory Tower, no force should be able to push him out.

"Yahweh."

As Baal raised his longsword above his head, a chilling sword energy spread across the blade like oil.

It was probably a life-or-death resolve comparable to the demon realm, manifested as the power of strength.

"Do you take me lightly? Even without Deadly Cross, I can annihilate the Ivory Tower."

'That's probably true.'

The energy Shirone felt from Baal was at a level that could penetrate the 97th and 98th floors.

'I have to consider this the final attack. The moment I'm pushed back here, there won't be a second chance.'

As the Hand of God blocked the front, Baal's eyes sank into a deep abyss.

"Here I come."

The moment those words fell, a vertical line was drawn across the landscape as if traced with a ruler.

That line, whose distance couldn't be gauged, was grasped by a hand of light whose distance also couldn't be measured.

"Graaaah!"

As if a palm had been cut, fragments of light burst forth like a fountain along the vertical line.

'97th floor.'

Even without controlling his power, it was so tremendously powerful that he had to make concessions.

'98th floor!'

With just one floor remaining, Shirone poured power into the Hand of God.

'I'll hold on!'

As Yahweh's will and Baal's will collided, the space of the 98th floor began to distort.

With a thunderous roar, shockwaves exploded, and Shirone's body was embedded in the ceiling of the 98th floor.

"Gah!"

In that position, he looked down to see Baal, wearing a demon's face, surging upward.

"Hyaaaah!" To avoid falling into the enemy's trap, what he chose was strength with all his heart and soul.

Shirone's eyes widened.

'He's planning to climb all the way to the top.'

The spine-chilling power was also magnificent, so even though he was an enemy, his heart grew hot.

As it collided with the Hand of God, the boundary line between golden light and purple light appeared distinctly.

Baal's will grew stronger.

'I'll break through.'

But the more that happened, the stronger Shirone's will contained in the Miracle Stream became as well.

'I'll block it!'

His body was being compressed, and a feeling of pressure in his stomach that seemed ready to explode washed over him.

'Is this Yahweh?'

How detestable an existence he was to the demon race wasn't important to Baal.

'Only weak beings whine. Whatever Yahweh is, I just need to surpass him.'

That's what he had thought.

'Can't I overcome this?'

It wasn't because Baal's will was weaker than Shirone's.

'He's embracing all of humanity. That would be an enormous weakness in any situation, but...'

Yahweh's will alone becomes something no one in this world can approach.

'How nice for you, human.'

He understood the feelings of other demons.

'I want to break him. I want to burn all my will and properly feel Yahweh's energy.'

At the first stage where his body began to be crushed, Baal turned away from his burning fighting spirit.

'Satan, my lord.'

Since all demons came from him, their power should also be used for Satan's purpose.

'Is this the moment?'

If he opened the demon realm and struck the Ivory Tower directly with Deadly Cross, his mission would be complete.

The meteor collision was hell's greatest weapon, but if it was the Ivory Tower, the exchange would be worth it.

Through the vibrations of the Hand of God, Shirone guessed Baal's intention.

'No.'

He absolutely had to prevent the demon realm from opening before humanity reached Ultima.

"Graaaah!"

In an instant, some thought flashed through Shirone's mind, and Baal's eyes widened.

The suppressed strength exploded dramatically as his sword rushed toward Shirone.

'Is he retreating?'

It would be unavoidable to prevent Deadly Cross from activating, but desperation didn't make sense either.

'Is it a trap?'

He knew that among Shirone's abilities was a technique that manipulated the mind like law.

'Yahweh is one who handles the mind. If he changes even my heart, that becomes reality.'

The corners of Baal's mouth rose.

'I won't be fooled.'

Without being certain of anything, he thrust his sword toward Shirone with full force.

And finally.

'What?'

Baal's longsword pierced through and passed through Shirone's abdomen.

'I really got stabbed by a sword...'

At the same time, he realized.

'Oh no!'

But it was already too late, and the Hand of God swept both of them up.

Thump thump, thump thump, in the 99th floor where the metallic sounds of the engine room could be heard, Baal surveyed the front.

Shirone, with a penetrating wound in his abdomen, was kneeling on one knee while holding his stomach.

'Such a method...'

There's magic that succeeds 100 percent.

If you want to show magic where a finger disappears, you just actually cut off the finger.

In the end, at the moment of stabbing the longsword into the abdomen, anyone would have no choice but to believe it.

'Because it's real.'

Baal walked toward Shirone.

"But what meaning does this have? You're mortally wounded, and you haven't harmed me."

As if he wouldn't give him time to heal his wounds, he immediately raised his longsword.

"Die."

At the same time, Viper in the control room pressed the button.

"Magnetic field reversal."

The moment the 68-ton battery shot out with a thud, Baal's body disappeared, and in his shocked eyes, he saw Shirone, who had also been hit by the battery.

'Was this it?'

As he moved away from the Ivory Tower at tremendous speed, Baal raised his strength to the extreme.

"Graaaah!"

But enduring the impact was all he could manage, and he couldn't even move a finger.

At the point where Shirone's gradually distant figure looked like a dot, Baal's nostrils contorted.

"Graaaaaaah!"

His roar of rage was buried in the snowstorm.

As the outer wall of the 99th floor collapsed, the tower's center of gravity suddenly shifted downward.

"Ahhh! We're going down!"

In the dizzying sensation of free fall, Tokai screamed and Viper bit her lip.

The remaining outer walls would cushion the impact, but that was only by building standards.

When the 100th floor was driven into the 98th floor, tremendous vibrations made their joints ache.

'Please, please!'

If even a 1 percent error occurred relative to the scale, the tower would crash into the ground.

"It stopped, it stopped."

Tokai muttered, and Viper examined the tower's balance displayed on the control screen.

The tower's tilt, which had seemed to maintain vertical position, was increasing from 0.1 degrees to 0.38 degrees.

"It's falling! It's because of the wind!"

Faced with the only variable they couldn't control, Artea, a 3-star resident, raised her fan.

"Wind Scene."

A bell-like sound was heard, then tremendous winds began to rage around the tower.

"It's still tilting!"

0.6 degrees to 0.72 degrees.

The Ivory Tower was the world's largest structure; if it tilted more than 1 degree, even a typhoon couldn't stop it.

"Artea! Increase the rotation!"

As Tokai, calculating fluid dynamics, gave instructions, the wind became even more violent.

"Whooooooo!"

"It's straightening! Just a little more!"

As the tower, which had been oscillating between plus and minus 0.5 degrees, regained its center, Artea exhaled.

"It's almost a vacuum. We'll have to maintain this state until the tower's connection construction is finished."

The situation allowed for fine adjustments because they had the strongest magician of the Blow series.

However, it was an unpleasant result since she would be tied to the control room, unable to help Singh.

"You knew from the beginning, didn't you?"

Feeling Artea's glaring gaze through narrow eyes, Viper shrugged her shoulders.

"Improvisation, improvisation."

Meanwhile, like Baal, Shirone was also caught in the battery's inertia.

'Too fast.'

The projectile weighed a whopping 68 tons.

Shooting such a thing with electromagnetic force was incomparable to explosive propulsion.

Though he prevented his body from bursting with Miracle Stream, the wound he received from Baal remained as it was.

As the Arctic headwind lowered his body temperature, even holding onto consciousness was an ordeal.

'How far am I going to fly?'

As the Corona Kingdom became visible beyond the horizon, the battery began to trace a parabolic arc.

'I'm falling.'

Though Miracle Stream would protect his body, a graceful landing seemed difficult.

The sounds of battle were heard.

"Maintain the defensive line! If we lose the Huig territory, it's a straight line to the Corona Kingdom!"

At that moment, the general looked up.

"What's that?"

A massive chunk of metal flew rapidly toward them and crashed right into the center of the demon army's camp.

KWAAAAANG!

Shirone, who fell in the snowfield, lifted his back.

"Oww."

After the crash, the battery rolled another 200 meters, crushing the demons in its path.

The demons stared blankly at that gruesome scene.

"What kind of bullsh—"

The demons who turned their heads again discovered Shirone with blood streaming down his chest.

"Yahweh?"

As the demons who had been approaching in a daze stepped back two or three steps, the squad leader shouted.

"H-hey! What are you surprised about? Since when have we been afraid of Yahweh? Everyone gather!"

It was a valid point in its own way, but for a single company to approach with interest felt quite ominous.

One demon muttered.

"...He looks hurt."

He seemed to still be conscious, but Yahweh's light couldn't leave his chest area.

"Sw-sword wound."

Yahweh had been stabbed by a sword?

The thought of who it could have been was brief, as a light of ecstasy rose in the demons' eyes.

"Kekeke! Kekekeke!"

The squad leader's shoulders suddenly broadened.

"Well well, did Yahweh come to repent? How gracious of him to personally visit to serve us delicious juice."

Shirone spoke.

"Stop the war. If you continue this meaningless killing, I won't stand for it."

Explosive laughter erupted from all directions.

"Puhehehe! What are you saying right now? Hey, do you know what condition you're in?"

Shirone's eyes filled with strength.

"I'm almost fully healed."

The laughter stopped abruptly, and the demons who exchanged glances all rushed forward at once.

"Kill him! Tear him apart!"

Just as the demons gathered and formed a mass like water flowing into a pit.

"Ahhhhh! What is this!"

Toxic smoke spread and the demons whose skin was melting scattered in all directions.

"Almost fully healed? You and your bluffing."

At the woman's voice, Shirone turned his gaze and discovered the familiar back of a woman.

"Miss Minerva."

Minerva, who turned around with a pipe in her mouth, smiled and winked.

"Welcome to Huig territory."

Based on the current time, it was the most fierce battlefield in the world.
