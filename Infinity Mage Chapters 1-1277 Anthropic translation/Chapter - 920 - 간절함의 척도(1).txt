The Scale of Desperation (1)

Omega Year 666.

"Save yourself."

Griffin muttered quietly as he watched the black rain falling from the sky.

Erasure Code.

This was the final measure Ankela had chosen after failing the second reset.

"Lesser Purification."

The black rain was dissolving everything it touched, erasing the landscape of the earth.

"Don't you plan to step forward this time?" asked Argoneth, who had been leaning against the cave wall where Griffin was hiding.

"Or is it that you cannot step forward?" Griffin spoke for the first time, having treated Argoneth as if he didn't exist despite being in the same space.

"I thought Taesung would come?"

Argoneth shrugged.

"As you can see..."

With everything rising above the horizon melting away, he could guess what state she was in.

"This place isn't safe either. There's nowhere to run. All life on earth will perish. Do you feel responsible?"

The Gaians had explosively increased their population to strengthen the Ultima System.

"It was too much. Even Ankela became overloaded. But look. This is the result."

Lesser Purification.

"Ankela chose to reduce the number of individuals, accepting the breaking of the law. Ultima is weakened, and you cannot win."

"Isn't it strange?"

Griffin smiled bitterly.

"In the days when Gaians weren't mentally perfected, many things happened. Killing their own kind, discriminating against the weak. We called that evil."

Even the Gaians, who had achieved an integrated mental system, had periods of conflict and discord.

"But Ankela defined all Gaians as evil. It means that departing from the photon system is a greater evil than murder, than any other crime."

Argoneth said, "Our mission is the perfection of the system. Murder and departure from the photon system are no different in that they both disrupt the world when viewed broadly. Of course, departure from the photon system is far more dangerous."

"I suppose so."

Perhaps a god should be indifferent.

"If a god had emotions, this world would be nothing but hell."

"Accept it. Emotions are uncontrollable signals. That's why the shadow world exists."

The system stabilizes by purifying the powerful emotions that flow into hell.

"Time is the same. Without 0.666 seconds of every second, photon signals wouldn't stabilize. Absolute time would be destroyed by the relativity felt by individuals."

"Right. Everything is a matter of the heart."

That's exactly why.

"I don't like it, this kind of world." It's too cold.

"I can imagine how much pain Taesung must be in, but what about you? How does it feel to watch all life disappear?"

All matter was flowing down, and huge, pitch-black rivers were flowing through the world.

"It's sad."

Argoneth looked up at the sky.

"This is what you've brought about. Ankela tried to give eternal life through the system of emptiness."

"Eternal life."

Among the creations Argoneth had made, there were creatures without lifespans, but it wasn't true eternal life.

"Eliminating the concept of lifespan is easy. You're like that too, actually. But in the end, when you die, it's over. Even if you live for a billion years, at the moment of death, the entire process becomes an instant. True eternal life is transcending the cycle of life and death."

The system of emptiness could make it possible.

"It's not too late even now. Give up resistance and submit to Ankela's will. Enter the next world."

If the Gaians block the emptiness, all higher universes will eventually perish.

Griffin said, "I dream. In that dream, I dream again. If I keep dreaming endlessly like that, it seems like I'll never wake up... but on the other hand.

"Time keeps flowing in the original world. When the sun rises and fatigue is relieved, I'll eventually wake up from sleep."

Argoneth countered, "But you'll never wake up. The subject's consciousness keeps digging deeper into dreams."

A massive contradiction created by time and mind.

"Think carefully, Griffin. This world began with a single, unique and irreversible delusion. If you block the emptiness, everything will disappear. Everything will become nothing again. Don't you know how terrible that state is?"

Even the infinite mage felt a chilling thrill when thinking of the state of infinite nothingness.

"...I have a favor to ask."

Argoneth had no intention of helping, but he was interested in what Griffin's favor might be.

"What is it?"

"Save them."

Argoneth couldn't find words to respond.

"Of course, I'm going to fight. But you don't want the world to end like this either, do you?"

"So? What exactly do you want me to do?"

"Just 2 people..."

Griffin held up his index and middle fingers.

"Just let 2 people avoid the Lesser Purification. No matter how much you hate us, they're your creations, aren't they?"

"There's no way to avoid it. Ankela's Erasure Code won't stop until all life disappears."

"Come on, we're both veterans here."

"You know how many species I've created. Surely we're not the only ones in this universe?"

"The universe isn't vast. It's just trapped within light-speed barriers because it's based on photon signals. The number of living beings is also much fewer than you think."

"Rather... it sounds like there are some?"

Argoneth, hit right on target, finally spoke up.

"Terraforce."

"Oh? Are they a species similar to us?"

"Different. Gaians are a species that developed the mind to its extreme. Meanwhile, dragons reached the pinnacle of information. If those are quantum code and photon code respectively, Terraforce is positioned in between."

"Hmm, in between."

Something that can contain both mind and information?

"Sound."

That was the correct answer.

"Right. Terraforce is a species that pushed waves to their extreme. Their technological power even surpasses the Gaians. They can transmit information beyond the light-speed barrier."

This meant intergalactic travel was possible.

"Magnificent."

"They're an excellent species. Much more stable, devout, and strict than you."

Argoneth's emotions were conveyed through sound.

"Right, sorry for being such a reckless species. Anyway, will you convey my intentions to Terraforce?"

Back to the main point.

"Why should I? It's not that I dislike you. The problem is the link. There must be a reason why Gaians among countless species were linked to the Idea, but my conclusion is failure. You're undermining the stability of the world."

Griffin proposed, "Fine, then let's do this. If 2 Gaians open a new world, let Terraforce judge. If even the new humanity descends into chaos, they can destroy it."

"Hmm..."

"What do you think?"

Argoneth rested his chin on his hand.

"Be precise. Does the scope you mentioned include departure from the photon system? No one should approach the secrets of the world."

"Of course. Even if we lose, I want the survivors to live to the end. Even if it's an eternal dream."

Tsk tsk tsk tsk.

Argoneth's body began to seep into the ground as he clicked his tongue rapidly, lost in thought.

"Select 2 people."

His voice echoed in the cave after he disappeared.

"I'll send an ark."

The holy sanctuary of God, Arabot.

Only the spire piercing through the sky was the sole place on the planet where the rain wasn't falling.

"The war is over."

In the angel's chamber, Ikael took in the flow of black rivers spread out beyond the window.

"They will fight."

When he turned his gaze, Satiel was suddenly beside him.

"Still won't break their stubbornness. The Gaians will be completely annihilated by this. The Ultima System will disappear too."

"If that's truly the case, then we too have lost the opportunity to approach the secrets of the world."

Ikael kept his mouth firmly shut.

The tiresome fight with the Gaians was over, but he felt an emptiness in one corner of his heart.

"Why do you side with humans?"

Ikael asked.

"The secrets of the world? Even without such things, as long as we win, it doesn't matter at all. Is that really the only reason?"

"Of course not."

Satiel smiled with her eyes as she saw hexagonal light spreading across the sky beyond the horizon.

"There's exactly one more reason."

"Phew, damn it."

The Gaians who had taken shelter under Griffin's hexagonal light were gasping for breath.

"Is everyone okay?"

Partran, the representative of the Gaians, looked up.

"Griffin."

One who had transcended the concept of lifespan and endlessly followed the long history of the Gaians.

"This isn't your affair to interfere with. No matter what happens, we must protect the Ultima System."

"Then you'll all die."

Even Griffin couldn't do anything against the force that seemed ready to melt the entire planet.

"Is there a method?"

"One thing. No, I should say 0.5 things. But there's something we must do first before implementing it."

"What must we do?"

Griffin brought up the matter of the ark.

"Select 2 people?"

"Right. Even if we can stop the Lesser Purification, 90 percent of the Gaians will disappear. But you'll fight to the end, won't you?"

Partran nodded.

"Humanity must be maintained regardless of who wins. In that sense, we decided to send 2 people."

Since they were connected through Ultima, they didn't go through the complex procedure of a conference.

"It should be the two people we love most."

As if by agreement, everyone turned to look at one couple.

"Um, excuse me..."

A fragile-looking man and a woman with large, innocent-looking eyes approached.

Griffin smiled with his eyes as he looked at those who would have to embark on a long journey.

"What's your name?"

"Huh? Oh, yes. I'm Adam."

Griffin nodded and looked to the side.

"I'm Lilith."

Adam and Lilith.

These were names that carried the mission of becoming new humanity on the planet they would reach.

"Right. You'll hear the detailed story on the ark. From now on, you'll live endlessly like me. You must trust and love each other in any situation. You must never cross the forbidden line. Chaos will come to the world."

The two nodded as if making a vow.

"Yes. Don't worry. I love Adam, and I'm confident we'll be together for life."

The moment Lilith's eyes sparkled with determination.

'That woman is...'

Shirone, who was receiving Omega's records, felt his heart drop.

Though her appearance was completely different, the light in her eyes perfectly resembled someone from the present.

'Uorin?'

It was the gaze of mitochondrial Eve.

"Right. Remember this absolutely. Both good and evil are defined by you. You must never lose Ultima."

As Griffin received their final vow, a massive disc-shaped flying object appeared, cutting through the clouds.

"The ark."

It was the technology of the species that would judge humanity.

"Go. I'll send you off."

Partran asked, "What do you plan to do? It's authority powerful enough to make the administrator break the law. You can't block it with Hexa."

"Not until I know what it is."

"Then?"

"I'll swallow it."

Griffin smiled and flew up toward the black rain that was erasing everything.

The moment Hexa's barrier touched the raindrops, it shattered, and his body entered the black clouds.

"Save yourself?"

In the pain of his body burning away, Griffin gritted his teeth.

"Don't talk nonsense."

Miracle Stream.

With an explosion, a massive hole of light formed and began sucking in the surrounding clouds.

"Aaaahhh!"

Ankela's fury, emotions that wouldn't be satisfied even by destroying the entire world, struck Griffin.
