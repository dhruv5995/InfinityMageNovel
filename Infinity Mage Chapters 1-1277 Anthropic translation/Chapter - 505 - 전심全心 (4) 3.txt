[505] Whole Heart (4)

"Kariel……"

Satiel couldn't believe it.

By her standards at least, he had been the most intellectually beautiful and refined handsome man among the archangels.

But she could no longer find any trace of his former appearance in the current Kariel.

As Piel brutally trampled him, his waist was completely folded backward and crushed against his upper body.

His face was between his legs, and his chest was completely torn apart by the energy of annihilation.

With only his lower half exposed on the ground while looking up at the sky, his appearance was perhaps the most miserable sight in the world.

But his eyes were deeper than ever before and filled with nothing but tranquility.

'Ah, I see.'

Even setting aside his broken waist, Piel's annihilation energy mercilessly gnawed away at Kariel's weakened existence.

It was a situation that couldn't be maintained for long anyway.

But the peace he regained at the end of his existence was as sweet as compensation for the long years he had spent hating Ikael.

'I should have just... given everything from the beginning.'

If he had known he would hate this much, if he had known he would waste countless years on pointless hatred.

He should have just done everything she wanted.

'Well, it doesn't matter now.'

He thought he could never forgive her. He thought no logic could change his mind.

But the moment he saved Ikael, his hatred disappeared like a lie.

What remained in place of the hatred was only narcissistic satisfaction from saving her and deep regret.

"Kariel, are you okay?"

At Satiel's voice, Kariel turned his head with difficulty.

For the first time since the war began, he thought about his role as an archangel.

"You mustn't annihilate Ikael."

Satiel's face contorted.

"What are you saying right now...!"

"I'm going to be annihilated soon. You know that."

Satiel ground her teeth.

Metatron and Methiel had been annihilated, and Kariel wouldn't last much longer either.

If Ikael were also annihilated, the disappearance of four archangels would tip the scales of law toward Satan.

If that happened, no means at the angel level could stop Satan.

"I understand your feelings. You're different from me. You don't even have someone to give your heart to."

Satiel found even that fact hateful.

"Heart? Do you think angels, noble spiritual beings, would be swayed by something like a heart?"

"Hehe."

Kariel smiled dryly as he looked up at the sky.

"You're already being swayed."

Sensing the end of his life, Kariel pulled up a very old memory that had sunk into the abyss.

'Isn't that right, Ikael?'

"In the beginning, there was amplification."

Ikael called Kariel and Uriel to explain.

"Within that amplification, the concepts of being and non-being were born. That is, existence and non-existence occurred."

Meeting eyes with Kariel, who was listening with bright eyes, Ikael gently stroked his head with an affectionate touch.

Kariel was delighted like a cat.

"Being and non-being. The concepts that govern them are creation and destruction—that is, you two."

Kariel asked.

"Then what existed before the amplification? Was there nothing at all?"

Ikael always liked Kariel, who was full of curiosity.

"Hehe, nothing at all means..."

Uorin said.

"Nothing at all."

Gando listened intently, watching every expression on Uorin's face as she spoke about the beginning.

"That is, there was no time or space. It's different from imagining a blank sheet. Even if you erase a blank sheet, it's not nothingness."

Humans understand nothingness but cannot experience it. Because nothingness exists before experience.

"Then what existed before this world was created? Was it ultimately a state of nothingness?"

"Probably so."

"But Gando, you must think about it this way. If the state of 'being' doesn't exist in this world, then the state of 'not being' cannot exist either."

Therefore, even if there was nothing in the beginning, humans should not define it as 'nothingness.'

The moment it's defined as nothingness, a contradictory situation occurs that actually violates the concept of nothingness.

"Then how do we define the primordial state?"

Uorin raised her index finger and said.

"Shutdown state."

"Shut down?"

Kariel asked back.

He already understood but had the desire to hear it once more.

"Yes. Whether something exists or not, that itself is in a shut-down state. Therefore, there is no matter or even concepts..."

Ikael cut to the chase and moved on.

"Some action occurred."

Even an archangel born from the original source concept could only express the shutdown state in this way.

"That action changed the shutdown state to an on state. Right at that starting point of amplification..."

Uorin raised both index fingers and crossed them in an X shape.

"Two states of being and non-being are born, referring to each other. Information defined as 0 and 1 combines in infinite patterns, and this universe finally begins to be created."

Uriel asked.

"Then what is amplification?"

Since she wasn't usually an angel who showed curiosity, Ikael turned her head with an interested expression.

"What action amplified this world?"

Ikael smiled awkwardly.

"That's... something even I cannot know."

Uorin said.

"No one can know. But something acted, and this world awakened. What was that action? A very weak electrical stimulus? A massive explosion powerful enough to push the universe? Actually, it doesn't matter what it was."

Uorin snapped her fingers.

"The fleeting moment that burst from my fingertip could be the beginning and end of some universe. Or it could be something like an absolute command from a transcendent being."

"I see."

The possibilities are infinite, making even the reality unknowable.

What's important is the fact that something was amplified through some action.

"But surprisingly, or should I say mysteriously?"

Uorin leaned back against the chair and crossed her arms.

"Humans have one word that perfectly resembles that action. Would you like to guess?"

Gando pondered for a long time but finally couldn't resist asking.

"I don't know. What is it?"

"It is..."

After pausing for a moment, Uorin smiled meaningfully and said.

"Heart (心)."

"Kuuuuuu!"

Within his collapsing mind, Shirone regained even a faint light of stability.

Finally, his vision opened and he could see Ikael's face, so pale it was almost transparent.

'Why...'

Shirone also knew it was already beyond recovery.

He was prepared for it, and therefore had no regrets or lingering attachments.

But Ikael was desperately trying to save such a Shirone.

Why on earth?

What meaning could extending his life by just a few minutes have for her?

"Foolish one."

Piel activated Apatheia to crush Ataraxia.

"Kyaaaaaaak!"

As Ikael's scream erupted, Shirone's mind, which had been slowly taking shape, wavered and poured down again.

"Huuuuuk!"

Shirone endured with all his heart.

'No! It can't end like this!'

When everything was rushing toward the end, what came to Shirone's mind was Zulu's teaching.

What dominates the mind is the heart.

But since the heart has no substance, it cannot be trained.

'The secret of the Thoughtless Mind.'

Containing oneself within the circulation of breath to stop the heart's activity.

'I have to control the explosion!'

Shirone took a deep breath and slowly exhaled.

With each exhaled breath, important things were discarded one by one.

No Ikael, no heaven, no life or death, no hatred filling his head.

Only breathing in and breathing out.

Returning to the basics of living beings.

"Huu. Haa. Huu. Haa."

Thump.

Shirone's Spirit Zone, which had lost elasticity and was drooping, suddenly regained elasticity and bounced up tautly.

"Heart."

Gando recited Uorin's words.

"Yes. Whatever the primordial event was, what's needed for that event to occur is the heart. This universe began from the action of that heart."

Uorin rolled up her sleeve and extended her right fist.

"Therefore, the heart changes the law."

Bang!

As her elbow extended at an invisible speed, her fist pierced through the air and a shockwave exploded.

"I want to throw my fist at transcendent speed. This wholehearted desire changes the law and moves the body."

"That's divine transcendence."

"Divine transcendence, Yaksha."

Uorin corrected with the precise term.

"Momentarily amplifying anger to change the law acting on the body. The action of the heart is truly mysterious."

"That's impressive skill."

"Hehe, then let me show you one more thing while we're at it."

Uorin raised her fist again and aimed it at Gando.

"I will pierce through your face."

Saliva gulped down Gando's throat.

Knowing her will was sincere made his hair stand on end.

"How about it? Is this possible too?"

Gando, who had calmly settled his mind, shook his head.

"It's impossible."

"Why?"

"Because it exceeds the authority of the heart."

Uorin nodded and lowered her arm.

"Right. Will belongs only to me. Even if I deliver my best strike, your face being penetrated is a completely different matter."

"Because divine transcendence is a way of dominating the body."

"However."

Uorin suddenly raised her fist again like a surprise attack.

And before Gando could say anything, she extended her elbow at tremendous speed.

"How about this?"

Bang!

Her fist struck the empty air and an explosion sound erupted.

Though it was an absolutely unreachable distance, Gando distinctly felt as if her fist had flown over and smashed his face.

"......"

Gando's arms trembled as he barely held back a scream.

It was much later that he realized his face was still intact.

"......How is this possible?"

Uorin was satisfied with Gando's self-control.

An ordinary human would have lost their mind.

"What I attacked wasn't your body but your avatar. Therefore, you saw my will to smash your head."

Gando finally understood.

How much of a monster the young girl sitting before him was.

"Mental transcendence."

Uorin corrected again.

"Mental transcendence, Prajna. Controlling the avatar in a state of completely emptying the mind. It's the opposite of divine transcendence, which concentrates the mind. It's not a level that a human living 100 years can master. Even those who have realized avatars cannot easily imitate it."

Gando honestly acknowledged it.

For him as a mage, mental transcendence was a sweet dream, but no amount of effort would allow him to reach that level.

Because it wasn't a place that could be reached through effort in the first place.

"I didn't mean to discourage you. There are both Yaksha and Prajna in the world, but they're just that. Actually, didn't you withstand my strike?"

"Thank you for the high evaluation."

Gando was sincere.

It was moving that Uorin, who usually treated him as less than a bug, would say such things for his sake.

But that's why there was also a bitter aspect.

In the end, he was just an object of pity.

If it weren't for the memories of Theraze Mystra, his biological mother, there would have been no reason for her to show him such affection.

Uorin observed Gando, who was making a gloomy expression, for a moment before bursting into a chuckle.

She wondered if she had treated him too well, but it seemed fine just for today.

After all, he was a son who would soon have to take on a heavy responsibility.

"Breathe in and breathe out."

"Pardon?"

Gando looked up with a questioning expression, but Uorin only repeated the same words.

"Breathe in and breathe out."
