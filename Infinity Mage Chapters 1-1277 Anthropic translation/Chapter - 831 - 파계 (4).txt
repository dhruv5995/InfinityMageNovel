Fallen (4)

Rian entered the cabin and quickly packed his belongings, finishing his preparations to leave.

"What will you guys do?"

Though the Zive soldiers had retreated for now, the hunters couldn't guarantee their safety once Rian left.

"There are no more vampires now."

Though one Lord had yet to awaken from dormancy, Zenia was confident she wouldn't lose control.

"I'll gather the hunters and organize a death squad. I won't leave a single vampire alive in this world."

When that happened, Zenia and the hunters would finally be able to live freely in the world.

"Alright, be careful."

"You too. Zive isn't the only one targeting you. You might end up fighting the entire world."

Rian smiled confidently.

"It doesn't matter. I was prepared for this."

Having already witnessed his martial prowess firsthand, any further words would just be nagging.

"Rian..."

They would each walk their own paths, but she felt certain they would never meet again.

"How about coming with us?"

Zenia gathered her courage to speak.

"Come with us. The Nephilim commander said it—a great war is coming. How about we join forces and fight together?"

Rian shook his head.

"I have somewhere I need to go."

Zenia recalled what Rian had told her before.

"The person you truly want to protect? You said they were much stronger than you."

"Of course. But now I can be of help to them. And..."

Rian looked back at the sunset.

"They're probably having a really hard time right now."

Unlike Rian, who could throw away everything just to become stronger, Shirone had many things to protect.

Now was the time to share their hardships as Shirone's sword.

"The descendants of the Archdemon are gone, but there are still countless demons in this world."

Rian said, placing a hand on her shoulder.

"Let's meet on the battlefield."

At those words filled with meaning, Zenia chuckled and lightly punched his chest.

"Don't go around destroying everything."

Though he couldn't promise that, Rian nodded and left the hunters' hideout.

'He was planning to return to his family home, but...'

The destination of the strongest great swordsman was the Ivory Tower.

Heaven.

After the war that had cost countless angel lives, Ankera had hidden herself from view.

The one granted full authority was Archangel Ikael, but she had remained silent for a very long time.

Then one day, Nane's voice reached them.

I permit the fallen nature of all beings.

Angels and demons alike, fairies and giants, and even immortals—they all knew what impact this would have on Heaven.

And now, for the first time since the war ended, the White Mirror—a gathering of archangels—was convened.

The archangels gathered in the pure white space were Ikael, Uriel, Satiel, and Rayel.

"Exactly half are gone."

At Uriel's words, the archangels fell silent.

The eight source concepts that sustained this world.

But now each of them had lost their exact counterpart.

Amplification had lost Extinction, Destruction had lost Birth, Decomposition had lost Synthesis, and Light had lost Gravity.

Rayel, the Archangel of Light, asked:

"To resurrect an archangel, Ankera's power is absolutely necessary. But Ankera is no longer here. What is the reason for convening this half-formed White Mirror?"

"Ymir has broken through the ice barrier."

At Ikael's words, the angels' photon bodies stiffened.

"Didn't you say special... laws were in effect?"

As far as Satiel knew, Niflheim's ice sea was a world of absolute stillness where even souls would freeze.

"It wasn't really a place capable of containing Ymir anyway. The reason he stayed quiet wasn't because of Ankera."

Uriel said.

"Because it was meaningless."

If there was no opponent capable of destroying him, then Ymir had no need to do anything either.

Rayel looked at Uriel.

"Then now, are you saying it has become meaningful?"

"Something is happening. Somewhere other than Heaven."

Only Ikael could provide an answer, but she kept her mouth firmly shut.

"So then..."

After a long while, just as Satiel was about to speak, the White Mirror space began to vibrate.

"What is this?"

The archangels' photon bodies expanded into halos as sharp gazes swept the surroundings.

"You've come."

Only Ikael remained calm, but her eyes were coldly sunken, unlike usual.

As the vibration intensified, two hands suddenly thrust into the White Mirror space.

Satiel jumped up.

"Who are you!"

The White Mirror was a place born from the most pure collective consciousness that only archangels possessed.

No impurity could tear through that consciousness and enter.

"Graaah!"

As the crude hands tore open the White Mirror space, the angels' photon bodies swayed left and right.

"Who do you think?"

Finally a voice flowed in, and at that moment everyone realized.

"It's me, of course."

Ymir, King of the Giants, pushed his body inside while tearing the White Mirror open.

"Ugh!"

The walls instantly healed, but the intrusion of the foreign substance called Ymir was intensely unpleasant to the angels.

"Are you insane, Ymir?"

The reason he could inflict physical shock on angelic consciousness was because Ymir was a fusion of Gaians.

To him, strength was pure energy itself, beyond the physical power of living beings.

"I knew you'd be here."

Ignoring Uriel's provocation, Ymir looked at Ikael.

"No matter how much I called, there was no answer."

Finally, Ikael's lips parted.

"What's your reason for wanting to see me?"

"War."

Ymir approached Ikael.

"Send me there. You can do it, can't you?"

The human organization called Zion was still blocking Heaven's invasion.

Of course, the person with the strongest defensive power was Adrias Miro, who had protected the Maze's space-time.

"Don't be arrogant, Ymir."

Ymir's eyebrows twitched.

"I know what you're thinking. But starting a war for your personal reasons is absolutely unacceptable."

"Personal reasons."

Ymir placed his hand on Ikael's shoulder.

The three angels simultaneously rose to kill him, but Ymir's words came first.

"Isn't that the same for you?"

Satiel was the first to lower his hostility, and the other two archangels also looked at Ikael.

"Ankera's Akashic Records have passed to Nane. Then Heaven should find Nane as quickly as possible. Yet you cannot make a decision."

Ikael couldn't refute this.

'Shirone.'

The child who carried Guffin's will.

"I know roughly through Suoui. Ikael, you... have recovered your memories, haven't you?"

Ankera had erased Ikael's sins, but through tremendous amplification, had restored all her memories.

"That's why you can't go. Well, that's fine. But there's one thing I want to hear. Why did you bear a human child?"

As the three archangels sat back down, Ikael was obligated to answer.

Satiel glared at Ikael with hostility.

'I too loved Guffin.'

Though she no longer knew who Guffin was, the longing for him still remained in her consciousness.

'But even so, bearing a child is unimaginable.'

Angels were concepts.

There was no reason for them, who were ideas themselves, to have children with humans who were mere shadows.

"First, Shirone is not my child."

Ikael declared.

"The child died. At the moment of birth. It wasn't even given a name."

"But it's not completely unrelated, is it?"

Ikael didn't speak about that.

"The reason Ankera prohibited fallen nature was... because no one should know the secrets of this world."

"Are there secrets even we don't know?"

"That's why they're secrets. Even Ankera herself. These are things that shouldn't even be approached."

Ikael raised her index finger.

"We are concepts, and therefore exist eternally. In contrast, humans are material and mortal. Therefore, they are under our dominion and submit for the sake of eternal life."

This was Heaven's law.

"But what if it's actually the opposite?"

"Opposite?"

"What if we were actually created by humans, and humans are the ones who have discovered the secret of eternal life?"

The archangels' photon bodies trembled.

"We might exist merely for human convenience. Nothing more than components sustaining this world. If that were the case, what would happen?"

The atmosphere in the White Mirror became explosively tense.

"We would become mortal. When this world closes, we would become nothing. Conversely speaking..."

Ikael looked at everyone as she spoke.

"Humans are the true gods."

Satiel jumped up.

"What nonsense is that! Those weak humans are gods? Humans are the ones desperately struggling because they hate this world!"

"That's why they can achieve fallen nature."

"Ah..."

Satiel stepped back.

"Fallen nature is an exception to the rules. Some humans ignore certain rules of this world. And that wouldn't be possible without an outside world."

Longing appeared on Ikael's face.

"This is Guffin's hypothesis."

Satiel bit her lip.

"Guffin."

"I don't know. As an archangel, I fought fiercely against Guffin. But after hearing his words, I thought about it. If we're merely information, is there a reason we should exist?"

"So that's why the child?"

"I simply... wanted to carry it on."

Like the Gaians who had left the photon world.

"But I couldn't."

The child died, and Ankera revoked Ikael's full authority for committing a grave sin.

Emerging from her recollection, Ikael announced to everyone with a stern face again.

"Ankera absolutely never permitted fallen nature. Not even when Heaven was on the brink of destruction."

But now the situation was different.

"Ankera asked Hexa: Why can I not become a god? But Hexa's answer was unexpected. Despite coming from outside, he tries to protect this world."

Perhaps it was because he came from outside.

Rayel said.

"So that's why Ankera chose Nane."

Nane was a being trying to go from inside to outside.

"At first, I waited. I believed he would guide us outside. But we were blocked by Hexa's barrier."

"All this talk about this and that."

Ymir said gruffly.

"In the end, we have to go anyway. Whether we smash all the humans or follow Nane outside."

"Satan is there."

An existence beyond law.

Satan, born from all human chaos flowing together, was the worst possible opponent for angels.

"But Nane has permitted fallen nature."

Uriel said.

"We won't be easily defeated like before."

Rayel, who had been listening to the discussion, looked at Ikael and said.

"Now is the time to make a decision. If anyone other than Nane prevails in this world, Heaven has no future."

Ikael knew they ultimately had to go, but the reason she still struggled was...

'Shirone.'

Going to the earthly world would inevitably mean clashing with Hexa.

As everyone waited for Ikael's judgment, she closed her eyes and fell into thought before opening her mouth.

"Organize the army."

Heaven began to move.
