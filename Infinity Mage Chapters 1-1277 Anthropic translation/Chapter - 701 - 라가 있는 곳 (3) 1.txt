[701] Where Ra Is (3)

Rian and Kido's faces turned pale at the decision to go to the place where 19,000 worlds existed.

'Surely he's not planning to search through all of them.'

It was impossible to guarantee how long it would take just to search through a single world.

"Hmm, good judgment."

Wuorin said.

"Andre's conquest difficulty could be called the worst among the three labyrinths. But if it's you..."

Because it was Guffin's ruins, and because the Hexagon that Guffin designed was none other than Shirone.

"Right. I'll use the Ultima System. If Guffin could do it, then I should be able to as well. If each labyrinth has a one-third chance of containing the Ra Enemy, then I'll bet on Andre."

Wuorin stood up.

"Good, let's depart immediately. Gando, have Ratusa on standby."

"Understood."

After Gando left, Shirone asked.

"What's Ratusa?"

"Hehe, you'll know when you see it. You can't cross the desert in a carriage, can you?"

'Hmm, a desert-specific means of transportation?'

Guessing as much, when he followed Wuorin out into the corridor, a group had blocked the passage.

Shirone immediately realized their identity.

"Wind Blade."

The world's strongest swordsmanship group that had instantly chopped Kazura's Magic Department Head Bosoon into porridge-like pieces.

The fact that Wuorin only realized the uninvited guests' presence after hearing Gando's words showed just how secretly she had conducted her meeting with Shirone.

But because of that, Wind Blade was not pleased, and their anger was transferred entirely to Shirone's group.

Rian observed the thirty swordsmen wearing owl masks.

'So those are Wind Blade.'

Befitting those who had cut Quan's Achilles' heel, each one's aura was extraordinary.

But what was truly frightening was the collective killing intent - the intimidation - that all of them were emanating simultaneously.

'Are they asking for a fight?'

An ordinary swordsman would lose their life the moment they were exposed to such intimidation, but it couldn't even make a dent before the will of divine transcendence.

'Indeed, they're no ordinary uninvited guests.'

As Wind Blade unified their thoughts, the one standing at the front of the triangular formation removed their owl mask.

Seeing the face of an Asian woman, Rian was certain.

'That woman is the leader.'

She had the eyes of a demon.

"Your Majesty, why did you bring in foreigners without even a word to us?"

She was probably the only one who could dare show displeasure to Kashan's Empress, but Wuorin responded coldly.

"What are you talking about? Isn't protecting me your duty? What were you doing when I was surrounded by such people?"

"..."

None of Wind Blade moved, but an energy of a different dimension from intimidation rippled forth.

Kido wrinkled his nose at the optical illusion of the surrounding scenery distorting like oil floating on water.

'She really is a pervert, this woman.'

Wind Blade's leader spoke quietly.

"I will make no excuses. However, if that's the case, may we correct our mistake even now?"

Rian, sensing the killing intent, blocked Shirone's front, but Wuorin shook her head firmly.

"No, the opportunity is already gone. You're all fired."

Wind Blade's leader found Wuorin difficult to read.

'I have no idea. What exactly is she thinking?'

Then Wuorin wrapped her arms around Kido's neck from behind.

"I don't need incompetent ones like you. I already have such an excellent bodyguard right here."

"What?"

Shirone and Rian looked dumbfounded, but the most absurd one in this situation was Kido.

"What nonsense are you spouting? Why would I be your bodyguard?"

"I've always wanted to try keeping an interesting pet. If I put a collar on you and keep you by my side, it would be much more comfortable than Wind Blade. How about you stop traveling and let me take care of you from today?"

"Hmph! A mere human thinks she can tame me?"

"What's wrong with that? I'm only making this offer because you're the Goblin King. You like crawling, don't you? Good. From now on, standing on two feet is forbidden."

Kido's eyes grew coldly calm.

"...Shirone, can I kill this woman?"

Simultaneously, Wind Blade's leader drew their sword, and the remaining 29 performed the same motion without the slightest error.

"It would be wise to choose your words carefully. If you lay a hand on Her Majesty, we'll make you feel pain beyond what any living being can imagine."

In the explosive situation, Wuorin embraced Kido's neck even more tightly and whispered.

"Kido, you'll fight for me, won't you? Don't believe what they say. I fired them. They're going to try to kill me."

'This woman is completely insane.'

Just as Kido's eyes blazed fiercely, Wuorin bared her teeth in a grin and kicked his buttocks.

"Go! Sweep away those worthless things, pet goblin!"

"Kido!"

The moment Shirone shouted, Wind Blade dissolved their formation like smoke and flew in.

Wuorin held her stomach and laughed, but all Kido could hear was the sound of the gale created by their swords.

'Damn it!'

Though they clearly had human bodies, Wind Blade's movements were definitely not human.

Kido rolled on the floor and swung his spear, avoiding the whirlwind of blades sweeping like a gale.

'This is...'

Wind Blade's leader intuited from just that momentary movement.

'One who has mastered the principles of earth.'

The paths of Wind Blade, following the laws of wind, and Kido, following the laws of earth, became entangled in the narrow space.

The air friction was like burning fire.

"Graaah!"

As Kido rolled and broke free, Wind Blade's members spread out like a flock of crows and stood behind Wuorin.

"Your Majesty, please rather command us to commit suicide. We cannot bear the shame of losing our position to a mere goblin."

Wuorin's laughter had already disappeared.

"What about your incompetence in failing to handle even such a goblin?"

Wind Blade's leader bit their lip as if there was no room for excuses, but Kido thought differently.

'If I had fought for just one more second...'

He probably would have been chopped into chunks of meat.

Unable to fathom Wuorin's intentions, Wind Blade's leader spoke in a desperate voice.

"If you give the command, anything..."

"I don't want to hear it. Get lost. For the next three days, maintain your most painful state on your own. Pathetic things."

The leader immediately bowed their head.

Though the most painful state would differ for each person, it was actually most comfortable when she gave clear instructions like this.

"We humbly accept your command."

As Wind Blade smoothly lifted their bodies and disappeared as if the corridor was sucking them away, Shirone asked.

"Wuorin, why on earth...?"

Wuorin, who had maintained a cold expression until then, suddenly puffed her cheeks and burst into laughter.

"Ahahaha!"

Then she pointed at the dazed Kido and stamped her feet.

"You were surprised, weren't you? Really startled, right? Look at that face."

Kido, who had been standing hunched over holding his spear, trembled all over and then shouted angrily.

"What the hell are you trying to do, you crazy woman! I almost died!"

Even Shirone was disappointed this time.

"That's right, Wuorin. That was too much. Using Wind Blade for a prank, of all things."

"Hmm, the Goblin King."

As Wuorin approached, Kido flinched and stepped back.

"Still, not bad. They're among the high-ranked groups even within Wind Blade, yet you lasted one exchange."

'Human, does that look like one exchange to you?'

It must have been a thousand exchanges.

"I honestly didn't pay much attention to goblin information, so I was worried. But seeing it directly puts me at ease. Protect Shirone well. Don't let even a single hair on her head get hurt. Got it?"

"Shut up! Why should I protect Shirone? I'm traveling of my own will!"

Shirone agreed with Kido's words.

"That's right. Kido isn't like a pet or anything. To conduct such a test just to confirm something like that."

'You don't understand, Shirone.'

How important Wuorin, no Theraze, no Mitochondrial Eve considered Shirone to be.

"Shirone, do you think there might come a day when we sleep in the same bed?"

Kido blurted out without thinking.

"What kind of nonsense is this now?"

Though the language was harsh, Shirone's feelings were similar.

"I don't think that would happen. I have someone I love, and you're Kashan's Empress. The strongest in the world..."

"Right, I am rather noble. What I want to say is simply that if such a thing happened, it would just be something that happened."

Wuorin was always enigmatic when talking about life.

"If I kiss you right now, that means I kissed you. It's a clear fact. Words like 'impossible' or 'can't happen' become meaningless."

He seemed to understand something.

"I'm biologically sixteen and will continue growing. Maybe I'll change into a body you'll want to love."

He thought she was beautiful even now.

"Of course it's difficult. Us sleeping together? Just thinking about it feels strange. Imagining us engaging in deadly schemes to kill each other would feel more natural."

Between Kashan's Empress and Alpheas Magic Academy's star, it wouldn't be impossible.

"But anything can happen in life. Someday I might become your bride, or perhaps I could become your daughter."

A brief silence followed.

"I understand what you mean. I'll keep it in mind."

Only Wuorin would know why she brought this up at this moment in this space.

'Don't worry, Amy.'

Satisfied with what she had placed in Shirone's heart, Wuorin walked down the corridor with a bright expression again.

"Well then, shall we depart?"

They went up to Aganos's spire.

At the watchtower overlooking the capital's scenery, handlers were waiting.

"Huh, what's that?"

Shirone pointed to a giant featherless bird crouched at the edge of the watchtower.

"Isn't that a Kydra?"

It was a tier-3 high-speed flying creature that Zulu had summoned before, capable of flying 7,000 kilometers per day.

"Don't tell me, summoning magic?"

"No, I just raise it. Its name is Ratusa. I ride it sometimes when I want to get some fresh air."

"..."

Just the fact that she had captured and tamed alive a great mage's summoned creature that could only be manifested through imagery showed Wuorin's power.

"Andre is quite far. But with Ratusa, we should arrive by tomorrow afternoon."

"Wow, tomorrow afternoon?"

"It's been educated since birth and senses human feelings well. It shouldn't be too difficult."

After giving them several instructions about crossing the desert, Wuorin approached and Ratusa rubbed its beak against her cheek.

"Damn, I'm not too fond of the sky."

Wuorin looked back at Kido, who was grumbling as he followed, and pulled out a pouch of gold coins from her bosom.

"Take this. There will be times when you need it."

Before Shirone could speak, Kido snatched it.

"Hehe, our Empress has good sense. I'll overlook that pet joke from earlier."

"Huh? It wasn't a joke though."

Wuorin laughed while pretending to hold a leash.

"I'll have the finest collar ready and waiting."

"This one really thinks I'm being nice to her..."

Just as Kido approached with a serious expression.

"I hear you're called Kido of Consumption."

"Huh?"

"Perhaps... I might be able to give you my blood too."

Only then realizing something was strange, Kido blinked and fell into thought.

"Kido, what are you doing? Hurry up and get on."

"Oh, got it."

After Kido climbed on last, Shirone grabbed the Kydra's reins and looked back at Wuorin.

"Thank you. Thanks to you, we saved time. I'll definitely repay you someday."

Armand, Moratorium's debt repayment, today's situation - he had received far too much from her.

"Be careful, Shirone. The world is vast, and Kashan's desert is even vaster."

Shirone muttered Wuorin's words and nodded, pulling on the Kydra's reins.

"Let's go, Ratusa!"

The Kydra raised its beak vertically, lifted its massive body, and kicked off from the watchtower to soar into the sky.

Keeaaaaaah.

The shadow trapped in the sun gradually grew distant.
