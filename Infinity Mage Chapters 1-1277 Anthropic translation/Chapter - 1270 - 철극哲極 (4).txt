Iron Pole (4)

Richard said.

"Here's how it works. As the final recorder, I'll transmit Apocalypse's information to Mutooryong Karatorsa. Karatorsa will share the information with the 12 Disciples, and they'll actually carry out the history that Uorin provides and Adam calculates." "Yes, it'll be very precise work. Meanwhile, you'll be free. Do whatever it takes to save Amy. If you fail, use Iron Pole's coordinates to repeat it again. Endlessly."

Fermi said.

"You'll encounter our past selves, but you yourself must directly reverse through time."

Shirone cannot remain in the present.

"Because the spacetime you're moving through is the spacetime we're trying to protect. That's how you and Iron Pole interact to prevent falling into a different universe."

Nade said.

"Iron Pole is on the ground where we are. Shura will lead the defense. And at the center of that Iron Pole, Uorin will provide new history each time you return. Through Future Poetry and History Search."

Shirone's expression grew serious.

"You're saying there are limits."

Richard said.

"Iron Pole is a concept, but Uorin is a living being. Her endurance isn't eternal. The more you repeat your regression, the more she'll be exposed to time waves. Since she's basically a Gaian, she'll last much longer than humans, but the opportunities aren't infinite."

"Uorin is..."

"Remember this, Shirone. This is your fight, but humanity's fate hangs on the results of that fight. If you save Amy, we all live. If you fail to save Amy, we all disappear."

Adam said.

"She's the woman with the biggest stake in this situation. She has responsibilities too. However, she's not completely convinced yet. She's considering it positively, but she said she wants to talk with you first."

The one who split Ultima.

"I'll meet her."

Something he had to meet eventually.

Perhaps Uorin had vaguely anticipated this situation.

Fermi said.

"Then let's go back up. All preparations need to be finished today. There's no time."

While Zhenyin cast ether waves to lock coordinates, Minerva approached.

"Shirone, remember the promise you made before?"

"Promise...?"

"When we raced to North Almond, I won. The loser grants a wish."

"Ah."

"I'll tell you my wish now."

Though he didn't know why it had to be now, Shirone nodded.

"Don't save me."

"What?"

"In the history the 12 Disciples enforce, you'll do your best to save Amy. But you also won't want anything to go wrong for anyone in this spacetime."

It was true.

"But feel free to use my history however you want. Salvation doesn't suit me." The notorious great witch who caused great disasters worldwide with Law Kill and Walking Dead.

Did she think her struggles as one of the Five Stars of the Ivory Tower couldn't atone for it?

'Or... maybe no life could wash away the trauma from her childhood.'

"I understand."

Shirone accepted.

"When the moment of choice comes, I'll make a judgment."

Though Minerva knew he wasn't the type to abandon others...

"Thank you."

It was enough for her.

Just before leaving the recorder's space, that perfect sealed room, Shirone turned and said.

"Richard, I'm going to defeat God." Perhaps Richard might become a god someday, but he smiled.

"Hey, aren't I pretty cool?"

"Haha."

A human lived.

Shirone truly believed that it was humans who had lived in this world.

When Zhenyin pulled at space, Seriel beyond the boundary asked worriedly.

"Are you okay?"

Everyone crossed the space, and Zhenyin sat on the bed with her support.

"I'll be fine after resting a bit."

Shirone nodded and said.

"Then while Zhenyin rests, I'll go meet Uorin. Where is she now?" Adam said.

"I'll take you there."

"I'll go alone. That seems better."

Understanding from Shirone's words, Adam explained Uorin's location.

Following his directions, Shirone arrived at the door of an isolated area.

"Uorin."

When there was no answer, he opened the door directly, and Uorin, with bandages wrapped around her calves, smiled.

"You came, Shirone."

Her expression was too bright as she limped with Kido's support.

"I was waiting. I have something to tell you..."

Slap! Her cheek turned.

Kido's eyes widened, and Uorin remained motionless with her slapped cheek.

Shirone didn't know either.

He tried to be calm, but the moment he saw her smiling face, he lost his reason.

This was why he wanted to avoid Uorin.

"Haha."

She laughed heartily.

"Well, yeah, I did do something wrong. So if this settles it, then now..."

At that moment, tears flowed down Shirone's cheeks.

"Why?"

Why did you ruin everything?

As if she heard those words, Uorin was sad but tried to act bright.

"Huhu, I must be quite hateful? But what can we do? Now everything depends on me."

She didn't want to end with melancholy emotions the event she had prepared solely for this moment.

"You need me, don't you? Of course I'm willing to help too. My condition is that you love me..."

"I will."

Uorin's mouth closed.

"I'll do anything. I'll do whatever you tell me to..."

Shirone pleaded.

"Please save Amy. You don't have to be with me. I'll do anything you want..."

This time even Uorin couldn't hold back, and her eyebrows curved upward.

She desperately held back the tears about to burst.

"Tell me you love me."

"I love you."

It was a heart that could never be filled.

"Tell me you'll stay by my side forever! Tell me you love me, Uorin, not Amy!"

"I'll stay by your side forever."

Uorin gritted her teeth.

'I won.'

Not wanting to show her tears, she turned around and forced her lips to curve up.

'Shirone is mine. He said he loves me.'

She said.

"Alright."

Though it could have been much harsher, she asked for nothing more.

"I'll do it. Go save Amy."

Then Kido realized.

Uorin, Lilith, Mitochondrial Eve, truly loved Shirone.

'That's love.'

From humanity's beginning until now, a woman who had waited only for this moment...

'True love.'

Uorin said.

"Now go. Everything's settled. Save humanity. Though I have no right to say such things."

When Shirone approached, she hurriedly turned away.

"Go."

As if it never even began... so that it wouldn't even feel like an end.

"Go! Go!"

Since even comforting her could be cruel, Shirone glumly left the room.

He didn't think of it as Eve's atonement.

He simply held deep in his heart only the pure goodwill of a woman who had loved him.

The door closed, and Uorin burst into tears, sobbing uncontrollably.

Kido approached.

"Hey, are you okay?"

"Hold me."

Uorin said through her sobs.

"I feel like I'll go crazy from loneliness. It feels like there's a hole in my chest. Kido, please."

Kido could do nothing.

When Shirone returned to the plaza after meeting Uorin, Ting urgently approached.

"There you are. This way."

Entering the resistance command room, executives including Cyrano were gathered.

Lethe, the administrator of the inner world, was looking at a world map, and beside her was...

"Taeseong-nim."

The planet's administrator was also there.

"Shirone."

Unlike when she had stabbed his heart and spoken coldly, she seemed frightened.

"Back then... I also..."

Not because she lacked courage, but because she truly didn't know what to say.

"Thank you."

But Shirone understood.

"For taking humanity's side. Whether it was an error or from the heart, it doesn't matter. We're fighting together."

Without her decision, humanity wouldn't have even had this last chance.

Shirone looked back at Ting.

"Are you okay?"

In terms of feeling betrayed, she wouldn't be lacking either.

"I don't think my doubts have been resolved. Since you convinced me, I'll just trust you."

Lethe said.

"Let's skip the small talk and get to the point. Yahweh, did you meet Omega's recorder?"

Shirone nodded.

"Then this will be easy to explain. We're moving up the departure schedule. The sanctuary is disappearing faster than expected."

It was Satan's will.

"Taeseong and I held out as much as possible, but it wasn't enough. The demons will infiltrate in 6 hours. And that will be... humanity's final war."

"When do I depart?"

"The sooner the better. Currently humanity is facing a World Map Council vote. Yahweh must leave before then. Please finish preparations within the next hour."

'One hour.'

A journey solely for himself, alone.

Kido stood there dazed.

"What are you doing?"

Even when Uorin sitting on the floor asked, he thought this couldn't be right.

"Uorin, this is giving up."

"It's not."

Everything was for Shirone.

"I have to handle time waves each round trip to Iron Pole. Two is better than one."

The taste of memory.

If Kido consumed Uorin's blood, the endurance of history would double.

"Then, just give me blood."

Uorin shook her head.

"Kido, you'll die following me. And I've achieved everything now. So... it's okay."

"It's not okay!"

Kido was angry.

Even if she couldn't be loved, Kashan's empress should be a noble woman forever.

"I'm a monster."

She who had looked slightly surprised smiled with her eyes.

"Me too..."

No.

"I'm a monster too."

Kido squeezed his eyes shut.

Words he knew but never wanted to hear.

"Sniff."

Shedding tears, Kido approached, supported Uorin's back and laid her down on the floor.

'Vanishing.'

It was the only consideration a goblin could offer.

"I love you, Uorin."

Though she could never perceive it, Uorin closed her eyes as if sensing something.

"Ahh..."

A dreamy moan.

And Kido, with the gentlest violence, bit Uorin's nape.

The taste of memory.

Universe.

The planet was burning pitch black.

There were no traces of oceans, only lava flowing like a net over the black earth.

"Hup."

Habitz inhaled.

When sparks came alive in his corpse-like burned body, the planet's lava blazed hot.

"Haah."

When he exhaled, even the light dimmed.

In those deadly breaths of death, even the demons trembled in fear.

"...Hup."

When molten metal exploded from the rapidly heated earth, the demons cowered.

"Hiek!"

If they touched Satan's fire, they too would become charcoal.

"Wizard."

Habitz's face contorted.

"Where are you?"

Though he had turned the entire planet into a Death Field, her location couldn't be detected.

'Either she's hiding somewhere I don't know.'

Or she's already burned to death.

Either way displeased Habitz as he sucked in air, making the planet begin to sizzle.

"Wizaaaaard!"

And at this moment, evil's victory was officially confirmed at the Terraforce Grand Assembly.
