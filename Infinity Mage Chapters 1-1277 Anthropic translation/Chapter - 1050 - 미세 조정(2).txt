Fine Tuning (2)

The lunar surface.

Watching the massive light burning from the ground, Shura made a sad expression.

"Buddha..."

The time spent by his side to learn the secrets of the world was never in vain.

"He's really leaving."

Whether it was Nane or Ankera, the shockwave that erupted beyond the heavens would shake this world.

"I just need to wait. But somehow..."

Why does my heart feel so empty?

"Buddha."

Shura murmured with a sorrowful expression.

"Have a pleasant journey."

It was neither time nor space.

Nane was simply passing through the distant void, waiting for a new finite world.

'The secret of the world.'

Where do we come from, and where do we go?

'It's different from death.'

What Nane was attempting now was to transcend even the bonds of life and death and leave the world.

He saw neither the long tunnel nor the white space that many had experienced on the verge of death.

Beyond the primordial boundary.

Just...

An indefinable space.

Nane's body began to slowly rise above the surface, quiet as a black lake.

There was no mass in the submerged feeling, and though there was no light, he could see without difficulty.

At that moment, Nane realized his existence as "I" and focused his consciousness on what constituted himself.

'Strange...'

His voice leaked out.

"What is this place?" (*Author's note: In reality, a reversal of thought occurs, but for convenience, it's replaced with a reversal of text.)

The first thought that came to him was that it wasn't particularly different from before leaving the photon world.

Nane, who had been lying on the water's surface, stood upright and gently stepped forward.

When the will to stand took hold, the surface supported his body as firmly as solid ground.

"This is somewhat interesting."

While taking steps, Nane realized that his field of vision was at a different height than before and turned his head.

In the curtain of darkness without even light, something presumed to be himself was shimmering.

A grasshopper's face.

His back was greatly hunched, and hook-like claws on his skeletal limbs caught his eye.

"What is this place..."

Perhaps it was only possible because it was Nane.

The moment he heard the sound from his own throat through his ears, he realized everything.

"Aaaaaaaah!"

The grasshopper-human carved in the curtain of darkness opened its hideous jaw and let out a terrible scream.

The Other Side.

Lete, president of Hwagongsa, arrived at Magritte's castle leading six generals.

Behind them, countless demons trembling with a sense of betrayal were screaming in rage.

"Execute the traitor Magritte!"

"Shame of demonkind! That worm who sold his body to Yahweh! I'll cut his throat myself!"

As all kinds of condemnation poured down, murderous intent rose from each of the generals' bodies.

'What could they possibly have to say?'

But even they couldn't dare claim they had done right in front of Lete.

'We'll just die together. We're sorry, Your Grace.'

Lete turned his head and commanded.

"Guide me."

None of the generals moved, and Baeksa bit her lip in distress.

'Open the door? I'd rather die first.'

She absolutely refused to play the role of clearing the path for Lete, who intended to annihilate Magritte.

"If you're still under a delusion."

Lete turned around, burning with hellfire.

"You'll have no choice but to die in that delusion."

Just as the generals closed their eyes, prepared for annihilation, Execution Commander Itaka stepped forward.

"I'll open it."

Her shadow-like black hair dragged on the ground, then spread around like ink.

Power entered Moonom's single eye.

"Itaka."

"It can't be helped. His Grace has committed a sin. Our loyalty only matters when it helps hell."

Moonom, who had reached the 4th generation upheaval, couldn't not know.

'Damn it. Acting superior to the very end.'

Since there was no way out, she was trying to take all responsibility and save at least her comrades.

"How touching, Itaka."

Normally, Lete would have smiled warmly at their friendship, but now his eyes were cold.

"But it's futile. If you annihilate His Grace, you too will rightfully be punished."

The demons behind agreed.

"That's right! The generals must die too! Traitors who dragged demonkind's honor through the mud!"

The demons' anger toward the generals had reached its peak, matching their hatred for Yahweh.

Itaka said.

"I will follow your will."

Her hair spread rapidly like a torrent and climbed up the castle gate.

Creak creak creak creak!

As the majestic sound revealed the inner scenery, the demons raised their fists.

"Drag out His Grace! His Grace...!"

At that moment, a voice echoed from the sky.

"His Grace did nothing wrong."

The demons simultaneously looked up at the sky, but nothing particularly caught their eye.

"He cares for hell more than anyone. That's why he accepted my proposal."

Shirone was walking through the forcibly opened crowd of demons.

Oris muttered.

"Yufi..."

No, now it was Yahweh.

But in the cat's large eyes, the afterimage of the young demon still remained.

Meanwhile, unaware of the outside situation, Lian held the great sword connected by Gehenna's chains.

"A sword that cuts the chains of karma. You're saying I can liberate Jinseong-eum with this?"

"It depends on how much karma you can bear. Of course, I hope that's the case, but..." His Grace trailed off.

If Jinseong-eum was liberated and the Spirit Realm opened, there would be a second demon invasion.

Lian turned around.

"I see. Thank you anyway."

It would have been fine to just let him go, but in the end, Magritte had to ask.

"How about killing me?"

Lian turned back.

"It's embarrassing to say, but I know countless techniques that could conquer the human world. In other words, if the Spirit Realm opens, the most dangerous enemy would be me. You could kill me now."

Lian examined Gehenna's chains connected to <Idea> through his palm.

"I don't judge."

Of course, he knew how pathetic yet difficult that was.

"You helped Shirone. At least for now. If you hinder Shirone in the future, I'll cut you down then."

"Do you think such an opportunity will come twice?"

Magritte felt heavy-hearted.

"The chance to eliminate hell's greatest mind. To cut me down later, you'd have to break through hundreds of millions of soldiers first."

"...I'd still have to cut you down."

"What if you can't? If you ultimately can't, and your lord dies?"

Lian's eyes grew coldly determined.

"I can cut you down."

Eyes focused solely on cutting, with no other options ever existing.

'This guy is just a sword.'

Perhaps the one who made a mistake at this moment wasn't Lian or Shirone, but Magritte himself.

'Reality or hell, whatever philosophy - he just cuts through everything. Is it really right to just let this guy go?'

Shirone's sword was strong enough to make the proud duke think such mundane thoughts.

"See you on the battlefield."

Through the massive hole in the basement, Lian escaped outside the castle.

The silence created by Yahweh's appearance was brutally shattered by the demons' rage.

"Kraaaah! Yahweh! Yahweh!"

The demons' eyes looking at their detestable enemy were so bloodshot they seemed ready to burst.

"Yahweh."

Lete stepped forward.

"Your shamelessness pierces the heavens. After putting on the disguise of the demons you so despised and acting, now you reveal your disgusting face before us."

"Leave Magritte out of this."

Shirone said only what needed to be said.

"He didn't betray demonkind. Rather, he made a deal with me for hell's sake. Who has the advantage will be determined by the results, but both he and I did our best."

If Lete annihilated Magritte, things would become easier for Shirone too, but 'I can't be cowardly.'

That couldn't be called conviction.

"Kekekeke! Kekekeke!"

Lete burst into furious laughter.

"Always the same way. Look at you now. You speak as if you care for demonkind, don't you? But in the end, you'll annihilate us. Isn't that why you came here?"

"Why do you do this? Answer me. If you're so righteous, why did you disguise yourself as a demon to humiliate our children? Do you find demons that laughable? You bastard!"

"About that..."

The time spent as Yufi was short, but the bond shared with the demons was sincere.

"I apologize. I didn't look down on you. To make an excuse, it was to prevent a bigger fight."

If Son Yujung hadn't interfered, it probably would have passed quietly.

"You call that an excuse!"

The person who let out a heart-rending scream wasn't Lete, but Stealth Commander Oris.

"How dare you...!"

As if words couldn't relieve her anger, Oris kicked off the cat's paws and charged at Shirone.

'Bad bastard!'

How could she erase this sense of betrayal from having felt affection, even briefly, for the being she hated most?

'I'll kill him!'

Oris's sharp claws rushed toward Shirone's nape as if to tear it apart.

"Damn it!"

The moment she saw Shirone's eyes, which held no will to counterattack, her hand stopped abruptly.

"Why don't you dodge? Do you think someone like me is easy?"

"I'm sorry. I deceived you. I had no intention of hurting you, but it's ultimately my fault."

The cat's eyes blazed.

"Lies. You knew I wouldn't be able to kill you! Because that's Yahweh's nature!"

Shirone confessed honestly.

"I wanted to leave it to your judgment. But... it's also true that I knew."

"Right. That's exactly who you are. You pretend to love without prejudice, but in the end, you just do as you please."

"Then what should I do?"

Shirone made a sad expression.

"I can neither die by your hand nor kill you. I can neither save everyone nor let everyone live."

No one knows.

Since even Buddha, who alone understood Yahweh, is no longer in this world.

All deaths are lonely deaths.

'Should I really stop?'

If giving up or fighting were the same, there was no need to suffer.

"...How can I believe you?"

Oris's murderous intent loosened.

"After shamelessly deceiving me, how can I believe those words about not wanting to hurt me?"

"You don't need to believe me."

Shirone shook his head.

"Believing someone means believing your own heart. Just do what you want to do."

At that moment, Lete shouted.

"Kill him! Tear apart Yahweh, who humiliates demonkind with his silver tongue!"

As the demons charged forward with screams, Oris's hand trembled.

'It's a lie. Even these eyes now, the words spoken - all lies to escape the situation.'

In time flowing as slowly as the speed of thought, the demons brought down their weapons.

'I can't be deceived again. He'll surely change his stance before dying. He'll kill me. Before that, I'll first...'

Hell's weapons pressed against Shirone's back with no room to escape.

Oris sobbed.

"Huuu..."

With a bang, impact hit the ground, and the demons looked around in confusion.

"What? Where did he go?"

Lete turned his head with cold eyes.

"Oris."

20 meters away, she was breathing roughly while holding Shirone in her arms.
