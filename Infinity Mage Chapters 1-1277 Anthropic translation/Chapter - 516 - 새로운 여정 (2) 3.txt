[516] A New Journey (2)

The Third Heaven, Shehakim.

As the aftermath of God's punishment striking Zion spread, Paradise, the dwelling place of the Eternals, had completely collapsed in the direction of the seismic waves.

However, even among those ruins, there was one building that maintained its form intact—the Great Assembly Hall, the judicial institution of the leaders, located north of the city square.

Currently, in the basement of the building, in a place commonly called the secret chamber, the ten supreme leaders of the Eternals had gathered.

The heads of this assembly, called the Council of Ten Elders among the Eternals, were all beings who had reached the art of incarnation after living through countless ages.

Murka, Deina, and Raun, whom Sirone had faced during the war, were also masters of incarnation who had lived for well over a thousand years, but their obsession with life had instead caused them to fall into ruin.

In contrast, the heads of the Council of Ten Elders were seekers who had enjoyed eternal life for at least ten thousand years and had transcended even attachment to life and death.

"They say Garas was annihilated by the giants."

The bald old man sitting alone at the head of the rectangular table spoke.

His pupils were nothing but slippery black irises, and whenever he spoke, the area under his chin swelled like a balloon, resembling a toad.

Chairman of the Council of Ten Elders, Beron (age unknown) - Amita Prajna.

The man sitting to Beron's left spoke.

"A failure of selective evolution. All the angels have departed."

With sculpture-like beautiful features and blonde hair swept back, his face was pale as a corpse, and sharp fangs were embedded in his mouth that opened as he spoke.

Third in the Council of Ten Elders hierarchy, Faust (estimated age 13,000) - Hundred Demons Yaksha.

The man sitting across from Faust spoke.

"Garas doesn't matter. What's important is that Ankera has been erased. From now on, we must rule over humans."

He had a solid build with round, colorful bumps protruding from his head, and triangular teeth that fit together precisely in a belligerent clench.

Fourth in the Council of Ten Elders hierarchy, Huama (estimated age 17,000) - Vajra Yaksha.

The woman sitting across from Huama spoke.

"The Light of Area 73, Sirone, wasn't it? It seems he even fought against Eternals during the war."

Her hair was black as pitch, seeming to blend into darkness, and her snake-like smooth body appeared to collapse the boundaries of physicality, composed entirely of curves.

While the silhouette itself was beautiful, thinking of it as a human body gave an eerie feeling.

Seventh in the Council of Ten Elders hierarchy, Shura (estimated age 10,200) - Apostle Prajna.

"Hmph! Even if they were Eternals, they were still babies who hadn't been weaned yet. There's no need to worry about anyone except Miro. Don't tell me even you, Shura, have become frightened?"

At Huama's rebuke, Shura retorted.

"Who says what? I'm just curious about this human called Sirone."

Then, imagining Sirone, she inserted her snake-like long tongue into her clothes and licked the curves of her entire body.

"He looks delicious, slurp."

After confirming that her tongue had been quickly sucked back into her mouth, Faust added:

"It's not a matter to overlook. He annihilated the Archangel Rayel, and that flash that appeared just before Ankera's erasure was also his achievement. And above all..."

Huama slammed the table in frustration.

"So that's why!"

"He is the Ultima System."

"Grr!"

Huama turned his head away with an indignant expression.

As long as Sirone possessed the spirit of the Gaians, who were predecessors even to the Eternals, there was no room for rebuttal.

The woman sitting at the far end of the table muttered.

"A human who killed God..."

She had a fierce wolf-like impression but with a strangely tender feeling.

Her black hair was as abundant as a wild horse's mane, and she wore a thick turban wrapped messily, making it stick out like flames.

She wore clothes as tattered as her worn turban, with loose ties that revealed the valley of her breasts spread left and right.

She had one leg up on the chair while resting her head against the handle of a great sword, revealing deep into her spread thighs.

Ninth in the Council of Ten Elders hierarchy, Baeknyeo (estimated age 11,200) - Asura Yaksha.

After a silence, Beron opened his mouth.

"We can't say he killed him. After all, Ra was erased by his own will. But it's true that the boy was a major variable in this war."

Faust asked.

"Are you thinking of recruiting him into the Council of Ten Elders?"

Shura said.

"That's a bit hasty. First of all, Sirone's incarnation is in a state of suspended activity, so we can't even hear his opinion. If he goes to the Under Coder, I won't stop him though."

"Anyway, you just want to eat that kid."

Huama, who had snapped at Shura, offered his opinion.

"With Ra erased, there's no one to be wary of. If we must pick someone, it would only be Miro among angels and humans. Ultima or whatever, strength is everything."

Though they possessed the power to dominate the world with powerful incarnation arts, they had to live holding their breath under strict control until now.

They couldn't oppose Ankera, who could erase information from the Akashic Records itself.

But now humans had gained freedom, and the Eternals' shackles were completely released.

Faust said.

"We should decide soon. The only existing Ultima System, the Light of Area 73, Sirone—is he an enemy or ally of the Council of Ten Elders?"

As the silence lengthened, Beron suggested.

"Let's do it by majority vote. After all, we are human. Now, those who think of Sirone as an enemy, raise your hands."

Shortly after, the ten people gathered in the secret chamber expressed their thoughts through a show of hands.

As Beron said, the voting result was extremely human.

A black sphere was born on a snowy mountain 7,000 meters above sea level.

Shortly after, the group began to appear one by one, led by Miro.

"It's cold."

Flu shivered as she looked around.

It was the peak of a mountain range where even oxygen was scarce, and all they could see was horizontally whipping snow.

"I could summon Salamander to endure it, but that would cause an avalanche."

Zulu summoned Kaidra, a Tier 3 monster.

Riding the giant bird that could fly 7,000 kilometers a day, the group quickly escaped the mountain range.

They arrived at a village located 600 meters above sea level.

In the gloomy landscape covered by snow clouds, the stone-paved roads were damp and the people's clothing was unfamiliar.

When the giant bird suddenly landed in the small village, all the residents stopped what they were doing and turned to look.

Miro approached an elderly man with deep wrinkles.

"Excuse me, could you tell me where this is?"

When translation was provided through Sein's mental magic, the old man blinked and pointed to the mountain, saying:

"Escatu."

Though his reaction was quite calm for someone encountering magic for the first time, Miro soon understood when she learned where they were.

"Ah, Escatu."

Meaning "center of the world," it was the name of a mountain range in the northeast of the continent.

"Well, we've at least made it to the continent. So what should we do? Since we've met like this, how about a modest get-together?"

When no one responded to her joke, Miro smacked her lips and got to the point.

"Let's part ways here for now. Be careful in case there's any pursuit. Does everyone have a place to go?"

Kang Nan said she would go to Zulu's hideout with Gaold, and Shiina and Ethella planned to return to the magic school.

Quan remained silent about his whereabouts, and Armin was free to go anywhere since he had already left the Ivory Tower.

The problem was Flu.

The Magic Association she needed to return to had already been taken over by the new Association President, Lufist.

"Will you be okay? How about coming with me instead?"

At Kang Nan's suggestion, Flu shook her head.

"No. I'll return to the Association first. I'm also worried about Lady Isabel."

"What if they interrogate you about what happened in heaven?"

"If there's something they want to know, I'll have to tell them."

Everyone's attention focused on Flu.

"Since Cage Team B has already gone, I don't know how much they can get from me, but if necessary, I'll provide information. I'm also a certified mage belonging to the Kingdom of Tormia."

Having heard that much, Kang Nan nodded.

"Yes, that's like you."

She hadn't been included in the project simply because she followed Gaold.

Knowing she was a professional who prioritized her duties above all else in any situation, they could trust her with assisting Sirone.

"Still, be careful. Lufist won't easily let you return to your position."

"It's something I have to accept. But would they really not use a talent like me?"

At Flu's jest, Kang Nan also smiled.

Believing in what you think is right.

If a professional mage thought that way, no one could stop her.

"Please take good care of Lord Gaold. From now on, I'll be working for the Association, but..."

Flu winked as she said:

"Once a comrade, always a comrade."

"Yes, once a comrade, always a comrade."

Understanding the hidden meaning in Flu's words, Kang Nan looked at Zulu and signaled that they should leave.

"Anyone going to the city can ride along. I'll take you there."

"Ah, then we too..."

Only Shiina and Ethella decided to accompany them to the city.

The remaining ones weren't particularly busy, nor were they weak enough to struggle with rough terrain.

Armin looked up at Shiina and said:

"Shiina, you'll become a good teacher."

"Brother."

Shiina understood Armin's words.

Even when she had felt hurt in her pride for being used merely as bait to draw the Eternal Reflector into the project, she now knew.

Why Gaold had wanted Ethella more than her.

"Not everyone needs to fight. Not everyone needs to be strong. Go back to school and do what you want. Become an excellent teacher."

Shiina showed a gentle expression for the first time.

"Yes. You should be happy too, brother."

Those words rather saddened Armin, but at the same time, laughter leaked out.

His beloved younger sister had finally overcome her past trauma and could start a new life.

"Well then, see you next time."

The bird Kaidra soared into the sky, and Armin also bowed silently to Quan before disappearing with Flicker magic.

As each person left for their own path, Arius, who remained last, approached Miro while carrying Sirone on his back.

"Lady Miro, what should we do?"

Miro looked around at the world spread out like a sprint.

"Well, where should we start exploring?"

The world she had returned to after 20 years was full of unknowns, but to her, all those unknowns were merely playgrounds.

Uorin, who had finished her History Search, opened her eyes wide.

"Found it!"

At the end of her grand journey through all of history, what she had found was another crack different from the underlying incident.

Gando asked urgently:

"Have you found it?"

"Born in the Middle East. Age between 15 and 30. Male. His name is Akaze, but if he had already left his hometown, he could have changed it easily."

When Uorin called for Pungzang, the door burst open and thirty people wearing owl masks were sucked in like smoke.

"You called for us?"

"Use the best intelligence network to find him. He was born in a tribe in the Akad Desert. His entire family died in the Oasis War, and he's one of the survivors."

That was all the information Uorin provided.

It was a task of searching the entire world with only rough age range, gender, and simple information, but it was worth it.

"Understood."

Pungzang slipped out silently, and Uorin paced around the room, biting her nails.

Ra had descended to earth.

With only one purpose: to annihilate humanity that constructs chaos.

"Are you really saying Ra was born on this earth?"

"Yes. We must find him before he begins to act. If we fail to do so..."

Gando could imagine the words Uorin couldn't bring herself to say.

None other than the reincarnation of the Akashic Records.

When he finished his judgment of this world, the event that would occur would approach humanity as an unprecedented shockwave.

"A great disaster has come."

"It doesn't matter. Even if it's a god, it cannot covet Theraze's stronghold. We must prepare thoroughly."

Uorin, who had finally stopped walking, turned to look at Gando.

"A new era has opened, Gando."

Following the erasure of Guffin and then Ankera, this was the third and final reset.

It was called the Great Purification Period.
