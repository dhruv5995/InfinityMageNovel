[534] The Final World (2)

Woodga didn't dwell much on the name and pointed in a direction.

"Now we need to harvest from the Tree of Life. If you want to live here from now on, you'd better listen to me carefully."

When the boy didn't understand, Woodga clicked his tongue.

"Well, once you receive Ra's blessing, you'll understand from then on. Anyway, let's go. We don't have time."

The boy looked back at the destroyed world with a troubled expression.

'Even so, to be destroyed like this.'

Recalling his memories from before hibernation, no matter how great a disaster had occurred, the world hadn't been ruined to this extent.

'Don't be impatient. My memories will return with time.'

As they headed toward the city center, Woodga's expression grew increasingly grim, and finally he stopped walking with a pale, ashen face.

"Brother... it's a contaminated zone."

The fact that buildings dozens of stories tall still maintained their form was a stark contrast to the landscape of other areas.

But more characteristic than that was the mucus covering everything - not just the buildings but the ground as well.

Though it had an overall reddish tint, its colors were so varied it looked like vomit.

"Mucus...?"

"That's right, it's mucus. If you touch this... huh?"

Woodga belatedly realized it wasn't Hamei's voice and turned to look at the boy.

"You know about mucus?"

The boy frowned without answering.

He had no memory of seeing such a devastating scene, but strangely, the red mucus felt familiar.

The aftermath of resource depletion from nuclear war...

It maximizes the efficiency of biomass.

Remove the mucus! The main culprit of ecosystem destruction!

Several memories flashed through his mind momentarily.

"Ugh!"

The boy suffered again, but the Children of the Sun no longer had time to care for him.

"Let's go. I'll go first, so follow me."

Woodga walked along a winding path like a waterway that the mucus hadn't yet invaded.

'This is serious. The path has gotten narrower than before.'

Though it wasn't known where the source of the mucus was, or how many sources there might be if any existed, it was clear that it was expanding.

The average expansion speed of the mucus was 1 centimeter per hour.

Though extremely slow, more than half of the current world had already been transformed into contaminated zones.

"Brother, over there!"

In the sky that Hamei pointed to, five Razets were fleeing while spraying jets, with a carnivorous creature chasing after them.

The moment the carnivorous creature caught up and glided down, the mucus covering the building stretched out like a frog's tongue and snatched its ankle.

Kieeeeeek!

Dragged in by the powerful tension and slammed into the wall, the strange bird screamed, then its entire body twisted and was buried in the mucus.

Though the distance was far, watching its body twist into strange shapes every second made it seem as if you could hear bones breaking.

This was why most creatures in the apocalyptic world had left the ground and made the sky their dwelling place.

"Brother, maybe we too..."

"No. Mucus doesn't react to slowly moving creatures. So we just need to go slowly. Got it?"

Though he said this, Woodga's expression wasn't good either.

The path was about 1 meter wide, which was comfortable, but his legs felt heavy as if crossing a precarious single-log bridge.

"Good. It's safe from here on."

Having escaped the contaminated zone, they walked for about an hour along the road leading out of the city.

Finally, a dense forest could be seen in the distance.

At the sight of the green landscape - the first he'd seen since awakening from hibernation - a wistful emotion stirred in the boy's heart.

"The Tree of Life is in that forest. From now on, you need to listen carefully to what I say."

Quickening his pace, Woodga looked around at the entrance to the forest.

"Hamei, do you hear any sound?"

"I hear it. A rumbling, vibrating sound."

"That's Ra's warning. Only the Children of the Sun can hear that sound. When you hear that sound, you must never enter the forest."

"What happens if you go in?"

"I've never gone in so I don't know, but the older brothers say you get a terrible headache."

Regardless of their conversation, the boy trembled as he looked at the fresh vegetation.

'Forest. It's a forest.'

Not a memory from before hibernation, but another memory was flickering in the depths of his mind.

'Why are my memories so jumbled?'

He thought perhaps he had dreamed while in hibernation, but considering the state of minus 273 degrees, that would be impossible.

"Brother, the sound has stopped."

"Good. Then let's go in now."

Inside the forest, no life forms could be seen except for plants.

It was strange that a forest could be formed without even common insects, but the boy's common-sense doubts were crushed by the nonsensical sight that unfolded before his eyes.

"This is..."

A massive tree stood tall in the center of the field.

No, could this be called a tree?

It writhed at regular intervals as if it had a heart, and though it was brown in color, looking closely revealed that the trunk and branches were intertwined with muscle-like fibers.

But what shocked the boy most were the 'fruits' hanging from the tree.

Though their developmental states varied, what hung there were not fruits but fetuses.

Humans born from a tree.

These were the Children of the Sun, the masters of this world.

"Do you remember, Hamei? You also ripened there. The older brothers harvested you."

Hamei just stared blankly at the Tree of Life.

"The Tree of Life can only be entered twice a day. When that sound I mentioned earlier disappears. The older brothers say the power emanating from the Tree of Life prevents other creatures from approaching. That's why the mucus can't invade this far either."

The fetuses hanging from the Tree of Life's branches were connected by stems at the crown of their heads, and when they took on the complete form of humans, the stems stretched almost to the ground.

Woodga approached a fetus that was crouched with its plump bottom hovering above the ground.

"Now, if it's almost reached the ground, it's okay to harvest. So here..."

Leaving about a hand's width of stem as a buffer, he cut it cleanly with scissors and caught it, causing the fetus to burst into tears as if startled.

"Waaah. Waaah."

"Haha! Look at this little one, so cute. Hamei, you take it. This harvest is your mission."

Hamei carefully embraced the fetus and looked down at it.

It was a Child of the Sun born when the Tree of Life received sunlight.

"Hehe, it's really cute."

'This is impossible.'

The boy couldn't believe what was happening before his eyes.

Other creatures aside, humans ripening on trees was absolutely impossible through natural evolution.

"Just what principle..."

The moment he took a step toward the tree, an eerie feeling crept through the boy's five senses.

A sound, or feeling, like thick strings vibrating.

'Magnetic field...?'

Suddenly his senses became acute, and he could clearly feel even things outside his line of sight.

If he put his mind to it, he felt he could even count the number of fetuses ripening on the Tree of Life.

"Um... don't you hear some sound right now?"

Woodga frowned.

This ancient person they'd brought out was clearly in very poor condition.

"Step back from the Tree of Life. And stop doing strange things. You have to come with us anyway."

After confirming that Hamei had wrapped the child in a prepared bundle and safely held it in her arms, Woodga urged them on.

"Let's go. We need to get out before Ra's warning sounds."

As they entered the forest again, the amount of information flooding the boy increased dramatically, but even that felt insufficient.

'What's happening to me? Why am I suddenly like this?'

As his mind became increasingly sensitive, the range his senses could reach gradually expanded, and eventually everything within a 50-meter radius was transmitted through synesthesia.

'Kekeke, as expected, they're coming this way.'

Seven underground dwellers who had positioned themselves in advance along the path discovered Woodga's group and each loaded their rifles.

Though they didn't have the unique auditory organs to hear Ra's warning, they knew that the Children of the Sun came here to collect fetuses.

'If they scatter, it'll be troublesome. Let's finish this in one go.'

When the leader gave a signal with his eyes, the underground dwellers waiting in the trees nodded.

"Now!"

As the targets entered range, the leader first grabbed a tree branch and hung like on a swing.

But Woodga and Hamei had already been pushed by the boy and jumped into the bushes.

"...What?"

How did they know to dodge in advance?

'Did they notice our ambush? No, if so, they wouldn't have come down this path in the first place.'

"Boss! What do we do?"

The leader's face crumpled.

"Blast them!"

"Kiyaaaau!"

The underground dwellers shrieked like monkeys and flew through the tree branches, firing their rifles.

With bullets raining from all directions, Woodga, who had fallen in the bushes, screamed.

"Ahhhhh! Save me!"

"Stay calm! We need to get out of here first!"

The boy's movements as he helped Woodga and Hamei up and led the way were smooth despite this being his first time here.

'What's with that guy? He's become a completely different person.'

Seeing how he maintained his composure even under attack from the underground dwellers, Woodga was reminded of the Magistrate, the ruler of their settlement.

"No, he's just a slave. Hamei! Let's run too!"

The Children of the Sun weren't inferior to the boy in speed, but the problem was that the underground dwellers' physical abilities exceeded theirs.

"Yahoo! Here they are!"

When an underground dweller hanging from a branch ahead pulled the trigger, the boy twisted his body and hid behind a tree.

Ratatatatata!

The vibration of the tree trunk exploding transmitted through his back, but the boy's eyes were sharply surveying the surroundings.

The enemies moving around in all directions were so agile that he couldn't determine their exact number.

'I can't be overwhelmed by fear. I need to assess the situation to the end to survive.'

Until you're dead, you're not dead.

As he concentrated with the resolve to take a step beyond the cliff, his senses became even sharper.

'Seven enemies with physical abilities far superior to humans. They have long-range weapons capable of destroying trees. Escaping will be difficult.'

"Brother! Save me!"

Looking toward where Hamei's scream came from, he saw three underground dwellers rushing toward her.

Woodga blocked their path, but no matter how he thought about it, he didn't have the durability to block powerful lethal weapons.

'What should I do?'

Pop pop pop pop pok!

As fragments flew from the tree trunk, the boy who had been peeking out hastily pulled back.

"Damn!"

Without any thought of approaching, they were using up an entire magazine without sparing bullets.

'Very inefficient.'

What this revealed was that the underground dwellers were more like warriors burning with emotion than cold soldiers.

'I can't get out...'

When the gunshots that should have been heard weren't, the boy turned his gaze toward Hamei.

The underground dwellers were keeping their distance while aiming their gun barrels.

'Why aren't they shooting?'

The underground dwellers' reason for hunting was solely consumption.

If it was helpless prey, not inflicting wounds was the way to obtain more meat.

"Kekeke. Now, let me put one in the head."

"Wait! I like heads! Just shoot the heart! Hearts are tough and don't taste good anyway."

"Are you crazy? How delicious are the organs in that area? Let's just blow off the head!"

"I'm starving to death! I'll just do it!"

An underground dweller who couldn't contain his hunger before food raised his gun barrel.

'No!'

The moment he thought he had to save them, the boy's body transformed into a flash of light and flew.

When he came to his senses, he was already blocking the path in front of Woodga and Hamei.

"Wh-what! Shoot!"

The moment the panicked underground dwellers pulled their rifle triggers, the boy's eyes widened.

Photon Cannon!

As a curtain of light pulsed with explosive noise, the trajectory of the bullets twisted sharply and embedded in the tree trunks behind them.

The harmony of thunderous sounds erased the child's crying, and as an entire magazine was emptied, a ringing seemed to flow through the forest.

"H-how did the bullets...?"

The boy just stared at the ground intently, accepting the new memories echoing in his head.

Spirit Zone. An extremely sensitive mental state.

Divine particles. Mass is energy.

Collide your thoughts. It's called Force.

"Ro-Rosine?"

At Woodga's voice, the boy came to his senses.

"...I'm not Rosine."

And walking toward the underground dwellers who were making blank expressions, he said:

"Sirone. My name is Aryan Sirone."

Sirone information recovery rate.

48 percent.
