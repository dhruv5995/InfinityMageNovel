[549] Code Decomposition (2)

She had no choice but to pick between left and right.

The reason even her monstrous senses couldn't detect it was probably because Lian's movement was split exactly in half between left and right.

Whether left or right, existing with exactly 50 percent probability each was movement absolutely impossible without borrowing the power of the law.

And that movement pushed Baknya into a life-or-death gamble.

'Left!'

The moment the traces of exploding ground approached before her eyes, Baknya twisted her body and raised her sword.

With a crash, Lian's greatsword struck.

Having no leisure to gauge the power of the strike, Baknya immediately threw her body back to create distance after the collision.

"Graaah!"

Lian's body swayed after swinging his greatsword wide.

Then his thigh and calf muscles ruptured with a terrible sound.

Pain surged through his remaining nerves, but Baknya was also in no state to be at ease.

'I blocked it. Did I block it?'

She had been able to block Lian's sword by twisting left, but honestly it had been left to luck.

The judgment that it was better to trust a 50 percent probability and act rather than hesitate before crisis showed just how trained she was as a swordsman.

But thinking about it the other way around.

'I almost died.'

With a 50 percent probability.

She who had lived for over ten thousand years had almost been cut by the sword of someone who hadn't even lived twenty years.

Though Yaksha was one for whom even attachment to life was an emotion from the distant past, her sense of humiliation was all the greater for it.

'I'll cut him down!'

Baknya exploded her Nirvana power to its limit and charged at Lian.

'I just need to be careful of that.'

The power when Denai combined with super-regeneration was stronger than any axing, so she didn't give him even a moment to throw his body from the start.

Lian, facing her, also moved his arm that was nothing but bone with the power of law to block the attacks.

If Baknya was acceleration, then Lian was pure speed.

The difference in technique and experience was absolute, but he was enduring by filling that gap with superiority in speed.

"Lian..."

Shirone, who had been watching the battle in a daze, muttered.

"You've gotten strong."

Though his memories were a chaotic mess, watching Lian's martial arts that were devastatingly beautiful filled him with joy from deep within.

"Archon."

At that moment, Shirone's heart sank.

He could tell just from the voice, because it was thick with the waves of death.

Where he turned his head, Yo sat kneeling on her knees, exhausted after the smoke of desire had escaped her.

"Yo..."

"Archon, the sun of the colony is..."

Before she could finish speaking, Fermi's air cut severed Yo's neck.

"Yo!"

Shirone's heart pounded roughly.

She was the woman who had looked like she owned the world with just one Shining magic spell.

Despite being of slave origin, she was the person who had believed in and followed Shirone before anyone else.

'Everyone's dead.'

The bodies of the guardians were piled beneath the pyramid, and leaving those corpses behind, the Fermi and Marsha combo was climbing up.

"Archon."

Though Shirone cursed having ears that had to hear words he didn't want to hear, his head turned as if by irresistible force.

Priest Bebeto was smiling with kind eyes.

"The Archon is one who possesses the language of God. That is why I too proposed a confrontation."

Thanks to that, Shirone had been able to preserve his life.

"Please, create a good world."

"No!"

The moment Shirone shouted, Bebeto connected the code and disappeared.

Appearing before Fermi and Marsha, all he could do was use his body as a meat shield to buy time.

Shirone watched Bebeto being hacked apart by the blade of patricide.

Please create a good world.

Someone had said that, and Bebeto had said that.

Even if all of this was false, could he say that even their suffering was false?

You can turn it back, human.

As Digital Ra's voice penetrated, Shirone looked down at his feet.

Before he knew it, new mucus was climbing up his body.

"You can turn it back?"

You can save them. You can eliminate all suffering in the world.

The mucus rose to his waist.

Accept me. Become a god and remake this world.

"Lian..."

Lian, still fighting desperately with Baknya, seemed to be saying with his whole body that he shouldn't do it.

"I'm sorry."

Shirone calmly closed his eyes and accepted Digital Ra.

"Hah!"

As the fusion ended and the Immortal Function opened, an avatar born from Shirone's body spread wings of light wide.

As if soaring toward the sun, the mucus pushed Shirone up into the sky above the pyramid.

"It's started!"

Shura, who had been fighting desperately with Miro, opened his eyes wide and looked back at the pyramid.

As light more intense than the sun descended to earth, everyone looked up at the sky.

Shirone and Ra became one, completely dominating the time and space of Apocalypse.

"Ah."

The troubles of humanity seen through Digital Ra were combinations of countless random numbers.

Within those combinations, war, famine, torture, every kind of suffering humans could imagine was unfolding.

What are you looking at?

A voice he had heard somewhere.

From the very bottom of his memory, the voice of a Gaian rose up and pierced his mind.

'Suffering.'

What are you looking at?

'Death. The extinction of life.'

What are you looking at!

Shirone's eyes flashed open.

'The Ultimate!'

As the Ultima System, Elysion, activated, another voice carved into humanity's most distant history reached Shirone.

What do you see at the end of the ultimate?

Shirone answered thus:

"...Emptiness (form is emptiness, emptiness is form)."

Kukukukukukuku!

As the world shook, Shura activated the pyramid.

'Show me what you have.'

Miro too needed to know what Shirone's collateral was that made Valhalla Action's equivalent exchange possible.

'Right, what exactly was there?'

The world began to fall as it transformed into digital code.

Unique codes and numbers flowing down like raindrops was natural in Under Coder, but what was surprising came next.

'The codes are being simplified.'

The unique codes, composed of infinite base numbers, were being simplified, dropping through billion-base to decimal.

'Base 5. Base 3. Base 2.'

Having analyzed that far, Shura felt his mind go blank and opened his mouth in a daze.

"Base 1..."

One.

All codes had been converted to 1.

Even with base 2, Shura had been able to gauge the information of the sun and clouds, but now it was impossible.

Even if the sun's information was 11 and the cloud's information was 111, there was no way to separate the two from 11111.

'There are no boundaries. This is exactly...'

The Gaian's insight, Elysion.

Going further, Miro realized.

'Because it's the simplest, it can reach the ultimate.'

And what lay beyond that was only the realm of infinity.

Elysion was the only key that could open the door of the confined state and escape into the open state.

As the bodies of the guardians and the bodies of the underground people were buried in the massive flow of 1s, Shura, coming to his senses, threw his body at Baknya.

'Emptiness is rushing in!'

Even as the world was ending, he grabbed the back of Baknya's neck as she continued fighting, and she shouted while dodging Lian's sword.

"We have to get out! It's resetting!"

"Wait! The match isn't over yet...!"

Shura decomposed his and Baknya's bodies into code 1 to match Shirone's protocol.

Lian watched the aggregate of 1s that seemed to seep into the waterfall of code and rise against the current.

Like an optical illusion, he could see the boundary line for a moment, but soon it became indistinguishable from other codes.

Meanwhile, Shirone was still looking beyond the ultimate in the dark space of the small world creation.

"Why do you leave!"

Mucus Man appeared behind Shirone.

When even digital signals couldn't connect with Shirone, he had directly borrowed human form to chase after him.

But he couldn't touch Shirone.

Though it was a gap of less than a meter, for Ra it was a boundary of emptiness that could never be crossed.

"Have you forgotten the value of this world! Can you leave after seeing so much suffering, the entanglement of life?"

"There's no falsehood or truth."

Shirone said as he turned around.

"It's all just a dream that came from nothingness."

With those words, Shirone slowly turned his body and moved away into the darkness.

"Wait, Shirone! You have an obligation to answer me. Why...!"

Ra couldn't catch Shirone.

That was exactly the gap between the confined state and open state, farther than the ends of the universe.

"Shirone!"

Apocalypse Reset.

Shirone Erasure (Information System Departure).

"What the hell happened?"

Miro's group was left alone in a pale space where the codes had disappeared and nothing remained.

While Marsha and Fermi looked around, Lian, drained of strength, collapsed with a thud.

Only Miro knew this was the Spot.

"Lian."

As Shirone appeared, cutting through the white landscape, Lian dragged his aching body and rushed over.

"Shirone, you..."

"Yeah. I remembered everything. Sorry for worrying you."

Lian bit his lip.

Saying he remembered everything meant Shirone had realized that even he himself was nothing more than information.

"I'm sorry. But to save you..."

"Lian, I'm okay."

Shirone was sincere.

"Thank you for coming all this way to save me."

Shirone looked at the others.

"Miro, Marsha, thank you. Fermi, you too."

The fact that he held not a trace of hostility toward Fermi gave a sense of what Shirone's current state was like.

"Well, you don't need to go that far with me."

Fermi shrugged and approached, materializing a depreciation transaction contract in his right hand.

"First, I'd appreciate it if you could sign this."

Shirone looked at the contract but nothing registered in his eyes.

Taking the pen, Shirone inscribed his name.

"Is that it now?"

Fermi didn't even respond and turned his body.

Walking to where others couldn't see while staring intently at the contract, his shoulders shook slightly.

'Kekeke, kekekeke.'

He had to transfer the signature to reality to succeed in the forgery, but Fermi's face was already intoxicated with victory, laughing grotesquely.

'I finally got it! 190 billion gold!'

Watching Fermi's retreating figure, Shirone smiled with empty yet beautiful expression.

He hoped Fermi wouldn't torment himself too much in reality, but now it didn't matter either way.

"Well then, goodbye everyone."

"Shirone, wait a moment!"

Before Lian's cry could finish, the scenery changed to the mirror room where Under Coder's final entrance had been.

"Shirone..."

Miro approached and placed a hand on Lian's shoulder.

"Don't feel hurt. For the current Shirone, this is natural. The real problem is the Shirone in reality."

"What do you mean?"

"The Ultima System integrates all information into one. Therefore, Shirone's Elysion also has no boundaries. In other words, the possibility of controlling the Immortal Function to its extreme limit has emerged."

Fermi's expression crumpled.

He had been a troublesome opponent even before going to heaven, but now it looked like he'd have even more headaches.

"I don't know what it is, but Shirone getting stronger is a good thing, isn't it?"

Miro shook his head.

"No. Elysion is a double-edged sword. Beyond the ultimate, there's nothing. I expect it's not the kind of emptiness humans can endure. Facing that emptiness, what's the possibility that Shirone will return to reality?"

Lian's face went blank.

"But that's..."

"I know too. The world of Apocalypse can't exceed the limits humans think of. So I can't guarantee it's possible in reality either. But if a situation like today happens again..."

After hesitating briefly, Miro spoke.

"Shirone will absolutely never come back."
