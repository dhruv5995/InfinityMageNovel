[549] Code Decomposition (2)

She had no choice but to select either left or right.

The reason her beastly senses couldn't detect it was likely because Rian's movement was divided exactly equally between left and right.

Existing with exactly 50 percent probability whether left or right - this was movement absolutely impossible without borrowing the power of the law.

And that movement had pushed Paknyeo into a life-or-death gamble.

'Left!'

The moment the traces of exploding earth approached before her eyes, Paknyeo twisted her body and raised her thin sword.

With a crash, Rian's greatsword struck.

Having no time to gauge the power of the blow, Paknyeo immediately launched her body back to create distance.

"Graaah!"

Rian's body, having swung the greatsword wide, staggered.

Then his thigh and calf muscles ruptured with a terrible sound.

Pain surged through his remaining nerves, but Paknyeo was also in no state to be at ease.

'I blocked it. Did I block it?'

She had been able to turn left and block Rian's sword, but honestly it had been left to luck.

The judgment that it was better to trust the 50 percent probability and act rather than hesitate before crisis showed how disciplined she was as a swordsman.

But thinking about it the other way around...

'I almost died.'

With 50 percent probability.

She, who had lived for over ten thousand years, had nearly been cut down by the sword of someone who hadn't even lived twenty years.

Though the yaksha Paknyeo had long since lost even attachment to life as an emotion from the distant past, her sense of humiliation was all the greater for it.

'I'll cut him down!'

Paknyeo exploded her nirvana power to its limit and charged at Rian.

'I just need to be careful of that.'

The power of Denai combined with super-regeneration was stronger than any axing, so she gave him no chance to launch his body from the start.

Rian, facing her, moved his arm that was nothing but bone with the power of law and blocked the attacks.

If Paknyeo was acceleration, then Rian was pure speed.

The difference in technique and experience was absolute, but he was holding out by filling that gap with superior speed.

"Rian..."

Sirone, who had been watching the battle in a daze, muttered.

"You've gotten stronger."

Though his memories were mixed up in chaos, watching Rian's martial arts - wretched yet beautiful - made joy well up from deep within.

"Consul."

At that moment, Sirone's heart sank.

He could tell just from the voice, because it was thick with the waves of death.

Where he turned his head, Yo knelt exhausted, the smoke of desire having drained from her.

"Yo..."

"Consul, the sun of the colony is..."

Before she could finish speaking, Fermi's Air Cut severed Yo's neck.

"Yo!"

Sirone's heart pounded roughly.

She was the woman who had looked like she owned the whole world with just one Shining spell.

Despite being born a slave, she had been the first to believe in and follow Sirone.

'They're all dead.'

The bodies of the guardians were piled beneath the pyramid, and leaving those corpses behind, the Fermi and Marsha combo was climbing up.

"Consul."

Though Sirone cursed having ears to hear words he didn't want to hear, his head turned as if by unstoppable force.

Priest Bebeto was smiling with kindly eyes.

"The Consul possesses the language of God. That is why I proposed this confrontation."

Thanks to that, Sirone had been able to preserve his life.

"Please, create a good world."

"No!"

The moment Sirone shouted, Bebeto connected the code and vanished.

Appearing before Fermi and Marsha, all he could do was use his body as a meat shield to buy time.

Sirone watched Bebeto being hacked apart by the Patricide Dagger.

Please create a good world.

Someone had said that, and Bebeto had said that.

Even if all of this was false, could he say that even their suffering was false?

You can turn it back, human.

As Digital Ra's voice penetrated, Sirone looked down at his feet.

New mucus was already climbing up his body.

"I can turn it back?"

You can save them. You can eliminate all suffering in the world.

The mucus rose to his waist.

Accept me. Become a god and remake this world.

"Rian..."

Rian, still fighting desperately with Paknyeo, seemed to be saying with his whole body that he shouldn't do this.

"I'm sorry."

Sirone calmly closed his eyes and accepted Digital Ra.

"Hah!"

As the fusion completed and the Immortal Function opened, an avatar born from Sirone's body spread wings of light wide.

As if soaring toward the sun, the mucus pushed Sirone up into the sky above the pyramid.

"It's begun!"

Shura, who had been fighting desperately with Miro, opened his eyes wide and looked back at the pyramid.

As light more intense than the sun descended to earth, everyone looked up at the sky.

Sirone and Ra became one, completely dominating the time and space of Apocalypse.

"Ah."

Human suffering viewed through Digital Ra was a combination of countless random numbers.

Within that combination, war, famine, torture - every kind of suffering humans could imagine was unfolding.

What are you looking at?

A voice he had heard somewhere.

The voice of a Gaian rose from the very bottom of his memory and pierced his mind.

'Suffering.'

What are you looking at?

'Death. The extinction of life.'

What are you looking at!

Sirone's eyes snapped open.

'Ultimate!'

As the Ultima System, Elysion, activated, another voice carved into humanity's most distant history reached Sirone.

At the end of the ultimate, what are you looking at?

Sirone answered thus:

"...Emptiness." (Form is emptiness, emptiness is form)

Kukukukukukuku!

As the world shook, Shura activated the pyramid.

'Show me what you have.'

Miro also needed to know what collateral Sirone had that made Valhalla Action's equivalent exchange possible.

'Right, what exactly was there?'

The world began to fall as it transformed into digital code.

Unique codes and numbers flowing down like raindrops was natural in Under Coder, but what was surprising came next.

'The code is being simplified.'

The unique codes - things composed of infinite base numbers - were being simplified, dropping through billion-base to decimal.

'Base-5. Base-3. Base-2.'

Having analyzed that far, Shura felt his mind go blank and opened his mouth in a daze.

"Base-1..."

One.

All codes had been converted to 1.

Even up to base-2, Shura had been able to gauge the information of the sun and clouds, but now it was impossible.

Even if the sun's information was 11 and the cloud's information was 111, there was no way to separate the two within 11111.

'There are no boundaries. This is exactly...'

The Gaian insight, Elysion.

Going further, Miro realized.

'Because it's the simplest, it can reach the ultimate.'

And beyond that lay only the realm of infinity.

Elysion was the only key that could open the door of the trapped state and escape into the open state.

As the bodies of the guardians and underground people were buried in the great flow of 1s, Shura came to his senses and threw himself at Paknyeo.

'Emptiness is rushing in!'

Grabbing the back of Paknyeo's neck as she fought even though the world was ending, she dodged Rian's sword and shouted.

"We have to get out! It's resetting!"

"Wait! The match isn't over yet...!"

Shura decomposed his and Paknyeo's bodies into code of 1s to match Sirone's protocol.

Rian watched the collection of 1s that seemed to seep into the waterfall of code and rise against the current.

Like an optical illusion, he could see a boundary line for a moment, but soon it became indistinguishable from other codes.

Meanwhile, Sirone was still gazing beyond the ultimate in the dark space of the small world creation.

"Why do you leave!"

The Mucus Man appeared behind Sirone.

When the digital signal couldn't connect with Sirone, he had borrowed human form and chased after him directly.

But he couldn't touch Sirone.

Though it was a gap of less than a meter, to Ra it was a boundary of emptiness that could never be crossed.

"Have you forgotten the value of this world! Can you leave after seeing so much suffering, the entanglement of life?"

"There's no falsehood or truth."

Sirone said as he turned around.

"It's all just a dream that came from nothingness."

With those words, Sirone slowly turned his body and moved away into the darkness.

"Wait, Sirone! You have an obligation to answer me. Why...!"

Ra couldn't catch Sirone.

That was the gap between trapped and open states, farther than the ends of the universe.

"Sirone!"

Apocalypse Reset.

Sirone Erasure (Information System Departure).

"What the hell happened?"

Miro's group was left alone in a pale space where the codes had disappeared and nothing remained.

While Marsha and Fermi looked around, Rian, his strength gone, collapsed with a thud.

Only Miro knew this was the Spot.

"Rian."

As Sirone appeared, cutting through the white landscape, Rian struggled with his aching body and rushed over.

"Sirone, you..."

"Yeah. I remembered everything. Sorry for worrying you."

Rian bit his lip.

Remembering everything meant Sirone had learned that even he himself was nothing more than information.

"I'm sorry. But to save you..."

"Rian, I'm fine."

Sirone was sincere.

"Thank you for coming all this way to save me."

Sirone looked at the others.

"Miro, Marsha, thank you. Fermi, you too."

The fact that he held no hostility even toward Fermi gave them a sense of what Sirone's current state was like.

"Well, you don't need to go that far with me."

Fermi shrugged his shoulders and approached, materializing a depreciation transaction contract in his right hand.

"First, I'd appreciate it if you could sign this."

Sirone looked at the contract but nothing registered in his eyes.

Taking the pen, Sirone inscribed his name.

"Is that it now?"

Fermi didn't even reply and turned away.

Walking to where others couldn't see while staring intently at the contract, his shoulders shook slightly.

'Hehehe, hehehehe.'

He needed to transfer the signature to reality to succeed in the forgery, but Fermi's face was already intoxicated with victory, laughing grotesquely.

'I finally got it! 190 billion gold!'

Watching Fermi's retreating figure, Sirone smiled with empty yet beautiful expression.

He hoped Fermi wouldn't torment himself too much in reality, but now it didn't really matter.

"Well then, goodbye everyone."

"Sirone, wait a moment!"

Before Rian's shout could finish, the scenery changed to the mirror room where Under Coder's final entrance had been.

"Sirone..."

Miro approached and gripped Rian's shoulder.

"Don't feel hurt. For the current Sirone, this is natural. The real problem is Sirone in reality."

"What do you mean?"

"The Ultima System integrates all information into one. Therefore, Sirone's Elysion also has no boundaries. That means there's a possibility of controlling the Immortal Function to its extreme."

Fermi's expression crumpled.

He had been a troublesome opponent even before going to heaven, but now it looked like he'd be even more of a headache.

"I don't know what that means, but Sirone getting stronger is good, isn't it?"

Miro shook his head.

"No. Elysion is a double-edged sword. Beyond the ultimate, there's nothing. I suspect it's not the kind of emptiness humans can endure. Faced with that emptiness, what's the possibility that Sirone will return to reality?"

Rian's face went blank.

"But that's..."

"I know too. The world of Apocalypse can't exceed the limits humans can conceive. So I can't guarantee the same would be possible in reality. But if a situation like today happens again..."

After hesitating briefly, Miro spoke.

"Sirone will absolutely never come back."
