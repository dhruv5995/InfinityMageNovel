Rules of the Holy War (5)

'What on earth are they trying to do...'

As Satan revealed his murderous intent, the guard captains from each nation drew their weapons.

'If I get caught in Vanishing, it's over. Should I cut him down before that happens?'

Simply cutting someone down based on murderous intent alone would cause problems later, but if the target was Habits, that was a different story.

"Hmm."

At that moment, Habits' murderous intent disappeared and he obediently walked toward Uorin.

"This should be interesting."

Fortunately no commotion broke out, but those watching felt even more unsettled.

'Restraining present desires for future pleasure.'

It was truly evil.

Shortly after, Paras, Moon, and Gustav entered the main building in order of arrival.

Feeling the gradually heavier atmosphere, the heads of each nation left their seats first for safety.

"Jincheon Empire! Entering the main building!"

From the procession of the Jincheon Empire that arrived around sunset, Sirone examined Jingang's face.

'He's gotten even more gaunt.'

It must be because his daughter was in hell.

"Jingang is no ordinary man."

Albino approached.

"No country escaped damage from the war, but they still have the world's largest population. The brains are the Jincheon Space Nation. I heard a woman named Anchal leads it - isn't she from the same school as you?"

"Yes. Though Anchal dropped out midway." Albino stroked his beard.

"The Three Emperors System has collapsed, but there are still three empires supporting this world. Kashan, Gustav, and Jincheon. The other nations will probably try to ally with one of them."

Sirone realized the true meaning of his words.

"It's true I'm acquainted with Jincheon's king, but I'm not someone who handles matters based on personal feelings."

"That remains to be seen."

Albino's laughter was grating.

"Where in worldly affairs is there anything not based on personal feelings? They may claim to act for the greater good for now, but even that greater good comes from the heart. There are plenty of ways to corner someone, aren't there? Especially someone like youâ€”"

"Mr. Albino."

Sirone wanted to make this clear.

"Jingang sent his daughter to hell. That daughter saved humanity. Doesn't that hold any meaning?"

"I'm not trying to fight with you."

Albino remained calm.

"Once we clash, things will work out somehow. No need to get worked up - results will come naturally. Like hot and cold water mixing. The question is who drinks that water. The reason you're attending the Holy War with Tormia citizenship is probably because the people who know you best are here. In other words, they're easier to control."

"I..."

"Were you going to say trust? That's fine. In any case, everyone makes their own choices. If your value is exceptional, I too would make efforts to curry favor, but..."

Albino shrugged as he turned away.

"Who knows? What might happen." As Sirone watched Albino walking away, Lufist approached.

"Don't take it too much to heart. He's someone who came here responsible for Tormia's citizens' future, after all."

His words had to be cold.

"Honestly, I sympathize with some of it too. I'm grateful you chose Tormia citizenship. I hope Yahweh saves humanity. But what happens after that? It'll be competition between nations again. When that moment comes, I don't want to see Tormia fall. Mr. Albino knows that too." Lufist turned his head.

"You're a key figure with the broadest and deepest network of connections in the Holy War. In a sense, you could be called the 13th nation. Honestly, I want to use you. If you don't like it, you can refuse. But... I'd prefer we don't exchange words like betrayal."

This was an issue that had to be addressed before the Holy War.

'Betrayal.' Just as Sirone was lost in thought, the Iron Kingdom arrived.

It was the only nation that maintained its monarchy while Fermi conquered the seven southern kingdoms.

Lufist said:

"They have a rational political system. The consensus is they won't stand out in the Holy War either. Moderately strong, moderately flexible."

Next to Iron's King Basak, Sirone saw a familiar face.

'Shura from the Council of Ten.'

She who had been on the moon with Buddha had descended to the world.

Lufist muttered:

"Why did she choose Iron?"

"It must be because of Berone."

Sirone's eyes darkened.

'The Berone problem.'

Are humans beings capable of changing results?

'Only God can do such things. But Berone left a possibility at the last moment.'

The Iron Pole he had planted in the Iron Kingdom was still embedded deep within the law.

'A result unshaken by causes. Nothing but pure will without any coloration.'

It was a hint for opposing God.

Past midnight, the southern tribal confederation and the Arachne Kingdom representing the ten island nations arrived.

Lufist said:

"These aren't core nations for this Holy War. But we need to watch the south. Countless tribes unified during the war. Their various shamanisms combined into one. Partly due to Gaold's crazy actions reducing demon numbers, but the south is currently the only continent that has completely eliminated demons, which is significant."

Sirone asked:

"What about Arachne?"

"Lots of beautiful women." At this brief assessment, Sirone looked at Lufist.

"What? Is what I said strange?"

"They're famous enough to hold world beauty contests. But if they're getting into the Holy War's 12 nations, shouldn't we not underestimate them?"

"You're misunderstanding something."

Lufist pointed at Arachne.

"They say people are the same everywhere, but as national borders differ, each country's philosophy differs too. It's a nation that has researched beauty for decades. Children grow up dreaming of world beauty contests. In other words, the size of their talent pool is different. And that talent has permeated throughout Arachne's politics and entire society. They say you can't land even a small contract without hostesses."

Sirone thought of Rangi.

"So they're professional."

"Right. Available personnel, experience, databases - in Arachne, honey traps aren't improvisation but military strategy. And honey traps sometimes..."

Lufist's expression turned bitter.

"Wield far more powerful force than cards like atomic bomb blueprints. Especially in political arenas crawling with embodiments of desire." Sirone examined the lavishly decorated carriages in Arachne's procession.

There were dozens of carriages large enough for ten people each, and Lufist was looking at the same place.

"They probably never intended to become a leading nation from the start. But they have plenty of potential to shake things up from the shadows. What they want is to grab as much profit as possible."

The Holy War held in Jive Kingdom.

'Kashan, Gustav, Jincheon.'

The three empires.

'Iron, Moon, Paras.'

Traditional powers.

'Tormia, Kesia, Corona.'

New forces participating in the Holy War for the first time.

'The south and Arachne.'

Unknown variables not yet figured out.

'Now it begins.'

The doors to the Holy War opened.

Leaving the banquet hall, Sirone entered the pre-arranged Tormia section.

Security was tight from the corridors, and a Yongroe staff member guided him to the conference room.

Entering the room guarded by the royal guard, Pony, Albino, Lufist, and Flu were gathered around a table.

"Did you find it?"

Lufist said:

"We wanted you to hear the briefing. Did I interrupt?"

"No."

As Sirone took a seat at one end of the table, Flu walked to the standing chart at the front.

"This is a meeting to check essential elements before the Holy War. I'll begin the briefing."

Taking out a pointer, Flu indicated the large text written on the chart.

"Holy War. An international alliance formed by nations wielding powerful influence in the world. The Holy War organization is divided into five main parts: General Assembly, Military Department, Economic and Social Department, Religious Department, and International Court. When people usually say the Holy War is convening, they mean the General Assembly."

The pointer tapped the chart.

"The Military Department is commonly called Valkyrie. Until recently, Iruki from Tormia served as Supreme Commander, but he's currently on leave due to emotional illness."

They didn't use the word retirement.

"The head of the Economic and Social Department is Mr. Smith, chairman of the International Alchemy Foundation. He's from Jive Kingdom."

"We can't expect any goodwill."

"Right. Though it's somewhat consoling that his authority has been considerably reduced since the war. The Religious Department is overseen by the Rami Church's Pope, and the International Court is handled exclusively by Red Line headquarters."

Albino asked:

"Who's the director? I know they're selected from those who've served as association presidents in various countries."

"Currently Mr. Bebeto Socrates holds the position. His nickname is the Fat Pig. He was president of Yakma Republic's Magic Association for seven years."

"Gaold would know him."

"Yes. I've attended former presidents' meetings following Mr. Gaold, but their relationship didn't seem particularly good."

Lufist let out a hollow laugh.

"Who would that guy be friendly with?" Flu continued his explanation.

"Subsidiary organizations of the Holy War include the World Climate Organization, World Health Organization, World Communications Bureau, and others. Delegations from each organization will also attend tomorrow's event."

Seriel was also traveling through the night to come.

"This concludes the overview of the Holy War. Now I'll explain the Holy War's voting system, which could be called the most crucial aspect."

As Sirone straightened his expression, the explanation continued.

"When all Holy War proceedings end, the 12 nations will gather for simultaneous voting. Each nation can exercise three types of authority. First is Rom."

It meant power in the ancient language.

"Rom is one vote that can be given to one's own country or another country."

A choosable vote.

"Second is Garto. Meaning favor, it's one vote given to another country. What you must remember here is that invalid votes are impossible."

"Meaning you must cast it somewhere."

"Yes. Even though there are three votes, it's still voting. Breaking the rules is considered forfeiting the vote entirely, resulting in authority being revoked."

Flu pointed to the third item.

"Finally, Temica. Authority meaning suppression - Rom not used on one's own country, in other words Rom given to another country. That vote can be eliminated."

Sirone asked:

"Conversely, when Tormia exercises Rom authority on its own country, other nations can't eliminate it with Temica, right?"

"Right. If Rom trading becomes too active, there's no upper limit to the auction. Simply put, you can transfer the one point you could give yourself to others, but that one point also carries the risk of being erased by one point."

Lufist said:

"Rom is the key."

"Yes. For example, a country like Arachne with no leadership ambitions would probably try to sell this authority to the highest bidder. But from the buyer's perspective, with the Temica suppression mechanism, they can't openly buy them up."

"Hmm."

As everyone fell into thought, Flu continued:

"The 12 nations can freely negotiate these authorities until voting, and ultimately the country receiving the most votes becomes the leading nation with the Pope's approval. Arithmetically, 23 votes is the maximum, zero votes the minimum. However, the decision-maker must officially be the nation's representative, and if replaced midway, the predecessor's authority is canceled."

Albino shrugged his shoulders.

"Kuk kuk kuk, a situation where the king gets replaced..."

The scent of blood already seemed to fill the air.
