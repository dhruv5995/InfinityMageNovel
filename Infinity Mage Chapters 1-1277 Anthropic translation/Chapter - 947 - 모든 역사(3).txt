All History (3)

The kaleidoscope began to unravel.

Natasha collapsed to the ground, and the few eyes that discovered her drew countless more gazes.

The noise of war rippled and faded away.

'That human woman... was defeated?'

Though the demons hated humans, they couldn't carelessly belittle Natasha's martial prowess.

"Rian!"

Tess, who had returned after completing her mission with the flowers of life, froze upon seeing Rian's condition.

"Hah! Hah!"

Rian breathed roughly, both his arms having vanished without a trace from the shoulders down.

Only <Idea>, floating in the air through divine transcendence, spoke of his will.

Natasha raised her head.

"Rian, was it?"

The skeletal reaper had its hand in her abdomen, treating her, but it could barely stop the bleeding.

A kind of surgical ability.

However, as was the law of avatars, its skill was only at the level of fixing a broken doll.

"Save your words. You might die."

Rian had no particular philosophy of war.

To raise any banner, too many humans had died by his sword.

"It's fine if I die."

Rian nodded and asked.

"Do you have any last words?"

"I lost."

She really wanted to tell him.

"Your sword broke through all my rhythm. Whatever it was, from now on it becomes your technique and your style. I'd like to call it irregular beat, but that's for the master to decide."

"Names don't matter to me."

"Really?"

Natasha relaxed and collapsed.

"You were cool."

She had spoken everything on her mind, but Rian still had something left.

"You said you could abandon evil."

"That doesn't erase the sins. But if you regret it, atone now. Here where humanity judges you, denying the demons is the only compensation for those who died because of you."

The demons' faces contorted.

"You can torture and kill me. I did a lot of bad things."

Natasha was calm.

"But I don't regret it. What's regret? If that were possible, I wouldn't be here in the first place."

For a talent that sought the best at every moment, looking back was impossible.

"When I said I'd abandon evil, I just meant it doesn't matter. Whether it's the human side or the demon side. Still, my answer is..."

Natasha raised her head.

"I became friends with Havitz first. Sorry."

For her, who had no purpose in life, that reason was enough.

"Kill her! Kill the human!"

Realizing it was advantageous to claim Natasha first, demons charged forward fiercely.

"All forces, charge!"

The allied forces, thinking the same, clashed, and the area where Rian and Natasha were became packed with troops.

"Kraaaah!"

It was a hellish battlefield.

"Satan..."

Seeing Havitz's severed head on the ground, all the Shiok wore identical expressions.

"Satan!"

Though their ages and appearances were all different, at this moment it seemed there were twelve identical faces.

"No! No!"

The 1 o'clock of Pride clutched his head and screamed.

"Time won't reverse! Why, why aren't you regretting it!"

Because he couldn't perceive it.

"I'll get revenge!"

The moment Shiok charged forward, a massive shadow appeared and all twelve began to sink.

"Kraaaah! Remember this, humans! We will return! We will surely get revenge...!"

The screams disappeared underground.

"Hah."

Only after a long while did Armin release his stop magic and slump down.

"We did it."

Quan appeared, blood streaming from one eye.

Since the strike was perfect, recovery was impossible, and even if it were possible, he would refuse it.

"Quan, your decision..."

"Do you understand now?"

Quan coldly interrupted.

"Why I don't go to meet her."

Quan's hidden code used emotions generated when driving himself into a terrible state as material.

The more his body was destroyed, the closer to abnormal he became, the more his asymmetric extremes would tilt.

'When this war ends...'

What state would Quan be in?

And would Shiina be able to accept that?

"God, do not forgive me."

Eden, whose mind had been dominated by Satan, shed tears as he offered a prayer of repentance.

Sein tried to think positively.

'At least we won.'

But the moment he examined Havitz's severed head, a doubt close to terror arose.

'What's that?'

Havitz's face, drained of life.

But in one of his dead pupils, something small and black was writhing.

'A fly.'

The sight of it trapped in the retina, pounding the eyeball with its two legs, sent chills throughout his body.

"It's not over yet!"

Honestly, he wasn't sure.

If Havitz were alive, it would be normal to hear mental waves through God's frequency.

"Kiaaaah!"

Havitz's eye shattered like glass, and from the pierced eye socket, mottled tentacles burst out like vomit.

"Get away!"

The circular mouth at the end of the tentacle spread like an umbrella and rushed toward Meirei.

'As if I'd let that happen!'

Everyone activated their specialties, but for some reason, no effects appeared.

'What?'

Twelve shadows formed around Meirei, and the Shiok appeared again.

"Kekekeke! You were fooled again! Fooled again!"

As the twelve rotating shadows spread, all laws within the circle were ignored.

Without even making a sound, Meirei's body was sucked into the tentacle's mouth.

Sein's Iron Wheel Eye couldn't cause any accidents.

'A predetermined future.'

Was it really a coincidence that Sein's group gathered and Havitz left the battlefield?

"Kekeke."

The face of Havitz, who pulled the 10-meter tentacle from his eye, gradually regained vitality.

"Finally, I ate it."

The tentacle, swollen like an anaconda, instantly decomposed Meirei.

'No.'

It wasn't sorrow for a comrade's death.

The worst possible situation had arrived, one where such human emotions had no room to interfere.

"Kraaaah!"

Purple Satan's energy spread fan-like above Havitz's crown.

"More."

He wanted to eat more.

The reason the voice of desire could be heard so clearly, as if spoken right into his ear, was...

'The hidden code of the 8 o'clock of Envy.'

It was clear evidence that Meirei's ability, God's frequency, had been stolen by Havitz.

"Cough! Cough!"

From below Havitz's throat as he dry-coughed, things like entrails came pouring out.

Then they took shape in the air, transforming into an indescribably grotesque human body.

"...Satan?"

"No. I'm Havitz."

Havitz, whose face and body didn't match, tapped his head with the monster's index finger.

"Just the brain, of course."

Though it was surely a curse that every part except his face was made of others' flesh and organs...

"Ho."

Havitz didn't care.

"So this is how it was. Interesting."

When Armin's thoughts were heard as hallucinations, Sein's group's faces turned pale.

"Were you listening through the object?"

When Havitz stuck out his tongue, Meirei's blood-stained <Nemesis> was revealed.

"Ptui!"

The moment he spat out the ring and the mental waves were cut off, Sein frowned.

'Damn it. Of all things...'

The ability that should never have been stolen had fallen into the hands of the one who should never have it.

Havitz looked back at Lilia.

"Aha? You were thinking such things? Unexpected. Or should I say cute?"

Lilia's face turned tearful.

"Please."

She finally realized what had befallen this world.

"Don't do this."

If only begging desperately could turn the situation around.

Sein spoke.

"Havitz, come at us. You want to kill us, right? Since we're the only natural enemy who can kill you."

If the face was Havitz and the body was Satan, then this time there was truly only one life.

"Hehe. Hehehehe."

Havitz, intoxicated by God's frequency ability, didn't even pretend to listen to Sein's words.

"I don't care what you babble. I can hear everything. All of your inner voices."

'This is really driving me crazy!'

Following his old habit, Havitz twirled his mustache.

"And killing is over now. You used this ability too, so you should know."

The mind that Meirei had eavesdropped on was Havitz's.

"No, your strategy will never succeed. Rather, kill all the humans! Torment and torture them! That's what you wanted!"

Frankly, that would have been better.

"The taste of humans."

Havitz said.

"The reason people torment, torture, and kill other people. There's nothing more delicious than humans in this world. The problem is that it's too addictive, and the threshold shoots up."

Sharp claws scratched his temple.

"So I thought. Isn't there a part of humans more delicious than life itself? And there was one. The heart."

That was why God's frequency was necessary.

"Now it's time to cook that. Something incredibly delicious that I can enjoy chewing for a very, very long time..."

Havitz's single eye swayed in ecstasy, and the tentacle on the opposite side stood stiffly erect.

"The taste of humans."

No one answered.

"...They've left."

When Havitz released his vanishing, not even his footprints remained.

Armin asked.

"Where did they go? If it's Tormia..."

"No."

Sein shook his head.

"Not Tormia. Miro is coming or has already arrived. When good and evil collide, Terraforce's judgment is activated. And when that happens..."

Quan continued.

"God's frequency disappears."

These were the words Meirei had warned them with before the assassination operation.

"Right. From now on, he'll think about enjoying pain rather than killing humans. In that case, there's no reason to go where Miro is. Even if he didn't calculate this, the law makes it so."

Lilia raised her hand.

"Wait. Then wouldn't it be right to return to the battlefield instead? Havitz cares about the Gustav Four Cavalry. To abandon them and leave seems..."

Sein nodded.

"Right. It lacks plausibility. But I'm putting weight on the major premise being executed. That is, today's events have caused a major change in Havitz's mindset."

Quan stroked his chin.

"He's become so absorbed in this that he'd abandon his comrades? Well, if things go wrong, the entire world could become his playground."

"Exactly. Since he can now read human hearts, it would be stranger if he remained exactly the same. Until now he was Satan dwelling in a human body, but now he's a bit closer to Satan."

Armin wrinkled his nose bridge.

"Then this is serious. If Havitz abandoned his comrades, the demons won't leave the Gustav Four Cavalry alone. Their reduced influence also means the demons' strategy is being implemented."

Eden gritted his teeth and stood up.

"9th Corps Commander Paimon."

The demon world is a pathogen.

"Right. This isn't the time to chase Havitz. We must suppress Paimon as quickly as possible. If she opens the demon world..."

Even God would shed tears of blood.

"Mm, yes yes."

Walking across the wasteland stretching to the horizon, Havitz tore off the tentacle from his eye.

Satan's flesh seeped into the black pierced hole and regenerated as an eyeball with a red pupil.

Havitz, thinking of things he could do with God's frequency, kept nodding.

"Aha, I could use it this way too."

The taste of humans.

He could now fully taste what he had designated as the most delicious part of humans - their hearts.

"But this isn't enough. Hmm."

When Paimon's demon world covered the world, human taste would flood in beyond imagination, but...

"That's just eating a lot. I want the ultimate taste. Something a bit more dramatic and thrilling..."

Perfectly agonizing events.

"Hehehe. Right, there was that."

To perfectly cook hearts, one more ability was needed besides God's frequency.

Events.

"It was worth keeping alive. I said I didn't want to kill."

Though he didn't know the direction and might not escape the wasteland even after walking for days...

"Satan!"

Demons who had pursued Havitz separately from Balkan's orders were flying through the sky.

"Kekeke, let's go."

Havitz raised his hand to the sky.

"Uorin."

Lifted by the monster bird's talons and rising into the sky, his gaze was fixed on Kashan.
