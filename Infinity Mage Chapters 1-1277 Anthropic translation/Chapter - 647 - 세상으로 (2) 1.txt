[647] Into the World (2)

After resting at the Ogent household, Sirone had finished preparing to leave with Rian.

Since he had to take the Ivory Tower test against powerful competitors, he couldn't rest for long.

During the three-day rest period, Tess, who had come down from the capital, was making lunch boxes by hand with Amy for the two departing friends.

"You must be sad, Amy?"

"......"

Since Tess had always cheered Amy on, she was furious about the situation where Amy had to part ways with Sirone for life.

"Don't be like that, at least say something. That you'll wait, or that he can't meet other women, or when and where you'll reunite."

What frustrated Tess most was that no promises were being exchanged between the two.

Amy shook her head with a sad smile.

"I don't want to do that. It wouldn't be any use anyway."

"Why wouldn't it be any use? You have to say things like that to make men watch their behavior."

Amy's hands, which had been kneading rice balls, stopped.

"Tess, do you remember? When we went to Galliant before."

Of course she couldn't forget.

It was a journey where they not only fought the Parrot Thieves but also experienced extraordinary things in Heaven.

"Back then, I said something like this - that sometimes Sirone would appear faint to me."

"Right, I remember. You said that. That Sirone seemed to view the world from an omniscient perspective."

"At the Ivory Tower, they call that Kar. The ability to analyze phenomena objectively while excluding oneself."

That's why the residents of the Ivory Tower placed complete trust in the stars.

"Hmm, he definitely has that tendency strongly."

"There's a saying that the worst person in the world is someone who has harmed you. It means humans are still trapped in the existence called 'me'. But Sirone seemed a little different."

"You mean he doesn't judge based on himself?"

"Yeah. Of course, mages always try to be objective, but Sirone even denies himself. When he embraced Marsha, when he forgave the royal named Pony. No, maybe even this is just my standard, and Sirone might have been following only the flow of logic from the beginning."

"That seems too extreme. Sirone may be cool-headed, but he's not a cold person."

"Honestly, I'm not sure."

Amy recalled Sirone's Kar value.

"A Kar value close to 90 percent means only 10 percent of his judgment is subjective. It's definitely not human-like. Most humans act expecting an emotional premium, but Sirone's actions are focused solely on achieving objectives."

Tears welled up in Amy's eyes.

"That's why I'm not saying anything. Words about waiting, promises about the future - they won't have any effect on Sirone."

*Thunk* - the kitchen knife stuck into the cutting board.

"That's not true, Amy!"

Tess grabbed Amy's shoulders with both hands.

"A person's heart isn't determined by numbers. You're definitely within that 10 percent. You're filling that 10 percent with emotions greater than 90 percent."

"Do you think so?"

Amy wiped her flowing tears with her sleeve.

"Will Sirone really not forget me?"

"Of course not! What will happen if you, who knows Sirone best, become anxious?"

"Yeah. I believe. I believe in Sirone."

With the situation of parting without knowing when they'd meet again, plus hearing evaluations from the highest institution called the Ivory Tower, her heart had unknowingly weakened.

Tess embraced Amy with her broad chest and said with a smile.

"Let's make the most delicious food. If not for us, would those idiots even eat proper meals?"

Only then did Amy regain her smile and nod.

"Ahaha! Right, they definitely would do that."

With two horses waiting, Sirone received Amy's still-warm lunch box with both hands.

"Thank you, Amy. I'll eat it well."

"Take care of yourself. Sometimes... send letters."

Even asking him to send letters felt burdensome, but Sirone readily nodded.

"Yeah. I'll contact you once I get settled."

Rian, who had checked the time by the sun's position in the sky, turned toward the horses and said.

"Let's go now. We don't have time."

Tess glared with sharp eyes.

"Hey! We don't know when we'll see each other again after parting, and you won't even say goodbye?"

"We'll see each other someday. Sirone has to compete with incredible people right now. Goodbye isn't what's important."

At his indifferent answer, Tess looked rather dumbfounded.

'What kind of guy is this?'

Rian added bluntly.

"Just graduate from sword school. Hurry up and join us."

Only then did a smile form on Tess's lips.

"Hmph, of course I will. I'll graduate as valedictorian and rise so high that there'll be no comparison with a dropout like you."

"Hahaha! You still don't know - by then, I'll have become a great swordsman known throughout the world."

Though they seemed to be bickering, Amy envied the two who were ultimately talking about each other's futures.

"Right! I almost forgot this!"

Sirone, who had put the lunch box in the bag hanging from the saddle, took out Armand from his cube.

Since there had been mental progress during the graduation exam, there should have been some changes to Armand as well.

Amy put her hands on her hips and said.

"Hmm, that's right. Now that you're a mage, you can carry weapons from now on, right?"

"Yeah. I plan to wear it as much as possible."

When he activated Diamond Armed, the blade split and wrapped around Sirone, then organic matter filled between the metal framework.

Multiple focus point detection. Function reset.

Armand, confirming the realm of Quantum Superposition, attempted another transformation following Heaven.

"Huh?"

The form that had been an angular pure white robe changed to a calm gray hood with a somewhat worn feeling.

It wasn't only the appearance that changed - the first thing confirmed was that the external artificial brain had disappeared.

'It's because of Quantum Superposition.'

When thoughts overlap in Force Dimension, having the artificial brain operating makes it much harder to integrate into Ultima.

'Valhalla Action is still disabled.'

It seemed Theraze hadn't paid the price yet, but according to Miro, it wouldn't take very long.

With the external artificial brain gone, Akamai's Antithese seemed to have moved its function to Armand's robe.

"Hmm."

When he opened Antithese, the robe split as if cut by a sword, and dozens of eyeballs blinked.

"Ugh!"

Tess grimaced, but tactically speaking, it eliminated blind spots.

Combined with Ringer's shell ability that reacted immediately to impacts, the user protection function could be considered the best.

'Huh? This is gone?'

The biggest change was that the tentacles of the Devouring Demon Kuzhen no longer came out.

'It's because my psychology changed.'

Even when he had transformed Diamond Armed in Heaven, survival was the top priority, so the manifestation had an extreme feel.

Kuzhen's tentacles had the ability to absorb energy by chewing and swallowing external organisms.

While there was the advantage of being able to give physical impacts, it definitely wasn't a method that suited Sirone's disposition.

'Most importantly, it's contradictory to Quantum Superposition.'

Abilities that were too active would become harder to control as the number of overlapping events increased.

"Wait, then how does it absorb energy?"

Sirone, whose mind was integrated with Armand, could immediately understand the change.

"Ah, it eats me."

"It... eats you?"

"The efficiency of energy metabolism has increased. So when I eat something, Kuzhen eats my body again."

It was more stable operation than finding energy externally.

"But that's creepy! Thinking that it eats you."

"I said 'eats' but it just promotes metabolism. It's the same as losing weight when you're hungry."

Living beings digest their own bodies to survive anyway.

"Still, wouldn't the physical exhaustion be severe? Isn't it dangerous?"

"It's fine. I'm the one who decides activation. Especially Kuzhen's digestive metabolism is extremely useful when dealing with Schema."

Moreover, combined with Kenser's cell regeneration ability, it would provide defense against impacts to the inside of the body.

'In other words, a four-stage defense system through Armand.'

First stage: Akamai's Antithese restrains, second stage: Ringer's shell protects the user.

Third stage: Kuzhen's metabolism promotion strengthens the body, and finally Kenser's ability regenerates cells.

Of course, actual combat would be different from theory, but with this level of defense system constructed, it seemed he could face any enemy.

'Next is offensive power.'

Galtomick's ability to strengthen laws would enhance not only magic's power but also the Avatar of Light.

Also, there were technical changes in pure magic amplification.

The magic amplifiers mounted on both gauntlets had been integrated into the right palm to draw out even more efficiency.

'This is actually better. If you're obsessed with balance, you can't create variables when it's important.'

This was also Sirone's disposition.

"I like it."

From form to function, it felt like he had finally put on clothes that suited him after casting off the extreme pain experienced in Heaven.

"As long as you like it, that's what matters."

Though Rian spoke nonchalantly, Amy was amazed by Armand's function of strengthening the entire Psychic Body.

The abilities Sirone had shown in the graduation exam alone had proven they could create tremendous synergy effects, but now Armand's functions were added on top.

'How strong is Sirone now...?'

On the other hand, Sirone liked how the style had changed from ceremonial to field use rather than the functions.

"I think I prefer these humble clothes."

Honestly, the thought of walking around the streets wearing a pure white robe without a single wrinkle made his face heat up.

"The mobility has improved too, and most importantly..."

Sirone fluttered his sleeves and smiled brightly.

"Is this waterproof too?"

Amy looked dazed, but it was an important issue for Sirone who had to keep wearing it.

Tess said.

"Still, for the world's most expensive clothes, it's pretty plain, isn't it? Good clothes have the designer's name engraved on them. How about adding something like that?"

"Ah, that's right."

Thinking the point was valid, Sirone closed his eyes and activated Ringer's shell.

*Creak. Creak.*

Metal lines moved on the soft sleeves, engraving the name Aryan Sirone.

"How about this?"

True to his modest nature, he had only engraved one line with his name, but that alone made it look much more luxurious.

"Yeah, it's cool. Now it really feels like you've become a mage."

Sirone looked at Amy with tender feelings.

Since it would take more than a day to express in words the emotions contained within, the two simply shared their parting affection through their gazes.

"Well, I'll be going! Everyone take care!"

As Sirone and Rian, mounted on horses, waved and disappeared at high speed, Tess placed her hand on Amy's shoulder.

"Don't worry, Amy. Just now..."

"Yeah. I heard it too."

Amy nodded while shedding tears.

"Sirone."

When they had left the Ogent family's main house and entered the mountain path, Rian asked.

"Why didn't you engrave Amy's name too? She seemed to want it. It wouldn't have been difficult, would it?"

Sirone smiled contentedly while staring intently at the sleeve with his name engraved.

And after a moment, he turned the sleeve inside out to show the lining.

"I already did."

Inside the name Aryan Sirone, another line of text glittered in the sunlight.
