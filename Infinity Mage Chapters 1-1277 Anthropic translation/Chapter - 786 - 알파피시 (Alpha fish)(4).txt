[786] Alpha Fish (4)

Mitochondrial Eve is powerful in that she can transmit 100 percent of an individual's experiences to the next generation.

Even before gaining the name Terase, they divided like cells and absorbed the history of the entire world.

Then they integrated it all and passed it to the next generation, building a vast database through this method.

History Search.

What Woorin found through searching almost all of history was the first meeting between Havitz and Abella.

"The meeting with Havitz changed Ms. Abella's fate."

As Abella listened to Woorin's explanation and recalled that time, a gentle smile appeared on her lips.

"Playing with Uncle Havitz was really fun. Unlike other adults, he knew what I liked."

Though he was considered the most evil person in the world, they couldn't deny Abella's words.

"I know about it too, the fate of witches. I've been hearing about it from the people around me since I was born."

Yus was a gypsy tribe that understood the law.

"If Uncle Havitz hadn't shattered my cursed fate, I would have become a witch by now and lived in suffering."

The story goes back 14 years again.

"Let's dig through here to make an underground waterway. Big enough for monster frogs to pass through."

On the sandy beach of the fishing spot, Havitz and Abella were absorbed in building a sand castle.

The fishing rod without bait had been extending toward the sea for over 10 days already, but the shark Havitz wanted hadn't been caught.

"Uncle, you know a lot about castles?"

"Of course I know well. It's my home."

Abella, who had been patting the ground flat while leveling it, lifted her sand-covered face.

"Uncle, are you perhaps an emperor?"

"Huh? Emperor?"

"You said your name was Havitz. The adults say this country's emperor is called Havitz."

"Ah, that's Havitz the 16th. That person isn't me."

"Is it okay to use the same name as the emperor?"

"Hmm, well? Probably okay. I know hundreds of people named Havitz."

Abella muttered gloomily.

"I wish Uncle were the emperor."

Havitz, who had completed the underground waterway with delicate hand movements, asked belatedly.

"Why an emperor? That seems like it wouldn't be very fun."

"Because you can do anything. Mom says to change my fate, you'd need to be at least an emperor."

"Fate? What's that?"

Only after spending 10 days together did Abella pull out the darkness in her heart.

"The tribe members say I'm going to become a witch. My mom is a witch too. So she constantly offers her body to men."

The Yus tribe was in decline.

"In the past, Yus's law was very strong, so many people came asking for fortune telling. So they could overcome the witch's fate too. But they said that period has ended now."

The tribe members couldn't let the name of Yus, with its thousands of years of history, end with their generation.

"Now we can't tell fortunes. So women with the witch's fate wander around villages selling their bodies."

The Baldol village where the Yus tribe currently stayed had not only fishermen but pirates living there too.

In reality, the two weren't very different.

"I don't want to go back to the village. Adults keep coming to touch me. Mom got angry once, but adults much bigger than Uncle beat her nearly to death."

"Being a witch must not be fun."

"Of course not. What's good about that? Just thinking about witches is horrible. I want to grow flowers."

"Then just don't do it. Being a witch."

Abella shook her head.

"They say the law can't be changed. Mom holds me and cries every night. She says sorry. But she says I'll have to become a witch anyway."

"I don't understand what you mean."

"Of course Uncle doesn't know. Only gypsies know about it."

"If you don't want to be a witch, why become one? You just don't have to do it."

Perfect chaos.

To Havitz, who existed outside the rules of what should naturally be, law was a ridiculous concept.

"You can do what you want to do. It's better to live happily - there's no need to do unfun things, right?"

"...Could that be possible?"

Abella, who had been lost in thought, smiled brightly.

"Still, these days are fun because I play with Uncle. Before, I was always alone in the forest."

A wonderful sand castle was completedâ€”

"I'm having fun too. There's no one to play with at the castle. Whenever I do anything, they just whine and cry."

When Havitz imitated the terrified faces of people around him, Abella held her stomach and laughed.

"Hah, I wish I could play with Uncle every day."

"Then just play every day."

Abella looked around cautiously.

"But Uncle, you're an adult. Mom said adults are busy, so I shouldn't bother them."

"It's fine. Playing with you is the most fun. I just won't do other things - what does it matter?"

Abella's eyes blinked prettily.

"Uncle seems very different from the adults I know."

"What's different?"

"You don't say things like 'do this, don't do that,' and you don't find me annoying."

"Other adults do that?"

"It's not just that level. They nag so much. You have to be a good person, you have to hold utensils like this..."

Havitz twirled his mustache.

"Hmm, I've never heard such things in my life, so I wouldn't know..."

That's why he realized:

"People who say such things do it because they're scared. From what I see, adults are always terrified."

"What are they scared of?"

Havitz shrugged his shoulders.

"Hahaha! I don't know either. What could possibly exist in this world to make them tremble like that? They try to walk straight as if there's only one rope over an invisible cliff."

Havitz pretended to walk with two fingers.

"When I tried walking here and there, there's no such rope. You don't fall wherever you go. That's obvious, right? But they insist on pretending not to know."

"Mmm. Don't fall, you say."

"Of course, if you want to play together, you sometimes have to give people what they want. But if you don't want to play together, there's no need to listen. The downside is it gets a bit boring though..."

Havitz comforted Abella.

"If you're just not afraid, you can do anything. You grow flowers too. Don't listen to boring talk about witches."

Though Abella didn't understand everything Havitz said, it was the best comfort she had ever received.

"Yes! I'll grow flowers starting today! Thank you, Uncle!"

Havitz grinned, showing his teeth.

From that day on, whenever Havitz and Abella met, they went into the forest to collect flowers.

One flower per day.

They didn't know the names or varieties of the flowers, but just being able to do what they wanted was joyful.

The shark still showed no signs of being caught.

"Should I go further out to catch it?"

Havitz, sitting at the fishing spot, yawned lazily while looking at the vast ocean.

"Why is she so late today?"

Abella, who had never been late before, wasn't showing up today.

"Did she get tired of playing with me?"

Because Havitz missed Abella, he left his spot and headed toward her village.

From the village entrance, with its characteristic fishy smell of a fishing village, he could tell there was a commotion.

"Damn gypsies! We took in these homeless people and this is how they stab us in the back!"

When the village leader Haxtor kicked a skeletal woman, Abella came running.

"Waaaaah! Mom!"

"Abella! Why did you come! I told you to run away quickly!"

Abella shook her head.

"No! I won't leave Mom behind!"

Two months after the gypsies settled in the village, the pirates who were fed up tried to lay hands on Abella.

Her mother's desperate resistance, leaving scratch marks on Haxtor's cheek with her nails, caused trouble.

"These people who have nowhere else to go dare to touch me? Do you all want to die here!"

The Yus chieftain blocked the mother and daughter's path.

"We said we'd work if you gave us jobs! Didn't we follow everything you proposed!"

"Work? Do you think the likes of you could even go out to sea? Do you think the house, food, and chickens we gave you came for free!"

"We'll leave! Please let us go!"

Haxtor burst into hollow laughter.

"Sure, leave. But first you have to spit up everything you've eaten so far, right? That's only proper, isn't it?"

Haxtor kicked the chieftain away and grabbed Abella's hair, dragging her from her mother's arms.

"Mom! Mom!"

Abella's clay flower pot broke and the nameless flower was brutally trampled.

"No! Please, not Abella...!"

"Shut up! This much is barely breaking even! Take her!"

As Haxtor's subordinate lifted Abella onto his shoulder and headed toward the barn, the chieftain crawled on the ground and shouted.

"You evil bastards! What crime does a child have!"

"Crime? Of course she has one. The crime of having no money."

Just as the men snickered in response, a voice was heard from outside the crowd.

"Abella~. Let's play~."

Silence fell instantly, and everyone turned to look at Havitz.

"What, who are you?"

The pirates who reflexively drew their swords looked at Havitz and turned pale as ghosts.

"The King of Greed...?"

Clatter, the pirates' weapons fell to the ground.

"Huk, huuk!"

Though it was their first time seeing him in person, there wasn't a single resident who didn't know Havitz.

'Damn it! God! Why! Why on earth!'

Why is Havitz here?

'It's over.'

No one knew what brought him to this rural village, but one thing was certain.

'We're all going to die.'

The King of Greed has no mercy.

"Waaaaah! Uncle!"

Abella, who had escaped from the weakened pirate, burst into tears and ran to Havitz.

"Mmm. It's okay, it's okay."

Havitz lifted Abella up with all his strength and patted the girl's back as he walked toward the pirates.

"I was scared, Uncle! Those people trampled my flowers! They beat Mom nearly to death too!"

"Mmm. It's okay, it's okay."

Haxtor's fingertips trembled when he realized Havitz knew Abella.

'What have I done?'

Even stabbing a sleeping demon in the ribs with a sword wouldn't be called more stupid than this.

"Your Majesty, we were...!"

"Die."

Havitz cut him off.

"Abella cried, so I don't want to play. Die."

"Aaaaaaaah!"

Haxtor screamed as if trying to destroy his mind, drew his sword, and slashed it horizontally across his own throat.

"Keurk!"

Seeing him die in one strike, the other subordinates also drew their swords and chose the same path as their leader.

'This is the only salvation!'

Because if Havitz decided to truly have fun, it wouldn't end with just dying.

While most pirates chose suicide, the residents couldn't muster the courage.

"Captain of Guards."

As soon as Havitz's words fell, a shadow slid over and revealed itself on the ground.

"Command me."

He wore a white mask with a mustache, his entire body covered in a black cloak, with curved twin swords crossed.

"Capture the villagers alive. Sentence them all to the Dark Punishment."

"Understood."

Gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, tearing eardrums, pulling out tongues, then amputating arms and legs and peeling skin.

The Dark Punishment meant receiving IV fluids in that state and suffering for life.

"Aaaaah! That's not allowed!"

As the residents rushed to grab the pirates' swords, the Captain of Guards' shadow moved faster than wind.

"Kill me! Please! Just kill me!"

People began fainting one after another.
