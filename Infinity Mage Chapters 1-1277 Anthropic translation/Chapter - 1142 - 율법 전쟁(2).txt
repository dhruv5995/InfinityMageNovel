Law War (2)

The surface of the sun, where arcs of fire spread on a cosmic scale, was filled with light.

"Ahh."

Born with a beautiful voice, Satiel felt the angel's homeland with her very being.

"This place remains unchanged."

Another archangel, Rayel, approached her while looking around.

Except for the absence of the sacred light body, the silhouette of light was exactly the same as before.

Flames rose from all directions, and a silhouette resembling a giant bird flew toward them.

"Welcome, beings of light."

"Phoenix."

Satiel walked toward the being that guards the sun.

"The poor angels are losing their light. The sun no longer protects them."

"It is because God views this universe from a different perspective. The feeling has changed."

Since it was a feeling, whether the change was great or small, the degree didn't matter.

Only God's thoughts were important.

"I want to restore it. Let me go to the Core. I will set things right there."

The Phoenix tilted its head.

"Why?"

"What? Of course for the angels..."

"If the feeling of the universe has changed, shouldn't we just continue in that new direction?"

Is that so?

'Why am I worried about the angels on earth?'

The Phoenix spoke.

"Satiel, new angels will be born now. They don't need to become angels again."

Satiel knew this too.

"But..."

If angels become different beings just because the laws of the universe have changed.

'What were we from the beginning? Were we just parts that make up the universe?'

"Satiel."

Satiel's silhouette flinched as if her thoughts had been detected.

'I've been found out.'

Within the sun that melts all matter, only pure minds can communicate.

'Heart. The power to choose for oneself. If this is what maintains my sacred light body.'

Depending on the Phoenix's judgment, her mental body could be absorbed by the sun.

"Don't worry."

The Phoenix folded its giant flaming wings and gently stroked Satiel's head.

"This place is home to beings with spirits of light. Go to the Core. However, it will be useless."

It was a difficult task without all eight archangels, the original concepts that make up the universe, gathering together.

'I will definitely succeed.' If anger is also a heart, Satiel would not stop until she had her revenge on Ikael.

"Let's go."

As the Phoenix spread its giant wings and embraced them, flames instantly covered their surroundings.

Zodiac.

"Your Majesty! An abnormal signal has been detected!"

The metal sphere Exoverse that adjusts the laws of the universe began to malfunction.

"Grrrr!"

Electricity blazed in Kitra's eyes.

'Are they disrupting the signal?'

Though the Exoverse contained their entire universe, Kitra quickly grasped the change.

'A specific signal is blocking the time waves. The inertia trying to return to the original world.'

The corners of Kitra's mouth turned up.

"Hmph."

The wheel of law wasn't light enough for just two archangels to move.

"No force can go against fate."

As electricity from Kitra's eyes spread and scraped the walls, space let out a horrible cry.

Ooooooh!

As the Exoverse resumed its forward motion, the time waves that rushed in sequentially overlapped for a moment.

The places affected by this temporal overlap were the pyramids built throughout the world.

Kitra's eyes regained stability.

"It's just slightly delayed."

Paras Kingdom, Pyramid of Truth.

Ooooooh!

All the characters carved on the inner walls began to glow, and a chilling scream was heard.

"What?"

The moment Shirone turned around.

Shirone's party had returned to the time when they first set foot in the Pyramid of Truth.

"Strange."

Ares said, turning off his lantern.

"There's nowhere for light to come in. How can we see?"

Shirone remained silent.

The memory of saying "It's like electrons" was vivid, and everyone must be feeling it.

'It's not temporal explosion.'

It was a realistic temporal overlap.

"Shirone, this..." Ares, who had lit a fire with red eyes, looked back at Shirone with a serious expression.

"Yes. We've been brought back."

"A reset?"

Though it was natural to think so, Shirone guessed through simultaneous events.

"No. It's a closed time curve. It's probably a phenomenon that only occurs inside the pyramid."

Like the upper floors of Eastas at the magic school.

"Events flow along time waves. The time waves rushing from the past have overtaken the time waves of reality. From our perspective, it's like going back to the past."

"Then we can't move toward the future?"

"I don't know that much. It's likely a one-time phenomenon, but..." Shirone examined the simultaneous events.

"Mica."

Though she felt current in her body, the voice transmitted through brain waves was only noise.

'As expected, she can't get in.'

Bzzt, bzzt.

Since the pyramid itself was a giant current, she couldn't receive Mica's signal.

Meanwhile, the other party members remained silent.

Their eyes seemed dead, as if they didn't care what happened to time.

Shirone felt bitter.

'In this place, human life is dismantled piece by piece. Taking responsibility for all those causes is a harsh thing.'

As Maximus said.

'What exactly is this ancient civilization? Why is human life dismantled in this place?'

He revealed himself in the darkness.

A being called Human, with a naked body and the face of a pyramid.

Canis reacted for the first time.

"You bastard."

The aura of darkness grew stronger, and Harvest's body grew large enough to touch the ceiling.

"Canis, stay calm."

At the same time Shirone spoke, Canis charged forward with Harvest leading.

"Iyaaah!"

The possibility that Arin might be blood-related was absolutely unacceptable.

'I'll kill him. If I kill him, it'll be over.'

As if eliminating the being before his eyes would make all the causes disappear too.

Human raised his hand.

As an invisible wave swept through the passage, Shirone's party disappeared before his eyes again.

Shirone gritted her teeth.

"Why are you doing this? What meaning does dismantling human life have for you?"

"Answer me! How long will you keep doing this!"

"Until I meet God."

Human said.

"Meet the God who exists at every moment in the bonds of cause and effect. Then you will be able to leave."

She roughly understood what it meant.

'I see.'

King Kitra of Paras received Human's baptism and came out of the pyramid.

'Blind acceptance of results. If you can accept that even if you die right now, even if you part with someone you love, it's ultimately fate, then you can be said to have met God. But...'

Can that be called human?

'With free will extinguished and even the heart lost, following the flow of law is...'

Shirone's face crumpled.

"Kitra is already... no longer human."

With a human body intact, he had become an object, an out-of-place artifact of ancient civilization.

'This is a serious situation. All life forms that enter the Pyramid of Truth become objects.'

Human said.

"Abandon your heart. Only when you choose nothing can you finally meet God."

"Your Majesty, preparations are complete. Please go."

When the fortune-teller of the Celestial Gate reported, King Munryong of the Mun Kingdom rose from his seat.

"Good."

In response to Paras's law attack, what they chose was not compromise but war.

'I'll kill Kitra.'

When they entered the mountain 4 kilometers away from Delta, the cave entrance was blocked by an iron door.

The moment the fortune-teller opened the door, the thick smell of blood wafted from the darkness.

"Heoheoi?! Heoheeo?!"

A man in colorful clothes was running around the cavern holding a sword with bells attached.

The Mun Kingdom had developed techniques using ghosts, and they planned to attack Kitra with this.

"Hmm."

Though Munryong had been familiar with shamanism since childhood, he didn't know it at an expert level.

"The other world, was it?"

"Yes. Originally, this world and the afterworld aren't divided by spatial barriers. It can be called an exchange of energy, and this place too can be seen as having both energies combined."

"Then there must be ghosts here."

"Yes. Demon summoning has been popular in the West for a long time, but Princess Jinseongeum of Jincheon blocked the spiritual realm, making it impossible. On the other hand, the East developed the study of handling ghosts, that is, energy. You can compare it to Western magic and Eastern law."

Unryong pointed ahead.

"What is that man doing now?"

The man in colorful clothes danced on the blade, then walked to a pig tied with rope.

When he cut open its belly, the intestines spilled out.

Squeeeeek!

"He's taunting the ghosts. What is the most resentful emotion for humans? First would be injustice. When misfortune strikes without reason. Like dying from being hit by a carriage, or falling to death by missing a step. In such cases, resentful energy accumulates in that place, and this phenomenon is called Han. It clings to human life force and disrupts metabolism. There's talk of blood flowing backward, but if it really sets in, one could cough up blood and die instantly."

Even while explaining, a chicken's head fell off and the shaman's face became covered in blood.

"Shooting this Han is called Sal. Once possessed by a ghost, one stops eating and drinking, becomes ill, and dies. Of course, those with the energy of tigers, the overlords, could endure it, but what we're shooting now isn't ordinary Sal."

As the sound of bells and drums drove one mad, the talismans hanging on strings shook violently.

"We've amplified the Han of a virgin ghost who was violated by bandits with the strongest shamanism. Just by releasing it, it will bring down not only tigers but even flying dragons."

A woman's scream was heard.

Kyaaaaaaah!

As the Han penetrated the talisman's barrier, Unryong felt nauseous without having eaten anything.

"...Truly terrible."

"It is terrible. But this isn't the end. The scary thing about Han is that it has no limits. We'll taunt the ghosts more and more to prepare the strongest Sal."

"The key is how strong we can make the Han. Is there anything else needed?"

"We already have the kingdom's best techniques and experts. We merely repay Your Majesty's grace."

Munryong stroked his beard.

"I heard there have been many contact requests from other countries since pyramids were built around the world."

"Yes. Everyone is desperate to understand the situation."

"Is Kashan included?"

"Of course. No country handles law better than the Mun Kingdom. But why do you ask..."

"That Sal thing."

Unryong pointed at the shaman and squinted one eye.

"Does it have to be shot at one person? Depending on the method, couldn't it target multiple people?"

"Of course there's Sal that can be shot at multiple targets. What scale are you thinking of?"

"Well, 11 people?"

Munryong turned his head.

"That is, all the kings in the Holy War?"
