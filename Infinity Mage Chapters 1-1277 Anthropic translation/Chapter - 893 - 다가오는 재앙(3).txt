The Approaching Catastrophe (3)

The Kingdom of Bekross was the smallest nation among the ten archipelago kingdoms.

The island had a population of roughly 2 million, with a well-developed fishing industry and a leisurely southern atmosphere.

And in the village of Ar-Ar on the southeastern side of that island, Shirone awoke from sleep in a good mood.

"Mmm..."

--

The warm sunlight and cool sound of waves seemed to breathe vitality into his weary body.

"I slept really well."

The moment he muttered those words, Shirone suddenly realized something and bolted upright.

"What?!"

He didn't understand.

"What the hell is going on?!"

As he got out of bed and opened the door, bronze-skinned children stopped playing ball and waved their hands.

"Big brother Shirone, are you awake?"

The foaming sea was refreshing just to look at, but his mind was becoming increasingly tangled.

'Here again.'

He had met Fermi on the southern continent and crossed over to the ten archipelago kingdoms to return to the Ivory Tower.

'Using the Bekross terminal would be the fastest way to jump to the Corona Kingdom.'

He was certain up to that point.

'But...'

By Shirone's count, ten days had already passed.

"Why can't I get out?"

He was trapped in the village.

"Same as always. It's because big brother Shirone won't leave. You had another dream, didn't you?"

Shirone looked down at the boy who appeared to be about ten years old.

"Maicon."

He remembered.

This was the son of the couple who had prepared lunch for him when he first arrived at Ar-Ar village.

"Me?"

"Yeah. Every day you say you don't have time, but in the end you always say you'll rest one more day before leaving."

Had he done that?

"Ah..."

Shirone recalled the memory of partying with the villagers past midnight last night.

'That's right.'

The torches lighting up the night, the sizzling smell of fish, alcohol and feasts, people laughing and chattering.

Everything was vivid.

"Bwahahaha! You're really amusing, my friend. I thought mages were cold and stoic."

Village chief Begpa thrust a beer mug toward him.

"Ah, not at all. You have to have fun when it's time to have fun."

Shirone, already drunk with his nose bridge red, clinked beer mugs hard enough to break them.

"That's right, exactly. Even during the world war, this village is safe. We've never been invaded before."

Begpa always said the same thing when he drank.

"Do you know what Ar-Ar means? It's an onomatopoeia expressing the breath of god. This place is specially protected by the god Beka."

Shirone played along.

"Oh, is that so."

"The breath of god Beka contains powerful force. It creates waves to help us make a living, but when angry, it becomes sharp as a blade. Even now, there's a place on Mero Cliff where god Beka's breath is carved."

"Yes, I saw it too. It was really mysterious. It wasn't a mark that humans could carve."

"Of course! What have you been listening to? That's definitely god Beka's breath!"

Shirone didn't believe in superstitions, but there was no need to argue about such things at a drinking party.

"Ah, right! I must be drunk."

A hearty voice was heard.

"Of course you should be drunk!"

A fat man holding grilled fish skewers in both hands walked over with his beautiful daughter.

"Uncle Yaska."

He was the village's best fisherman and incredibly strong.

"In Ar-Ar, you can forget about things like war! Come, come! Eat this and get drunk again!"

As Yaska handed over the grilled fish skewer, his daughter Lua approached with a smile in her eyes.

"Hello, Shirone. Looks fun?"

She was tall like her father, and her bronze body was firm and graceful like a wild horse.

"Yeah. It's been a long time since I've had such a relaxing time."

Lua's popularity in the village reached the sky, but Yaska liked Shirone.

"That's right, that's right, being happy is the most important thing. Why don't you settle down here with our daughter?"

"Dad, really..."

Lua didn't seem to dislike the idea either.

"What's wrong with that? If it's Shirone, dad can rest easy. He's kind, he's a mage. And he repaired all the broken houses, didn't he? With his wonderful magic skills."

"I knew he'd do that. Get married just because he fixed houses? Shirone, don't mind him."

Shirone played along cheekily.

"Haha! I'm fine with it though? I really like this village. Besides, I don't have any responsibilities now."

That's right, everything was over.

'Let's forget it all. Fermi will take care of everything. The war, the name Yahweh...'

Though he had turned his back on the world, it was nothing compared to the exhilaration of putting down the enormous burden of humanity.

"Huh?"

At this point, Shirone felt an uneasiness about his own memories for the first time.

'The realm of Yahweh...'

He had definitely talked about that with Fermi.

'What did we talk about? I can't remember. Did we make a deal? No, that can't be. Yahweh is still...'

Vivid in Shirone's heart.

'Temporal Explosion, Ataraxia, Instantaneous Enlightenment, Resonance. I can feel them all. Nothing has been transferred to Fermi yet. Then why?'

The memory continued.

"Halariole! Reierrola!"

The folk music unique to Ar-Ar echoed, and people paired up to dance.

Shirone and Lua also held hands and spun around.

"Hahaha! Hahahaha!"

The world spun, and the alcohol spun.

"Shirone, this way."

Lua grabbed Shirone's wrist and left the party, running to the end of the beach.

The sound of drums faded distantly, and the two looked at each other in the moonlight.

"Shirone."

Lua, whose eyes had been sparkling brightly, suddenly approached and kissed Shirone.

"I like you. I love you."

The people of Ar-Ar village were honest about their feelings.

"Lua..."

Amy's face briefly came to mind, but Shirone deliberately erased her existence.

'I'm sorry. I can't go back.'

To the outside world where a terrible life awaited, he didn't want to take even one step.

'Forever in this place...'

In Ar-Ar village, protected by god.

'I'll live here.'

Shirone pulled Lua's body toward him and kissed her as she waited.

The two fell onto the sandy beach, and their scanty clothes came undone with a single touch.

The drumming didn't stop all night long.

"No!"

Shirone shouted loudly.

"That can't be."

It was his own memory so he had to accept it, but there was still a part he couldn't understand.

'Me and Lua...'

The sensation of lips, the sensation of skin, even her scent and the sounds of the scenery were vivid.

'That can't be. I still love Amy. Even if I was drunk... Could it be?'

One thought crossed his mind.

'Memory distortion?'

Setting aside La Enemie, it wouldn't be impossible for a mental-type mage.

'But who could do it?'

Who could perform mental manipulation on an Infinite Mage?

'Besides, it doesn't make sense logically. The me in the memory entrusted everything to Fermi. But in reality, the realm of Yahweh is with me. That's the key.'

It was just hypothesis upon hypothesis, but if it wasn't an amateur mage, it was quite malicious.

'Or some unknown...'

Maicon shrugged his shoulders and sighed.

'He'd be such a good big brother if not for this.'

It was strange that he, usually calm in personality, got angry like fire every morning.

'He must have nightmares every day.'

Since he came from the outside world where war was raging, Shirone probably had some painful memories.

"Calm down and come eat breakfast at our house. We need to eat quickly and go to Mero Cliff."

"Mero Cliff?"

Maicon pointed to the cliff by the coast.

"The place where you go to train every day. You go there in the morning and stay until sunset."

Shirone examined the cliff.

'I don't remember this either.'

Since memories are naturally forgotten, you can only know which memories have been erased when you encounter keywords.

'More information has been deleted than I expected.'

Anyway, if he visited the cliff without fail every day, there must be a clear reason.

"Maicon, sorry, but today..."

"I know. You won't eat. You'll say you don't have time, right?"

Shirone stared at Maicon's triumphant smiling face and turned his head.

"Right. I don't have time."

As Shirone cast teleportation and rushed to the cliff, Maicon's mouth fell open.

"Really awesome..."

This was something that never got old no matter how many times he saw it.

'Here it is.'

Looking down at the cliff from the sky, Shirone confirmed that circles of various sizes were carved into the ground.

'Incredibly large. These are circles that could never be drawn without measuring from the sky.'

No, they'd have to be viewed from the edge of the universe.

'Because they're perfect.'

The circles that the villagers called evidence of god's breath were no different from angels' halos.

Shirone looked back at the forest on the land side.

"Hmm."

His transcendent senses, opened up to the ninth sense, were craving the forest like thirst.

'Right. The body remembers.'

Entering the forest, Shirone opened his Spirit Zone and searched for traces of the past.

'There's something over there.'

Among the synesthesia coming through the Spirit Zone, there was a particularly bothersome object.

Arriving in front of an ordinary tree, Shirone put his hand into the trunk and grasped a notebook.

'Made of material.'

As a marker, one page was made of heavy metal.

Turning the cover, cryptographic text was densely written.

'This is... Shirone Code.'

It might seem childish, but Shirone had created codes by combining his own intimate secrets.

For example, substituting 'Amy's chest' with the letter X, and when decoding, converting it to 'unknown.'

Even if the chart was extracted, it could be interpreted as 'touch' or 'desire' depending on the person, making it difficult to decode.

'An emotional code governed by feelings. I'd been creating these whenever I was bored instead of writing a diary, but...'

In this situation, it was helpful.

"Let's see..."

Shirone decoded the numerous character strings all at once.

The content was shocking.

'First! Do not extract the chip in your head. It could result in death? What does this mean?'

Shirone hastily felt his head.

'It's there!'

A small incision behind his ear could be felt.

'You implanted a chip?'

It was probably true.

'If it's a physical device, it's unrelated to mental power. That's how memory could be manipulated.'

Who on earth?

He quickly searched through the memo, but yesterday's Shirone hadn't been able to confirm that far either.

'Wake-up time: 8:30 AM every day. Right, that's what happened today too.'

He continued reading.

'Ar-Ar village escape plan. Time Vibration. Requires minimum 24-hour amplitude.'

If the timeline was stretched to 24 hours, he could perceive 12 hours in the past as the present.

'Then that would be 8:30 PM yesterday evening. The events and timeframe are almost identical to what remains in my memory.'

Something had happened during that time period.

'It looks like I trained here.'

Shirone saw records of daily improvements in Time Vibration ability.

'When should I execute it?'

Checking the last page, Shirone finally realized what memory he had lost.

"Today."

Right now, in fact.

'Time Vibration!'

From Shirone's body, an enormous temporal energy incomparable to before began to surge.
