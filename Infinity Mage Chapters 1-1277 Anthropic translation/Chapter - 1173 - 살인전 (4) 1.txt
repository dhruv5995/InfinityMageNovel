Massacre Battle (4)

The terrorist incident at the small conference hall spread rapidly through the mouths of those who were present.

The most shocking news was that all of Kashan's core forces had been deployed.

"Director!"

A National Intelligence Service agent who skipped the greeting protocol informed Dante, who was in the middle of a briefing.

"Code A is under attack by Kashan near the small conference hall. Allied nations are providing support."

Code A meant Quan and Shiina, Code B meant Quan, and Code C meant Shiina.

"What?"

Lufist's brow furrowed.

"That's too fast. Wasn't Code C supposed to be the most likely target for enemy movement?"

Dante couldn't understand this time either.

"Why? They can't possibly succeed."

The agent said.

"The Kashan forces attacking Code A consist of 100 Wind Blades, archers, melee fighters, ranged fighters, and Royal Guard Captain Kido."

The moment they heard those words, those gathered in the sealed room felt as if they'd been hit in the head with a hammer.

"They deployed... everyone?"

Lufist said.

"Instead of choosing Code A, they're using a strategy of crushing with overwhelming force. That's why it was so fast."

They feared Quan that much.

Tess shot up from his seat.

"We don't have time for this. I'll mobilize the troops. We need to deploy there too...!"

"Wait."

Albino raised his hand.

"Wait a minute. So you're saying Kashan deployed their entire force. Then what's the Empress's current defensive capability?"

Close to zero.

"Ah."

The moment everyone realized, Albino slammed the table and turned his head.

"There's no time!"

His bloodshot eyes conveyed the urgency of the situation.

"Get going and kill that bitch!"

Meanwhile, a massive chase was unfolding at Delta headquarters.

"Yahoo! It's a hunt, a hunt!"

A thug with a chicken head was chasing after Kashan's Empress, who was wearing a hood.

"Hahaha! Got you!"

"Kyaah!"

After knocking down the target and removing the hood, a woman wearing a silver wig was revealed.

"Damn! Another dud! You don't pay for these, right?"

Just as he raised his sword to strike her neck, the chicken head's leader shook his head.

"Don't kill her. There are important people here. It could be troublesome to deal with the aftermath later."

"Haha! Boss, you heard it yourself. Satan or whatever is going to take responsibility for everything anyway."

"That may be true, but that guy... hm?"

The leader blinked.

"Who was it again?"

The name Harvitz wouldn't come to mind.

"Ugh!"

Shirone, who was rushing to the scene, suddenly frowned.

'Something just happened.'

Harvitz had disappeared.

The feeling of displaced senses was terribly unpleasant, but Shirone eventually grasped the truth.

'Vanishing. It's been activated.'

The murder game had begun again.

'Who's the target this time?'

Whoever it was, there was only one thing Shirone could do.

"Mica."

Yes.

"How much longer until Elicia is complete?"

Mica's transcendent senses detected all the tribal people of the southern continent across space and time.

7,033,019 unified brainwaves detected. This corresponds to 99.8 percent of the total. Estimated arrival time: 13 seconds.

'Too late.'

It was enough time to kill someone.

"Huff! Huff!"

Uorin, who had spread dozens of shadow warriors, continued her lonely escape.

"Over there! Go catch her!"

Armed forces from various nations who had received intelligence were desperate to claim Uorin's head.

She activated Future Vision.

'Not this way.'

As the laws wavered due to the time faction led by Paras, tremendous headaches surged through her.

"Ugh!"

She collapsed as soon as she turned the corner and heard the sounds of pursuit traveling through the walls.

"Find her! She couldn't have escaped yet!"

She clawed at the marble floor.

'I won't die!'

Pulling her hood deep with one hand, she gritted her teeth and crawled desperately.

'Think I'm going to die? I'm Uorin. By any means necessary, even crawling through hell...'

As her headache subsided, she began running again.

'I will survive!'

While running through corridors as complex as a maze, someone suddenly approached from the side.

"Your Majesty!"

Uorin's heart sank, but realizing it was Gando, she sighed in relief.

"Help me up. I'm too dizzy."

"You've endured well. I'll take over now. We should be able to escape Delta."

Future Vision was saying the same thing.

"Right. Let's hurry."

However, there was still one thing that Future Vision could never see.

"I've been waiting."

Harvitz spoke, but nothing about him could be perceived while in his Vanishing state.

"Your mind is completely readable."

The first murder was a setupâ€”without Kido, Uorin was completely defenseless against Satan.

"I'll take it."

He would sever her neck and absorb History Search.

Mica said.

7,047,113 unified brainwaves detected. Elicia is complete.

'Now!'

The moment Shirone heard this, he stopped his instant movement and activated Miracle Stream.

Light leaked from his eyes, and at the terrifying output, Shirone clenched his teeth.

"Graaaah!"

The mental power of seven million people was within the range that could change the laws of the world.

'Where are you hiding?'

It was powerful enough to completely deny the ultimate evil law separated from Ultima.

"Harvitz!"

Hexa's light formed a dome extending several kilometers in radius beyond Delta headquarters.

And at that moment.

"Die, Uorin."

Harvitz's Vanishing was cancelled.

"Huh?"

What Gando and Uorin saw at that point was a longsword that had approached right up to them.

'Why here?'

Before Uorin could finish her thought, Gando pushed her shoulder to the side.

In the split second when Gando's neck was being severed, they looked into each other's eyes.

'Mother.'

He seemed to be smiling, but she couldn't be certain since his head was flying through the air.

Watching the blood spray before her eyes, she unconsciously fell backwards.

"What?"

Harvitz looked toward the corridor.

"How did you know?"

Reading Shirone's mind through divine frequency, he looked back at Uorin and said.

"You were lucky."

Even before she could mentally grasp the current situation, shock close to terror seized her brain.

'This is Satan.'

Even though his decisive strike had failed, no emotion could be found in him.

"Hmm."

A fly circled around Harvitz's left pupil, then shot out like a tentacle and grabbed Gando's face.

Watching his face being absorbed, Uorin desperately held back her groans.

It could have been her.

"That makes two."

Harvitz shook off his longsword and turned around.

"One hour remaining."

Those who were fighting outside Delta were also enveloped in Shirone's light.

"What?"

Through quantum transmission, they all felt as if they had become one giant organism.

Of course, when the light disappeared, everything returned to the starting point.

However, what remained in their memories was Satan's current state that Shirone had conveyed.

"Harvitz has..."

Killed Gando.

In other words, each nation would now be responsible for any murders that occurred within the next hour.

'A ceasefire.'

As the bloody storm that had been raging in the holy war subsided, Kashan's forces fell into thought.

'This is dangerous as it is.'

Even if Harvitz had withdrawn, the fact that Uorin was defenseless remained unchanged.

'We must protect Her Majesty.'

With even Gando dead, Kashan's Royal Guard was feeling a return instinct close to desire.

"Graaah!"

The one feeling this pain most acutely was Kido, who was battling Quan.

'Uorin, do we have to keep going? You almost died.'

Yula, the leader of the Wind Blades, said.

"Capture Shiina."

For the ruthless Sword Demon, only obeying the Empress's command remained.

As 100 Wind Blades flew toward Armin, Kido had no choice but to attack as well.

"Tch!"

Spinning his spear like a wheel as he moved, Quan also followed him with external gravity.

'He's strong.'

As different gravities interlocked, the directionality of that entire area became chaotic.

Keira shouted.

"Armin! It's dangerous!"

What even Flicker magic couldn't avoid might be 100 Wind Blades.

'Damn!'

The moment the blades came in.

'Stop!'

His ultimate magic activated, and 30 people caught in the time field froze solid.

"Good. For the time being..."

Just as Armin wiped the sweat from his chin, 12 black shadows were born beneath his feet.

The demon's time: 0.666 seconds.

'It's complete?'

"Yahweh."

Harvitz muttered.

"I can't be the only one getting annoyed. Right?"

"For Satan!"

Twelve Shiok that rose from the ground spun rapidly and tore through the time field.

The Wind Blades moved, and swords flew toward both arms of Armin, who was holding Shiina.

"Dangerous!"

As Shiina pushed Armin away with air-type magic, the blade grazed his fingertips.

"Target acquired."

A Wind Blade that snatched her up like a hawk returned toward the formation at the speed of a gale.

"Shiina!"

Quan's eyes rolled back as he kicked off the ground, and Kido, targeting that opening, thrust his spear.

"It's over!"

A Hand of God that flew in from the side grabbed Kido and slammed him down.

After bouncing off the ground repeatedly and regaining his balance, he looked up and bit his lip.

"Shirone..."

"Kido."

The Wind Blades and Quan were nowhere to be seen.

"Shiina!"

At Quan's voice as he pursued the Wind Blades at terrifying speed, Yula gave an order.

"Five squads, advance."

"Yes."

Sixty Wind Blades scattered like smoke, then rotated like a storm in front of Quan.

In countless consecutive attacks, Quan's body was gradually being carved away.

Let me applaud you.

An eerie voice was heard.

Thirty men were enough to cut your ankle. But now there are sixty.

"Shiina!"

Blood splattered along the turbulent air currents.

The result is the same. You are still a bug. Still vermin. Be crushed by our swords.

The Wind Blades' attacks, accelerating every second, began to catch up with Quan's Initial Movement.

As the swords' approach distance closed by 0.1 millimeters, sword wounds began to multiply on his body.

This is your limit. Candle in the wind.

'Shiina.'

Your swordsmanship was magnificent too.

Senseless laughter burst from Quan's mouth, and the Wind Blades' displeasure permeated the air.

Are those your last words?

'Swordsmanship?'

Where in the world is there swordsmanship that destroys oneself?

'I am a clown.'

A fool who can only dance with swords because he cannot make the woman he loves happy.

'But still...'

Quan's eyes grew distant and hazy.

'I kept my promise.'

The sixty Wind Blades who sensed Quan's change were all thinking the same thing.

What is this?

As if one eye had been covered, Quan's figure was flickering in their vision.

'My final technique, though it may be pathetic.'

What Quan, who couldn't raise his senses through any abnormality, chose as his last resort was...

'Please smile.'

Half of everything that made him upâ€”half of his brain.

'Asymmetric Ultimate.'

His thoughts flew away, and the areas where half his schema had disappeared had no sensation at all.

"Heh heh. Heh heh heh."

A single tear ran down Quan's cheek.

"I'll... protect. Shiina."

Even with his language abilities deteriorating, this was the only thing remaining in his head.

The Wind Blades shuddered.

"Kill him!"

Not an eerie voice, but a raw scream, and sixty Wind Blades pounced on him.

And then...

A storm of tremendous amounts of blood and flesh that couldn't be from just one person came swirling.

Clown Pierrot.

Idiocy.
