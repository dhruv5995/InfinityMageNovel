[535] The Final World (3)

In the standoff between guns and magic, the underground dwellers tried to launch a preemptive strike according to their nature, but Shirone's reason was faster.

'Photon Cannon!'

As spheres of light rushed forth in flashes, the seven underground dwellers scattered in different directions.

Rat-a-tat-a-tat-a-tat!

The forest filled with kinetic energy capable of killing people, and bullets and flashes flew ceaselessly, each aiming for the other's throat.

'This isn't enough.'

There were too many obstacles for direct shots to work.

'They're really agile. What the hell are these guys?'

With them leaping through the trees and spraying bullets like rain, it was impossible to recklessly throw himself into the fray.

'I need more powerful force.'

Shirone concentrated power into the photons floating in his right hand, then leaped toward the enemy formation.

Casting teleportation in zigzag patterns to avoid the barrage, he hurled a Photon Cannon at an underground dweller hiding behind a tree.

As omnipotence amplified through magical action, the tree snapped with a crack, and the underground dweller struck by the shockwave collapsed, coughing up blood.

"Gaaah!"

'Now six.'

Shirone threw himself behind a rock and fired a Photon Cannon upward above his head.

The underground dweller who had been leaping down took a direct hit to the abdomen and crashed.

'Five.'

"Boss! Ambush tactics aren't working! He must have eyes in the back of his head!"

"Shut up! It's just luck! Everyone charge! Otherwise we starve!"

"Kiyaaaa!"

The underground dwellers, reminded of their hunger, came flying from all directions.

But Shirone, with his Spirit Zone deployed, could clearly see their trajectories.

'My goodness...'

Woodga was staring at the scene unfolding before his eyes with a dazed expression.

Not just because it was powerful, but because the ability Shirone wielded controlled light.

To the children of the sun who performed photosynthesis, light was life itself, and that was why everyone followed the Archon.

"Brother, this sound!"

Woodga snapped to attention and shouted.

"This is bad! Ra's warning is...!"

Having taken down three more in the meantime, Shirone heard Woodga's voice piercing through the ringing in his ears and suddenly remembered.

'Magnetic field!'

The reason they had waited briefly at the forest's entrance must have been because an electromagnetic field was formed around the Tree of Life.

"Let's escape! There's no time!"

Breaking away from the enemy formation, Shirone grabbed Woodga and Hamei and cast teleportation.

"Chase them! We can't let them get away!"

"Food! I'm eating today!"

Due to the terrain with many obstacles, even casting teleportation couldn't completely shake off the underground dwellers leaping over trees.

"Hey! They're following! Hurry!"

Shirone gritted his teeth and concentrated his mind.

As he split his thoughts to the extreme, flashes passed between the trees like light reflecting off mirrors.

As the desperate underground dwellers unleashed all their firepower, bullet traces hit the ground and chased after Shirone like snakes.

"Uaaaah!"

Spotting the forest entrance, Shirone put his whole heart into increasing the chain speed of teleportation.

Then a beeping sound was heard, followed by a tremendous headache rushing in.

"Grrk!"

As the Spirit Zone shattered, Shirone's group fell to the ground and crawled desperately out of the forest.

"Uaaaaagh!"

At the agonizing screams, they turned to see the underground dwellers who hadn't managed to escape clutching their heads in agony.

"Save me! Uaaaah!"

Though the entrance was only 30 meters away, unable to bear the pain, they couldn't even think of coming out.

Blood trickled from their burst capillaries, then suddenly they let out final gasps and stopped struggling.

Woodga spoke in a trembling voice.

"...They're dead. That's what happens when you ignore Ra's warning."

Then he hurriedly turned to look at Shirone.

"You, who exactly are you? How do you possess such abilities? You're not even one of the children of the sun."

Though they wouldn't understand anyway, Shirone had no intention of conversing with them at the moment.

'Magic...'

He had lived in a world where magic existed.

But still, in his memories remained the image of himself entering an artificial hibernation capsule.

'Still, the fact that new memories keep surfacing is positive. For now, I need a safe place.'

Only then did Shirone look back at Woodga.

"Take me to where you live."

When Shirone conveyed this through gestures, Woodga nodded.

"Right, that's correct. You are our slave. But we won't be able to return today. We won't be able to get out of the contaminated zone."

Shirone understood what Woodga meant by pointing at the sun.

'There is one method. But will it really work?'

Wings of Light.

As golden wings spread brilliantly behind Shirone's shoulders, Hamei stared as if entranced.

"Wow..."

Ra was what the children of the sun called the sun.

Also the sole god who created life, and according to scripture, he commanded angels with wings of light as his servants.

"Brother, maybe that person..."

The reason Hamei trailed off was the same as why Woodga wasn't saying anything.

The colony already had an Archon.

There couldn't be two incarnations of Ra in one colony, so he wasn't certain if bringing Shirone was the right decision.

'No, we can't spend the night here anyway.'

Newly born children of the sun needed to rest as much as possible in places where light shone.

Having made his decision, Woodga led Hamei.

"Let's go for now. It's not our fault anyway. We'll just report honestly to the Archon."

As the two held hands, Shirone looked up at the sky and powerfully beat his wings of light.

With a bang, the air exploded and they rose dozens of meters high, causing Woodga and Hamei to be terrified by flight they had never experienced.

In contrast, Shirone calmly surveyed the scenery.

'As expected, it feels familiar. Then are the magical memories the real ones?'

As they gained altitude, the landscape of the destroyed world came starkly into view.

Countless creatures were flying between buildings that looked like burnt matchsticks, and beyond the horizon, forests were sparsely established.

'There are quite a few places like this. It's definitely civilization.'

But still, the largest part of his vision was contaminated zones covered in mottled mucus.

'More than 70 percent of the city has been devoured. What the hell is that? I feel like I might remember.'

Woodga, having gathered his wits, pointed in a direction.

"That's our colony over there."

The cross-section of a mass of scrap metal completely filling the gaps between buildings was visible.

"Good, let's go!"

Though he had warned them in advance, at the flight speed that made the scenery seem to be sucked in, the children of the sun couldn't help but scream.

Shirone covered a distance that would take half a day on foot in less than 10 minutes.

Landing on the asphalt road, buildings that had once been over 60 stories tall surrounded them, broken more than halfway up.

"Follow me. I'll take you to the Scribe. But once we reach the colony, you can't act recklessly."

Passing through the forest of buildings, a pyramid of tangled steel beams appeared.

It was of tremendous scale to be considered man-made, and barricades were installed around the perimeter.

"Gathering mission completed. Open the way."

When Woodga spoke to the sentries, two sturdy white men placed their fists on their left chests.

"Thank you for your hard work. Please enter."

The sentries didn't discriminate by race, gender, or age, but they all commonly gave the feeling that something was lacking in their eyes.

'Familiar appearance. Are they those awakened from artificial hibernation?'

Inside the pyramid was brighter than expected.

Shirone looked up at the sphere of light floating above the ceiling.

'Lighting magic Shining. There are mages here too.'

Woodga took Hamei to the nursery.

When the old woman who received the newborn child of the sun placed the baby in a spot bathed in gentle light, only then did the crying stop.

"You've worked hard. It couldn't have been an easy journey."

"Hehe, it was okay because brother Woodga came with me. I think I can do it alone from now on."

Knowing it wasn't as easy a mission as she made it sound, the old woman just smiled gently.

"But who is that slave?"

"Ah, we discovered an ancient's resting place this time. Hamei found it. But..."

Woodga hesitated, then told the old woman about what had happened at the Tree of Life.

"Hmm, I see..."

The old woman, lost in thought, seemed to have some idea and nodded, then patted Woodga's head.

"I'd better make the report myself. I'll be sure to mention that Hamei made the discovery, so don't worry and go inside."

Woodga and Hamei's faces brightened considerably.

Honestly, they had been at a loss about how to make the report.

"Yes. Then we'll leave it to you."

As the two fled the nursery, the old woman finally turned cold eyes on Shirone and spoke.

"Follow me. There's a ritual you must undergo."

Shirone followed the old woman to the very top of the pyramid and waited outside the door until the report to the Scribe was finished.

Finally, the door opened to reveal the interior of a temple with neatly laid floors, unlike anything he had seen so far.

At the end of a path where torches burned stood an altar, and on the throne above it sat a man with short green hair and a strong impression.

"Archon, this is the ancient who demonstrated light abilities."

As the Scribe bowed and reported, the Archon's gaze pierced through Shirone sharply.

"Is what the Scribe says true?"

When Shirone showed no reaction whatsoever, the Archon called an old man in robes who had been waiting in the corner.

"Priest, examine this boy."

The old man, approaching Shirone with unsteady steps, chanted something like an incantation while spinning both palms in circles.

"This is...?"

Shirone's eyes widened as he saw the old man's palms glowing bluish.

Following the path of the hands, golden codes appeared as if wiping frost from a glass window.

The incantation continued endlessly, and the old man moved his hands in larger circles, examining the codes surrounding Shirone.

Then, scanning from Shirone's face down to his stomach, his body became translucent and other codes appeared.

"Hmm, so that's how it is..."

The old man extended his right hand into the air and made a grasping motion.

Then a specific code arrangement was caught in his hand as a pattern engraved on a transparent band.

Next, with his left hand, he scanned Shirone's head area again to reveal codes, then pulled and connected the band.

"Haaah!"

At the sudden flood of information rushing in, Shirone trembled with his limbs stretched stiffly.

"The language of God shall work miracles upon you."

Having said this, the old man turned to the Archon.

"Confirmed, Archon. The language of light is engraved in this boy's body."

"How lamentable. Why would Ra engrave the language of light upon a slave?"

As the Archon turned his right hand over, a massive sphere of light rose above his palm and shot toward the ceiling.

'Shining...'

Even in the process of the children of the sun's language fusing with his brain's information, Shirone could clearly see that scene.

As the Shining magic was cast, everyone in the temple raised both hands and burst into thunderous cries.

"Incarnation of Ra! Grant us life!"

The Archon, arrogantly lifting his chin, gave an order.

"Erase the language of light. Only those who submit to us may continue their wretched lives of feeding."

'Erase what?'

Before he could be surprised by the fact that he was gradually understanding their words, Shirone discovered the hostility in the old man's eyes.

"Do not resent me. There is only one sun in a colony."

The old man swept his right hand through the air, then grasped a band inscribed with reddish codes.

Then, shining light from his left hand on Shirone to reveal the codes, he connected the band as if driving it in.

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

As tremendous shock was applied to his brain, an unbearable flood of information rose as if to burst his head.

"Endure it! For slaves, there shall be only obedience!"

'I am not a slave!'

Shirone resisted the code that would destroy his ego and bit down hard on his molars.

As the Spirit Zone contracted, a frame began to form.

When an overload occurred at the point where the old man's code and Shirone's code clashed, the terrified priest trembled.

"Th-this cannot be... How..."

The whites of Shirone's eyes showed as his eyelids fluttered.

'I have to endure. If I can't hold out here, it's over.'

Unbreakable Diamond!

As an indestructible mental state was established, Shirone's eyes snapped open and his Spirit Zone expanded infinitely.

With a bang, the codes exploded, and the priest standing nearby screamed and flew all the way to the front of the altar.

Struggling to raise his upper body, he continued what he had been trying to say with a pale face.

"How can one reject the language of God..."

Shirone rubbed the spot where the codes had been connected and glared at the Archon sitting on the altar.

"What were you trying to do to me?"

"..."

Shirone Information Recovery Rate.

57 percent.
