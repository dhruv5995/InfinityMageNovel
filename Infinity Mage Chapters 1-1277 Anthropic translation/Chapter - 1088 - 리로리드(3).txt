Reload (3)

"Attack!"

Nearly 4,000 users gathered on the Zeta Plateau opened fire all at once.

It was far more powerful than the combined firepower from the first clash of the Solar War.

"Damn it all."

Even so, compared to his 72 million durability, it was merely scratch damage.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

As Dr. Martin let out a roar, powerful sound waves struck the users' mechs.

Feeling resistance as if hit by strong winds, the rankers charged forward at the front.

"Go! Go! Let's finish this quickly!"

As the users approached, Dr. Martin raised both fists and struck the ground hard.

As if exceeding the limits of containable sound, noise mixed with the thunderous roar.

'He's strong.'

Even rankers equipped with the most powerful armor would die instantly from a single hit.

'But the pattern is simple.'

Aegis sent out a wide-area communication.

"Based on our analysis so far, Dr. Martin has three patterns: physical attacks, beam attacks, and sonic attacks."

While threatening to lower-level users, rankers could dodge them.

The problem was his durability.

"This is maddening."

Durability: 71,138,473/72,000,000

Even in the full charge state with the highest firepower output, Dr. Martin didn't even catch fire.

"Everyone fall back!"

At Yahweh2's communication, the rankers who checked the satellite looked back in surprise.

The sphere of light they saw with their own eyes was vibrating with a much more violent feeling than in the footage.

'He was condensing photons. About 1 minute?'

Yahweh2, cutting through all the rankers, fired his Michelan Gun at Dr. Martin.

KWAAAAANG!

The doctor's face, which hadn't budged even from grenades, turned to the side as if about to break.

"What..."

The rankers couldn't believe their eyes.

Durability: 70,605,985/72,000,000

Aegis reported to Fermi.

"Impact damage of 532,488. An unbelievable figure. 133 more hits until complete destruction."

"It's like user-level dueling." Fermi clicked his tongue.

'The resonance amplitude matches the system's limits. To achieve higher power than this, the condensation time would increase exponentially. So it's one shot per minute after all.'

As Sirone retreated, Operator moved in.

'Collapse.'

As the black blade struck the ground, a black magnetic field explosively expanded and pulled Dr. Martin in.

"Insignificant creatures!"

Dr. Martin's upper body bent downward as he held his ground by striking the earth with both hands.

"GRAAAAH! GRAAAAH!"

Hearing the noise-mixed screams, the users unleashed another volley.

"This is surprisingly doable?"

His durability dropped faster than expected, and Yahweh2's Michelan Gun every minute accelerated the damage.

"We're winning! We can do this!"

Finally, when it dropped below 36 million, Dr. Martin's weak spots caught fire.

And at that moment, users who had been near the Zeta Plateau began arriving one by one.

"Yahoo! Finally, it's our world!"

Their target wasn't Dr. Martin, but the rankers fighting desperately.

Aegis communicated:

"Anarchists. Their levels are low, but they'll be a hindrance during close combat."

"What's so grand about it? They're just troublemakers. Drive them out. They can't reconnect anyway."

Fermi grabbed one troublemaker's head and pumped electricity into it.

"UAAAAGH!"

The struggling mech exploded, and Fermi dusted off his hands as he cut through the blast smoke.

Little Witch approached.

"You're working hard."

"I have overtime work. What's the matter? You're not holding a grudge, are you?"

He put a hole in Little Witch's head as she raised a white flag.

"Of course I'm holding a grudge. Whether I'll act on it is my judgment. But what are you planning to do?"

"We should protect him for now, shouldn't we? Think of it as playing hero to save the world."

Little Witch looked back at Operator.

"He's someone Yahweh2 needs. He should be able to create a program to mine Apocalypse."

That's exactly why he was an obstacle.

'Should I kill him?'

If Operator died, Sirone would have no choice but to come to Kashan.

Fermi felt killing intent from him.

"If..."

Worin cut him off.

"I know. It's a foolish thought. This might be the point where we can uncover the world's secrets."

From High Gear's perspective, the real world could be considered the outer world.

Fermi agreed.

"If we go from reality to the outer world, Argones activates. That's what we confirmed in Apocalypse. But here, and with Yahweh2, we might be able to get some information. Assuming we reach Ultima, of course."

"Will Nane return?"

"The reason Argones didn't activate is probably because Nane has administrator privileges. But analyzing that fact in reverse, the outer world didn't recognize Nane as an enemy. If Nane ever returns to our world, everything might end."

"We need to find it before then."

What Buddha knows, Yahweh should know too.

"Yahweh2's foolish actions help in their own way, but humanity reaching Ultima is impossible anyway."

"Humans fundamentally dislike others. When the majority says something is right, a minority will inevitably rebel."

Her back panel opened and eight guided missiles flew out, trailing tails.

Nearby troublemakers exploded.

"People like these. If only it were this easy in reality..."

"I have my own plan. I don't know if Yahweh2 will understand, but I'll prevent total annihilation."

"Fermi is..."

This time Fermi cut her off.

"No. It's business. If everyone dies, who am I going to make money from?"

Looking at Fermi's smile, it seemed easier to understand when he had no expression.

"I'll help."

Little Witch raised her index finger.

"With my help, setting up the board becomes much easier. In exchange, we share the information we get here."

'I knew it.'

Like poisoned candy, but Worin's understanding of systems was unparalleled.

"I'll make a proposal too. Yahweh2 is just a puppet; it's you who's really moving things."

If they gave the key to Worin, who wanted to possess Sirone, there was a high chance she'd go berserk.

"Fine. You handle it here."

Once the conclusion was reached, Fermi asked:

"So what do you think? It seems like that guy Number Seven is leading this. Should we use him to set up the board?"

"I know his location, but it's useless. Even if we kill him, the creature won't disappear. We'd just earn Yahweh2's hatred for nothing."

'Do we have to solve it here after all?'

Aegis communicated:

"The anarchists' numbers are increasing. It looks like about 1,000 now."

It was quite a large number, but considering where this was, it was natural.

"Release the hunting dogs."

The golden wheel moved, and Worin's subordinates began hunting the troublemakers under her orders.

Meanwhile, the forces participating in the Solar War desperately pressed Dr. Martin.

'790,000 durability left! Almost there!'

Though they lost 80 users, they had fought well against the strongest mech in history.

At the center of that good fight was Sirone.

'The final shot!'

Confirming the real-time dropping durability numbers, Sirone fired his Michelan Gun.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

Dr. Martin's massive body, flames erupting from his entire form, began falling forward.

"UAAAAH! Get away!"

As the immeasurably massive form crashed into the ground, an earthquake occurred and...

There was a moment of silence.

"We did it. We really did it."

They had shaved off all 72 million durability.

"We won...!"

At that moment, Dr. Martin's head exploded with a bang, creating new casualties.

"What? A final pattern?"

How naive that thought was became clear to everyone the next moment.

"Dr. Martin's counterattack. He's showing his true colors. The AI consumed by madness will eliminate the users."

From where the head exploded, a crab-like mech with 14 legs walked out.

Information appeared in augmented reality.

Dr. Martin (Main Body).
Level 4,500.

Confirming the level, users checked his durability in a dazed state.

Durability: 750,000,000/750,000,000

"750 million..."

An emotionless mechanical voice flowed quietly from the massive mech.

"Total. Human. Extermination."

Sirens wailed, and from behind the main body, a black curtain spread like a net.

All of it was ammunition, flying toward the users at tremendous speed.

Pop pop pop pop pop BANG!

Like rain from the sky, mushroom clouds of explosions raced across the vast land.

With half the users who participated in the Solar War dead, communications poured in.

"Reform the lines! We fight again!"

When the smoke cleared, the sky was already covered with countless mechanical creatures.

The sheer number was enough to crush morale just by looking, leaving users stunned.

'It's over.'

When everyone thought so, there was one user charging toward the main body.

"Operator!"

Racing at sonic speed, she drew her black blade horizontally and gritted her teeth.

"Number Seven..."

Seeing the 750 million durability, she knew this wasn't just simple mayhem.

"You want to destroy my world?"

She'd rather die than watch that happen, and this time she was serious.

"You bastard!"

Avoiding the barrage and reaching the main body, she raised her High Gear's output and swung her sword.

"Think I'd let scum like you take it?"

She swung the black blade countless times, but the main body paid no attention and scraped the ground with beams.

Through satellite screens, she could see users being overwhelmed by creatures. Even rankers were helpless.

"Die! Die!"

As she swung her sword in fury, a shadow fell over her head.

The main body's leg aimed at her and began falling with full force.

Operator thrust out her black blade.

"HYAAAAH!"

The moment metal met metal, the mass she felt through her entire body shocked her mind.

The blade shattered like glass.

'This is frustrating.'

Just as the massive leg was about to crush her...

The main body's leg stopped abruptly, and Operator couldn't believe her eyes.

"H-how...?"

Yahweh2, who had somehow arrived beside her, was supporting the main body's weight with his bare hands.

"The system broke."

As Dr. Martin's main body completely emerged into this world, the system was damaged.

Therefore, breaking through.

"Then..."

Sirone could also reach the unique signal that was this world's destination.

'Infinity.'

As Yahweh2's eyes widened, the main body let out a grinding sound and slowly lifted its leg.

"Get out quickly!"

Operator, coming to her senses, threw her body away, and Sirone kicked off the ground to escape the radius.

With a thud that shook the earth, Sirone flew high into the sky.

'There is no fixed form.'

The sphere of light condensing in the Michelan Gun grew exponentially, creating two suns in the sky.

The moment Operator looked up, Sirone drove the flash straight down.

"KIYAAAAAANG!"

The sound the main body's system made was like a machine screaming.

Durability: 660,989,764/750,000,000

'89 million damage?'

Then all 14 legs bent, and the body was crushed to the ground.

Durability: 420,818,812/750,000,000

'Additional damage. He crushed it with force.'

As the thunderous noise subsided, Fermi, still calm, looked back at the main body.

"Infinity."

Since he's capable of it in reality, there's no room for doubt.

"Well, then..."

In each city of High Gear, countless creatures were slaughtering users.

"From now on, it's uncharted territory."

Ultima System.
