Trigger (3)

Ashur had returned.

The two-dimensional form trapped within the transparent panel materialized into reality the moment the glass panel shattered.

"Lord Ikael!"

He immediately drew his sword and took a battle stance, but the situation was different from what he had expected.

'What happened...'

The angels' bodies were emitting black smoke as if they had been heated by fire.

Sirone was the first thing he saw, but Ashur focused on the flaming female figure beside Ikael.

'Amy.'

The fact that conceptual beings like angels had been burned meant that a power transcending phenomena had been at work.

'The Idea of Fire.'

As far as Ashur knew, the only being who had reached that level was Ankera, the incarnation of the sun.

'Nane devoured that dream.'

Recalling how Amy had received help from Buddha, Ashur roughly intuited the situation.

'She too has reached the end. In that case, no angel would be able to approach her.'

Because all angels were born from the sun.

The flames disappeared from Amy's body, and having regained her human flesh, she gasped for breath.

"Phew."

While complete combustion was in progress, she was invincible, but after the fire went out, the aftereffects were severe.

Sirone approached through teleportation.

"Amy, are you okay?"

Instead of answering, Amy smiled, and her eyes contained a small thrill.

'It's definitely tremendous power.'

Sirone also had a history of blowing away angels with Hand of God, but this time was on a different dimension.

'Idea is essence. There would be nothing that Amy cannot burn.'

"Lord Sirone."

When Ashur approached, Sirone asked.

"What happened to Wizard?"

"He made contact with the target. He asked me to leave it to him. By now, the outcome should be decided."

It was a showdown with Satan.

"I see."

It would be a lie to say he wasn't worried, but he hadn't trained him weakly enough to treat him like a child.

'Right now, I have no choice but to trust Wizard.'

At that moment, Satiel's voice was heard from far away.

"Uriel."

Then a shockwave rushed in, and Satiel came flying while clutching Uriel's neck.

"Don't interfere with me! Even you will be annihilated...!"

Satiel, who got hit in the face by the Geuklakgon, couldn't finish his words and flew sideways.

She burrowed her fingers into the ground 20 meters away and crouched, baring her teeth.

"You..."

Ikael said.

"Please stop."

Just as it had been from long ago, there was a special resonance in her voice.

"This is not the time to fight like this. The world is heading toward its end. We must prepare for the finale."

"It's all because of you!"

Satiel kicked off the ground and charged, throwing a punch at Ikael.

"How dare you betray the angels!"

When Ikael grabbed her hand, the judicial halo Nostalgia activated.

"Die!"

Just as the power of decomposition crumbled her palm like sand, Ikael spread her sacred body.

"Ataraxia."

As her presence amplified, even Satiel's Nostalgia lost its light and weakened.

"Grk!"

Still, Satiel did not back down.

"Ikael, you hypocrite. You just need our power. For Sirone's sake."

"That might be so."

"You betrayed us! So..."

"But aren't you the same?"

The moment she saw Ikael's cold gaze, Satiel instinctively shut her mouth.

"Because Guffin is no longer here."

"...What are you talking about?"

"No matter what means you use, you can't meet him, and the only thing left is your memory."

Satiel's teeth ground together.

"Because if you extinguish even that burning rage, you won't be able to feel him through anything anymore."

"Shut... up."

"Isn't that why you're fighting?"

"Kill her!"

The moment the archangel's command fell, all the regular angels flew in, prepared for annihilation.

Just as Sirone blocked Ikael, Uriel charged toward the regular angels.

"Ragnarok."

The moment Geuklakgon struck the ground, massive white electricity ascended as if flowing backwards.

The roar wasn't the problem, but the angels froze at the shockwave that shook their sacred bodies.

Ikael muttered with a surprised expression.

"Uriel."

"Don't be mistaken."

Still blocking the angels' path, he turned his head slightly.

"This isn't a decision for you. If I have something called a heart, it would surely be murderous intent, but..."

How strange.

Because he could destroy everything in the world, he was even more unable to lay a hand on anything.

'Destroying Ikael would be easy.'

The only problem was whether he could handle himself after she was destroyed.

Then all the angels turned their heads.

"Hm?"

Then Ashur, and in the next moment, the humans Amy and Sirone realized it.

"Something is coming."

What was certain was that it wasn't matter.

'Some kind of feeling.'

An eerie feeling was rushing in.

Zodiac 12.

The astrologers looked at the mechanical device floating above the pentagram drawn on the floor.

'How tragic.'

That the essence of the world was contained within metal.

King Kitra of Parass emitted brilliant blue light from both eyes as he gave instructions.

"Welcome the new world."

Having received the baptism of recognition at the Pyramid of Truth, he had briefly seen the essence of God.

When he came to his senses, he was outside the pyramid, and his emotional illness had been completely cured.

"Cause is meaningless."

Currently, besides Kitra, those who had contacted the Pyramid of Truth were scattered across the world.

"Grand Adjustment."

If reset meant system initialization, then Grand Adjustment meant changing the system itself.

What resulted from that was...

The ground shook.

Sirone looked at the pyramid structure rising beyond the horizon.

"What... is that?"

It was massive enough to rival the Pyramid of Truth in Parass.

"Sirone!"

Ikael shouted.

"Time waves keep rushing in. They're changing the laws of this world."

"Time waves?"

That was why the angels realized it first.

"Things like that are being erected all over the world. I can't survey everything through Gub-eo-bo-gi, but there are already more than eight."

Sirone bit his lip.

'Ancient civilization.'

Evidence of the outer world created when nothing existed in the universe.

'Are they intervening directly? For what purpose?'

While Sirone was lost in thought, the regular angels flocked to Satiel.

"Archangel, what exactly is that...?"

Satiel remained silent.

Even archangels had no information about things erected before their existence.

'No, even if they knew, it would be the same.'

OOPArts disrupted the information of all approaching beings with magnetic fields.

"What's about to happen?"

Zodiac 12 reported.

"Your Majesty! We've input the coordinates. However, once we change fate, we cannot turn back."

The reason for speaking was that even the astrologers were terrified.

'This is insane. It's a problem on a different dimension from world domination or humanity's destruction.'

The world they had known would disappear.

"Execute it."

"Ugh."

Several astrologers shed tears from pure fear, but Kitra remained calm.

'If I can become a god.' Having his head blown off didn't matter.

"Grand Adjustment."

When the astrologers operated the machine, the spherical metal began rotating rapidly.

Blue light exploded from Kitra's eyes.

"Ohhhhh!"

Through the curtain of completely pale vision, something hazy seemed to flicker.

'O God.'

The angels were busy surveying conditions around the world through Gub-eo-bo-gi.

'This doesn't make sense.'

The terrain had completely changed in areas where pyramids were erected, and no living beings were visible.

"Sirone, this is serious. Right now..."

Just as Ikael was about to speak, the nearest erected pyramid was engulfed in electricity.

"Graaaah!"

The angels' sacred bodies shook violently, and finally someone screamed.

"Kyaaaah!"

Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!

Angels whose sacred bodies exploded began falling to the ground like puppets with cut strings.

The angels' faces turned pale, and Sirone met eyes with Ikael.

'Could it be?'

Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!

With already half the angels fallen, Satiel bit her lip tightly.

"Archangel! Huk!"

When the sacred body of the angel beside her exploded, even she couldn't help but flinch.

'Is this the end?'

The chain reaction of explosions skipped Satiel and continued to an angel on the opposite side.

And so...

"All of them?"

In the place where the regular angels had disappeared, only Satiel, Ikael, and Uriel remained.

'Why are we still here? Because we're archangels?'

Naturally, that would be the first thought, but Sirone slowly shook his head.

'No, that doesn't matter.'

Exploring the Pyramid of Truth, Sirone knew the identity of the characters carved on the walls.

'Each one was said to be an angel. In that case, even archangels couldn't avoid it. What these three have in common lies elsewhere.'

Heart.

That was the only thing he could think of, when Satiel clenched her fists and shouted.

"This is ridiculous!"

The sight of angels who ruled the world sprawled helplessly on the ground was the epitome of misery.

"How can this be? The angels..."

At that moment, a flash flew in front of her, and Rayel, the Archangel of Light, landed.

"Satiel, the laws are changing."

When the system changes, the definition of specific concepts also changes.

"The angels' concept has lost its absoluteness. They've been demoted to human status. Based on the time wave cycle, we won't be able to avoid it eventually either."

Satiel examined the regular angels.

They were still breathing, but their sacred bodies, symbols of nobility, were nowhere to be seen.

Her gaze turned to the pyramid.

'What the hell is that thing?'

The massive structure charged with electricity seemed ready to commit some act soon.

"What are you going to do?"

"I can make it in time. Let's go together. We need to resolve this before our status falls."

Satiel understood immediately.

'Damn it.'

She wanted to eliminate Ikael right now, but even her own existence was in danger at the moment.

"Hmph, this worked out well. Think of it as punishment for you. Becoming the humans you love so much."

Ikael, whose sacred body's energy had become much fainter than before, just kept her mouth shut.

"Let's go, Rayel."

The moment Satiel finished speaking, Rayel activated the judicial halo Accelerator.

Watching the traces of those who disappeared at the speed of light, Uriel muttered.

"Human, huh."

Having one's status fall was a miserable thing he had never considered, but strangely, his heart trembled.

'Not bad.'

He looked back at Ikael.

"What will you do? Satiel doesn't seem to like this situation."

Amy asked.

"Where did Rayel go?"

"The sun."

"The sun? You mean... that thing?"

When Amy pointed to the sun floating in the sky, Ikael nodded.

"Yes. Humans are born on planets, but angels are born from the sun. We are conceptual beings. Light signals condense and materialize."

Sirone said.

"If it's Rayel, he'll arrive in 10 minutes. Following him isn't the problem, but..."

Could a human body endure it?

"Hmm, so that's how it is."

As if to dispel Sirone's worry, Amy's body once again burst into flames.
