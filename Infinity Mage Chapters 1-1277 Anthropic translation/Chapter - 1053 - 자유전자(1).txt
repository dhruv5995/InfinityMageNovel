In the flames, Rian cursed.

'Damn it.'

Purifying Ymir's demonic energy was on a completely different level from anything he had experienced before.

'This is supposed to be Ymir?'

It was limitless dissatisfaction.

As if unable to breathe for over 100 million years, as if unable to excrete for over 1 billion years.

'No living being could endure this.'

But what thoughts would Ymir have, born to endure within that cosmic contradiction?

"Graaaah! I will devour! I will devour everything!"

Monorath craved endlessly.

The more he did, the more massive Gehenna's flames became, and the earth turned to lava, surging like an ocean.

'The extremity of emotion.'

The reason Shirone couldn't act matched the reason Lethe was watching.

'They're pushing each other beyond their limits. Not providing variables is actually helping.'

As Gehenna's chains transcended the limits of purification, Rian's body began to melt.

"Grrrrrr!"

Seeing burning flesh dripping down, Monorath's eyes became bloodshot.

"I will, I will..."

The lava earth shook as violently as mountains.

"Devour!"

With a pop, Rian's body evaporated, and a cold smile formed on Lethe's lips.

"No one can stop Ymir's demonic energy. It would be the same in reality, but..."

She turned to look at Shirone.

"How unfortunate. Your efforts and the Grand Duke's have come to nothing. Just give up."

Annihilation in the mental world literally meant the nothingness of existence.

"It can't be helped."

As Lethe's eyes narrowed, Shirone continued.

"...is what you feel. When it becomes like that, when such results have already come."

The lava churned unnaturally, then the entire earth began to swell as if erupting.

"But Rian is different. If he wants to do something, he absolutely will do it. If Ymir's power comes from contradiction, then Rian's conviction is also a contradiction."

Rian's sword was a sword that denied everything.

"Moreover, to deny everything means to transcend the world and carry it through."

It could be said like this:

"Divine Transcendence."

As the slowly swelling lava suddenly shot up to the ends of the sky, Lethe turned her head.

Shock filled her eyes.

"That is..."

It was Rian, grown to such an enormous size that he could probably be seen from beyond hell's horizon.

"GRAAAAAAAH!"

Though the lava in yaksha form had no vocal cords, the vacuum resonance alone was enough to shake the world.

At that moment, Lethe realized.

"Monorath! Run!"

But it was already too late, as Monorath was suffering with his eyes rolled back showing the whites.

"I will devour! I will... I will..."

Flash—the world was engulfed in light, and all matter within sight evaporated.

Covering her face and twisting her body, Lethe opened her eyes as soon as the heat disappeared.

There was an enormous pit of unknowable depth, black as outer space.

'Everything has been purified.'

The earth, Rabiet, and the countless cities around it—all had become nothingness.

Shirone entered the pit.

"Rian!"

After descending dozens more kilometers, he heard sounds like tens of thousands screaming simultaneously.

'Resonance of darkness. This is bad.'

The pit had formed because Rian had purified the entire earth, creating an abyss.

'The sense of time is fading.'

Time doesn't flow in the abyss.

This was the same principle as time disappearing when all matter in space is eliminated.

"Rian!"

Feeling all eleven senses becoming paralyzed, Shirone exploded with Agape's light.

If he went any deeper, he wouldn't even be able to sense his own existence.

'Where? Where are you?'

Light sharp as a blade shattered the darkness as it advanced, but caught nothing.

'Damn!'

It was no longer space.

"Hey, hey. Are you okay?"

In the darkness of the abyss, Son Yu-jeong fumbled over Rian's body, which had collapsed as if dead.

Lychera's voice came from around his waist.

"Let's get out of here quickly. This is a strange place. If we stay like this, we'll go insane."

Son Yu-jeong felt the same way.

'The abyss.'

Powerful nature that had swallowed countless demons.

"Son Yu-jeong-nim."

Hastily regaining focus, Son Yu-jeong concentrated again on the hand touching Rian.

'I can't let my guard down. If my attention wavers even slightly, I'll lose my senses.'

Honestly, even now he doubted whether what his hand was touching was real.

"Ah, so warm. Son Yu-jeong-nim. The ocean is so beautiful. My mother drowned in the water..."

"Shut up. Don't make such a racket."

Son Yu-jeong shook Rian.

"Hey, hey! Get it together!"

"Hehehehe! So, you idiot, you fool, why did you jump in to save this guy? You should have run away."

He wanted to smack Lychera's head, but couldn't tell where his hands were.

'As if I wanted to save someone.'

If he could act just once while injured, he had to grab Rian.

'In the abyss, you lose yourself. This guy is the only one who can escape this place.'

Because only the Idea would be the sole standard.

"Hey! Wake up! Wake up!" 

Though he was trying anything out of desperation, it would probably be difficult to restore consciousness.

'I've never heard of humans being able to create something like this. Just where are this guy's limits?'

Now he had no choice but to gamble.

'Hair. My hair.'

Exerting her final concentration, she pulled out a hair strand and caused a string phenomenon.

"Hnngh..."

A faint light seemed to illuminate the surroundings, but soon darkness swallowed the hair.

She screamed internally.

'No! Get it together!'

But it was only happening in consciousness—no actual voice leaked out.

'Ah! Ahhh!'

No matter how much she shouted, her senses didn't return, and finally even her consciousness was submerged in darkness.

.......

The moment even her ego disappeared, a drop of string light fell downward.

"Hm?"

Feeling a refreshing energy wash over his mind, Rian slowly opened his eyes.

'What is this now?'

He couldn't see anything, and quickly realized this was different from the darkness humans commonly imagine.

'I can't feel anything.'

When he reached forward, Gehenna's chains were drawn in and caught the 'Idea'.

"Shirone."

Lifting his head and lost in thought, Rian's lips curved slightly upward.

"I've become stronger."

The Ymir's demonic energy he had absorbed was filling his entire body with explosive power.

"Idea."

The Great Straight Sword pierced the darkness.

"Divine Transcendence."

The single coordinate Rian enforced redefined the abyss's nothingness as space.

"Rian!"

Agape's light rushed in roughly, brightly illuminating Rian's surroundings.

As Shirone smiled upon making eye contact with Rian, Son Yu-jeong appeared with all his joints twisted.

"Anyway..."

In any case, it was admirable that he had tried to save Rian, and the Hand of God grabbed them.

"Let's go."

Casting spatial movement in that state, a streak of light instantly pierced through the abyss.

"Phew."

Just below the fire clouds, Rian examined the enormous pit he had created.

"Incredible."

Shirone nodded.

"Yeah. But this is just part of hell. Purifying the Holy Sound will be much more difficult."

Rian gripped the Great Straight Sword and looked around.

"Where's Lethe?"

"She left. We'll meet again soon. She'll be waiting where the Holy Sound is."

Though it was regrettable not to settle things immediately, Rian decided to bury it in the abyss's darkness.

'Magritte.'

It would have been fine to raise a glass.

'Rest in peace.'

Stang National Magic School.

Waking up in the morning, brewing coffee, and going to work to find students training intensely.

"Good morning."

The teachers greeted Shirone.

"Yes. It's a beautiful morning."

To mages, the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower were objects of admiration, though there were special feelings among them.

Since veteran teachers were mostly drafted during the World War, the teachers' ages were roughly similar to Shirone's.

"Thank you so much for helping with the advanced class supplementary lesson yesterday. You don't know how moved the students were."

"Not at all. It's something I should naturally do."

Though the Ten Wizards Council and Amy stepped up to guide students, Shirone was still the core.

Amy noticed how the female teachers' gazes changed day by day.

As Amy watched Shirone chatting and sighed, a familiar voice was heard.

"The Great Star is being too much."

Lampa, who had returned after surveying various nations' situations on Shirone's special mission, stood behind her.

"Lampa-san."

"I don't know much about romance, but it would definitely be better to draw a clear line in situations like that."

"It's because he has a personality that can't refuse people."

Though she didn't show it, hearing Lampa's words did relieve her feelings somewhat.

'No matter how busy work is, how can he not visit even once at night?'

But she couldn't embarrassingly visit him first.

"Amy. Lampa-san."

Shirone approached after parting with the teachers, but Amy's reaction was unexpectedly cold.

"Hmph."

As Shirone blinked, Wizard came running hurriedly from outside the training ground.

"Big brother!"

Amy became even more annoyed at the sight of her clinging to him, but feeling jealous of a seven-year-old was too pathetic.

"What's today's training?"

After glancing once more at Amy's expression, Shirone smiled and welcomed Wizard.

"Today we'll have some special training."

At the word "special," Amy subtly turned her head, showing interest.

"Have you heard of Force?"

"Force? No."

It was basic for students who went through regular courses at magic school, but unfamiliar to Wizard.

As Shirone walked to the center of the training ground, teachers and students stopped training and gathered around.

Direct guidance was very helpful, but every moment of Shirone and Wizard's training was history.

"Force is..."

Shirone raised his index finger and said.

"Colliding existing thoughts with other thoughts. It could be called a technique for changing one's way of thinking."

"Hmm."

Wizard nodded but his voice had a nuance of not quite understanding.

"To explain simply... yes, suppose today is exam day but you had a big fight with your parents in the morning. Then that person wouldn't be able to concentrate on the exam because of what happened in the morning. Right?"

"Hmm."

Shirone gave another example.

"Someone you love died. You're walking while immersed in sadness when suddenly a carriage comes rushing at you. At that moment, the brain forgets the loved one and operates quickly to respond to the carriage."

"Ah."

"Utilizing that artificially is Force. Limited to magic, it's like instantly changing the battery."

Wizard understood.

"It's an incredibly cold technique. Cruel too. You have to forget the person you love."

"Haha, that's right."

Shirone suddenly became serious.

"If you can't do it, you die."

"...Yes."

"The basic is Cross Force. Continuously colliding batteries along a cross-shaped intersection. Like this."

A curtain of light spread above Shirone's head, drawing a cross over 10 meters long.

"It's faster to see directly than with words. This vision magic will show my Force in real time."

Wizard swallowed and nodded.

"Thousand-fold Force."

The moment Shirone spoke, countless spheres symbolizing various magics filled the cross.

Kakakakakakakakaka!

The spheres bounced at tremendous speed, and effects flashed above the heads of people nearby.

"Im, impossible."

As the Five Great Stars' buff magic entered them, not only students but even teachers examined their own bodies.
