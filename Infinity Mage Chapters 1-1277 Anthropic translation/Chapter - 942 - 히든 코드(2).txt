Hidden Code (2)

Still battling with suspicion, Eden opened his mouth.

"I'm sorry, Lyria. I understand what's happening, but honestly, I can't trust you."

No matter how much he told himself it wasn't true, visions of her betrayal kept blooming endlessly.

Mayray spoke.

"That's enough now."

When she eavesdropped on Lyria's heart using divine frequency, the suspicion disappeared from everyone's minds.

Sein let out a long breath.

'When you can read someone's heart, prejudice can't exist. Terraforce's technology is incredible.'

The qualification to judge good and evil isn't given for nothing.

'Now.'

When Kuan gave a signal with his eyes, Lyria amplified the law of the jester Pierrot to its maximum.

While even allies couldn't find him, Kuan's chosen target was Pride's 1 o'clock.

'I won't miss this time.'

As he moved behind the woman and aimed for her heart, the Seven Sins moved in perfect unison as if reacting.

'Sloth's 4 o'clock, huh.'

What you don't want to happen won't happen?

'Then try experiencing it.'

Since the asymmetric extremity was amplified, he would have the upper hand even in a clash between cheats.

Kuan's sword flew toward the woman's back.

'Die.'

Since no one knew Kuan was there, no regret would arise either.

"Graaah!" Overwhelmed by an ominous feeling, Pride's 1 o'clock gritted her teeth and twisted her upper body.

She simply wanted to do so.

'There's definitely something.'

Because Sloth's 4 o'clock would mobilize all possible laws to avoid the approaching future.

'I need to realize it.'

If only she could figure out what it was, even if something terrible happened, she could change her choice through the emotion of regret.

'Too late.'

In a moment where one second stretched like eternity, Kuan sneered inwardly.

'No matter how you call it a hidden code, the one who wields it is human. That's your downfall.'

Before Pride's 1 o'clock could even turn her gaze, his sword would pierce her heart.

'Huh?'

He felt chilling killing intent from the side.

"Danger!"

Even before Mayray's voice burst out, Kuan had already retrieved his sword and retreated.

A fist came into the space where he had been, making the air explode with a bang.

'Who is that guy?'

As if affected by centrifugal force, Kuan made a large detour through the air and examined the identity of the fist.

A young man wearing horn-rimmed glasses with his hair parted 8:2 was relaxing his stance and smiling.

"Wow, really agile, aren't you? Your timing was perfect though."

??????

That's what Kuan wanted to say.

'That attack just now was as fast as mine. Did the Seven Sins have a schema master too?'

The young man spoke playfully.

"You must have trained really hard. How did you do that movement? I'd like to learn too."

Though he was expressing admiration, his eyes curved like seagulls behind the horn-rimmed glasses were clearly mocking.

Kuan, who had landed on the ground, spat out.

"What would you do with that knowledge? No, even if I told you, someone like you wouldn't be able to learn it in a lifetime."

"Haha! Of course."

The young man stuck out his snake-like long tongue and said with a sinister gleam in his eyes.

"Who would do such a foolish thing, you idiot?"

As Kuan kept his mouth shut, the young man's thoughts that Mayray had eavesdropped on flowed in.

'Wandering's 6 o'clock. His hidden code is... obtaining the result of having done all actions necessary for achievement.

'Are you kidding?'

Everyone who heard the wavelength was outraged.

Especially Kuan showed disgust in his eyes, but Wandering's 6 o'clock just shrugged his shoulders.

"I'm human too, but watching the world you guys live in is really funny. It's nothing but comedy. Trying desperately to do something, and when you lose in competition, you just whine. Puhahaha! Just..."

As Wandering's 6 o'clock turned his body and flexed his arm, his robe burst with a bang.

His right forearm, thick as a log, was revealed.

"Just do this, right?"

Though they had expected it, actually seeing it with their eyes darkened Sein's group's expressions.

'There's no need to train.'

Just assume you did it and that's it.

"Knowledge is the same. Digging into books every day, memorizing, staying up for days and nights trying to understand."

There was no particular change from Wandering's 6 o'clock.

But Sein's group could definitely read a subtle feeling different from before in the young man's eyes.

"Hmm, so about 20 years?"

Filled with the feeling of intelligence, he smiled wickedly.

"Let's say I studied hard."

It wasn't just Sein who felt fundamental displeasure about life's purpose.

'How far are you planning to mock us?'

To advance by 0.1 seconds, to lift 1 more kilogram, to score 1 more point.

'Dedicating one's entire life - that's what it means to be human.'

Even while feeling like their lives were being denied, the Seven Sins' wavelengths continued to surge.

'Injustice's 7 o'clock.'

It was a child.

With a depressed, expressionless face, and undeniable malice contained in their eyes.

'Right, what's the hidden code?'

Takes no responsibility.

Now Sein's group could easily imagine the exact content contained in the hidden code.

'Even if they instigate others to kill, push people off cliffs, or release poison into rivers!'

No one would think it was their responsibility.

'Fine, let's see how far you'll go mad.'

While waiting for the next wave of thoughts, a blonde woman extended her hand.

"Hidden Piece."

The scenery where Sein's group was located split like a puzzle, and Mayray's space detached entirely.

"Give me your ear!"

As the blonde woman made a wicked smile and raised her finger, it caught fire.

Just as the burning finger tried to grab Mayray's ear, Sein adjusted the spatial information.

'Sun-Moon Light Ring!'

The blonde woman's hand grazed Mayray's ear, and the puzzle-like tangled space returned.

'Is this an irregular formula?'

It was an ability he had read about in numerous reports coming into the Holy War.

'Mortasinger's ability.'

10th rank of the Council of Ten Elders.

According to Sirone, she had fallen to Satan's temptation and been dragged to hell.

"Are you Mortasinger?"

The blonde woman covered her mouth and laughed.

"Hohoho! How unpleasant. To mistake me for someone who's nothing more than fertilizer."

"Fertilizer?"

Since they knew their minds were being read anyway, the Seven Sins had no secrets.

"To activate hidden codes, we need materials. Extreme emotions, that is. Here's the interesting part - extreme emotions are at a level that's rarely felt in reality. Out of 100 people, maybe 0.1 would experience it once in their lifetime?"

He roughly understood what she meant.

"But in the other world, it's commonplace. Mortasinger is still screaming in hell right now. Begging to be purified instead, saying she'd rather have that. Kekekeke! But purification is another word for pain, you know. What do you think that means? She's asking to be tortured more!"

The mental wavelength about the blonde woman was collected.

'Envy's 8 o'clock. Her hidden code is... being able to have what cannot be had... I see.'

Money, lovers, positions can be stolen.

'On the other hand, talents, looks, happiness - these have qualities that cannot be transferred. But Envy's 8 o'clock can do it.'

The condition is destruction.

If she's jealous of someone's face, she just needs to pour acid on that person's face.

'So Mayray's ear...'

Whether she knew what the group was thinking or not, Envy's 8 o'clock was busy with her own words.

"Oh, and thanks for sending that kid called Jinseong-eum. The spirit realm is closed, but the hidden codes are strengthened. That kid caused quite a lot of trouble, so our demons are taking very good care of her. We probably won't run out of materials for a while."

"Materials."

Sein suddenly had a question.

"You said extreme emotions are needed to activate hidden codes. Then why is Kuan..."

Sein looked back at Kuan and stopped speaking.

"Ah."

He saw Kuan standing with a calm expression, his one arm and the opposite sleeve fluttering in the wind.

'Asymmetric extremity. The code he could obtain by removing one arm while his ankle tendon was already severed...'

It was being activated using Kuan's own emotions as material.

'I roughly understand now. How extreme emotions work on hidden codes.'

Isn't there living proof right in front of them?

As the Seven Sins took a step forward, Sein retreated the same distance and gave instructions.

"Maintain distance."

"Hoho. Why? You can read our minds, can't you? Where else would you find a more advantageous battle?"

Sein felt humiliated.

'I thought so at first.'

The problem was that the Seven Sins' hidden codes weren't the type that could be blocked just by knowing about them.

'Delusion's 9 o'clock is also tricky.'

Sein's gaze turned to a simple-looking bachelor as he heard the mental wavelength.

'Imagination becomes reality. A truly terrifying hidden code. Like a completed version of Nemesis.'

Delusion's 9 o'clock pointed at Sein's ring.

"I smell something familiar. Is that Nemesis by any chance?"

Sein's hypothesis was correct.

'So this is how it is.'

Just as humans dream, demons' emotions also flow into Drimo and float around.

'Sometimes you see them too.'

If you've ever seen something during sleep paralysis, your thin barrier temporarily opened.

'Then they get excavated by mental magicians and slip out into the human world.'

Though there are countless objects, most items that made human lives terrible probably came from the other world.

"Sein."

Sein's eyes widened as he turned his head.

"Miro?"

The scenery changed instantly, revealing the old landscape of Alpheas Magic School.

"What are you standing there dazed for? You said you'd help with my research today. Did you forget?"

"Ah..."

Sein couldn't reach the thought that Delusion's 9 o'clock had activated his hidden code.

Imagination becomes reality.

"Ah, sorry. I was thinking about something else."

Though memories of the Seven Sins still remained, the cheat flipped the sensations of reality and imagination.

"Damn it! I never even said I'd help!"

Gaold from his weak days was following, carrying three boxes full of documents.

'Gaold...'

The man who, on the day of the Tribunal of Twenty, was the only one to throw his life away to save Miro.

'That's right.'

All memories were vivid and he knew why, but there was no sense of incongruity at all.

This was reality.

"Miro."

In the contradiction of living reality while knowing the future, Sein was seized by an intense impulse.

"Yeah?"

I like you.

Just once, he wanted to honestly confess his feelings to her.

Just like Gaold did in the Inferno Hell.

"What? You called me but won't say anything?"

It wasn't because he lacked courage.

He simply wanted to know that there was no man in the world who could possess Miro.

'But I was wrong.'

The beginning of everything was...

Time flowed quickly, revealing the scene from the day of the Tribunal of Twenty.

He saw Miro walking toward Estas.

'Gaold will come.'

The voice that had shouted for Miro even while being cursed with self-returning mutation had caused a small crack in her perfect mental state.

'For my whole life, no, even now I regret it. Why couldn't I show courage like Gaold?'

As Miro passed by his side, tears welled up in one of his Cheolryun eyes, which hadn't happened at the time.

Farewell, Miro.

That was about all he chose to say as his final goodbye.

'Damn it!'

Pride's 1 o'clock's voice planted a code not in Sein's consciousness but in his unconscious.

Choose. The future can be changed.

'Miro.'

Gaold will come. Before that, you protect Miro. Shout to the world! That Miro is your woman!

'Miro!'

Let's skip all the process. You honestly know too, don't you? If you choose here, Miro will become your woman.

"Miro!"

Sein's face turned pale at Gaold's voice heard from afar.

'I have to do it now! I can change it! I can avoid regret! I've carried this my whole life, my whole life!'

But Sein's reason was blocking his voice without even knowing why.

'Hnngh!'

The gears in both pupils moved frantically within one degree as if caught on something.

'No! This isn't right!'

Prejudice's 5 o'clock cast a hidden code on Sein.

Actually, Miro likes you too. Very much so.

"Aaaaah!"

As his eyes burned hot from the collision of reason and emotion, Sein screamed.

She thinks only of you even now!

"Please! Plea..."

As Sein screamed, something in his head felt like it snapped, and a huge crack appeared in the scenery.

"What...!"

As the positions of imagination and reality reversed, a chilling thrill ran up Sein's spine.

"Damn it! You idiot!"

While everyone who had escaped from Delusion's 9 o'clock looked around with the same eyes as Sein.

"Kuan?..."

Only Kuan was kneeling on one knee, panting while holding his sword in a striking pose.
