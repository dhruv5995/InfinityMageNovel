[711] The 19,000 Worlds (5)

Soldier ant 13th Night.

Born during the early days when Queen Garnet was establishing her colony, he was a battle master who had slaughtered thousands of enemy ants.

Though he currently served as captain of Garnet's direct guard unit, it wasn't unusual for him to personally appear when new enemies emerged, given his innate love for combat.

Striding forward, 13th Night thrust his antennae toward Sirone, paying close attention.

Even though antennae could receive countless pieces of information, they were ultimately just functional evolution of the five senses.

Simply touching his body couldn't reveal what thoughts Sirone harbored.

"Who are you? Why have you invaded Garnet Colony?"

Though the Ultima System decoded 13th Night's pheromones, Sirone had no means to communicate back.

'What should I do?'

Pondering this dilemma, Sirone found a new solution in the ant's act of scanning his body with its antennae.

'Perhaps...'

Slowly raising both hands to show he had no intention of attacking, Sirone concentrated, and two tentacle-like appendages similar to ant antennae extended from Armang's robe.

'Microcosm Genesis.'

If it was Armang's function that had connected to countless systems until now, perhaps communication with an ant was possible too.

"What's this now?"

At the two tentacles climbing over Sirone's left and right shoulders, 13th Night activated his combat stance.

'My breath is stopping.'

The ant's killing intent was chaos itself, yet also so pure it felt like watching Nade's magical synchronization.

Having experienced it before, he could remain somewhat calmer, and Sirone carefully connected the tentacles to the antennae.

"Hup!"

Just from brushing contact, the different systems exchanged information, and 13th Night's body trembled.

New language system detected. Translation program construction. Interface creation and output.

Simultaneously with Armang's signal, the robe swelled and a organic sphere with nerve-like fur protruded.

External Artificial Brain (Language Translation Version).

"What have you done to me?"

At the completely different sensation from other creatures' antennae, 13th Night exploded with killing intent and launched his body forward.

"Wait! Now I can...!"

As 13th Night charged at tremendous speed and his jaws crossed like twin swords, Sirone hastily leaned back.

"Not bad!"

Seeing the ant curl into a ball and spin while swinging its claws, Sirone's eyes flashed wide.

'That's Kido's...?'

Law of Earth
Ant Hell.

"Kill! Kill! Kill the enemy!"

Countless ants released pheromones, but since the External Artificial Brain was analyzing the signals separately, his mind wasn't dizzy.

'The problem is this ant.'

The space around spinning 13th Night seemed to be sucked in entirely.

Finally, as the landscape became distorted with Denai, he saw the illusion of the earth tangling like thread.

'Whoa...!'

Sirone was genuinely impressed by the level reached not by a human body, but by an ant's.

The world vibrated up and down as soil from all directions rose up, completely blocking Sirone's escape routes.

Though such phenomena weren't actually occurring, the world's laws announced Movement Zero through Denai.

'Chyoeni Bardo!'

As the mirror world opened, another route different from this world was born in Sirone's senses.

"What?"

13th Night stopped rotating and tilted his head.

Though he had clearly blocked the movement routes with the Law of Earth, Sirone was nowhere to be seen at his destination.

"I don't want to fight."

Feeling the pheromones, 13th Night flinched and turned around to find Sirone had already positioned himself there.

"..."

Countless ants held their breath and watched, while 13th Night realized through his excellent insect senses.

"You... you're doing the same thing as me."

13th Night didn't know how he had acquired the technique of harmonizing with the earth.

He had simply fought countless wars and returned enemy ants to soil, gradually understanding the principles of life.

"Yes. I've lived the same life as you."

Though their system might be inferior to humans', Sirone saw that the essence was no different.

'Nothing is trivial. We simply choose not to look closely.'

Recalling Miro's teachings, Sirone politely requested of 13th Night.

"I came from another world. And I want to know how to return to my original world. Take me to your queen."

"To Her Majesty?"

Though it was fortunate they could communicate, the queen was in a frail state and this opponent was strong.

'But there's no hostility.'

Only the Avatar's nature conveyed through Sirone's antennae in that brief moment served as grounds for trust.

"I don't have the ability to arrange a meeting with Her Majesty."

Only female ants ranking in the top 10 among the colony's royalty could have an audience with the queen.

"You might die. The royalty are conservative and consider intrusion by other species unclean."

Though he thought societies were the same everywhere, Sirone wasn't worried about that.

"But you're the strong one. I can persuade them."

13th Night shook his head.

"You don't understand. They're not subjects for persuasion. The royalty will someday build colonies..."

The ant's pheromones cut off abruptly.

'Lord Merot might permit it.'

Merot, ranked 1st among royalty, was an ant with beautiful appearance and noble character who commanded the people's respect.

However, the 'engagement' competition among nobles (male ants) was fierce, so bringing a creature with both sexes wouldn't go unnoticed.

"There's one way. Taking you as a war slave. Then the nobles won't pay attention."

Though it was still dangerous, Sirone had no other choice unless he planned to live here forever.

"Fine. I'll leave the treatment to you. Just let me meet the queen."

"...Follow me."

As 13th Night turned, the worker ants parted left and right as if receiving a single signal.

At the Andre entrance.

Kido, facing the Maga Bandit Group, hadn't had a second to breathe, his face pale from oxygen deprivation.

'No good. I can't hold out.'

After hundreds of exchanges, he was cutting them down one by one, but 38 had only decreased to 32.

In Kido's perception, it was as if they hadn't decreased at all, and especially the vice-leader's skills were objectively far superior to his own.

"Break through! Break through the entrance!"

All Kido could do was desperately block using the entrance's terrain.

'Blade Hell!'

Rolling on the ground while swinging his spear, the bandit group momentarily retreated, but his physical limits were evident.

Confirming the rotation speed was decreasing, the vice-leader drew his sword first and charged.

"Now! Kill him!"

"Grk!"

In the critical moment when his throat was about to be cut, Kido had no choice but to give up the entrance and retreat.

'This is bad. Now...'

With the entire bandit group occupying the wide space, the number of enemies he had to face increased to everyone.

"Prostrate yourself and beg nicely, and I'll cut your head off with one stroke."

Seeing the vice-leader approach with his sword lowered, Kido felt all strength drain from his body.

'I'm not afraid of dying. But...'

If Kido died, Sirone would die too.

"He went in thinking I would protect him."

His hands holding the spear trembled, and tears flowed at the thought that he ultimately couldn't protect him.

"You fought well. Now die."

As Sirone's death became reality, Kido felt fear for the first time in his life.

The thought of Sirone dying was terrifyingly frightening.

'I have to protect him.'

The life of another that the goblin's cold heart embraced was hot like a massive chunk of coal.

It was a heart.

"Please save Sirone. I'll do anything. Just don't kill Sirone. He went in trusting me."

Teardrops fell, wetting the ground.

"...That's regrettable."

The vice-leader genuinely pitied Kido.

"Once you die, you can forget everything."

Bestowing the only mercy he could offer as a human, he slowly approached and raised his sword.

'Water. I want to drink water.'

As Sirone's life swallowed into his chest blazed fiercely, Kido felt an unbearable thirst that nearly drove him insane.

"Thirsty... so thirsty...!"

"Die."

Just as the vice-leader was about to bring down his sword, Kido suddenly raised his head with bloodshot eyes.

'What?'

The goblin's afterimage wavered like a mirage, and the surrounding earth began to undulate like waves.

Sensing danger from the unexpected change, the leader swiftly brought down his sword at lightning speed, simultaneously.

"Graaaaaaah!"

The ground caught in Denai revealed the illusion of transforming into a swamp and pulled down the bandit group's lower bodies.

Law of Earth
Earthbound Spirit.

"Damn it! What is this! My feet...!"

As the bandit group flailed in the endless illusion of falling into a swamp, the vice-leader shouted.

"Get it together! It's just an optical illusion from the law!"

Gravity acting equally on the earth became jumbled, creating the illusion of being trapped in a swamp.

'Incredible Acing! How could a mere goblin achieve such...!'

"Graaaaaaah!"

Kido stretched his upper body wide and looked up at the ceiling with shocked eyes.

'It's being filled! It's being filled!'

As refreshing coolness suddenly rushed into his chest that had burned to ash, he tasted the greatest ecstasy of his life.

It was the moment when the goblin's mind, which had circulated through the cycle of feeding and reproduction, absorbed the heart and expanded into an even greater world.

'This is a heart.'

Like parched earth absorbing rainwater, as his heart filled with love, the power of Acing surged even higher.

"Create distance!"

The vice-leader and members barely overcame the Acing, but the sensation of walking through a swamp was impossible to adapt to immediately.

Whiriri. Whiriri.

At the flute sound, everyone who raised their heads saw Kido spinning his spear and laughing.

'Now I understand, Sirone. What it means to be human.'

The flute sound stopped, and Kido, gripping his spear properly, extended one hand and gestured for them to come.

"Have a pleasant journey."

Kido had learned what love was.

Labyrinth Phaitalos.

Nane briefly gazed at the entrance of the pitch-black cave where all the world's turbid energies flowed.

Having reached the state of Yua Dokjon, he experienced the world being destroyed and reborn with each blink of his eyes.

'Without me, there is no universe.'

But was that really everything?

'If simply closing one's eyes is the end, why do we exist in this world?'

Nane's journey, which began from extremely low experiences, was meeting its end before the universe's existential value.

The moment he stepped into the labyrinth's darkness, he felt the sensation of falling endlessly.

The Law's Lowlands.

Just standing over the hole where corrupt energies were sucked in made his ego feel like it was collapsing.

'The fact that I'm falling means...'

Since no naturally formed cave could create such a deep pit, there was only one possibility.

"The mirror world."

Finally, the sensation of falling ended, and an unfamiliar landscape completely different from reality unfolded before his eyes.

Blood-red flames burned without fuel, and iron mesh and steel frames burned by the heat connected the interior in complex ways.

"Please save me! Kyaaaah!"

"Uaaaah! Just kill me! Please kill me!"

Even hearing people's terrible screams, Nane walked forward without changing expression.

In the world of mind, even physical death couldn't mean extinction.

"No! No!"

Monks and explorers who had entered the labyrinth were suffering unspeakably horrific torments that collapsed their egos.

'Hell?'

Phaitalos Underground 1st Floor.

It was the hell of lust, one of the seven sins created by humanity's corrupt laws.
