Giant Adjustment (1)

Marsha asked.

"What do you mean by that?"

"The Apocalypse is where the final information of the future that can be reached based on reality accumulates. Of course, it's not a structure where things physically pile up."

"Right. Even in an ordinary household, you might find something that's a year old alongside something that's over 20 years old. Mining means collecting the oldest relics to uncover information about the near future. Of course, sometimes that means you actually have to do some digging..."

"Yes. In that sense, the fact that the building with Digital Ra is Fairy Biomimetics has great significance. In the demon war, the elves sided with humans. Enox, the elf chieftain, considers her own kind a failed race."

Only humans dream endlessly, desire without limit, and struggle without rest.

"She knows. Any race that fails to assimilate into human society eventually becomes livestock."

The fire tribe was a prime example.

"Enox and the elves are still fighting even now. And this monument tells us their outcome."

"The fairies won."

It wasn't a good result for humans either.

"Why don't they appear? I understand why the giants aren't moving since they already obey Ra's commands, but..."

"The fairies are the same. With Ikael stepping down from the position of archangel, they lost their center. But now it's clear what they're after."

Fairy Biomimetics Corporation.

"They're trying to become human." Biomimetics.

"In a completely different way from... the elves' agape."

The angels' cries were mournful.

"Ah, why has this happened... Are we still angels?"

Having lost their pure concept, their sacred luminous bodies, there was no nobility to be found in them.

Only self-esteem that had fallen to rock bottom.

'Why do we grieve?'

Uriel looked up at the sky where Sirone had departed.

'Just because we've lost our concept doesn't mean we're no longer ourselves. So why?'

There had always been perfect standards.

Angels born with inherent concepts from birth have no conflict about their actions.

'Even fallen angels... their crimes were committed within their own concepts.'

'For angels, the sacred luminous body must have been the standard of existence, beyond power or ability.'

Without such a shock, it couldn't be called a fall from grace.

'Then what about me?'

Uriel questioned himself.

'Even if I've lost my sacred luminous body, even if I have no standard of existence, can I still choose?'

He couldn't kill Ikael.

The fact that the Archangel of Destruction hesitated before destruction was clearly an action of the heart.

'I ended up defining myself by my own standards, not the universe's standards.'

Sacred luminous bodies do not perish.

"Ah, Lord Uriel."

The angels gathered toward the brilliant sacred luminous body floating above Uriel's head.

"What should we do now? Should we perish? Or should we exist? These hands, these feet... where should we move them?" 

Uriel looked down at the angels' servile expressions.

'They've probably never done it before.'

The act of choosing something for themselves.

"Let's go."

Uriel turned around.

'We can't go to the human world where Satiel lived. They wouldn't be able to endure it.'

They were like newborn children.

Taking them to humans who deal with uncertainty would lead to terrible consequences.

'They'd be like predators.'

Following weakly behind, the angels asked.

"Where are we going?"

The archangel with a sacred luminous body had departed for the sun, and humans had become their natural enemies.

"Crown."

The head of the 72 ranks of fairies.

The giant sailing ship created by Ashur's signal stretched through the vast expanse of space.

Sirone was in the captain's quarters.

'Rayel must have arrived by now.'

Although Ashur's ship was fast enough to reach the sun in a day, light speed was on another dimension.

'Not speed, but concept. The unit of signals that make up the universe.'

While the mind is faster than light, faster-than-light simply means the void between signals.

'No matter is faster than light.'

Even at such speed, it would take roughly 10 minutes to reach the sun.

Ashur entered.

"I'm sorry."

Sirone had been keeping watch outside while he recovered after using his Signal ability to its fullest.

"It's fine. Warp is impossible anyway. If it weren't for you, Ashur, we couldn't have even attempted it."

If even a trace of doubt remains in the mind, quantum phenomena won't activate.

Though he could approach it through Omega's experience, this time he couldn't gain certainty.

'No living thing has ever entered the sun. No, even if there were, it would have been the same.'

It was an unknown that even escaped Taeseong's control.

"Going in a straight line would be fastest, but near-light speed has many risk factors. I'll take a safe detour."

"Yes. Please do."

Coming down to the passenger cabin, he saw Ikael and Amy standing side by side in front of the window.

Ikael's expression was dark.

"Are you worried?"

Though she had betrayed heaven for Sirone's sake, the angels were also precious to her.

"Yes. But it'll be okay. Uriel remained. He'll take good care of them."

Amy asked.

"You said it's the angels' homeland. What kind of place is it? This is my first time going to the sun."

Sensing her consideration, Ikael smiled.

"It's a beautiful place. Though by human standards, the environment might be a bit extreme."

"A bit?"

Sirone's eyes narrowed.

"Hehe. The sun's light is a network that travels from one end of space to the other. Without light, there would be no sensation, and then there would be no world for humans either."

"Everything came from the sun."

"Yes. That is 'Ra'. And the being that controls all those suns is the eternal sun that never goes out, Anke Ra, the incarnation of the Akashic Records."

The eternal and immortal Ra.

"If any life form born from Ra came to Amy's planet, they might find it a harsh environment. But for me, an angel, the sun is the most comfortable and mentally peaceful sanctuary."

"So angels can withstand the sun?"

"Of course we can't."

Ikael pouted and rolled her eyes.

Amy was speechless at her girlish appearance, then she continued her explanation with a smile.

"Even conceptual beings like angels can't endure the sun's enormous energy."

That was why the 12 apostles couldn't come.

"But the sacred luminous body doesn't disappear and gets absorbed as is. That's why angels can go to the sun. You could say the sun itself is a giant sacred luminous body."

He seemed to understand what she meant.

"An aggregate of mental bodies. But can we humans endure it too?"

Sirone said.

"I should be able to defend with Miracle Stream, but that would probably be the limit. If Satiel responds hostilely, it could be dangerous."

"That's why Amy came with us."

Ikael said.

"With Amy having the incarnation of fire, she should be able to withstand the sun's power. In terms of law, it means there won't be a system collision but compatibility instead."

"Do you really think so?"

Of course she was confident, and even if she weren't, she would have come anyway, but the opponent was none other than the sun.

'Me stomping around on the sun?'

As Amy's eyes lost focus imagining it, Ikael patted her head.

"Hoho, don't worry. If you can influence the angels' conceptual bodies, it means you've approached Ra's status. You can look forward to it. It's truly a beautiful place."

Amy turned to look out the window.

"The sun..."

At the far end of space, a star sparkling like a gold coin was waiting for them.

The sun is wondrous. Looking at a fireball 100 times the size of humanity's planet from just 1,000 meters away, one realizes how brilliant this world is.

Their eyes were blinded by the tremendous light, and any living being would have melted long ago, but...

"The movement has definitely changed."

The conceptual angels accepted the entire pale world of heat as it was.

Rayel transmitted consciousness through his sacred luminous body.

"An adjustment occurred throughout the entire universe. To build several pyramids on a single planet."

In terms of the ratio of change, it was so minute that no instrument could measure it.

Half of a half, half of that half, digging through eons to reach that point of adjustment.

Angels call the change that occurred in that realm:

"Feeling."

Satiel frowned.

"An extremely small change that even an angel's senses can only perceive as a feeling. But since it definitely changed..."

It's a giant adjustment.

An explosion on the sun's surface sent pillars of fire thousands of kilometers high shooting into space.

A festival of light.

The light born now would cross the vacuum and cause countless events throughout the universe, but...

"Hmph."

That light held no angelic authority.

"I can't accept it. I'll restore the angels. I just need to change them from the core."

"Can you do it? Even if all the archangels gathered, it would be difficult. Above all, even if you connect to Ra's core, to reverse this change..."

The power of amplification is needed.

"Ikael."

The fact that nothing could be done without her fueled Satiel's anger.

"We have no choice but to try. Now there are only two of us left. Angels who have hearts... Hm?"

Satiel turned to look at Rayel.

"But why do you still have your sacred luminous body? Have you ever violated the standards of law?"

There was no answer, and Mara Luna, hiding behind Rayel, focused her eyes intently.

'It's all because of you.'

When Satiel decided to become the archangel herself, the archangels left her side.

No matter how much she screamed and raged, her voice couldn't move the world.

'Lord Rayel stopped walking.'

I am the archangel! I will set everything right! I will punish the traitor Ikael!

After listening to her cries all night, Rayel sighed and turned around.

"Luna, let's go back."

"Lord Rayel, Lord Satiel has no authority to lead the archangels. Why do you yield to her?"

I am the most noble! I am the archangel!

"We've known each other for a long time."

Luna could never forget Rayel's face as he looked toward Satiel at that moment.

"I felt it wouldn't be right if I left too."

"Lord Rayel..."

He chose for himself.

Satiel asked no more questions.

"Hmph. Well, whatever. At least having you here will make it a bit easier. Since you're the Archangel of Light."

"Right. Let's go in."

As the two angels leaned toward the sun, Luna's face crumpled.

"Ugh! Lord Rayel..."

"Return to subspace. This is our homeland. It's not a place Mara can endure."

Even one meter further would feel like her body would melt.

"I refuse. I'll follow you."

Luna, Mara of moonlight, was the goddess of madness. Her obsession with Rayel was beyond imagination.

"Luna."

Rayel caressed her piercingly beautiful face.

"I command you."

"Lord Rayel. My master."

Shedding tears and rubbing her cheek, Luna's body became hazy and disappeared into subspace.

Rayel turned around.

"Let's depart."

The conceptual bodies of the two angels rushing toward the sun at tremendous speed began to catch fire.

'Ah.'

Satiel felt infinite peace.

'Ra. My homeland.'

The angels' flesh evaporated instantly, and two sacred luminous bodies burrowed into the sun's embrace.
