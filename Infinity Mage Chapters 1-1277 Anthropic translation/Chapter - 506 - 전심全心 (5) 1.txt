[506] Whole Heart (5)

"Huu."

Gurgle.

As the Spirit Zone surged toward Shirone, the landscape refracted toward the center as if trapped within a water droplet.

"Haa."

Gurgle.

As he exhaled, this time the Spirit Zone extended outward toward the world.

Like a rubber band, the surrounding objects stretched, revealing taut tension.

'Breathe in.'

Gurgle.

'Breathe out.'

Gurgle.

The world was pulsating along with Shirone's breathing.

With each pulse, his mind that had been exploding outward as a result of Ataraxia's Six-Stage Bombardment gradually gathered itself together and began to regain its proper form.

"Th-this can't be..."

Ikael trembled with an indescribable emotion.

The ability for a human mind to resonate with the world's objects was a characteristic of Elysion.

But completely calming an exploding mind was an event that arose solely from Shirone's unique enlightenment.

This was surely some human realm.

'He's reached Prajna.'

Just a year ago when teaching Ataraxia, Shirone had been merely a beginner who hadn't yet entered the depths of his mind.

Of course, the mental state of Geumgangtae wasn't a realm that a teenage boy could encompass either, but Prajna was a mental system of an incomparably different level.

By Ikael's standards of normal humans, he had leaped over a process that required at least a thousand years of cultivation in one bound.

Gurgle. Gurgle. Gurgle.

The contraction and expansion of the Spirit Zone accelerated further.

Drrrrrrrr!

As if receiving centripetal force, the smaller it became, the faster its pulsation beat the world countless times.

And finally, Shirone's eyes snapped open.

Mental Transcendence.

Prajna.

As the Spirit Zone disappeared, golden heat shimmer rose from Shirone like flames.

As a result of his whole heart constructing his mind, Shirone's avatar transcended the heart and revealed itself in the real world.

'That is...!'

The first thing visible was Armand's avatar.

The substance of Armand integrated with Shirone's avatar was in the form of smooth armor that gleamed like molten gold, unlike its monstrous appearance in reality.

Shirone's avatar shone with even brighter light as massive wings of light spread from both shoulders.

A being who had cast aside the heart and realized the true avatar.

That was Prajna.

Whooooooo!

The moment Prajna entered his sight, black aura spread from Phiel's body, shaking the sky above.

'Prajna?'

It was a realm too deep for humans to reach, so he hadn't even considered the possibility.

And for that very reason, it was also what Ankera had desperately guarded against and tried to prevent.

Though known to barely exist in the earthly realm, among the immortal divine citizens, there were rarely those who ascended to Prajna.

But even they were strictly controlled by Ankera's will, so they formed their own community to resist in their own way - that was the Council of Ten Elders, the organization that commanded the Third Heaven, Shehakim.

'I'll eliminate Prajna.'

As Phiel shot out dissolving into black smoke, Ikael blocked Shirone with her weakened body.

The moment she saw Phiel's face that seemed to be sucked into an abyss, she realized there was no chance of victory, but her feet were firmly rooted to the ground.

Kiiiiing!

Just as Phiel was about to pierce through Ikael's torso, a golden flash curved in to block his path.

An afterimage overlapping as if an avatar was superimposed on Shirone's body cast magic toward Phiel.

Graaaaaaang!

The massive flash of Photon Cannon pushed forward.

The solid ground rolled away like waves, and Phiel's silhouette fluttered like ash within the white radiance.

"Kruuuu!"

Where the flash had passed, Phiel groaned with his arms crossed.

Since the mind exploded through Ataraxia's Six-Stage Bombardment was entirely focused on the avatar, the power had become even stronger.

"Phiel! Stop now! We can't lose any more archangels!"

Satiel flew over belatedly and shouted, but only Shirone's death remained in Phiel's photosphere.

Whooooooo!

As Phiel's white robe burned in the heat, his body assimilated into perfect darkness and struck at Shirone.

No longer able to be called an angel, before the will of annihilation that only Phiel could possess, Shirone's avatar began to flicker as if losing its light.

'I won't forgive you.'

Shirone charged straight toward the darkness rippling with the energy of death.

Ataraxia was impossible.

The concept of amplification was still acting upon him.

'I won't forgive you!'

But he still had one more weapon remaining.

Valhalla Action!

As the halo spread, the trigger that reversed cause and effect activated.

'You alone...'

Shirone gritted his teeth.

Ikael's screams, her tears, her pain.

All of these flashed through his mind in an instant, igniting his resolve.

"I absolutely won't forgive you!"

As the dying avatar blazed again, darkness swirled and a terrible cry was heard.

Whooooooo!

An avatar contains the entire lifetime of a being.

As Arin had discovered with her supernatural sight, Shirone's avatar possessed light, and that law of light tore apart the law of darkness.

"Kruuuuu!"

As Shirone thrust both hands forward and charged, black smoke followed in a trail, gathering between his palms.

After a moment, the smoke condensed and materialized again in the form of Phiel wearing an angel's robe.

"Keke! Kekekeke!"

Even with his throat being strangled by Shirone, Phiel let out an eerie laugh.

It was laughter born of absurdity.

'This is Prajna.'

A situation unimaginable before today's war broke out.

Among the eight archangels, who would have known that he, the most skilled at guiding death, would be pushed this far by just one human?

'But still human in the end.'

One corner of Phiel's lips rose to where his cheek should be.

"You seem frustrated."

At the mocking tone, Shirone's face contorted.

Even at this moment, Valhalla Action was waiting for some result to be input, but no matter how much he thought, he couldn't find a way to annihilate Phiel.

"Yes, that is your limit."

Even Phiel had to acknowledge Shirone's abilities.

The archangel ability Ataraxia and the angel ability Valhalla Movement, the functions of the magic sword Armand that had absorbed even the characteristics of Purgatory's strongest species, and avatar enhancement through Ichigo Yuishinjo.

The powerful mental strength of Immortal Function and magic using God Particles, the enlightenment unique to Unlockers.

On top of that, he had mastered the mental state of Geumgangtae and even Elysion, the mind of the Gaians.

And finally, even the realm of Prajna that drew out one's true avatar.

Too many realms, abilities, and techniques were combined for one human to have mastered, and through the massive trigger of Ataraxia's Six-Stage Bombardment, they had reached their extreme and arrived at this result.

But even that wasn't enough to drive Phiel to annihilation.

If Ataraxia was an archangel's ability, then Apatheia was also an ability of matching power.

What was gained from the offset of amplification and annihilation was merely making an archangel kneel once.

Even if he could subdue him, as long as the ultimate shield of annihilation existed, it was impossible for Shirone to generate enough power to completely erase Phiel.

"That is what it means to be human. It was quite a chilling struggle, but in the end, it's just struggling."

As if trying to unfold his pride that had been crumpled until now, Phiel shouted in a voice that seemed to tear.

"No matter how much you throw your whole heart, you cannot reach an angel's mind!"

Before the excitement unbecoming of the Archangel of Annihilation, Shirone's eyes became as cold as absolute zero.

"No."

The golden avatar expanded a bit more, completely covering Shirone's physical body.

"Not yet."

Valhalla Action activated again, spinning rapidly.

Shirone, emitting terrifying radiance from his eyes, ground his molars and input the result.

'I need more powerful force.'

Valhalla Action accepted Shirone's endless desire without filter.

'Stronger! More! More! More!'

As desire was mediated to the Akashic Records, finally the result value of causal exchange emerged.

Power sufficient to be confident of eliminating Phiel.

The price to be paid for borrowing that result was a staggering 127 years, 9 months, 17 days, 43 minutes, and 5 seconds.

An inefficient payment method to the point of coughing blood.

This stemmed from the fact that advancing a specific action and advancing a future level were completely different things.

While actions moving from A to B produce roughly fixed time calculations, strengthening mental power never correlates proportionally with time.

Increasing magical power would have countless variables blocking the result - potential, effort, training methods, recovery status, etc. - so the interest on time had clearly compounded like a loan shark even worse than the most vicious ones would stick their tongues out at.

Equivalent exchange of desire and possibility.

Even facing a result that required borrowing while giving up his life, Shirone was resolute.

'It doesn't matter.'

As Shirone's approval fell, Valhalla Action began reversing cause and effect.

"It doesn't matter, as long as I can eliminate you."

That was the heart that threw away an entire life, which even Phiel had overlooked.

In other words, it was Shirone's whole heart.

Valhalla Action.

Photon Cannon.

Kuaaaaaaaaaang!

A flash exploded in front of Shirone.

If one were to observe the current scene from outside Heaven, the flash would surely be extending like a beam of light, but to everyone watching from close by, it simply seemed like a massive wall pushing forward.

"Kruuuuuk!"

With his neck grabbed, Phiel raised both hands to block his face.

But before astronomical mass being expelled at tremendous speed, even an archangel could only be helplessly overwhelmed.

Whooooooo!

First his left arm fell off, then his right arm and both legs were torn away simultaneously.

As his entire body disintegrated, the dark energy composing him rotated as if struggling, but even that lasted only an instant.

Eventually, before being pushed even 100 meters, Phiel had already become a handful of dust and vanished to the end of the world.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The Photon Cannon fired from Araboth in Heaven's center extended toward the fairy city of Maconom.

And from there again, destroying numerous districts, it pierced through Heaven's outer walls and disappeared into Purgatory.

"Ph-Phiel...?"

Satiel trembled.

Within the traces of the flash that had severed Heaven, not a trace of Phiel's presence could be found.

A human had annihilated an archangel.

A being of such low status as to be treated as a commoner in Heaven had trampled the highest existence of Heaven.

'I see. So Ra's will is ultimately...'

Satiel finally realized what Metatron had tried to say in his final moments.

'Humans have climbed up to our very throats.'

There was once a time when even Mara was treated as a god by humans. Also, all events occurring in Heaven were their mythology.

But now, the curtain of that mythology was about to be lifted.

'Satan.'

Satiel snapped to attention and looked toward Jebul.

With Phiel's annihilation, the law of evil would have become even stronger.

"I need to find Rayel!"

Kariel would be annihilated, and even Ikael was combat-incapable.

She had to gather as many angels as possible to at least prevent the situation from worsening further.

'Until Ra's will activates...!'

Having made her decision, Satiel glanced briefly at Ikael before spreading her wings of light and taking flight.

Kurrrrrrr.

As if proving her thoughts, she could see structures in distant Jebul breaking, snapping, and collapsing.

"Mere demons...!"

Murderous intent flashed in Satiel's eyes as she spotted something.

Metatron's enemy - within the gray smoke rising like clouds, a red mass of flesh was rising massively.
