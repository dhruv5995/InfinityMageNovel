[573] Reaction and Response (5)

As steam-like vapor rose from Frings' body, Dorothy canceled her victory pose and assumed a defensive stance.

'Hickory defense mode 100 percent.'

Sensing an unnaturally twisted hostility, Dorothy unconsciously activated her algorithm.

"Dorothy, you're a strange girl."

The moment she saw Frings' eyes as he rose to his feet, Dorothy's soul began screaming madly.

It was a coldness that shouldn't exist in this world.

"You seem like you're not thinking about anything, but you're actually thinking a lot. Tell me. How scared are you right now?"

Dorothy bit her lip until it bled.

"You're scared to death, aren't you? Afraid that I might kill you. Well, you're always terrified anyway."

"I'm... not thinking about anything."

"Is that so? Did you think I'd just let it slide if you said you weren't thinking about anything?"

Frings spread both hands in a levitating pose.

'Ice Demon.'

Behind him, dozens of hideous ice pillars like spider legs jutted out like blades.

'I'm going to die. I'm going to die.'

Dorothy's body trembled violently.

"That expressionless face is a mask to hide the appearance of a terrified child. Was an adult's body really that fascinating?"

Frings, the president of the Hide-and-Seek Research Club, had seen through Dorothy's life.

"Tell me. What kind of imagination are you having? What expression are you making?"

Dorothy's lips trembled.

"If you won't speak..."

Frings' mouth twisted grotesquely.

"I'll drag out the child inside you."

Dorothy's mind went pale and her entire body shuddered as if struck by lightning.

Mimesis Algorithm activated. Emergency escape.

As shock hit the mage's brain, Hickory automatically switched to auto mode, carrying Dorothy as they fled into the forest.

"..."

CRASH!

The Ice Demon's spikes shattered and fell to the ground.

"Heh heh heh."

Covering his face with his hand, Frings slowly reined in his killing intent.

"Too bad. I wanted to see her scream."

Having returned to his slimy expression, he held the Scramble in his hand and called "Pao," completing a three-part sequence (○●○).

'At least it's a decent hand to play with.'

After checking his Master Card status, he muttered while parting the bushes.

"Now, who shall I destroy?"

"Hah! Hah!"

Having entered the deep forest, Dorothy pressed her hand against a tree trunk and breathed heavily.

Hickory, released from the Mimesis Algorithm, was looking at her with a smiling face, but it didn't feel as pleasant as before.

"Ugh!"

Completely broken by Frings' chilling aura, she had fled without even thinking to steal his Scramble.

"What do I do..."

Dorothy sat down weakly and shed tears.

"He found out."

He had discovered it.

The child hiding inside an adult's body.

After checking his Master Card, Hersy looked at Shirone's current hand: ○●○●ⓡ.

'This is strange.'

It was a question that had been bothering him since Shirone defeated him with Kong yesterday.

The reason he had accepted Shirone's Kong while holding ●●●○ (Dictator) was because Shirone's hand appeared to be all ⓡⓡⓡⓡ.

If Dictator was also the second strongest hand in the 4th stage, there was no reason to call Pao.

But the result was ○●○● (Democracy).

Of course, opening four random cards and getting an equal ratio of white and black was probabilistically correct.

'No, probability isn't supposed to work like that.'

Something being too probabilistic gave him a non-probabilistic feeling instead.

'What Cayden said yesterday is also bothering me.'

He had also chosen random for the fifth card.

'It feels like he's not afraid of a full hand. If he messes up the build-up, he'll have no choice but to fold in the 6th stage.'

Having allies Kong each other to force folding was a situation where both sides had finished their experiments.

'Does he think hiding one card is more important than folding when Democracy is already revealed?'

Finishing his thoughts, Hersy sent a召集 signal.

His current hand was ●● (Heresy). It was a hand he wouldn't regret losing even if he folded for the sake of experimentation.

'Tomorrow, I'll eliminate Shirone from the game.'

Scramble Royale Day 3.

At the location where Scramble was summoned, Shirone met Cayden again.

'Of all people...'

Cayden's hand was ○○● (Religion).

He had chosen one ○ (White) and opened two ⓡⓡ (Random) cards to form this combination.

'It's a hand that's hard to develop.'

So from Shirone's perspective, it wasn't entirely a pleasant situation.

If Cayden called Kong, his own hand ●○●○● (Revolution) would be revealed, and from then on, he would inevitably draw suspicion.

"This will do."

Cayden held his cross sword vertically and said.

"Today I'll kill you."

Shirone was considerably relieved by Cayden's attitude of not even considering Kong.

'In some ways, that's impressive.'

Though their dispositions were different, Shirone felt he could see Rian in Cayden's stubbornness.

"Fate of the Red Cross."

Cayden placed his palm on the sword and muttered.

"Guide my talent."

As the blade glowed red-hot, Shirone's eyes widened.

'That's...'

"Mana Absorption."

The fire on the sword blazed intensely as Cayden charged forward.

'Magic Swordsman!'

It was a title that only someone of Cayden's caliber—positioned among the top students in the graduating class—could earn through magic alone.

"I don't know what secret you're hiding, but..."

The cross sword swept horizontally.

"I'll bury it along with your death."

A massive flame cloud rolled in like a tsunami, burning everything in Shirone's vicinity to the ground.

"Ugh!"

It was a Magic Swordsman technique he had never demonstrated at school before.

"Taha! Taha!"

Each time Cayden swung his sword, flame clouds six meters high rolled forward with reverse rotation.

The radius was so wide that it would be impossible to dodge without teleportation, and as Shirone retreated, lightning struck down from above his head with a crack.

'Lightning magic?'

The cross sword, charged with electricity, was driven vertically into the ground.

Magic Sword Technique: Lightning Impact.

As blue electricity spread like a spider web across the ground, Shirone's body convulsed.

'Shunpo!'

Simultaneously, the sequence formula entered the realm of transcendence.

1 second ago.

Magic Sword Technique: Lightning Impact.

The moment the electricity spread, Shirone leaped into the sky, causing Cayden to grind his teeth.

'I just can't understand it.'

This feeling again.

No matter how excellent a mage might be, Schema should dominate in the realm of physical technique and reflexes.

Moreover, the situation had been developing exactly as it should.

'What the hell is going on!'

No matter how much he racked his brain, he couldn't figure it out, because nothing was actually wrong.

"In that case...!"

Cayden contorted his face like a wolf and prepared his killing blow.

"Mana Enhancement!"

The cross sword vibrated, emitting powerful high-frequency waves.

It was a Kaiser-series technique, a type of sonic magic.

'You can use all types of magic?'

He was a different kind of genius from Fermi.

Cayden swung his sword toward the bewildered Shirone.

"Can you dodge sound too?"

BOOM!

The shockwave devastated the surroundings, but Shirone emerged through the blast wave completely unharmed.

'How?'

It wasn't space.

He had dodged time.

'I have no choice.'

As the Avatar of Light permeated Shirone, Cayden finally realized the true nature of his sixth sense.

'That's it. It's not luck. It's definitely some kind of technique.'

As the Photon Cannon compressed in his hand, golden afterimages identical to the Cheonsa spread like a fan from Shirone's body.

For the first time, Cayden, who had been launching fierce attacks, stepped backward in front of Shirone.

As Shirone closed the distance with teleportation and swung his hand holding the Photon Cannon, Cayden rotated his cross sword 180 degrees to defend with the flat side.

"Huh?"

Surprisingly, Shirone was approaching from the opposite side.

"Damn it!"

Cayden raised his Schema ability to maximum and defended at a terrifying speed, but Shirone had already naturally changed direction as if bending.

It wasn't that he had twisted his trajectory using magical ability, but rather a natural movement as if it had been predetermined from the start. This gave Cayden a startling insight that struck his mind.

'Could it be... time?'

The moment he thought this, Cayden's arm moved at a frightening speed.

"Graaah!"

Block, block, and block again.

In a split second, Cayden changed his defensive stance seven times. His physical abilities were fast enough that no mage could imitate them, but Shirone's Photon Cannon was leisurely closing the distance toward an undefendable point.

'This is like...'

At the end of his thoughts, Cayden was stunned.

'Infinity.'

It felt like infinite Shirones were rushing toward him.

BANG!

The Photon Cannon slammed into his side, and he heard the sound of ribs breaking.

"Gah!"

Cayden's eyes shook from the impact as he flew over ten meters and crashed into a wall.

"Graaaah!"

With broken bones, even Schema's regenerative power couldn't make immediate combat possible.

'I need to steal his Master Card!'

Shirone immediately ran toward Cayden.

Cayden hastily tried to stand up, but his legs gave out and he fell to one knee again.

'Let's knock him out.'

The moment the Photon Cannon formed in his hand, Cayden shouted with a contorted face.

"Shirone, Kong!"

Lulu's voice came through as an electrical signal.

"Cayden has called Kong."

If he didn't choose within 1 second, he would fold.

"Kong!"

Cayden's hand folded and Shirone's hand ●○●○● (Revolution) was revealed.

Moreover, the brief moment when he had to meet Kong with Kong decisively provided Hersy's team with an opportunity for reversal.

"Now!"

As Hersy shouted and burst out, Anchal, Eden, and Fisho simultaneously revealed themselves from all directions.

'It's Eden!'

Since stopping Eden's card collection was the top priority, Shirone hastily changed direction toward where the Scramble was.

The moment he grabbed the Scramble, Hersy shouted.

"Stop him before he opens!"

Anchal called Kong.

Her hand was ○○●○● (Emperor).

It was a higher hand than Revolution, and she folded while leaving one unopened ⓡ card.

Unopened random cards could neither influence nor be influenced by the game.

Since this was also a fact already verified through experimentation, Hersy, Eden, and Fisho simultaneously shouted without needing to check the Master Card.

"Shirone! Kong!"

If everyone called Kong, Shirone couldn't harm any of them.

'It's over! You're eliminated!'

It was the so-called "Kill Shirone" operation.

"You lost the Kong battle. Until the next Scramble summon, no harm can come to Shirone."

"What?"

Hersy thought there must be something wrong with his hearing and checked his Master Card.

'Extinction (●○●●○).'

"Wait. No, why is this?"

Cayden clutched his side and said.

"He controls time. That's his ability."

It felt like reality was being erased and a new reality was being born.

The reset couldn't be felt in the realm of thought, but the material evidence of the cards proved it was real.

'Time? Time?'

It was the first time in his life Hersy had such a dumbfounded expression, but he quickly came to his senses, looked around, and shouted.

"Run! Retreat!"

As everyone fled, the person Shirone targeted was Cayden.

Not only was he injured, but this was also a moment when he could vent the frustration he had been holding back.

At that moment, Eden ran over and blocked Shirone's path to Cayden, who still couldn't move his body.

'Saint Barrier!'

As the Spirit Zone emitted brilliant light and formed a defensive barrier, Shirone's brow furrowed, having heard about the ability from Iruki.

'I need more powerful force.'

The moment he opened his eyes wide and activated Immortal Function, the Photon Cannon shook as if dancing with madness.

Eden felt a chill for a moment but bit his lip again and prepared to withstand it.

'Photon Cannon!'

A flash of light nearly one meter in diameter instantly struck the Saint Barrier.

The spherical form that hadn't budged even against explosive magic dented like cotton, then the opposite side bulged and exploded with a pop.

"Kyaaaaa!"

As Eden's omnipotence was destroyed and he crouched on the ground clutching his head, everyone who had been fleeing turned around with horrified eyes.

"Eden's..."

Defensive magic had been penetrated.

It was a sight no one in the graduating class had ever seen.
