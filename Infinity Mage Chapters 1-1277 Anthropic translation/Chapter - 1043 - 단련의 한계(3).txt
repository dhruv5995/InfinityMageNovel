The Limits of Training (3)

"Big brother! Big brother!"

The Wizard shouted as she left the training ground, but Shirone seemed not to hear her and quickened his pace.

He arrived at the most secluded spot in the school, a place not made for rest.

Having lived in the mountains since childhood, Shirone always sought nature whenever he wanted to rest.

"Haah."

He sat on a small rock and exhaled, but couldn't expel the frustration in his heart.

'What would be the right thing to do?'

The Wizard's power was absolutely necessary to kill Satan Havitz, but 'what about the Wizard's life?'

It was a situation where a seven-year-old child had to kill the most evil and cruel being in the world.

Shirone let out a bitter laugh.

'Yeah, maybe I'm the one who's gone crazy.'

In fact, he had known this about himself from some point on, but this time was different.

"Big brother."

At the Wizard's voice, Shirone looked up.

She had probably followed him out of concern, but seeing her splinted arm only added to his guilt.

"You're badly hurt. Wizard, I have something to tell you..."

"I'm sorry, big brother."

The Wizard's eyes were glistening with tears.

"I didn't think about how mom and dad would hate it. Learning was so much fun, so I got too excited..."

'Fun?'

Shirone realized a fact he had forgotten.

'Ah, right.'

It was incredibly difficult and incredibly painful, but still, humans could endure it.

'As long as they're certain they can become stronger.'

Nothing more thrilling than that had been given to humans.

"Wizard, why is magic fun? Do you want to become the strongest in the world? Do you want to surpass me?"

"I want to surpass you. But winning doesn't matter anymore. Magic is just fun."

"There are many ways to be happy in this world. You could live joyfully without necessarily becoming the best. So why do you still want to learn magic?"

The Wizard blinked her eyes.

"Well, that's obviously..."

And as always, she spoke with the most innocent smile in the world.

"Because this is the world I'm going to live in."

Shirone felt a lump in his throat.

"Yeah, that's right."

No matter what others might criticize, this was the only world we had to live in.

Only we could understand ourselves.

"Today's training was a bit weak, wasn't it? I told mom and dad. It'll be fine from tomorrow."

"Haha!"

Shirone wiped away his tears.

Since diving into the world of magic, he had never experienced the two words called defeat, but...

"Yeah, let's grit our teeth and run."

It felt like all the resentment he had to suppress to achieve that one result was being comforted.

The Wizard approached Shirone and wiped the tears from his cheek with her small hand.

"It must be hard for you too, big brother."

Though it hadn't been long since they intensified the training, the Wizard's insight had grown quite deep.

"You've grown a lot. Being able to consider other people's hearts is an excellent talent."

"Hehe. So, big brother, are you and Amy in love?"

"Huh? Well..."

"Then if I become stronger than you later, will you like me more?"

'She's still just a child after all.'

Shirone said while suppressing his laughter.

"There are different kinds of liking. If you really do surpass me..."

If you become the world's greatest magician.

"Yeah, in some aspects, there might be cases where I'd treasure you more than Amy, don't you think?"

Though it was an adult's way of categorizing, the Wizard was delighted by the possibility.

"Great! Then I'll surpass you first thing tomorrow!"

"Ho, really?"

Shirone pulled the Wizard's broken arm and mended the bone with Miracle Stream.

The next day, the atmosphere in the training ground was cold.

Even after seeing yesterday's heartbreaking scene, the Wizard's parents insisted on observing.

"Phew, today's going to be brutal too."

While the teachers were already tense, Shirone and the Wizard stood in front of the Image Zone warming up.

"Real combat practice?"

"No. Today's basics."

The Wizard's determination gave Shirone sufficient courage, but he couldn't exclude the parents' position.

'Seeing their child in pain is the worst thing for parents. I was too thoughtless.'

No matter how much it was our world, he had to consider the feelings of those watching from outside.

"Today's lesson is Mental Pulsation."

It was the optimal training that wouldn't reduce intensity while not appearing too extreme.

"I'll show you a demonstration."

The Wizard, being naturally awakened, could cast instinctively but was ignorant about theory.

'That's actually more amazing, but to face Havitz, I need to teach everything I can.'

When the Wizard's creativity was bitten by Havitz's chaos, her body would remember this moment.

Shirone stood in the center of the Image Zone installed at Stang National Magic School.

Memories of training to improve grades in the graduating class flashed by like a revolving lantern.

'I should do well.'

When Mental Pulsation deployed without warning, the watching teachers' eyes widened.

"My, my goodness..."

In the Image Zone, the mind becomes visible, but the back-and-forth movement couldn't be seen.

'A huge sphere...? No, it's definitely going back and forth. The count keeps going up.'

The buzzer that rang each time it reached maximum radius echoed as if tearing the speakers.

'Mental pulsation 6,000 times per second.'

Even if he didn't know who the world's second-ranked magician was, it would be several times faster than them.

The Ten Great Magicians shook their heads.

'Can't match it.'

It was a natural result for someone who had mastered the techniques of the mind, but the problem was the Wizard.

'She can't even reach it, but even if she did, normally she'd die. The Five Great Stars are serious.'

When Bartok turned his head, the Wizard was watching the demonstration without even blinking.

"Aha."

The Ten Great Magicians all thought simultaneously.

'1 minute 17 seconds.'

That was the time it took for the Wizard, who knew nothing about basics, to understand after seeing 6,000 mental pulsations per second.

"Do you get it?"

Without needing any particular explanation, the Wizard nodded and entered the Image Zone.

"I'll try."

Shirone took a position next to Amy, and the Ten Great Magicians stood behind them.

It was training after all, but pure curiosity arose about how far she could go.

"Phew."

After taking a brief deep breath, she suddenly widened her eyes and deployed Spirit Zone.

The buzzer rang, and teachers and students fixed their gazes on her mental pulsation count.

Bartok's heart raced.

'800 times per second. Far beyond professional magician level. But the talent we want is at the level that reaches the end of the universe. This much won't...'

"Huh? Huuuh?"

At the same time students made expressions of shock, the mental pulsation count kept rising.

2,000 times per second.

The Wizard's pupils were vibrating frighteningly, but not to a size that exceeded the critical point.

'She's controlling it.'

The mental pulsation count continued to rise, and blood trickled down from the Wizard's nose.

"D-dear."

The Wizard's mother grabbed her husband's arm.

'Faster, faster.'

It was probably a level where she couldn't even feel the changes happening in her own body, just pure ascension.

When it exceeded 3,000 times per second, blood flowed from her eyes, and her mother couldn't bear it and ran to Shirone.

"Stop it! Our child will die!"

Bartok knew why Shirone remained silent.

'I am... a 1-star resident of the Ivory Tower.'

He had enough skill to be an association president in any kingdom, but above him were 2-star, 3-star, 4-star, and 5-star.

'Why wouldn't I have wished for it? Why wouldn't I have craved it? But it's not a place you can go just because you want to.'

The Wizard's father said.

"Please stop now. As we said yesterday, our daughter's safety is our top priority."

Bartok thought.

'You don't know.'

How desperately crazy those immersed in this world are to become stronger.

Mental pulsation 4,000 times per second.

'I don't want to beat someone. I don't want to become strong to gain something. I just become stronger. The fact that my existence endlessly rises is so happy in itself.'

In other words.

'All humans...'

The Wizard's eyes filled with intense focus.

"Kyaaaah!"

Mental pulsation 5,000 times per second.

'I can become stronger. I can do better. I believe it. The moment I doubt, I'll break.'

Pure tears mixed with the bloody tears.

'I want to... fly in the sky.'

The Wizard's Spirit Zone, having reached its limit, began to collapse in a distorted form.

"If you lose the rhythm, it's over."

Shirone said.

"Your thinking is rigid. Let everything go. The desire to be acknowledged, the obsession that you must succeed, let it all go and focus on the present. Don't converge your thoughts, but burst yourself out with the feeling of radiating."

"Uaaaah!"

When mental pulsation reached 6,000 times per second, Shirone felt thrilling chills.

'She understands immediately and switches her mental state.'

It wasn't jealousy he felt, but rather emotion like watching a work of art.

But to others, it was a horrific sight of a seven-year-old child bleeding from her eyes, nose, and mouth.

"Magician."

The Wizard's mother said tearfully.

"Please stop now. I beg you. I know our child has talent. But... what meaning is there in succeeding while doing this?"

"Talent, you say?"

Shirone spoke for the first time.

"Do you think that child is enduring all that pain right now because she has talent? If you think so, you're being incredibly rude to the Wizard."

"B-but..."

"Yes, the Wizard is a genius. Maybe something called talent exists. But mother."

Shirone looked back at her.

"There's no such thing as talent for doing something well without effort in this world."

With a force different from yesterday, the mother closed her mouth.

"All humans are the same. When pricked with a needle, does a genius hurt less? No. It's just a difference in how they understand that pain, how they digest it. Are you looking at the Wizard's talent? I see the opposite. What I see is that a mere seven-year-old, to reach her current level..."

Shirone turned his gaze to the Wizard.

"Only the amount and magnitude of pain she had to digest from inside her mother's womb."

How much must that fetus have cried to organize those impossible feelings?

"Our daughter..."

The mother made a tearful face.

"You said you're farmers."

Shirone said with apologetic emotion.

"I don't know much, but I heard farmers remove rotten rice seeds in advance. But their hearts probably aren't good about it. The work of nurturing great life sometimes has to be cruel."

The father's eyes changed.

"We can't make you understand our world. Just as others can't know a farmer's world exactly, neither can we. But within it, we dream and compete. To us, that's the only real world."

It was the same for everyone.

"The Wizard wants to be the best. Not because she has talent, but because the magnitude of pain she's endured won't tolerate her current position. That's why the moment she met me, she threw everything away."

Shirone pleaded.

"Please leave her to me. If I judge that the Wizard truly can't endure it, I'll stop."

"But even now she's bleeding like that..."

"You stay quiet."

The husband who stopped his wife said to Shirone.

"I understand what you mean. I'm a man too. I've dreamed of climbing to the top of the world at least once. But you're saying our daughter will become the best?"

"Yes. If she can endlessly digest pain like this, she'll become that before long."

The father looked at the Wizard.

His eyes grew hot seeing her gritting her teeth and enduring while bleeding from her eyes.

'Damn it! Yeah, she'd want to fly. Dad wanted to fly too. So do it to your heart's content. Dad will protect you.'

Closing his eyes tightly, he bowed his head and shouted.

"Please take good care of her!"
