**Clan of Darkness (3)**

A man wearing a fedora and glasses took one last look around before entering through the back door of the blood bank.

The man who matched exactly the description given by the gang leader was named Tempest.

Like the vampire who had attacked the Balk family, he was of the Almas rank.

As Ryan watched from around the corner, the man opened the door and passed straight through the wall without opening it.

'Definitely a vampire.'

After staying in position for about a minute, Ryan slowly moved closer to the back door.

'This is troublesome.'

Ryan didn't have a key.

Gently grasping the steel door's handle, Ryan gradually increased the strength in his arm.

"Hmph."

*Crack*, the metal twisted and the door opened.

'Did they hear that?'

He carefully pushed the door open and checked inside, but felt no presence.

Relying on his experience-honed instincts, he entered to find a corridor stretching to the end of the building.

Only some of the crystal lamps were lit, and following the dark corridor, he could see light in the distance.

'Blood refrigerator.'

Reading the sign, he peered through the door to see specially treated blood packs stored by type.

As the vampire turned toward the door, Ryan quickly pressed his back against the wall.

'He didn't notice.'

Speed alone isn't the only measure of strength.

'There was no presence.'

Ryan's tailing was so slow that it didn't even disturb the air flow—a considerable level of skill.

'Not the highest level yet.'

Though he wasn't satisfied with his current level, it was sufficient to deceive enemies.

When Tempest opened the lid of the metal box, blood packs were neatly stacked inside.

After scanning with his eyes, he placed a bag beside him and began transferring the packs one by one.

"What are you scheming?"

Finally, Ryan turned and stood in the doorway, causing Tempest's movements to freeze.

But he soon regained his composure and continued his work without even turning around.

"So you're the one who interfered with Masker."

That must be the name of the vampire who attacked the Balk family, which meant only one conclusion.

"Are you also an Almas?"

"I'm called Tempest. I've been around for quite a while. In the darkness, of course."

"I have no intention of getting involved in vampire society."

Ryan gripped the greatsword on his back.

"But I can't allow harm to come to humans. Surrender quietly and you won't suffer."

"Harm?"

Tempest smiled with his eyes.

"Just as humans eat to live, we crave blood to survive. To express it with disgust, like mosquitoes. Humans kill mosquitoes, but they don't feel guilt about it."

Ryan had encountered countless beliefs while crossing the desert.

'It's always like this.'

There were very few cases where he could find the right answer, and the result always belonged to the victor.

"I don't want to think about it in a complicated way. You've killed humans and will kill more, so I'm arresting you."

"Is that so?"

Having put the blood packs in his bag, he turned around.

"I heard the story. They say you fight like a Hunter. But do you know where this is?"

"A blood bank."

"Exactly."

Tempest's pupils contracted vertically.

"How are you going to catch me?"

Throwing the remaining blood packs from the box at Ryan, he moved as fast as teleportation.

As Ryan's sword cut through the packs, blood splattered horizontally along the blade's trajectory.

'I won't miss.'

In a situation without interference, even an Almas-rank vampire was one step below Ryan.

The greatsword flashed like lightning, and Tempest's left arm separated with a wet sound.

"Krrgh!"

Tempest finally realized the severity of the situation.

'That's a strange sword.'

Half-soul vampires have 50% immunity to physical attacks.

But just as Masker had said, the incarnation technique didn't work on the sword Ryan wielded.

"But...!"

Biting into a blood pack, blood gushed out and Tempest's lips turned red.

'Powerful regeneration!'

Viscous blood bubbled from the severed arm and instantly regenerated the body.

"I'm invincible in this place!"

Tempest charged forward bravely, turning the interior of the cold storage into chaos.

'This is annoying.'

Ryan cut Tempest several times, but the body that had absorbed blood showed no signs of breaking down.

'Damn! Is he really human?'

Meanwhile, Tempest was also experiencing firsthand what Masker had said about Ryan not seeming human.

'I need to retreat for now.'

Just as Tempest's body dissolved into black smoke and headed toward the door...

'Now!'

Ryan, charging with Axing's power, stabbed the greatsword into the center of the only remaining torso.

"Kraaaaah!"

Tempest's smoke regained physical form and was pinned to the wall with his heart pierced.

"If I block the blood circulation, regeneration is impossible."

"Kukuku."

Tempest grabbed the greatsword with both hands.

"You still can't kill me. There's plenty of blood, so try staying like that all night."

A voice came from outside the door.

"How about this?"

With a *click*, something was embedded in Tempest's neck.

"Kuk! This is..." It was a small syringe.

"What?"

When Ryan turned his head, a middle-aged gentleman with a thin mustache entered carrying a medical bag.

"Don't move. If you pull out the sword, the heart will start beating again."

After giving this warning, the middle-aged gentleman cleared the blood packs from the table and opened his bag.

While he mixed three drugs on the spot and drew them into a syringe, two figures entered the warehouse.

A large man and a silver-haired woman.

Ryan noted that the woman had silver hair.

"It's complete. Now I just need to inject..."

As the middle-aged gentleman approached, removing air from the syringe, Tempest seemed to realize something and shouted.

"Hunter?"

Then he struggled violently.

"No! Not that! Anything but that!"

With his heart stopped, he couldn't muster any strength.

"Vampire-specific blood coagulant. It only takes 5 minutes to detoxify, but in this state, that's plenty."

"You bastards! Let me go! I'll kill you! I'll suck all your blood dry!"

"Now, now! Stay still. It's going to hurt tremendously."

The middle-aged gentleman roughly jabbed the syringe into the collarbone area, causing Tempest to scream.

"Kraaaaaaaah!"

As the injection was administered, a noticeable change occurred.

'He's disintegrating.'

Purple veins appeared like a net on Tempest's pale skin, then the skin became dry and flaked off like dead skin.

"Kraaaaah..."

Then, as if cooked by heat, his entire body dried up, turned to ash, and fell to the floor.

The large man who had followed the middle-aged gentleman, carrying a huge gun on his shoulder, looked at Ryan.

"What about you? How did you know to come here?"

Before he could answer, the silver-haired woman raised her thin sword and charged.

"Move aside. I have to kill him."

Ryan activated Axing and hastily stepped back, while his companions narrowed their eyes and watched.

"What? Why is he moving like that?"

The silver-haired woman pointed her sword.

"He's a vampire. Kill him."

Ryan roughly understood the situation.

'This is getting complicated.'

Axing certainly resembled vampire movements, and more importantly, she was the person who had confirmed Ryan's death.

"It's a misunderstanding. I'm human."

"Nonsense!"

As the silver-haired woman ran along the wall, the large man aimed his gun forward.

"This should do it, right?"

With a thunderous roar, bullets were fired, and Ryan simultaneously raised his arm to block them.

With *thud thud* sounds, pellets embedded in his muscle.

"Krgh!"

"He blocked it with his body?"

At this sight, the large man lowered his gun, and the woman running on the wall also landed at a midpoint.

"Hrrrgh!"

Hearing Smile's phantom voice, Ryan flexed his arm and the pellets *popped* onto the floor.

They were made of silver.

"What? Are you actually enduring it?"

Being hit by silver bullets would make recovery impossible for several minutes, even with Almas-level powerful regeneration.

"It doesn't work on me. Because I'm human."

The large man shook his head.

"No, if you were human, you'd already be dead."

The middle-aged gentleman, who had gone to check outside, returned and gestured to his companions.

"Let's get out of here first. The 'Guards' are coming."

Ryan frowned.

"Guards? The Royal Guard?"

He had heard that it took time to organize a mobile unit.

'There's something I don't know.'

The large man pointed at Ryan with his thumb.

"What about this guy?"

The silver-haired woman approached Ryan closely.

"You're not a vampire?"

"As you can see... well, I can't prove it, but I find drinking blood disgusting."

To her eyes, Ryan's face had a living complexion, unlike yesterday when his heart had stopped.

"Zenia, aren't you mistaken? If he were a vampire, you should be able to sense the wavelength."

The silver-haired woman, Zenia, bit her lip.

"That's the problem—I can't sense it."

The middle-aged gentleman made the decision.

"Then he's human. Are we taking him or not? If we get tangled up with the Royal Palace, things get complicated."

Though they were vampire hunters, they weren't exactly using legal methods either.

Zenia turned and spoke to Ryan.

"If you're truly innocent, follow us. We can find out by investigating at headquarters."

"I'll do that."

Ryan had no intention of staying here either.

"However, if it turns out you are a vampire..."

Crossing the threshold, Zenia said coldly:

"I'll kill you myself."

The Royal Guard surrounded the blood bank.

"The door is broken!"

"Go in! Annihilate the vampires!"

Ten minutes later, the troops who had searched inside approached the 3rd Unit Commander of the Guards.

"We found traces of vampires. But... they had already disintegrated into ash."

"Damn! Hunters again?"

"How do they always find out and get there first? This operation was perfectly classified."

"I don't know. There are rumors of other vampires too. Anyway, withdraw. Close the blood bank for the time being."

"Yes!"

From the rooftop of a building 100 meters away, Ryan was looking at the blood bank.

'It must have been a secret operation.'

He could picture Benov throwing a fit tomorrow morning.

The middle-aged gentleman asked:

"You don't seem to be from the Royal Palace either, so where did you hear about the blood bank?"

"Just here and there."

There didn't seem to be a need to reveal the details.

"We're Hunters. Called the Genocide Team. You could say we're the last vampire hunters remaining in Rodenin."

'Genocide.'

The team name was meaningful.

"I'm Katein, a drug specialist. This big guy is Gunner Fauler. And this is Zenia, swordsman and leader of Genocide."

Zenia, with her silver hair cut in a bob, had a sharp chin and thin eyebrows, giving her a prim impression.

"Hmm, we're introducing ourselves when we don't even know his identity yet."

Katein interrupted:

"What's your name?"

"Ryan. Ozent Ryan."

Zenia looked at Ryan with a surprised expression.

"The Knight of Maha?"

In cases like this, having a known name was convenient.

"That's what they seem to call me."

Since demons appeared in the world, there was a rumor that any swordsman had heard at least once.

A mythical story about one swordsman crossing the desert alone, cutting down demons.

'This man...'

He was much younger than she had imagined.

"But!"

Zenia's voice trembled.

"You took a charging attack! Your heart couldn't have withstood it. No, you definitely weren't breathing..."

"It's a long story."

At least not something to discuss before dawn.

"Let's go back for now. Let's leave it to Doctor Grain."

Someone who studied biological anomalies would be able to provide answers.

Zenia made a groaning sound and turned around.

"Follow me. I'll show you our hideout."
