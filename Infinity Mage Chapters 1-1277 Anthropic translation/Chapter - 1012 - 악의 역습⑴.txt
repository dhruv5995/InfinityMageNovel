The Counterattack of Evil (1)

Even without knowing Shirone's true identity, those waiting for him were the kingdom's highest official and the Ten Circles of Magic.

Either way, they were figures a magic school teacher couldn't treat carelessly, but Wizard was being stubborn.

"I want to go say hello! Hurry, hurry!" The teacher's blood ran cold.

"Wizard, those people are very busy. Instead of that, why don't you play with teacher? Yes, shall we draw pictures?"

"No! I'm going! I'm going to go!" Perhaps if she were an ordinary child, the teacher wouldn't have tried so hard to stop her.

But Wizard had never shown social courtesy in front of anyone.

Not even when the king came to visit.

'She pulled His Majesty's beard. No, that was actually fine. He dotes on Wizard more than anyone.'

Being a mage herself, she knew the influence that the stars of the Ivory Tower wielded over the kingdom.

"Huh?"

Suddenly the teacher's legs floated up and she was pulled forward by Wizard's hand.

Shirone's eyes changed.

'Gravity Collapse.'

Not a consciously cast spell, but a phenomenon naturally manifested through synesthetic thinking.

'Her potential is humanity's strongest...'

As Rampa's words suddenly made sense, Wizard arrived sliding across the ground.

"Who is big brother?"

With her abundant blonde hair braided thickly on both sides, the faint freckles on her nose bridge were cute.

'This is more serious than expected.'

Though he didn't want to use the word madness, her eyes were different from other children.

'She's already aware of her own strength. Even knowing she's hated, she finds joy in watching people unable to do anything about it and struggle helplessly.'

A child who could defeat adults.

'When this simple interest combines with pleasure and amplifies to near infinity...'

Does she become Harvits?

Though his thoughts were serious and extreme, Shirone smiled and returned her greeting.

"Hello? Big brother is the kingdom's inspector."

"What's an inspector?"

"Someone who checks if students are doing well and if they have any difficulties. Including you, of course."

"Hmm."

As Wizard seemed to be losing interest, Shirone asked a personally curious question.

"How's school life? Is magic fun?"

"Yes! It's fun!"

Being simple, her emotional shift was quick.

"Wizard beats big brothers and big sisters! I beat teachers too, and I beat all the uncles here!"

As she pointed past Rampa to each member of the Ten Circles, the teacher's face reddened.

"I'm sorry! She's still young..."

It was a convenient excuse, but Wizard didn't stop there and pointed at Shirone.

"And I beat big brother too."

As the Ten Circles' expressions hardened, Shirone tilted his head curiously.

"Big brother is also a mage, right? Kingdom inspector mage."

Rampa's eyes narrowed.

'When the Five Great Stars conceal their aura, even my discerning eye cannot gauge their level. Truly a fearsome talent.'

Shirone readily admitted it.

"That's right, big brother is also a mage. Like Wizard, I've been studying magic diligently since I was young."

Wizard made an exaggerated laughing gesture.

"Big brother is super weak though."

Trusting her feelings as they were might be proof that despite her abilities, she was still pure, but...

"Wizard is strong. This strong."

The way she drew a large circle with both arms, as if their shortness was limiting, gave off a beastly impression.

She won't be easy to handle, Shirone thought as he casually brought up a topic.

"Yes, Wizard is really good. But there are many people in the world who are even better."

As if her soul had left and only a shell remained, the life disappeared from Wizard's eyes.

"I win. I'm strong."

"Really? Hmm, then what do you think would happen if Wizard lost? Would you get really angry or sad?"

At that moment.

"I said I win! I'm going to beat everyone!"

Rage that had been hiding somewhere exploded through the child's throat.

"Go away! I hate you! Hmph! Hmph!"

After expressing maximum hostility, she suddenly grabbed a handful of dirt and threw it at Shirone.

"Wizard!"

Unlike the pale teachers, Shirone didn't even flinch and continued speaking.

"I understand. Then since Wizard says she can beat everyone, will you show big brother once?"

"Yeah, good! Game! Game!"

Wizard, familiar with tests since birth, turned toward the practice field.

"No, not a game. With real magic." The teachers' eyes widened, and even the official who had been listening with difficulty turned his head.

"Um, even so, actual combat is..."

"It's fine. She has sufficient skill. How about it, Wizard? Can you still win?"

"Good. I'm going to beat everyone anyway. Let's do it."

As Shirone nodded, Bartok, leader of the Ten Circles, stepped forward.

"Then I'll be your opponent."

The teachers doubted their ears when they heard this.

"What?"

Recalling what kind of existence a star of the Ivory Tower was, they rushed over shouting.

"You can't! She's still just a child! Please let us do it instead!"

The dedicated teacher pleaded with Shirone.

"Inspector! I'll take responsibility for Wizard's rudeness. Please stop this."

Shirone's thought was...

'Mr. Bartok will test Wizard.'

This should be a good match.

'The teachers are terrified. Even teaching her closely, they don't know her true nature.'

Shirone spoke up.

"I'd prefer if you didn't go easy on her because she's young."

"But still..."

Though the teachers' gazes turned disgusted, Bartok grasped the true meaning.

'To that extent, huh.'

Of course he'd expected it, but hearing it from Shirone's mouth made him feel fired up for the first time in a while.

Rampa mediated the atmosphere.

"Then I'll referee. The match time is 3 minutes. However, if a dangerous situation arises, I'll intervene directly."

Only after hearing words from a 3rd-class resident of the Ivory Tower did the teachers emerge from their panic state.

"3 minutes, just endure for 3 minutes..." Meanwhile, Amy frowned.

'At the stars' level, 3 minutes is enough time to do everything. In the end, Mr. Rampa is also showing favoritism to Shirone.'

Arriving at the center of the training ground, Bartok observed Wizard with cold eyes.

'Synesthetic thinking.'

What humans consider sacred creative thinking was merely basic logic to Wizard.

'If she can create all solutions...'

Bartok's eyes bulged as flames shot up from underground.

'Then with no correct answer at all!'

An endlessly growing pillar of fire twisted in mid-air and rushed toward Wizard.

'Crush her with power!'

As the training ground blazed with massive flames, the teachers screamed in horror.

The dedicated teacher shrieked at Rampa.

"This isn't what was promised! How can you do this to a child! I'm going to sue you people!"

No one paid her any attention.

Not Shirone, not Amy, not Rampa - they were all following the two shadows moving within the flames.

"There was a solution after all."

To Rampa's words, Shirone replied.

"I should say she found it. This happened outside the limits of Mr. Bartok's thinking."

At the point where his confident strike ended in futility, the match between the two was neck and neck.

'This is ridiculous.'

When blocking magic coming from all directions, tension would rise to the top of his head, but...

"Bang bang! Bang bang, bang bang!"

Occasionally when the enemy's face came into view, he couldn't tell if this was reality or illusion.

He understood the students' feelings, but for a star of the Ivory Tower, emotions couldn't be a variable.

"Let me show you an adult's way."

As he extended his hand outside his robe, the jewel embedded in his glove's back radiated light.

"Spirit's Essence."

The Ten Circles possessed a full 10 out of the 17 that existed in the world.

"Earth's Stirring."

Rumble rumble rumble!

The earth shook and land rose from all sides, rushing toward Wizard like waves.

Rampa's expression hardened for the first time.

'Dangerous!'

The form where all possibilities of the earth element were aggressively integrated resembled a catastrophe.

"Huh? Huh?"

The earth that had trapped Wizard and formed a dome began shrinking rapidly like a deflating balloon.

"This is..."

Just as Rampa was about to act, thousands of small bubbles popped out from the dome's surface.

"Huh?"

And the next moment, the earth exploded into pieces with a tremendous roar.

"Yaaaah!"

With Wizard revealed at the center, convection was visibly rotating around her.

Shirone said.

"Technique isn't everything. Properties, power, even the principles of nature..."

Things that can be created through creative thinking.

"I'm going to win!"

As her desire manifested synesthetically, dozens of hybrid magics that defied common sense rushed forth.

'Damn! What is that?'

Heat, gravity, fluid, elasticity, electromagnetic force, hardness, friction - countless elements were being used in forms he'd never seen before.

'Marvelous.'

Rather than worry about death, the pleasure of having his thinking limits destroyed was 10,000 times stronger.

As a flash of light carried him away, the hybrid magics crashed into the ground.

BOOOOM!

Dust clouds rose, and Bartok, caught by Rampa, landed next to the group.

"Where's Wizard?"

She emerged through the smoke and ran to Bartok, wiggling her bottom.

"Yay! I won! I won!"

Though the teachers tried to restrain her, this time she was quite angry and wouldn't stop.

"Stupid. Stupid. Hmph!"

"Wizard, that's enough now. You're being worse than usual."

Bartok stood up.

"No, I lost."

Though everyone present knew this fact, hearing it from the person involved was still shocking.

"I'm sorry, Lord Rampa. Teaching Wizard seems to be beyond my capabilities."

"No need for that. I was surprised too. Anyway, the situation has become difficult."

Turning his gaze, he could see the official's shoulders trembling as he faced away toward the trees.

'This is huge.'

He was breathless with adrenaline.

'A seven-year-old beat a star. Stang Kingdom going to the holy war isn't just a dream. Ivory Tower or whatever, I absolutely have to have her. The parents are just stupid farmers anyway - I should just pay money and adopt her myself...'

Seeing clearly what thoughts were brewing, Rampa sighed and turned his head.

'We should have brought her three years ago.'

At that time, it had been a prolonged debate even among the principle-obsessed Ivory Tower's internal affairs department.

Of course, given that Shirone, who ultimately became a star, was one of the Four Great Transcendents, their decision had proven correct again, but...

'People need to have flexibility. What harm would there be in picking two? Getting obsessed with Kar...'

Feeling regretful was unavoidable.

"Can't be helped."

Shirone, patting Rampa's back in comfort, approached where Wizard was.

"You're really good at magic, Wizard."

"Yeah! Much better than big brother."

Wizard, still holding a grudge, lifted her chin that didn't even reach Shirone's waist.

"Wow, really? Then how about one last match with big brother this time?"

The moment the Ivory Tower stars all turned their heads, the dedicated teacher protested.

"Enough already! Just because a child threw some dirt, is this really worth tormenting her so persistently? Her skills were proven in the previous match."

"Of course. I'm sorry. But there are circumstances. This isn't good for Wizard either as things stand."

"What do you mean..."

Rampa interrupted.

"If Lord Shirone wishes to do it, I cannot stop it. However, I don't think I can referee."

"It's fine. I can control it."

The teacher frowned.

"What exactly are you talking about? Even a star of the Ivory Tower couldn't win, so how could the inspector... Huh? Shirone?" Though they might not know his face, anyone involved in magical society knew this name.

"What! Shirone!"

Amid the murmuring, Rampa spoke.

"Sorry for not revealing it earlier, but won't you entrust Wizard to us one more time? There won't be any danger. We already have the royal castle's approval."

The official, receiving the dedicated teacher's gaze, nodded while squinting one eye.

'Really? Is this person really Shirone?'

Countless titles flashed through his mind: the Infinite Mage, one of the Ivory Tower's Five Great Stars, the Yahweh of the Age.

"Oh? Strong."

At the voice, he turned his head to see Wizard looking at Shirone with curiosity.

"Big brother, you suddenly became strong."
