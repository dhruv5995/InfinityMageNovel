12 O'Clock, 12 Nations (3)

The Jincheon Empire sector sealed off the corridors with an unprecedented security level.

"Your Imperial Majesty!"

Jingang, struck by Moon Kingdom's curse, collapsed coughing up blood before he could reach his bedchamber.

"What happened!"

Dozens of physicians rushed to examine his condition, all reaching the same conclusion.

"His energy has weakened. This is not a normal pulse. He has fallen victim to the enemy's sorcery."

"How can you call that an explanation! The world's strongest Jincheon falling to mere energy manipulation! And you call yourselves...!"

"Enough."

Jingang rose from his bed.

"Your Majesty, you must rest." Those struck by curses suffer disrupted metabolism and in severe cases may be possessed by evil spirits.

"I said I'm fine."

Though Jingang's face was equally pale, his eyes blazed with intensity.

"Curse magic... what filthy methods they use."

Since Jincheon's roots lay in Moon Kingdom, they shared much understanding of sorcery.

"Curse, curse magic?"

The officials' faces reddened.

"It must be Moon Kingdom! Only Moonryong could commit such shameless acts!"

Jingang calmly walked over and sat in his chair.

'Why couldn't they block it?'

Though not as advanced as Moon Kingdom, Jincheon had plenty of sorcery experts.

'They penetrated all magical defenses and struck me directly. Impossible with human power alone.'

It must be the work of the other world.

"Your Majesty."

Having heard the news, Anchae of the Jincheon Space Agency prostrated herself before Jingang.

"Please allow me to die."

As head of the department responsible for intercepting otherworldly threats, she could not escape responsibility.

Jingang did not blame her.

"Report."

"We confirmed abnormal demonic activity in a specific region of hell. Estimated approximately one hour ago, but the Jincheon Space Agency only detected it seven minutes ago."

"Hmm."

Since Jinseong was connected to Gwangcheon Star, Jincheon could investigate the other world.

Of course, like observing planets in other galaxies, it was limited to mathematical data.

'Gwangcheon Star has technical limitations. Perhaps we should consider detecting it in 53 minutes quite remarkable.'

Still, one hour.

'I don't know if it was pre-arranged, but I can't shake the feeling it was rushed. And if it involves the other world... we cannot exclude Harvitz.'

'In other words, the result of Satan's impulsive nature. A cornered rat biting the cat.'

Jingang spoke.

"Since the enemy drew their sword first, we must respond accordingly. Anchae, you must handle this."

"...Yes."

Though director of the Jincheon Space Agency, when she removed her eyepatch, she was the strongest spy with demonic eyes.

A physician advised.

"Your Majesty, please rest now. We will find a way to break the curse somehow."

"No. That won't be necessary."

Rising from his seat, Jingang drew the imperial sword and looked around at those present.

He exhaled deeply, but his frustration didn't dissipate and instead twisted his insides.

"Cough!"

As he staggered, coughing up blood again, the physicians jumped up in alarm.

"Your Majesty!"

Jingang pointed his sword at them, blocking their approach.

"Don't come near."

A ghost?

Jingang's face contorted grotesquely, and a demon's visage flickered like an afterimage.

"Keke. Kekekeke."

"Your, Your Majesty..."

"Moonryong, you think you can kill me?"

Clutching his chest as if tearing at it, bloody tears streamed down his eyes in straight lines.

'My daughter is in hell. In eternal torment with no escape, no end... A father's heart is...'

"I am the ghost! My heart is hell itself!"

The shimmering heat around Jingang filled the room like thick smoke.

Anchae's single eye widened.

'Extreme energy.'

There seemed to be a rotting stench, and the piercing screams of ghosts followed.

"I'll devour them all! Demons, gods - I'll chew them up without leaving a bone fragment!"

As blood vessels bulged across Jingang's face, the officials cried out in tears.

"Your Majesty, please calm yourself! You must not harm the imperial body! Please...!"

Anchae stopped the officials.

"Wait!"

"What are you saying, Director? At this rate, His Majesty will be in danger!"

"Just... wait a moment."

Beyond Jingang staggering in his extreme state, a ghost's face was revealed.

'It's suffering.'

The strongest curse - a maiden's resentment combined with hell's demons - was wailing.

Anchae shouted.

"Your Majesty, overcome it! It makes no sense for Jincheon's emperor to fall to a ghost!"

"Director!"

"His Majesty's judgment is correct. If you cannot control your mind, the ghost's resentment will only grow stronger."

"Then shouldn't we stop it now?"

"Resentment is an emotion that cannot be endured without blaming someone. Therefore, a ghost whose grievances remain unresolved will seek new targets. The first to be struck is... the one who cast the curse, the shaman. Depending on the circumstances when the spell was cast, it won't end there. The enraged ghost will harm everyone present at the time, until its resentment is resolved."

The officials finally understood.

"You don't mean...?"

"Yes. During my intelligence activities, Moon Kingdom's fortune-tellers called this phenomenon..."

Anchae said.

"Reverse Kill."

Around midnight.

Seventeen thousand fairies were stationed at the entrance to the forest called Green Ocean.

Deep within that forest, at the edge of primeval waters untouched by human feet, lay the elves' homeland.

"This is troublesome."

The fairy with rainbow-colored wings was 1.5 times larger than other fairies.

Though still much smaller than humans, his aura was massive as a mountain.

Fairy King Crown.

The supreme being at the top of the 72 fairy ranks, and the only male-bodied fairy.

'A spirit possessing the concept of supremacy.'

The fairies knew.

'For as long as water existed in lakes, wind blew through valleys, and fire boiled in lava, Crown has reigned in the highest place.'

Now that even Ikael had abandoned heaven, it was natural for him to seek kingship himself.

A mid-ranking member of the 72 orders reported.

"Crown, the scouting party has arrived."

Fairies in cute camouflage uniforms with fierce makeup flew to Crown.

"We found the elf fortress. They're establishing defensive positions, but we can guide you there immediately."

Crown stroked his chin.

"Hmm."

Though beautiful like a boy, the bearing of one who had lived through eons was ingrained in him.

'We've chased them and finally cornered them here. But elves in the forest are on another level entirely.'

Moreover, it was the world's largest forest, making it an impregnable fortress from the fairies' perspective.

'The Fire Clan's abilities and Small World Creation are also troublesome. We'll have to prepare for total annihilation.'

Then thunder roared from the sky.

"An ambush?"

As all fairies looked up, a flash of light landed before them.

"Uh..."

The massive archangel who overwhelmed the fairies stood with arms crossed.

Uriel.

"Crown."

While no angel possessed authority equal to Ikael's, Uriel was different.

"Archangel of Destruction."

To avoid being destroyed, Crown immediately descended and bowed his head.

The supreme spirit became displeased.

'A proud archangel seeking us out. Even Ikael has already abandoned heaven.'

Uriel's words shattered Crown's doubts.

"I need your help."

"Pardon?"

A request rather than a command was unprecedented in heaven's history.

'What's happening here?'

Under the suspicious gazes of seventeen thousand fairies, Uriel waited for an answer.

In the deepest darkness of night.

At the truth the Vatican desperately wanted to hide - 'Heaven's Village' - Shirone's group waited.

"Mica."

Melkidu does not exist.

There must be a reason the Catacombs led by Kigolgi kidnapped Seina.

"Lamie is the world's largest religion. And Satanism has been growing in power under that great shadow. What happens when the shadow disappears? Satanism will be wiped out."

This was Iruki's opinion.

Though it certainly made sense, Shirone couldn't shake an uneasy feeling.

'Is that really all there is to it?'

Perhaps because Kigolgi was his demon.

"Mica."

Melkidu does not exist.

Every thirty minutes, Shirone summoned Mica to check if Melkidu had materialized.

'Mica only extracts information about specific keywords. It cannot detect automatically.'

When Shirone wasn't calling, Mica was merely a nameless portrait.

As dawn approached, Shirone spoke.

"Mica."

Melkidu has materialized.

As Shirone jumped up, Iruki, Nade, and Eden intuited immediately.

"Found it?"

Shirone asked Mica.

'Where?'

It is here.

'What do you mean?'

No matter how much Shirone looked around, Heaven's Village showed no particular changes.

Melkidu is currently detected as existing everywhere in phase space at this time.

'Then there are people who entered?'

From the point location detection became possible until now, a total of four people worldwide have entered.

Shirone had an intuition.

'Something they have that I don't.'

Negative energy.

'Mica, can you copy and transmit the psychological state of those who entered Melkidu?'

If his hypothesis was correct.

Value judgment of psychological states is impossible. Copying brainwaves is possible.

'That's enough.'

As soon as he finished speaking, someone's brainwaves overlaid Shirone's brain.

"Ugh."

Of course, having identical brainwaves didn't reconstruct the experiences that person had.

What Shirone could feel were murky desires and an even greater anxiety.

"Shirone, over there..."

Where Nade pointed, they could see a black space emitting gray smoke.

"Right. That's probably Melkidu. It revealed itself sensing my negative energy."

Eden asked.

"How did you do it?"

"Murder. I just killed someone." That's what the brainwaves indicated.

Though his friends couldn't readily understand, Shirone began walking instead of explaining.

"Let's go in. You'll understand when we get there."

Shirone's group thrust themselves into the absorbing black space.

Crossing the boundary, they saw human silhouettes running through thick mist.

'Criminals from around the world.'

Each time they breathed the smoke, voices echoed in their minds.

Someone help me! I don't want to go to prison!

This was a mistake! I didn't mean to kill! I was just, I was just angry. So angry that...

I'll never be caught. I'll kill more. More women, more pleasure...

Frowning as they walked for about five minutes, the gray smoke finally cleared.

They were in a dense forest.

"A moment's impulse."

A woman's voice was heard.

"Or did you fail to resist years of suppressed desire and commit an irreversible act?"

Shirone's group stood back-to-back, looking around.

"Where are you? Come out!"

"No, that's not it."

Based on his experience in Maze Andre, Shirone guessed what Melkidu was.

"However old it may be, it was initially just a space that absorbed negative energy. Then criminals began gathering here one by one."

"You're saying it's a system they created?"

"Right. It became the safest hiding place for those who should face society's judgment."

"Those who crossed forbidden lines." The woman spoke.

"Welcome to Melkidu's starting point."
