Iruki would become a successful mage.

"We'll arrive in one hour."

Even among Valkyrie's command, which gathered the finest minds, he had risen to the position of Supreme Commander.

One who thinks like Ex Machina.

The gray matter organ inside Iruki's skull possessed the world's most exceptional functionality.

The number of troops under his command exceeded one million elite soldiers, and even archmages and grand swordsmen were no exception.

"I should get some rest. Wake me up in 30 minutes."

The carriage guarded by 200 certified 2nd-class knights provided the utmost comfort through the culmination of technology.

'Is this truly the right thing to do?'

Though he had made a quick decision due to the urgent nature of the situation, doubts still lingered.

'Now that the spirit realm is closed, the demons' numbers have become quantifiable. It's time for weapons of mass destruction, but...'

The weapon Iruki designed was an elemental bomb he had first conceived during his days at Alpheas Magic School.

Its magical power would transcend imagination, and if mishandled, it could lead to humanity's mutual destruction.

'It's a weapon that would have been created eventually anyway. If we can't eliminate the demons, humanity will perish regardless.'

As he consciously loosened the strings of tension, fatigue rushed in so intensely his nose stung.

Once Iruki's breathing stabilized, Aromi, the leader of his support team, carefully turned through her documents.

She had an intellectual appearance with horn-rimmed glasses and was actually a woman who had led Jaive's think tank.

"We're currently heading to the dwarf ruins in the Arca Mountains, southwest of the Tormia Kingdom. A state-certified excavation team is already conducting mining operations there. There might be resistance, so please make sure all documents are properly attached."

The legal department leader said.

"They can't sue us anyway. The Tormia Kingdom's approval has already been granted."

"That may be true, but..."

The fact that the excavation team consisted of Iruki's former classmates was concerning.

"Cough! Cough!"

When Iruki coughed, Aromi unfolded a blanket beside him and covered him with it.

"It's gotten worse lately."

Iruki suddenly opened his eyes wide and sat up, covering his mouth with his hand.

"Kgh! Kgh!"

Following harsh breathing sounds, a handful of blood seeped through his fingers.

"Supreme Commander!"

Aromi supported him while shouting.

"Call the medic! Quickly!"

"I'm fine. I want to go quietly."

"That's not acceptable. When the Supreme Commander's condition is critical, I make all decisions regarding emergency treatment. That includes the authority to decide on complete mission cancellation."

Iruki smiled wryly with his blood-stained mouth.

"But you won't do that, will you? Right?"

Aromi, who had maintained a cold expression, showed her gentle face and coaxed him.

"So please get examined. You're someone humanity cannot afford to lose."

Only Ex Machina's thinking ability could face Havitz, who existed beyond probability.

However, overdrive was steadily consuming Iruki's life even now.

"I'm coming in."

The medic who had been waiting in the auxiliary carriage boarded the main carriage and examined Iruki.

Even while checking his blood pressure and eye movements, Iruki lay there weakly.

If he stopped overworking his brain even now, he might be able to enjoy a reasonable lifespan like others, but...

'Don't worry, Father. I know what you would say.'

Just as the extreme of combustion is explosion, Iruki intended to burn his life in a single moment.

'Please, just hold on until the war ends.'

When Iruki's eyes became clear again, Aromi bowed her head with a heavy heart.

'Thank you.'

It was the only thing she could say to someone facing death.

The Arca Mountains contain ruins of the dwarf race that flourished 2,000 years ago.

The dwarfs' handicraft techniques are known to be so precise they surpass existing humanity.

Their artistic value matched their archaeological worth, so once excavation succeeded, making a fortune was a foregone conclusion.

"Center! Center! No, a bit more to the side!"

At a cliff 80 meters high and 320 meters wide, a group was conducting mining operations.

The team consisted entirely of mages who had attended the same school.

Rumble! Rumble!

Massive equipment 13 meters tall and weighing over 70 tons was drilling into the cliff.

It had caterpillar tracks on its lower body, and at the ends of two arms attached to its humanoid upper body were enormous drills.

"That's it! Dorothy! Keep it turning!"

The woman operating the equipment was Dorothy, who had dropped out of Alpheas Magic School last year.

"Ugh! Here we go!"

The Mimesis ability to share minds with mages dramatically improved the operational efficiency of machinery.

Kakakakakakaka!

As the two massive drills rotated, sparks flew and petal-like traces of light appeared before their eyes.

"Go for it! Hickory 19!"

Hickory 19, created through countless improvements, accepted Dorothy's mind and increased its output even more.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Then dull impacts struck the equipment, and the heavy body began to shake.

"Stop! Stop! It's blocked!"

Sabina, who had once attended magic school with Dante, waved a stop flag.

"Ugh, damn it!"

Dorothy struck Hickory's cockpit hard and frowned as she climbed out of the machine.

"What is it? Iron ore again?"

"Yeah. The mineral content is too high. I thought it was strange when they readily gave us the excavation permit."

The Arca Mountains were historically a difficult region for mining.

"Let me check."

Closer, who majored in earth magic, approached Hickory 19's drill.

The heat was intense enough to cause burns.

"Phew! It's completely blocked. It'll take two days to break through this. How about attacking the first excavation site again?"

Canis, who had joined the excavation team with an archaeology major, approached with Arin.

"That won't work. If we keep drilling with such crude equipment, the dwarf ruins will be destroyed."

Dorothy glared fiercely.

"Hey! You called it crude equipment! If I put my mind to it, I could play ball with this thing!"

"Either way, it won't work. If the ruins or artifacts get damaged, all our work will be for nothing anyway."

Closer used his expertise to examine the cave's geological structure.

"If we just break through this point, it seems like we can go down easily. From the flow, it doesn't look deeply buried."

"Then let's smoke a cigarette and try again."

Dorothy lit a cigarette and jumped down from 10 meters high.

Though war had broken out and they had dropped out, there was no worry of these mages getting hurt.

"Sigh, nothing's easy. I gave up school and bet my life on this."

Dorothy threw her hard hat on the ground and exhaled cigarette smoke slowly.

She wasn't wearing a bra, so her chest area protruded from her black tank top.

Closer held a water bottle and said.

"Still, we're better off than most. Did you hear about Frings? After graduating, he became a magic kindergarten teacher."

Sabina frowned.

Frings, who majored in ice magic, was remembered as a pervert with severe voyeuristic tendencies despite his excellent skills.

Dorothy burst into laughter.

"Hahaha! A kindergarten teacher? Well, considering his personality, it might be the perfect fit."

Wasn't he probably flaring his nostrils at the children he taught, asking what they had for breakfast?

"We've all changed a lot. Come to think of it, school was really fun."

Dorothy reminisced about their graduation class.

Personal combat, the fierce battles of Scramble Royale, the intense graduation exams, and...

As she smiled faintly while thinking of someone, she snapped out of her reverie and shouted.

"Alright! Let's start again! Let's do it properly this time!"

"Sounds good!"

Just as everyone was returning to their positions, Arin looked into the distance and said.

"Canis, look over there."

A huge carriage with armed escort knights was rapidly descending the hill's slope.

"What's that? The kingdom?"

"No, the emblem is different."

When the entire excavation team cast air magic to compress the air, the carriage's insignia became clearly visible.

"The Holy Kingdom?"

It was the emblem of Valkyrie, the combat division.

While they waited with uneasy expressions, the carriage stopped trailing dust.

The door opened and Aromi stepped out.

She observed the excavation team with a neat demeanor, adjusted her glasses, then walked over like a cat.

"Hello. I'm Aromi, Chief Secretary of the Strategic Command Support Office of the Valkyrie Division under the Holy Kingdom."

Closer spoke bluntly.

"That's quite a long name. What do you want?"

Aromi got straight to the point and presented an official document.

"As of this moment, excavation rights for the Arca Mountains are being transferred to Valkyrie by approval of the Tormia Kingdom. Please review and sign this."

"What..."

Before Dorothy could finish, Canis shouted.

"What's this about?"

He roughly snatched the documents and quickly reviewed the ten-plus pages of transfer details.

"Don't spout nonsense!"

He then threw the documents on the ground and stared directly at Aromi.

"I couldn't even find evidence of dwarf ruins before I investigated. Now you're saying you're taking away a project we planned and started? I absolutely cannot accept this!"

Aromi remained calm.

"This has nothing to do with dwarf ruins. This is a world crisis that transcends nations. We'll provide compensation."

"Who are you to put a price on the ruins' value? The dwarfs' artifacts areâ€”"

"Wait a moment."

Dorothy, the team leader, stepped forward.

"You said it has nothing to do with the ruins? Then what is Valkyrie planning to do here? Build a military base?"

"That's classified."

"I'm sure it is. But shouldn't you at least bring a convincing argument for us?"

"Why should I?"

Aromi didn't give them any opening to argue.

"The Holy Kingdom requested it and the kingdom approved it. This isn't a matter for a private excavation team to interfere with. Please leave."

This time even Dorothy couldn't hold back.

"Who are you? I need to meet the person in charge. The chief secretary can't be the decision-maker."

"As I said again..."

"That's me."

Before Dorothy could finish speaking, Iruki stepped out of the carriage and approached them.

"I-Iruki?"

They had heard through the mage community that he had left Tormia, but they never expected to see him in a place like this.

"It's been a while."

Following behind Iruki, 40 knights positioned themselves left and right to guard him.

As mages, they could tell better than anyone that these were all masters rarely seen in society.

Sabina asked.

"Iruki, what's going on?"

Aromi stepped aside and said.

"If you're citizens of Tormia, please show proper respect. This is the Supreme Commander of the Valkyrie Division under the Holy Kingdom."

"Supreme Commander?"

Closer blinked.

"So you're the commander-in-chief?"

Iruki said casually.

"That's right. I'm sorry about this. I don't intend to interfere with your work, but we need to use this place."

Being mages, they grasped the situation instantly, and Sabina asked sharply.

"So you came knowing everything? Then you know our personalities well too, right? Even if it's the Holy Kingdom, stealing someone's livelihood is too much."

Dorothy felt the same sense of betrayal.

But because it was none other than Iruki, she suppressed her emotions and tried to have a conversation.

"What are you planning to do here?"

Dorothy's eyes filled with intensity.

"Right, I get it. You're in such a high position that people like us aren't even visible to you..."

"I'm going to make a very dangerous weapon."

"Supreme Commander."

Iruki ignored Aromi's signal.

"For that, I need special minerals. Investigation results show they're buried in large quantities in this mountain range."

It was definitely classified information that shouldn't reach enemy territory, and Dorothy's feelings became complicated.

'Iruki.'

The protagonist of her most precious memories from school days.
