Chain Reaction (2)

Two hundred citizens were protesting in front of the Delta headquarters where the holy tournament was being held.

"Impeach the King of Zive!"

This was the aftermath of an article about the holy tournament's corruption that a reporter named Meikle had published in the daily newspaper.

"A king who has lost his morality has no qualifications. Citizens must unite to rebuild our nation." This was an unprecedented sight in other kingdoms, happening because their king was elected by vote.

Of course, that system had made Zive a wealthy nation, but from the king's perspective, it was maddening.

Myron, Gis's aide, surveyed the protesters as he left the Delta headquarters.

'This is worse than expected.'

The fact that 200 people had gathered in just a few hours meant the citizens' opposition was fierce.

'Of course, there are probably opposition faction members in there too.' Moving people required money, and it would be difficult without some big shot behind it.

The streets were also bustling.

"The world is ending! Everyone repent! The god Cria will save us!"

The giant pyramid that had suddenly appeared in Zive's territory was visible even from here.

Naturally, the citizens' shock was tremendous, and doomsday prophets had rushed into the streets.

"The glory of Terapos has arrived! Now all humanity will face divine judgment!"

Thanks to the pyramid, it was good that attention was being diverted from Gis.

He could see young men who had been boldly looting stores getting arrested by security forces that had immediately deployed.

"Pathetic."

Systems don't shake easily.

'Unless you're certain the world will end tomorrow...

Because humans can't let go of today.'

"Phew, I need to change clothes first."

His face was bruised from the beating he'd received from Gis, and his clothes were stained with blood.

When he entered the mansion where bodyguards were stationed, his wife and daughter were in the hall.

"I'm home."

"Oh my, what happened to your face?" When his wife asked with a surprised expression, Myron made an excuse.

"You saw the news. I fell a bit while pushing through the protesters. It's not serious. Get me some new clothes."

He heard his daughter sigh.

"Hah."

His brow furrowed at the sight of his twelve-year-old daughter reading a magazine without even greeting him.

"Your dad comes home after several days and you won't even acknowledge me?"

"What? You're really annoying."

When she slammed the magazine shut and headed to her room, Myron's voice rose.

"Hey! Your attitude...!"

"Honey, leave her alone."

His wife said as she brought new clothes.

"She's going through puberty. Things are chaotic outside too. She'll be entering advanced school soon."

"Geez, what a fuss over puberty."

"Still, she got first place in the multilingual proficiency assessment today. The teacher says she has talent."

Myron, who was changing clothes, raised an eyebrow.

"Really?"

This is what makes life worth living.

"That little rascal."

A smile appeared on his lips as if nothing had happened.

"Well, blood will tell. If she's my daughter, she should be able to do at least that much. What else did the teacher say?"

"She has good judgment and excellent peer relationships. They said she'll definitely be in the top ranks even after entering school."

For politicians' children who only needed private tutoring, school was a special-purpose institution.

"Support her well from behind. Don't provoke her unnecessarily. That age is when they're most easily shaken."

"You should come home more often. Talk with the child..."

"Nagging again."

It was always like this, but his irritation was worse after coming home beaten like a dog by Gis.

"Am I out there playing? You know how busy I am, so why say that? On a day like today, take it easy."

His wife didn't want to hassle someone who was hurt either.

"Alright. Are you going to the temple?"

"Field work. I won't be able to come home for a while. Limit going outside, and definitely attach a bodyguard to the child."

Gis's words couldn't be overlooked either.

"Yes. But you should eat something."

"I don't have time. I'm busy. Bring Toby. I'll just see his face and go."

This was his late-born four-year-old son.

"He's sleeping. It's nap time."

"...Tell him to wait a bit. Will something terrible happen if he doesn't nap for one day?" His wife's voice carried claws.

"How would I know when you'll come home to wait? And how important naps are during the growth period..."

"Ah, fine. I got it."

Since the result would be the same no matter how long the argument went, Myron headed for the entrance like he was escaping.

"I'll be back. Take good care of the house." Perhaps bothered that he was leaving without seeing his son's face, his wife's voice became gentle.

"You're really okay, right?"

"I'm fine, of course. I'm Myron. I absolutely won't fall apart, so just take good care of the kids."

Actually, he didn't really know.

'If this incident grows bigger, His Excellency's status will change too. Plus I heard the pyramid angels' power has weakened.'

'Let's solve things one by one.'

The priority was preventing reporter Meikle from writing any more articles.

"Hah."

Leaving the mansion, he looked at the top of the pyramid beyond the city skyline.

"What do I care?"

I can barely take care of myself.

A man stood at a VIP-only bar in the city center.

"So I get to see a place like this too."

The bar that only influential people frequented was naturally closed, but that wasn't a problem.

When he knocked, the door opened.

"Who is it?"

"I'm someone called Baekgu."

He was called Baekgu because his head was shaved bald, but his real name was Travis, an organized crime member.

"Please come in."

In the cold air where they hadn't even started preparing for business, there were dozens of rooms.

'Must be quite someone.'

A person who had rented out the entire bar during broad daylight - a bar that required considerable power just to enter.

The room the manager led him to was the most secluded and spacious among them.

At a table that could seat dozens of people, with a bottle of premium liquor, a man sat lost in thought at the head seat.

"Sir, I've brought him."

"You may leave."

Myron, who had been waiting, adjusted his glasses and looked over Travis's features.

He was a sturdy, honest-looking man.

"Sit. You're handsome."

Travis bowed politely and walked to the end of the long table to sit down.

"Hello. I'm Travis. Age 43. I've heard a lot about you from big brother."

Actually, he knew nothing.

The guy called big brother who had visited after three years had only said he could make some money if he went there.

Myron poured liquor and spoke.

"I'm trying to start a big business lately, but I'm short on people. I heard you have some muscle."

"I'll work hard."

"Right, what kind of work do you do now?"

"I'm operating a brothel in Edia District 2. I have five organization members."

"Hmm, five."

Travis hastily added.

"They're all useful guys."

It was the inferiority complex of a small organization's boss, but Myron thought differently.

'Five riffraff. Perfect.'

Would a king of a nation hire gangsters because he lacked capable people?

'It's the holy tournament period. If it's revealed that political maneuvering was involved, other countries will tear us apart. But if it's just brothel gangsters, covering it up would be easy even if exposed.'

The reason Myron, the king's aide, came personally was due to the iron rule: 'Long chains get stepped on.'

"First, take this."

Myron pushed the heavy briefcase on the table forward.

"Is this what I need to do?"

"Open it."

As Myron crossed his legs and sipped his drink, Travis opened the briefcase upward.

"Th-this is?"

It was full of large gold coins.

"One million gold."

"One million!"

It was an amount Travis could never touch in his lifetime no matter what he did.

"You need money to work. Use it for now." All kinds of thoughts flashed through his mind.

'It's definitely dangerous work. No, that doesn't matter. With this money, what work couldn't I do?'

"Don't just stare, check it. Since they're large gold coins, you should be able to count them."

"I trust you, sir. However..."

It was the first time he'd been scared of money.

"I don't know what kind of work it is, but I'll do it. However, this much money isn't necessary in this business."

Myron chuckled.

"What are you talking about? This is the contract fee."

"Excuse me?"

"I don't know what business you're talking about, but my business is different. I'm giving this as a sign of good faith for future cooperation. If you handle the work well, I'll give you ten times this amount."

'Ten million gold?'

Travis shook his head.

'No way. This is absolutely not right. Even decent nobles don't have this much money.'

He realized the source of his unease.

'My abilities, no, even if I sold my life, I'm not worth this much.'

Myron had the same thought.

'It is a bit much.'

Slow cooking over low heat was standard, but right now even an hour was precious.

'I can't help tomorrow's morning paper, but I must stop the evening edition. I need to cook this fast.'

Click, the briefcase closed.

"...I'll do it."

Of course.

'When you can finish life in one shot, who would take the long way around? People aren't that complicated.'

What's complicated is money.

"Then I'll trust you with it."

"Um... shouldn't we write up a contract or something?"

The amount was so large he felt guilty, but from Myron's position it was absolutely impossible.

'Why would I bring cash?'

He pointed at the briefcase.

"Isn't that the contract? Think comfortably. You can earn plenty more like this in the future."

At that moment he realized.

'He's a politician. Am I finally seeing the light?'

He didn't know the face or name yet, but he felt he could offer even his soul.

"By chance, the person I'll be serving..."

"Hah."

Myron took off his glasses and expressed his irritated emotions fully.

"What's a gangster bastard so curious about?"

Travis saw the horrifying vision of one million gold disappearing in an instant.

Perhaps instinct.

Travis jumped up from his seat and bowed 90 degrees.

"I'm sorry. I didn't know my place. This will absolutely never happen again."

Myron filled a water glass with strong liquor and offered it.

"Have a drink. I'll contact you separately."

"Yes, sir."

Travis poured the liquor straight down his throat, picked up the briefcase, and bowed.

"Please call me anytime."

After leaving the bar and seeing the sun again, his head spun from the alcohol.

But he wasn't drunk.

'No, am I drunk?'

Even though he was carrying a bag full of gold coins, he couldn't feel his arms and hands.

Travis took a deep breath and entered the street with a poker face.

His heart felt like it would burst.

'This is crazy.'

What if someone stole the bag, what if there was a tail, what if lightning suddenly struck?

'Please, please just let me get home.'

He usually strutted down the street with his chin up confidently, but at this moment he was the weakest human in the world.

"Extra! Extra!"

Articles about the giant pyramid erected in Zive were being distributed through magazine companies.

"Repent! The end of the world is coming!"

All the world's religions had rushed into the streets to preach their respective doctrines.

"The King of Zive must reveal the full truth of the incident! We don't want a corrupt king!"

Civic groups were now marching through the streets, spreading their opinions.

But Travis was thinking:

'Honey, wait! Son! Daddy did it!'

Only the moment when he would slam down one million gold in front of his family was real.
