The Beginning of Destruction (4)

The Tormia delegation arrived across the moat from the royal castle of the Jive Kingdom, Delta.

"Open the drawbridge!"

The bridge crossed the moat amid the sound of turning gears echoing through the sky.

Rufist, who had entered the castle, spoke.

"Well built."

Unlike naturally developed royal castles, this was a structure built according to urban planning.

Sirone said.

"They say it took 20 years to change like this. It's proof that the politics are stable."

Delta's main building came into view.

It was a modern style, a flat rectangular structure when viewed from the sky.

Kashan and Corona had arrived first, but they didn't seem particularly concerned about Tormia.

'That's reality.'

Pony examined her thoughts.

'To become a leading nation, we need a trump card to convince the world. Elemental bomb technology is excellent, but other countries also have cards of this level.'

It was actually a simple problem.

'Kashan, which can control demons, Corona, backed by the intelligence of the Ivory Tower, and Tormia.'

What country would the world's people want to become the leading nation?

'At least not Tormia.'

Nevertheless, the reason they could compete with other countries was because of Yahweh.

'Without Sirone, Tormia is just a mediating country exercising one vote. I too am in a position where I have to think about which country to sell this one vote to, and for how much, but the King of the World.'

She couldn't help but feel her heart race at the moment when they weren't pushed back even in encounters with superpowers.

'It's not impossible if Sirone helps. That's why Mr. Rufist is also risking everything, but...'

Yahweh's position would be different.

'Sirone would be fine even if Tormia doesn't become the leading nation. The reason for attending the Holy War is for human unification.'

Of course, as long as the Kingdom of Tormia supports Sirone's beliefs, the alliance wouldn't break.

But would that be enough?

'Having to dip your feet in dirty water is also politics. And Rufist won't discriminate between means and methods.'

No, she shouldn't pass it off like this.

'I'm the same way.'

For Pony, who had been pushed out of the succession line early on, power was something to overcome.

'The days when I just wanted to escape.'

She didn't need a destination.

'I enrolled in magic school, participated in beauty contests while receiving looks of contempt and scorn...'

Because she was so disgusted with power, she could have become even a puppet king.

'Actually...'

Wasn't she craving it more than anyone?

'No.'

Pony shook her head.

'It's just a momentary desire. Let's only think about helping Sirone. As one mage, for humanity...'

When she first became queen.

The first thing that came to mind was the expressions of the royals who had ignored her.

'Now I'm aiming to be the King of the World.'

The joy of her self-esteem, which she could never proudly display anywhere, exploding brilliantly.

'I don't want to end it here.'

Something inside her began to whisper.

'Bind Sirone to Tormia. If Sirone would move only for me...'

You can get what you want.

Pony looked at Sirone's profile as he gazed ahead, lost in thought.

'Amy.'

She thought she was no less than her.

'If the person by Sirone's side had been me instead of Amy, would he have helped? Would he have made me the King of the World, even more than humanity?'

'Hehe.'

Power is a frightening thing.

'Right, this is why I'm not suitable.'

If it were Amy, she would never have such disgusting thoughtsâ€” Just then, a sound came from beyond Delta's walls.

"Kingdom of Kesia! Entry!"

The status of the nation could be seen just by the officials of Kashan and Corona turning their bodies.

"Hmm, Kesia. A troublesome opponent."

Iron was still the powerhouse of the southern continent, but Kesia had also devoured the 7 parts and 7 nations.

'The figure at the center of that is...'

Ardino Fermi.

At the procession entering led by golden carriages, Corona's Lampa told his disciple.

"Don't lose sight of the Kingdom of Kesia. They're the most unpredictable variable in this Holy War."

"Their think tank is the Golden Wheel. The organization that ate the 7 nations of the southern continent with Angel. The leader is the drug lord Fermi."

"Ardino Fermi."

The young and old man defined things differently.

"Master, I know you're old, but isn't that too retro? You said updating information is important. After Yolga's death, the Ardino family was completely pushed out by Adrias. Fermi is excellent too, but compared to Miro, the Ultima..."

"Adrias of depth."

Lampa said.

"There was a saying, 'Ardino of breadth.' When those two heroines coexisted. Modern mages think of Ardino as a pushover, but have you seen Yolga? If you're not certain, don't update. Don't you know such words?"

"But..."

"Yolga's vision for reading the flow of the times far transcended the human category. The logs were erased, but it's generally accepted that Miro's philosophy was also influenced by her. If you underestimate Fermi's capabilities, Corona will also be in danger."

The disciple clicked his tongue.

"Who says I'm underestimating? I'm also thinking of doing this properly this time."

"Why? Is there some girl you like?"

"No, well..."

Information mages were the backbone of all wars, but were far from receiving attention.

'But the Holy War is different. Here I can stand out. In other words...'

He could appeal to women.

'The world might end, but shouldn't I at least try dating before dying?'

Though his disciple's thoughts were clear as day, Lampa didn't scold him.

'Perhaps that's everything.'

What grand reason is needed for humans to live?

Meanwhile, Uorin felt bitter.

'They came after all.'

She thought there was a possibility that the Apocalypse side would check Sirone.

'That guy's not to be taken lightly.'

The Golden Wheel's financial power, Angel the cure for emotional diseases, and information buried in the Apocalypse.

'The bastard who knows how to handle all those elements most dirtily.'

Though Kesia's cards had many dark elements to become a leading nation, that made them more dangerous.

'It'll work.'

Sirone thought the same.

'Fermi pursues extreme efficiency. In other words, he has a tendency to solve any problem in the easiest way.'

And people prefer easy things.

'He can overturn the situation at least once. That's Kesia's greatest weapon.'

Fermi, moving toward Delta's main building, smiled while receiving countless gazes.

"Was I this famous?"

Within his relaxed gaze management, analysis of key figures was rapidly conducted.

'Corona is quite strong too. There seem to be stars as well. Kashan is centered around the wind commander... Hmm?'

He saw a man leaning against Uorin's back.

'Ultimate evil, Havitz.'

Their gazes clashed briefly, but Havitz soon turned his head back and yawned.

"Yawn."

God's frequency was speaking.

"...What a strange fellow."

That was Satan's entire impression, but all others were on high alert at Fermi's actions.

'We must use him.'

Those who knew the essence of politics could devour Fermi's cards as well.

'They're waiting in the order of Tormia, Corona, Kashan. He'll try to squeeze in with the side he considers friendly.'

Fermi whispered something to the king.

The direction Kesia took after determining their lead was beyond expectations.

"What, what?"

Despite having plenty of space to squeeze in, they went to the outer side of Tormia, which was on the outskirts.

As the procession, smaller than other countries, took position, Fermi's eyes sank.

'This is the vital spot, you idiots.'

The strategy of ignoring the Kashan Empire and Corona complicated the minds of the leadership.

Lampa stroked his beard.

'Hmm, not squeezing in the middle is an active display of favor toward Yahweh. It means he doesn't care about face for the sake of profit. That makes sense too. When trust needs to be built, he's the type to accept any loss.'

If it were simply that tendency, it would be fine.

'But if there was something visible only to Ardino's vision, then Kashan and Corona made a mistake.'

Fermi smiled and said.

"Hey, Sirone. Seeing you again after yesterday? At this rate, we'll grow fond of each other."

Sirone replied curtly.

"This is an official occasion. Watch your words."

"Haha! What's the problem? We're not strangers, and I'm also from Tormia. Pony, it's been a while too. How have you been? Let's be comfortable when we're together. That's why I came over here."

"Huh? Oh, right. It really has been a while."

Even knowing it was pretense, she couldn't brush away the hand extended by Kesia's core figure.

Sirone's eyes narrowed.

'Cunning bastard.'

Anyway, for now, it wasn't bad that Fermi was paying attention to Tormia.

Pony looked back at Kesia's king.

"Nice to meet you. Tormia's..."

She stopped speaking, and Sirone also looked at King Manolka with a dazed mind.

A body as gaunt as a mummy, a face full of wrinkles, mouth hanging open as if dead.

'He really looks dead.'

Thinking of drugs, Sirone glared at Fermi with killing intent.

"Fermi, you bastard...!"

To bring the king after turning him into a mummy.

"What did I do? Ah..."

Realizing, Fermi shook Manolka.

"Old man, old man. Wake up. I told you not to sleep."

"Huh, huh?"

The king's body trembled, then he seemed to come to his senses and looked around.

"Oh, did we arrive already? Wheeze wheeze. Nice to meet you, young people. I'm Manolka, the king of Kesia."

Sirone asked.

"Are you alright? You seem unwell."

"Everyone says that. I have a constitution that doesn't gain weight easily. Heh heh heh!"

Fermi shrugged.

"Why blame me for everything? This old man is originally like this. He's 72 years old, in the prime of youth."

'He looks like he's 172.'

Everyone had the same thought.

"Youth my ass, you rascal. What desires could I have at this age? If you want to do something, tell this young man. But to think Kesia came to the Holy War, I've fulfilled my wish before dying."

"Why would you die? Soon, beauties from all over the world will be proposing to you."

"Don't live too intensely, you rascal. Humans get pushed around by the world, but if you push back together, only your head will break. Do everything in moderation, in moderation."

"Yes, yes."

Even after hearing their entire conversation, it was impossible to understand what kind of relationship they had.

'What the hell?'

Just as Sirone was lost in thought, the main building's doors opened wide and music echoed.

"Welcome! Leaders of the world!"

A man with a sturdy build, cleft chin, and neat appearance appeared without even guards.

'Gis.'

It was the king of Jive.

"The eve festival will be held when all 12 nations gather, but it seemed impolite to those waiting, so we prepared this intermission event."

"Intermission event?"

Just as everyone was puzzled, a woman much taller than Gis emerged from the main building.

"...Huh?"

Satiel, the Archangel of Destruction.

"Let me introduce. The new force that will lead Jive's future. Heaven's army."

The rooftop of the main building flashed, and hundreds of lights crossed and shot up into the sky.

Each light was an angel, and different concepts of judicial halos unfolded simultaneously.

"Damn it."

The officials' faces turned pale at the overwhelming power that seemed to shake the world.

Gis spread both arms.

"Welcome to Jive."
