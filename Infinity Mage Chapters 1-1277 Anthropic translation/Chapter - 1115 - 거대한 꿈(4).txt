The Grand Dream (4)

'The first day is reconnaissance.'

The officials headed to their respective national quarters.

'Only one nation can become the leading country. There's no nation that would propose an alliance right now.'

Even if allied nations won the vote, the problem of deciding the leading country would remain.

'For priorities among allied nations to be established, the balance of power needs to tip to some degree.'

At this point where friend and foe weren't distinguished, no country would readily extend their hand yet.

As each nation's thoughts grew complicated, Uorin burst into the room and shouted.

"What are you doing right now!"

Kido was watching, and Havitz was lying on the bed, blinking his eyes.

"What?"

"You cornered Sirone. Did you forget our deal? The condition for handing over the world was..."

"You get to have Sirone."

Havitz suddenly sat up.

"It's a good strategy. If Sirone accepts my deal, it'll be good for you too."

"You can't win hearts that way. Do it according to the original plan. Stop going off track."

"You're the one going off track."

"What?"

Havitz pointed at Uorin.

"Your History Search ability. If Kashan becomes the leading nation, you can integrate humanity into Ultima."

This was also why Uorin was confident that Sirone would come to her.

"So what? I said I'd give you my ability once I achieve what I want."

Among the mitochondrial Eve's lineage, only Uorin possessed future sight.

When she looked at something, the trajectory of that object's future movement was revealed as lines of light.

Indeed, the apple she was looking at had faint light flowing along its surface.

Moments later, a hand-shaped light connected with the apple's light, then dropped the apple downward.

"It's actually nothing special."

At Havitz's words, Uorin turned her gaze.

"Seeing future movements. You can just predict that much anyway."

The reason future sight was powerful.

"Its true value is activated when you close your eyes. That's the secret you wanted to hide."

When Uorin saw nothing, the timeline could extend infinitely.

'Because all signals are connected.'

Havitz's fingertips, the table his hand touched, the floor the table touched, the earth connected to the floor.

If all the trajectories of buildings, humans, creatures, and plants established through that earth were revealed as lines of light.

"You'd dominate history. By manipulating the variables that occur within it."

Havitz picked up the apple.

"So, how about it?"

The golden timeline spread out and swayed massively.

"If I drop this apple here, what will happen 200 kilometers away?"

The apple rolled on the floor.

Kido would pick it up, and by tomorrow that apple would rot and be collected by a janitor.

Of course, that apple would end up in a trash can, becoming food for bugs...

'When the timeline is accelerated endlessly.'

Changes would occur in the colonies where bugs lived, resulting in biological changes on the scale of 10,000 organisms...

"Stop."

Uorin cut off her thoughts.

Future sight expanded the deeper you delved, so at some point it would overload the brain.

"Magnificent."

Even without Uorin explaining, Havitz saw through everything with his divine frequency.

"My trivial action of dropping an apple changed the history of bugs. Just like a god."

The reason Uorin wrinkled her nose was that those bugs could also be humans.

"Seeing with eyes has limits. History Search has too vast a radius. At most..."

She could find La Enemy.

"No, no. There's no limit to the ability. It's just because your brain is human."

Havitz fell into thought for a moment.

"I heard there's still a Gaian brain remaining..."

Murderous intent flashed in Uorin's eyes, and hot anger welled up in her chest.

"What are you trying to say?"

"Don't forget why I kept you alive. If I tried to take it by force, you'd commit suicide, so I have no choice but to go along with your will..."

It was an ability he wanted that much.

"If future sight goes to Sirone, I think I'd feel anger for the first time."

Havitz headed for the door.

"My method might be better. Think about it carefully."

If he crossed outside Kashan's territory, it would cause a commotion, but there was no way to stop him anyway.

When the door closed, Kido spoke.

"I don't like this. It was an impossible deal from the start. That guy wants your ability so badly that he's just letting himself be used. At this rate..."

"Shut up."

Kido's eyes grew intense.

"Get a grip! Even if you can create Ultima, Sirone already has someone he loves!"

"Kido, please."

Uorin slowly raised her head.

"Please... shut up."

As evening approached, Arachne's messengers delivered letters to each nation.

"A banquet. How luxurious."

When Lufist placed the letter on the table, Sirone read it.

"Most will attend."

"Yeah, the behind-the-scenes work that can't be done in meetings will start now. They won't skip it just to gauge the atmosphere. The problem is..."

Lufist pointed to the last sentence of the letter.

"For an enjoyable banquet, we hope courtesans from each nation will also attend to grace the occasion. On the surface, it might be intended to compete in cultural superiority, but..."

Albino said.

"Nighttime politics is about to begin. Arachne's side will seriously deploy honey traps. I'm curious how powerful they'll be. Why don't you experience it once? If we know the level, we can infer how much information will leak from other countries."

When there was no answer, he shrugged.

"I can't do it at my age..."

"I'll decide based on the situation. The real problem is our courtesans. I'd like to keep them in reserve if possible."

He didn't say he'd protect them.

"If there are impure intentions mixed in, I'd like to refuse. Do we really have to go that far?"

No one agreed with Sirone's words.

'Can't we do something even worse?'

It wasn't a matter of like or dislike.

If everyone was doing it, Tormia had no choice but to do it too - that was competition.

'But ignoring Sirone's wishes isn't good either. This is quite troublesome.'

Lufist chose the next best option.

"We should ask the courtesan troupe's opinion first. Sirone, would you go and tell the leader?"

"Yes."

Sirone also thought it would be better if he persuaded them directly.

"A banquet?"

Sirone found the lodging where the courtesan troupe was staying and conveyed the letter's contents to Ozent Reina.

"It probably won't be a pleasant occasion. It'll be crawling with greedy people."

"That's right."

She nodded.

"Understood. We'll prepare and depart."

"Pardon?"

He had expected her to refuse naturally.

"Will it be alright? You know what kind of occasion this is."

"But we can't not go, can we? We're also fighting for Tormia, so we have to accept that much. They're naturally expecting Maya, and if the situation gets bad, I'll step in and control it."

When Sirone showed a dubious expression, Reina smiled and patted his shoulder.

"Don't worry. This kind of thing happens all the time in the royal palace. Trust your big sister and leave it to me. However, the problem is..."

Reina looked back toward the corridor.

"I'm not sure about Cayden. You know, if his hands move regardless of his will..."

"I see."

The banquet hall would become chaos.

Taking Sirone with her, Reina found Cayden's room and explained the situation.

"So if you could stay in your room for a while..."

"That's not possible."

Cayden was firm.

"I can't send Maya alone. I will definitely protect her. Please let me go."

"Even if you say definitely..."

Cayden also knew that he couldn't suppress the symptoms of moving regardless of his will.

"I won't bring my sword."

"It's a difficult occasion. A small mistake could tarnish Tormia's reputation. Just this time..."

"Please let me go with her."

When Reina turned around, Maya was standing among the courtesans attending the banquet.

"If Cayden doesn't accompany me, I won't go either."

Sirone stepped forward.

"Don't worry too much. I'll also go to the banquet, so nothing will happen."

Maya's heart swelled at the fact that Sirone would protect her, but she deliberately shook her head.

"No, I appreciate the sentiment, but... I want to go with Cayden. I don't think I'll feel at ease otherwise."

'Maya.'

Cayden's expression became dazed.

Of course, he wasn't stupid enough not to know what feelings prompted her words.

'She's making an effort.'

To keep her promise to forget Sirone, she too was desperately struggling.

Cayden stepped forward.

"I swear. I absolutely won't make any mistakes. So please let me go."

His will was higher than ever, and he glared coldly at his right arm.

'You know too, if you're part of my body? If you make a mistake this time, I'll really cut you off.'

His right arm showed no reaction.

When they arrived at the banquet hall, what looked like 200 people were engaged in conversation.

Among the world-class figures, the courtesans were extremely tense.

"Tormia's turn is last. The courtesans can enjoy their time comfortably and come when called."

The fact that the 10 minutes to decide Cayden's treatment had pushed their turn to the very end meant.

'Remarkably shrewd.'

It was proof that this wasn't a time for mere indulgence.

The genteel atmosphere gradually heated up as alcohol was consumed, and there were some who stood out.

"Puhahaha! Yes, yes! Alcohol is definitely best from Rubiang. Don't you think?"

It was Prince Marcus of the Iron Kingdom.

A libertine in his early thirties, he was now blatantly looking over the women in the banquet hall.

"Hehe, so that's when I... hmm?"

Even while talking, he had been looking around when he stopped speaking after seeing Maya.

"Oho?"

Most people knew Maya from her time with the Valkyrie courtesan troupe.

"A famous person has come."

He immediately left his seat, grabbed another drink, and approached Maya.

"Mystic Maya, right?"

His voice was gentle, but his eyes, already loosened by alcohol, were threatening.

"I'm Marcus, First Prince of the Iron Kingdom."

'The Prince of Iron.'

The intimidation from his position was much greater than expected, and Maya involuntarily shrank back.

"I'm Maya. It's an honor to meet you."

When she had no choice but to extend her hand, Marcus's fingers coiled around it like a snake.

"Oho, your skin is so soft..."

Just as he was about to make a joke without reading the room, he saw Cayden glaring with frightening eyes.

"What's with you?"

Since this was anticipated, Maya calmly explained.

"He's my bodyguard. Cayden, please greet him."

"Bodyguard?"

One thing she hadn't expected was that this wasn't a place where common sense applied.

"How unpleasant. Is this the extent of Tormia's standards? A mere courtesan's bodyguard dares to glare at a prince."

Determining right from wrong was meaningless.

If Cayden subdued Marcus, they would simply gain Iron as an enemy nation at that moment.

'Endure it, Cayden. If we clash with Iron from the start, only other nations will benefit.'

The harsh reality.

With officials from each nation watching with snake-like eyes, Cayden had to make a choice.

Unable to disappoint Maya, he bowed his head.

"Please forgive my rudeness..."

And at that moment.

Cayden saw his right hand throwing a punch upward at tremendous speed.
