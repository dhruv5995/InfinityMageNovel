[770] Destruction (5)

As the spear of light pierced through the celestial knight, the ground rippled like waves.

Since he had controlled the mass, it didn't unleash the full power of destruction, but the speed was much faster.

"Aaaaaah..."

Just as Wigo, who had dropped to both knees from the powerful shock, was about to collapse to the ground.

"Huk!"

He raised his elbow to prevent his face from slamming into the earth.

'I am...'

The convulsions in his brain transmitted through his nerves, and only after a long while was he able to analyze what had happened to him.

'How long was I trapped?'

Just 1 second.

But Wigo's mind contained the complete memory of repeating that 1 second 100,000 times.

Wigo's cousins muttered:

"What just happened?"

Angel's Punishment was a world-famous incarnation technique, but they couldn't understand how Wigo had fallen in a single strike.

Garcia felt the same way.

'I don't understand. What on earth happened?'

Wigo was also one of the top masters not only in South Eymond but in the world.

Moreover, if it was a battle of incarnation techniques rather than attacking the main body, no matter what was done, it would be difficult to produce such shock.

"Do you have any idea?"

The mere fact that Garcia spoke first showed how bewildering the atmosphere was.

Minerva said:

"Vibration."

The expression of watching a fire across the river disappeared, and she now had the cold eyes of a witch.

"..."

Garcia pondered her words.

Though she had uttered only one word, the head of the Magic Association's mind pierced through countless possibilities to reach a single conclusion.

"You mean 1 second... vibrated?"

"Yes. Plucking the timeline. The line repeatedly travels back and forth between points A and B, but ultimately the amplitude of the vibration is 1 second. However, within that 1 second of vibration, countless 1 seconds are distributed as probability."

Garcia just listened.

"Then the question is, how did Wigo, the subject, perceive this vibration?"

The cousins paid attention.

"The conclusion is cognitive dissonance. He likely experienced both an instant and eternity simultaneously."

Just hearing the explanation seemed to cause cognitive dissonance.

One of the cousins asked:

"How is that possible?"

Minerva shook her index finger up and down.

"This is the vibration of the timeline. Even if you try to feel the 1 second at a specific point within this vibration..."

Her finger kept moving.

"There's no 1 second there. The finger has already passed, leaving only probability."

Hence, an instant.

"Conversely, if you do feel the 1 second at a specific point."

Her finger stopped.

"Since probability collapses, it's no longer vibration."

Garcia said:

"100 percent probability. It becomes a real 1 second."

Hence, eternity.

"The result varies according to the observer's intention. But Wigo vibrated together with Shirone's 1 second. In other words, resonance."

Minerva touched her thumb and index finger in sequence.

"Therefore, Wigo experienced two things simultaneously. One was the experience of 100,000 seconds rushing in within 1 second. And the other..."

Now Garcia understood too.

"The experience of 100,000 seconds of repeating 1 second. This is why he felt both an instant and eternity simultaneously."

Minerva lowered her hand.

"Strictly speaking, it's neither an instant nor vibration. There's currently no name for the time that Wigo experienced."

Shirone called it Time Vibration.

"But looking at Wigo's expression, I can fully imagine what kind of experience it was."

Wigo, still looking dazed, was terrified by his inability to speak.

'Am I becoming an idiot?'

The deadly battle, especially repeating the most intense moment 100,000 times, was a memory he never wanted to experience again.

"Are you okay?"

Hearing Shirone's voice, Wigo slowly raised his gaze to look up at Shirone.

"..."

As the terrible memories from within the vibration flooded back, his pupils shook with fear, and he eventually fell backward.

"Huuuu..."

Shirone looked at Wigo with a pitying expression.

'This is why I didn't want to use it on other people.'

It was a means to counter Nane's void.

'The integration of time explosion and time compression.'

Shirone's super-cognition could sense the Idea and handle all information in the world integratively.

'That is enlightenment.'

And now he had reached the stage of making that information vibrate entirely through resonance, shaking the world.

"If I can shake the world."

If the timeline of the world we live in endlessly travels back and forth between points A and B.

"Past and future overlap."

As the present disappears, this world dissolves into a world of probability without any fixed values.

"Therefore, there exists no future that must come, nor any past that can never be returned to."

A kind of time slip.

"Creating a phenomenon that reverses time."

Wigo slowly raised his head to see Shirone making a sad expression.

"This was the only way I could..."

Though still inadequate.

"Save everyone against Nane's void."

Wigo's face turned tearful as clear tears rolled down his cheeks.

'What have I done?'

Yahweh of universal love.

He was someone who bore the burden of being unable to tolerate even a single misfortune existing in the world.

'Father.'

The depth of one's realm isn't everything.

'I was foolish.'

Realizing how broad Shirone's heart was, he began to feel ashamed of his own narrow mind.

"Go to Zion."

Shirone extended his hand.

"It was an excellent incarnation technique. Let's fight together. This world needs people like you."

"Ah..."

Finally, his voice returned.

"Thank you."

Seeing Wigo shedding tears, the cousins also seemed to realize something and closed their mouths.

Minerva said:

"You think it's just 1 second?"

Garcia hadn't thought so, but hearing it, he didn't feel like denying it either.

"Repeating a moment can't save the whole. It can't eliminate all demons either. However..."

Minerva thought of Veron.

"A man threw a question to this world and left. Can humans truly change the future with their own will?"

"The Veron Problem. If the results are already determined by law, then Nane's void would also be correct."

"That's why it's not just 1 second."

Shirone's answer to the Veron Problem was 'yes.'

"He destroyed the predetermined future. He threw down a direct challenge to Nane's enlightenment."

If the future could be destroyed.

"Whether the world is truly suffering has now entered a stage where we can't know without going to the end."

Shirone approached, supporting Wigo.

"You'll feel better if you rest."

As the cousins took Wigo away, Shirone turned to Minerva and said:

"Let's go. We've delayed too much time."

Garcia approached.

"Thank you on behalf of Wigo. If there's anything we can help with in the future, please visit us anytime."

Minerva raised her fierce eyes.

"Hey! You never said that to me? How dare a mere Magic Association president try to choose between the Five Great Stars?"

'You have to act human to get treated like one.'

Looking at Shirone made her dislike Minerva even more.

"I'm glad Wigo is safe. Even one more person helping Zion would be good."

Garcia spoke his inner thoughts for the first time.

"Yes. Currently, Gustav's movements are unusual, and the Holy War is recruiting talents from around the world. I'm also thinking of applying to the Valkyries soon."

"What? You, Association President?"

"It's not confirmed yet, and I'm thinking of taking the test. It's time to join forces. Of course, I'm not ignoring personal career or the kingdom's honor."

"Ah, that's natural."

Not everyone needed to be Yahweh.

'If he's the world's greatest flame mage, he should easily pass the test. Or maybe even get a free pass.'

Shirone didn't show it.

"I hope you get good results. If we meet again someday, please take care of me."

That's what Garcia wanted to say.

"I wish you good fortune."

The jet carrying Shirone roared fiercely and crossed the sky at Mach speed.

Watching the temple rapidly disappear, Shirone turned to Minerva.

"We're going to the Ivory Tower?"

"We have to. Time Vibration is destruction in itself. There'll probably be some talk. Then leaving for Kashan will be a few days later?"

"What kind of talk would take so long?"

"You'll know when you hear it."

She didn't want to get involved with Terapos.

"Instead, I'll handle the trivial matters for you. There's the South Eymond matter, and registering Law Kill too."

"You're registering Law Kill?"

The Five Great Stars, who couldn't find satellites, could register one additional thing besides themselves to the Ivory Tower.

"No matter if it's to punish extreme evil, it's still an ultra-special killing weapon. It needs to be registered with the Ivory Tower to use freely. Otherwise, there'll be tremendous global backlash."

"Ah."

"I'll entrust Law Kill to you. Maybe it's finally found its proper owner..."

It was an unusually sentimental remark.

'Well, for Minerva, Law Kill is...'

It wasn't easy to give someone else an object that contained all the terrible pain and ugly past.

"But what's the wish?"

"Hm?"

"You lost the bet. What's the wish?"

Minerva grinned.

"You seem secretly excited?"

Shirone firmly waved his hands.

"No way. It's better to get hit quickly. It probably won't be a normal wish."

What wish could a Five Great Star have?

"Hmm, fine."

Minerva turned around in the jet and looked at Shirone's lips with honey-dripping eyes.

"What should I do with this?"

Just as Shirone shuddered, Minerva held up two fingers.

"I'll give you a choice. Something that can be done here and now, or something that can only be done later. Choose."

'Something that can be done here and now?'

As Shirone mentally wrote down a list, he gulped and said:

"Something that can only be done later. So things that can be done now but postponed don't count, right?"

"How cunning. Of course, most things I like can be done here. But what if it's something like marriage? That can't be done here."

"...Are you in your right mind?"

Minerva laughed refreshingly.

"Just kidding. Anyway, fine. Something that can only be done later - sold! You promised me?"

"I should at least know what it is."

As the jet penetrated through clouds, Minerva was lost in thought with distant eyes.

"Time Vibration."

"Yes?"

"If someday... if you really get a chance to save everyone..."

At her unusually serious voice, Shirone listened carefully, but she hurriedly shook her head.

"I'd better save it after all. That way you'll worry more, right? I'll tell you when the time comes."

"How can that be? What is it?"

The reason Minerva kept silent was for Shirone's sake, not her own.

'Because you won't be able to accept it.'

Life is suffering.

Though she was traveling with Shirone, her essence was actually closer to Nane's philosophy.

'Don't save me, Shirone.'

That was what she truly wanted to ask.

"Geez, really! If you keep doing this, I'll pretend the wish never happened! It's not like teasing people."

A smile naturally formed at Shirone's grumbling, but tears were gathering in her eyes.

'I need to wipe it away.'

The witch's heart that could never be clean.

'Wipe it away with moonlight.'

As they passed over the Mediterranean, the Akad Desert of the northern continent was approaching in their view.
