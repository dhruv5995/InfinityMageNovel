[627] Banya's Magic (4)

"Boyle!"

While everyone was on guard against Shirone, only Pandora rushed to Boyle's side.

After confirming he was face-down on the ground convulsing, she turned around and shouted.

"Get the medics! He seems to be unconscious!"

She flipped Boyle's body over and tried to secure his airway when a faint sobbing sound leaked out.

"Huk. Heuuk."

Boyle was shedding tears.

The sight of him unable to move even a finger, combined with the gaze of countless spectators, evoked an even more pitiful emotion.

"Why am I..."

Even when he was competing with Pandora for the lead in the advanced class, he couldn't have imagined such a despairing future.

"I did my best..."

The world doesn't want everyone to be happy.

"You worked hard, Boyle."

She wasn't just talking about the one year in the graduating class.

"Make sure you pass, Pandora."

Feeling the sincere empathy in Boyle's last words as he was carried away on a stretcher, Pandora glared at Shirone.

"Kuk!"

The moment her eyes met Shirone's, who was guarding his surroundings without the slightest disturbance, she instinctively had to step back.

'There's no chance in a direct confrontation.'

Though her stomach boiled with anger before the cold reality, the weak had their own methods of combat.

"I understand that feeling."

Mark, who had finished emergency treatment and taken a seat in the audience, said.

"Honestly, I didn't know the gap would be this big."

When Shirone told him to leave, indignation had torn at his chest, but now after witnessing the end of Survival of Extremes, all that remained was a miserable feeling.

"Don't blame yourself too much, Mark. Let's think of it as good experience."

Just as Mark was receiving comfort from Maria and biting his molars while lowering his head, Sadd approached.

"Maria is right."

"Teacher Sadd."

Mark reflexively turned around, but unable to face him, he dropped his head powerlessly again.

"I have to honestly admit it. I did my best. But Senior Shirone and I are on different levels of talent."

"Talent."

Countless people utter the word talent, but not a single person actually claims to possess that talent themselves.

"Maybe such a thing exists. But even if it does, humans aren't such amazing beings, Mark."

Sadd turned his head to look at Shirone and continued.

"No human can create something from nothing. That's not talent. It's just that Shirone's experience, the number of failures, the number of problems he had to solve were overwhelmingly greater than yours."

"Experience... you say?"

"That's right. And now you too have gained precious experience that not just anyone can obtain through today's test."

Mark finally looked back at Sadd.

"Only those who rise from failure become strong. Skill and power aren't everything."

Then a familiar voice interjected.

"You mean a magician who can respond to all variables?"

Sadd turned with a surprised expression, while Mark and Maria shouted with delighted faces.

"Senior Ceriel!"

She was a senior who had graduated from Alpheas Magic School a year earlier and Amy's best friend.

"Hello, Teacher Sadd."

"Yes. It's been a year. I heard you passed the certification. How have you been?"

"I recently got an internship at the World Health Organization."

Mark's eyes widened.

'The World Health Organization. She really did it.'

It was a dream job for healing magicians and also Maria's goal, whom he had a crush on.

"Oh, that's great! Congratulations!"

"Hehe, I was lucky. Many questions I knew came up."

No one could get hired at the World Health Organization through luck alone, which made Ceriel's composure feel like she lived in a different world.

'Is that a professional's aura?'

It wasn't because of her makeup and suit, but confidence oozed from every word and gesture.

"Come find us after the test ends. Everyone will be happy to see you."

"Yes. I'll visit later."

After Sadd left, Ceriel gripped the back of Mark's chair and looked down at the Colosseum.

'Amy. You've finally come back.'

How much guilt had she felt watching Amy, who was eliminated early in the graduation exam a year ago due to the Golden Ring's collusion?

"Senior, please sit here."

As Mark moved aside to offer his seat, Ceriel sat down with her bag on her knees.

"Thank you. By the way, the situation has become interesting."

"Yes. It's really amazing. Senior Shirone reversed the entire situation in an instant. On the other hand, Senior Amy... still doesn't seem to be displaying her true abilities."

At Mark's honest assessment, Ceriel smiled bitterly.

"Her heart is too soft."

"Huh? Senior Amy?"

"She still hasn't made her decision."

Looking at Shirone, who had deployed Force Dimension and was watching enemies in all directions, Amy felt a mix of emotions.

'I wish you had at least said something.'

She knew there was no room for personal feelings in the graduation exam, but right now everyone was Shirone's enemy.

'Even on the day you came to find me...'

Had Shirone been thinking about the current situation?

"Though she seems fiery on the outside, Amy has a softer heart than me. She can't ignore someone who's struggling, and when someone asks for forgiveness, she ends up embracing them even when she knows better."

Hearing Ceriel's words, that was certainly true.

"It must be even more unsettling because it's Senior Shirone."

"But it's okay."

Ceriel proudly watched her best friend engaging in fierce competition in the Colosseum.

"Because Carmis doesn't tolerate mistakes twice."

Amy's red eyes blazed crimson.

'Now it's starting!'

Unlike a year ago when she was eliminated early, the current situation was equal, so there was no need to be nervous anymore.

'I just need to take my own graduation exam!'

Using Amy's movement as a signal flare, the other participants also cast teleportation simultaneously.

As Shirone rotated, Amy's Fire Strike struck Frings, who was targeting Shirone's rear.

'Targeting me?'

Frings, who defended with an ice barrier, tilted his head, while Iruki, Dorothy, and Hersy attacked other participants.

"A new system displaces the existing system."

Baikal's analysis was accurate.

If they couldn't immediately defeat Shirone, there was no need to stubbornly persist at a loss.

Rather, it was more advantageous for passing to use Shirone's system to eliminate other participants.

Only selfish judgment mattered with no room for emotions, and the battle situation began heading toward chaos.

"Damn! What the hell?"

Screamer, who still hadn't made a decision, glared at Shirone amidst the battlefield where combat was breaking out simultaneously.

'It seems like he'd fall with just one hit.'

Everyone knew Shirone was in an exhausted state, but it was also true that they couldn't find a way to break through Quantum Superposition.

'Should I do it? Should I just go for it?'

While Screamer was conflicted, friend-or-foe identification was rapidly taking place in Shirone's mind.

'There are no allies anyway. If they're going to use me, would it be more advantageous for me to strike from behind instead?'

It wasn't a bad choice, but for now there were still more who opposed his system.

'Let's eliminate the neutrals first.'

When Shirone targeted Screamer and charged, the one who had been conflicted just moments before hastily created distance.

'Damn! I can't become a sacrificial lamb.'

Rushing into Force Dimension, the space Shirone dominated, without a plan was tantamount to suicide.

'Hehe, a monster is a monster.'

Though Fermi still had some leeway, he too was merely circling the perimeter, avoiding Shirone's domain.

'Four-dimensional space...'

The Force Dimension Shirone deployed was a miniature version of the upper layers of Estas, where all events existed simultaneously.

The only difference was that the Force Dimension created by Guffin had no limit to overlapping using Stop magic's time mechanism.

'This should be interesting. Shall I try breaking through?'

Judging by the magic Shirone had cast so far, his mental strength gauge was certainly below 10 percent.

'No, not yet.'

Even so, Quantum Superposition's ability was powerful enough that he couldn't guarantee victory, and Fermi wasn't the type to throw himself into uncertain battles.

"So that's Shirone."

Iruki's father Albino said with a smile.

"The fact that 26 people are responding with different methodologies to a system proposed by one person means there's no room to dig deeper."

Amy's father Shacola agreed.

"He's a child with tremendous presence. The phrase 'controlling the battlefield' fits the situation perfectly."

Arganes poked Albino's side.

"Honey, don't just talk about Shirone, analyze Iruki too. You're still his father."

"His thinking is fast. But there's too much of it."

That was the end of his analysis of his son.

"By the way..."

Shacola looked at Shirone, who was the only one who could move freely in the Colosseum.

"The abilities he's showing now would be the reason he could give his all in the first evaluation. Is it improvisation, or was it a calculated strategy from the beginning?"

"Probably both."

Albino's gaze followed Shirone.

"A calculating person would never choose such a strategy. But it's not like he pushed forward without a plan either."

"Then...?"

"He just knows."

Albino could guess Shirone's thoughts.

"He must have experienced countless failures and achieved corresponding successes. When such processes repeat, you naturally come to know. The fact that no matter what difficulties arise, you'll eventually find a solution. You end up believing in yourself."

"...Insight into oneself, is that it?"

"Yes. In Yongroe, they express it as having your skull cracked open. In other words, thoughts flowing freely like water."

Shacola stared at Shirone, who was inducing enemies' reactions while dominating the battlefield.

"Amazing. Certainly Amy..."

"Yes, Iruki..."

Both spoke simultaneously.

"Would fall for him."

Shacola's head turned to Albino.

"What?"

Albino silently smiled while taking in Iruki, who was fighting on Shirone's side.

'This is a good problem, kid. Give it your best shot.'

Calculations raced through Iruki's mind.

'Seven are trying to use Shirone. Eliminating my natural enemy here would be best. The most troublesome opponent is...'

Iruki's gaze targeted Dante.

'You.'

Though Dante was also on the side using Shirone's system, allies had no meaning in such situations anyway.

'Atomic Bomb!'

As explosively chaining flames charged forward, Dante cleanly evaded the explosion's trajectory.

'Right, so you want to do this.'

He had thought since the Royal Magic School that this was an opponent he'd have to face eventually.

Central Calculation Magic Circle: Pascal.

As a full 200 instant magic circles floated around, each emitting different colors, the audience's cheers erupted.

"Now it's really starting."

As various magic poured out through automaton action, Iruki cast teleportation in zigzag patterns.

'Pascal is good magic.'

Iruki's Spirit Zone crashed into Pascal.

'But you can't beat me with logic.'

Overdrive!

As electricity ran wild through the circuits forming his brain, his eyes flashed and Pascal's battery was analyzed instantly.

'Cancellation!'

He thought this would end it.

"What?"

But Pascal was still perfectly intact, raising its 200 eyes to target Iruki.

'Did you put a password on it?'

Security devices using knot theory were triple-layered on Pascal's circuits.

"Did you think I wouldn't prepare?"

As Dante spread both arms and flew over Pascal, 200 amplification magic circles overlapped in tunnel formation.

Ultra-precision Serial Magic Circle: Hundred Ways.

"If you're the pinnacle of logic, then I'm the designer who handles it."

Kiiiiing!

A Fire Strike that passed through 200 magic circles in series was amplified to 189 times its power and fired.
