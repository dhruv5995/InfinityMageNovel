[581] Probability of R (4)

'This is......'

Surrounded by light, Eden felt materialized holiness for the first time in her life.

Without ultimate defensive magic, no one could have such thoughts in front of such overwhelming mass waves.

Though there was no pain or shock, the impossible light output that couldn't have been created by humans transmitted as vibrations through the thin barrier.

When the output suddenly surged at the end of that transcendent vibration, her mind went completely blank.

'I need to escape.'

She didn't know if Scramble Royale had height limits for out-of-bounds rulings, but at this rate, she felt like she'd be blown all the way to space.

'Oh God......'

Eden fixed herself in a space exactly the size of her body.

'Why are you angry?'

As friction increased, the vibrations outside the barrier became extreme.

It sounded like crying.

Not a beast's cry, nor human screams, but something else's wailing.

"Heuuup!"

As long as God existed, Eden's barrier wouldn't be destroyed.

'It's getting stronger.'

But holding her body fixed in space was an entirely different problem.

'I was careless. Damn......!'

In the endlessly intensifying flash, she realized Shirone's calculation.

'She planned to blow me away from the start!'

The chains of divine law holding her broke, and her body departed from its coordinates as if vanishing.

"Ah......"

When she regained consciousness, the cry-like trembling had disappeared.

A vast sea of clouds spread below her body, and a huge moon floated in the night sky above.

"Beautiful."

Everything God created was beautiful.

Even as gravity pulled her body toward the ground, accelerating through the sea of clouds, her eyes didn't waver in the slightest.

'No need to worry.'

Because God would protect her.

"......"

In the quiet mountains after the flash disappeared, Shirone looked up at the sky.

Her gaze belatedly followed the pure white body falling in the most natural position.

She fell head-first with a thud that shook the ground, and dust rose from the deeply carved crater.

Then moments later, Eden emerged without a single hair out of place.

'This woman really is......'

A monster.

When she'd heard about it from Iruki, it hadn't felt real, but experiencing it firsthand made her hair stand on end.

"The strategy was good. But you thought it would be too easy."

In Scramble Royale's out-of-bounds ruling, the height limit was beyond the range of the gravitational field.

She didn't know what would have happened if she'd pushed head-on from the start, but Eden wouldn't submit so easily next time anyway.

'Should I be satisfied with obtaining the Scramble?'

Eden wouldn't attack, so there was no reason to hold this position any longer.

'I need to prepare other countermeasures.'

As she turned with that thought, Eden called out.

"Wait a moment."

Shirone looked back with a puzzled expression.

"That amplification magic from earlier. Compared to when you met Gaold, how is it? Stronger?"

It was incomparable to her power before going to heaven.

"Probably. Why do you ask?"

Eden fell into thought without answering.

"You seem concerned about Gaold. What's the reason? Because you're from the same Yore religion?"

Eden's expression crumpled.

"Where do you get off associating me with that heretic?"

"Heretic?"

"He's one who abandoned God. Mad with mere human lust."

This time Shirone's brow furrowed.

While it might be interpreted that way, Gaold's love for Miro was real.

"Why do you speak that way? If God truly exists, then human emotions are also God's creation."

"Of course. But only under God's care. Gaold killed countless lives for one woman and even threatened all of humanity's lives. All to satisfy his own desires. A disgrace erased from the Yore religion, whose records shouldn't even exist. That's Gaold."

"Is that your omnipotence?"

Eden boldly revealed herself.

"All things are under God's guidance. Therefore, I am invincible without relying on anything."

"You're not invincible."

Shirone thought so.

Though she hadn't found a logical way to break through, if Eden truly thought that way, then even Absolute Barrier wasn't invincible.

"Don't you have any sympathy for Gaold's suffering?"

"Sympathy?"

Eden twisted her lips.

"There's no room for sympathy for one paying the price for abandoning God. I'm stronger than Gaold. I'm proving it right now, aren't I?"

Shirone recalled the memory of Gaold blocking Ataraxia with Vacuum Press in the Magic Association's underground secret bunker.

Unlike Eden's calm expression, the face he'd shown was the extreme of pain.

The totality of all the bad emotions that he had to experience because he was human, because he was a living being.

'Mr. Gaold......'

Perhaps that's why she found herself cheering for him.

Perhaps his suffering seemed more magnificent than a God whose existence was uncertain.

"It's not over yet. No matter how great your defensive magic is, nothing is absolute unless you're God."

"I am God."

Eden placed her hand on her chest.

"That's why it's absolute."

Realizing they'd reached an irreconcilable point, Shirone closed her mouth.

"Come anytime. God neither runs nor hides."

Eden turned and disappeared into the forest.

Returning to her hideout, all she had to do until the next Scramble was summoned was call upon God's name.

'Eden. And Gaold.'

Between the peace God gave and human suffering, Shirone didn't know which was more important.

The second Scramble of the sixth day was summoned, and participants who received their respective missions moved busily.

Dorothy was also accelerating to collect as many Scrambles as possible.

'I need to find 2, no, 3 myself.'

Otherwise, she couldn't catch up to Fisho's speed.

Whooooom!

Zoner's sensitive senses detected vibrations in the air.

'High frequency?'

As Hickory held her and shot into the sky, the tree behind them exploded with a bang.

'It's Hersy.'

Kaiser Gun, a sonic attack magic.

The method of amplifying natural frequencies to explode objects took time but had the advantage of being invisible.

'Why suddenly?'

Hersy's hand was ♤♤♤♤.

At this point when the total number of Scrambles was decreasing, there was a high possibility she hadn't opened.

'She's planning to make me consume my hand.'

To block Hersy's call, Dorothy had no choice but to use the Scrambles stored in Hickory.

'Then!'

Dorothy, prepared for a fold, entered combat mode.

'Cannon Kick (←→→ + Attack)!'

As Hickory charged in a back-kick stance, breaking trees, Hersy's hidden figure was revealed.

'She's not calling. Does she have something in mind?'

Just then, Hersy took a stance with twin pistols while dodging Hickory's attack.

'Double Kaiser Gun.'

As two waves resonated, Hickory's body trembled violently.

'Damn!'

What she'd targeted from the start were the Scrambles Hickory had collected.

Especially with wave-type characteristics, attacks that ignored durability were iron's natural enemy.

'I need to subdue her in time!'

Double Super Rocket Punch (→→→ + Attack, Defense)!

The two rocket punches devastating the forest had murderous power, but Hersy's detection ability was also formidable.

"Targeting the enemy's weakness is basic among basics."

Just as Hickory's frame shook as if about to explode, Sona's magic was forcibly canceled.

'Cancellation?'

"Targeting the enemy's weakness is basic among basics."

As Iruki appeared in the sky, Hersy hastily threw herself aside.

"Gah!"

The rocket punch was pursuing her.

'The battlefield has already been analyzed. Sona is no longer possible.'

Having lost her detection function, Hersy felt isolated in darkness.

'Air Suit!'

Wrapping herself in the basics of defensive magic as much as possible was all she could do.

'Control Mode (Attack + Movement), Maximum Output (→→→→→→).'

As Dorothy's rocket punch struck directly into her abdomen, Hersy's expression crumpled like paper.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Watching Hersy fly off, knocking down trees, Iruki shouted.

"Master Card!"

If Hersy was eliminated, the alliance team would lose their brain.

'Then even with Eden, we can win.'

As Iruki and Dorothy rushed into the forest, the scenery suddenly changed bizarrely.

Jincheonyosul

Lewd Demon.

"Heoeoeoк!"

What they saw wasn't human bodies.

It was the primordial massive desire that had existed since a single cell decided to divide into male and female.

"Heoк! Heoк!"

As the illusion disappeared, Iruki breathed roughly.

'Incredible. This isn't ordinary-level illusion.'

Turning his head, he saw Dorothy looking at him and swallowing hard.

"Ah......"

Iruki, having regained his senses, said.

"Anyway, it's a success. Keep collecting Scrambles. When we reach our target, victory will come."

"Huh? Oh, got it."

As Iruki was about to leave, Dorothy called out.

"Iruki."

"Yeah? Hup!"

As she suddenly kissed him, Iruki's eyes wavered.

Without any promise, both their lips parted simultaneously, and Dorothy, her face flushed, spoke rapidly.

"I'll definitely succeed."

Watching Dorothy fly away with spatial movement, Iruki seemed to lose his sense of direction momentarily, looking around.

"Ah, I need to go to Sabina......"

A flash shot up in the opposite direction from Dorothy.

"Damn Cancellation."

Hersy clutched her aching stomach and grimaced.

Though she'd managed to block it, her abdominal muscles felt torn.

"Are you okay?"

Hersy glared at Anchal.

Though she'd overcome the crisis thanks to her magic again, she couldn't feel satisfied.

'She's definitely strong. Besides Fermi and Lycan, there's probably no one who can subdue her.'

In other words, she was stronger than most teachers working at the school.

"Do you actually intend to do anything? Don't you know you'll have to pay if you lose here?"

"I think I'm doing as much as others."

"That's not what I'm talking about."

"I cast Image Realization on Nade yesterday."

Hersy stopped speaking.

Come to think of it, there had been no movement from Nade since yesterday.

"So what? Do you want praise for pulling off something like that?"

Anchal smiled mockingly.

"You'll understand someday. Just that alone means I've done my part in this match. So don't resent me."

"Wait! What exactly are you...!"

Before Hersy could finish, Anchal cast spatial movement.

The third Scramble was summoned.

'I can't stop Eden right now. Rather than gamble, let's collect one more Scramble.'

Since there was no guarantee she'd yield as meekly as in the morning, Shirone bypassed coordinates where Eden was expected to be.

"Huh?"

Suddenly, sacred mist spread everywhere, and a tomb built in Eastern style cracked open.

Jincheonyosul

Middle Heaven Realm.

The sound of a coffin opening was heard, and Anchal walked out of the tomb.

"I've been waiting, Shirone."

Having already experienced illusions, Shirone tensed up.

'Anchal's hand is......'

As if reading her thoughts, Anchal pulled out a Master Card and threw it on the ground.

"What are you doing?"

"I have no intention of attacking you. I want to talk."

The secret agreement she'd heard from Amy came to mind.

'If Anchal withdraws, it's definitely advantageous. But......'

Shirone's decision was the same as Amy's.

"Pick up the Master Card."

"I haven't said anything yet."

"I don't want to hear it. I don't know what you were thinking when you participated, but let's fight fair and square."

"You'll need my help. If you investigate Estas alone, you'll die."

"If you're talking about upper-level rumors, I'm not interested."

"The Great Purifier. If you led the third initialization, it's not entirely unrelated to you, is it?"

Shirone's eyebrow twitched.

'Just who is this woman?'

After surveying the surroundings, Anchal carefully approached and brought her mouth to Shirone's ear.

Though she'd blocked the area with magic, information security was a spy's basic skill.

"Estas is......"

Hearing Anchal's words, Shirone's eyes widened and her heart began beating wildly.

After organizing his thoughts, he slowly opened his mouth.

"......What do you want?"

"Companionship. Let's enter Estas together."

Anchal, having dispelled the Middle Heaven Realm, tore the Master Card in half and disappeared into the forest.

"Come find me when the match ends. I'll be waiting."

Anchal.

Scramble Royale forfeit.
