The Sin That Could Not Be Connected (2)

Armin also knew that he wasn't underestimating Ryan's abilities.

'It's established fact that no one can match a Maha knight when it comes to sword power.'

However, when it came to technique alone, Kuan's movement could be called the strongest in all of humanity.

'Bypassing Harvits' perception. If Kuan can't do it, no one can.'

With Sein's Wheel Eyes and Mayray's ability 'God's Frequency' added to the mix, it wasn't impossible.

'Even if it's just a 1% chance, it's worth attempting. Harvits is that kind of person.'

Remove the ultimate evil, and the war ends.

"I have something to confess before we go," Mayray said.

"Terraforce is fundamentally a race that pursues good. But if good and evil engage in all-out war, they will no longer interfere in human affairs."

Sein said, "I know. Terraforce will judge humanity, and if evil wins, they'll destroy everything. Though I wonder what meaning there would be after good has already lost..."

Armin said, "So once the all-out war between good and evil begins, you won't be able to use the 'God's Frequency' ability either."

"Yes. This might be our last chance. That's why I want to do it now."

"Do what?"

Instead of answering, Mayray extended her hand toward Dante.

"Do you happen to have an awl or something sharp?"

Dante walked to the desk and threw an awl used for making document files from the drawer.

"Thank you."

Catching the handle, Mayray aimed the awl's tip at her ear canal and continued speaking.

"The irregular God's Frequency is activated by blocking the ears. It cuts off the world's vibrations and accepts only Terraforce's frequency. But blocking with hands has limitations. Noise gets mixed in."

Stopping there, Mayray inserted the awl into her ear canal and pierced through her eardrum.

Then she slowly twisted it, causing her nerves to spasm and her eyelids to flutter.

But that was the only change, and Mayray pulled out the awl with a calm expression.

"Now it's done."

Blood gushed from her ear canal, dripping down along her earlobe.

"If it were just hearing sounds, there wouldn't be a problem, but the vibrations of the heart are quite sensitive. Having lost my right hearing, I should be able to hear a bit more clearly."

Dante caught the awl Mayray threw back and swung his arm, splattering blood on the floor.

Sein, who took on the role of commander, checked the time.

"Alright, let's depart then. Hell's army is advancing toward Tormia. We need to eliminate Harvits before then."

Just as the assassination task force was following Sein out the door, Dante called out to one person.

"Lilia."

"Yeah?"

"Be careful."

Lilia burst into laughter.

"Oh please, don't worry..."

Suddenly realizing something, Lilia turned back to Dante.

"You're really strange today. This isn't your style at all."

"What isn't?"

"Why are you being so serious, you who are the coolest person in the world? You're most attractive when you do things your own way."

Her cheeks turned slightly red, but Lilia returned to a serious expression and said,

"I don't know what you're thinking, but don't get swept away by emotions. Be yourself. It scares me."

The joke about dying when your personality suddenly changes had some truth to it in the law.

"Right."

Only after seeing Dante's relaxed smile did Lilia nod with apparent relief.

"Well then, I'll be back."

The door closed, and Dante returned to the shadows by the wall, sat on a box, and lit another cigarette.

'Iruki.'

They weren't particularly close, but that made the thought of having a drink together linger even more.

"Need to have some snacks ready."

Having made his decision, Dante sprang up and headed for the door when security team's deputy leader Ena bowed her head.

"Team leader, I have something to report. The activation code for the bioweapon..."

"Ms. Ena will handle it."

Ena, who was flipping through documents, looked up.

"What? What do you mean...?"

"I'm delegating all of Loph's authority to you. You won't need a handover, will you, Ms. Ena?"

Since the Fire Tribe would control the bioweapon anyway, it didn't matter who was entrusted with opening the code.

"Uh, excuse me..."

Ena's eyes darted around before she realized it was a promotion and accepted.

"What will you do, team leader?"

Despite his cool smile, Dante's eyes burned with fighting spirit.

"To the battlefield."

He wouldn't hide deep underground fiddling with code fragments.

"I'm so pissed I could go crazy."

Omega Year 892.

Leading Eden's residents, whose numbers had grown over the long years, Guffin entered heaven once again.

But the angels hadn't just been enjoying peace either.

"Why?"

Kariel, who had analyzed Gaian technology through Babel, had created numerous ancient weapons.

"Why did you come back?"

Since this would surely be different from previous wars, Ikael found Guffin's return both welcome and terrible.

"To fight again? Aren't you sick of it? Accept your limits. Humans have already lost."

War is where the victor takes everything.

"Heaven has mastered all human technology and developed it further. Even if you fight again, the result will be the same."

Ashur finally arrived.

"Lord Ikael."

Before he could even catch his breath, he confirmed Guffin's face and likewise gritted his teeth.

'Is the war between gods and humans starting again?'

Whether he knew Ashur's thoughts or not, Guffin cheekily spread both arms and asked,

"Did you miss me? You looked like you were getting teary-eyed."

Ikael couldn't understand.

"You're saying that now? You don't think our past disappeared just because time has passed, do you?"

"You're misunderstanding something. We didn't come to fight."

"Huh?"

Ikael blinked for a moment, lost in thought, then subtly showed signs of joy.

"...Are you saying you'll surrender?"

If the Gaians raised the white flag, she could at least elevate their status as much as possible.

"No. We don't acknowledge Ankera."

Feeling like he was toying with her, Ikael raised her voice.

"You're not here to fight but you want to become god? Are you trying to play word games with me right now?"

"Maybe so." Guffin extended his hand.

"As the representative of the Gaians, I request a meeting with Ankera. Take me to Ra."

Not only Ikael but also the numerous angels who had already arrived stood with their mouths agape.

"You want to meet... directly?"

"Yes. I know best how long our war has been, having fought every battle. I don't want to continue this ridiculous war of attrition anymore. The reason I came back is to settle things with Ra."

Methiel shouted,

"A lowly human dares to seek an audience with god? Even angels cannot see that being without a summons!"

"If you refuse..."

Fire lit in Guffin's eyes, and the Gaians' idea expanded massively, piercing the sky.

"We'll do it again, that's all."

Most angels showed hostility, but none expressed it aloud.

'Even if heaven has the advantage...'

Those are Gaians.

Memories of battles carved over eons passed through the angels' minds.

'Every time we thought it was over, they stubbornly reversed the situation. That's the most annoying part.'

Fight or compromise?

While the angels had mixed thoughts, Ikael stepped forward as their representative.

"You who deny god want to meet god? No words will be able to persuade that being."

"I can do it."

Ikael's eyebrows twitched.

"I'll stay."

As the angels stirred, Ikael focused all her attention on Guffin.

"I'll give up becoming god. Instead, let the remaining Gaians go. Would this be enough for negotiation?"

"Uh..."

Ikael realized she needed to understand Ankera's intentions first and stopped speaking.

"Good."

Her voice was amplified through Ataraxia, which symbolized the archangel's power.

"I'll arrange the meeting. However, only you may participate in the talks."

"That's enough."

When Guffin looked back, the Gaians filling the earth simultaneously cut their links.

Since war might begin depending on the meeting's outcome, the angels also held their positions.

Guffin rose into the sky and approached Ikael.

"Shall we go then?"

"Hmph."

She turned away coldly, but her face was crumpled as she quickly moved away.

'Sigh.'

Why was she acting like this?

'After this person disappeared, how much did I regret?'

If only she had held on a little stronger at the last moment, if only she had honestly thrown her heart out there.

Guffin, who had approached her side, said,

"You look like you have something to say."

"That..."

Ikael's lips moved, but as if her throat was blocked, no words came out.

"If you end up staying in heaven, are you thinking of living together with us?"

She newly realized how difficult it was to put heart into sound.

"Hmm."

Guffin nodded.

"Probably so."

"I see..."

Though it was somehow an insufficient answer, a faint smile formed on Ikael's lips as she turned her head back.

"You thought well. I'll help you a lot."

Unaware that Guffin's eyes were filled with sadness, Ikael arrived at Arabot.

Upon reaching the top floor where Ankera resided, she prostrated herself before the door.

"Ankera, Maclaine Guffin, representative of the Gaians, has requested a meeting."

The door slowly opened, and Ankera's drumbeat-like pulsing sound leaked out.

===

The sight of a giant mass of flesh beating like a heart was grotesque, but Guffin wasn't surprised.

Ikael brightened up and stood.

"The meeting has been granted. You must be courteous. Come find me when it's over."

"Ikael."

Ikael, who was about to leave, turned around.

"What is it?"

Though they had fought fiercely for vast periods of time, this was the first time she'd seen Guffin with such a sad expression.

'Well, he has to give up what he wanted so much.'

Ikael comforted him.

"Don't be too sad. There are ways to live happily together with us. Lord Ankera too..."

"Hearts are connected."

Guffin tapped his chest twice, then extended his index finger pointing at Ikael.

"I hope you'll carry it on too."

"What do you mean by that?"

Ikael tilted her head and asked, but Guffin turned without answering and approached Ankera.

"Wait! Guffin...!"

The moment she reached out her hand, the stone door slammed shut, blocking her view.

It was a sacred, inviolable domain.

"Ankera."

As Guffin walked toward the giant monster that reached the ceiling, its pulsing momentarily stopped.

Making drum sounds, the center of the hide split horizontally, and an eyeball bulged out.

"Mac... tick! Clai... tick! ne..."

Nerve endings from all directions made grating sounds as they tuned the vocal vibrations.

"Guffin."

The finally stabilized voice was majestic and quiet enough to be called the voice of god.

"You who have deceived the world and denied the law, why do you seek me?"

"You know, don't you? I'll leave the photon system. There's a way not to destroy the world. So let all Gaians except me leave."

"I refuse."

Ankera was firm.

"You have caused trouble in every moment of time. I do not trust your words."

"That's why you're not god."

A very long silence followed.

"...What do you mean?"

"Not being able to trust means not knowing. If you don't know about me, then you're not god. So how about we settle who the true god is here?"

"Settle?"

Looking at his own reflection in Ankera's pupil, Guffin spread both arms.

"Devour me."
