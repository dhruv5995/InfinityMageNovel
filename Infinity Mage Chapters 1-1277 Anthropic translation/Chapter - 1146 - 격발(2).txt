Trigger (2)

"Over there! All-out attack!"

Watching demons gathering from all directions, Minerva extended her hand.

"Can you stand up?"

The moment Shirone grasped her hand, a loud bang echoed from behind her.

Her transportation method, Jet, was flying toward them at tremendous speed, piercing through the demons.

"Damn it! Don't let them escape!"

The moment Minerva grabbed Jet with her hand, both their bodies shot up into the sky.

"Hohoho! Try to catch us if you can!"

Flying demons belatedly covered the sky as they flew after them, but they couldn't match Jet's speed.

Having escaped the enemy's range, the two circled in the sky, wary of pursuit.

Shirone, who had wrapped one arm around Minerva's waist, examined where the sword had pierced through.

Minerva asked.

"Are you okay? How did that happen to you?"

"Baal got me."

"To block Deadly Cross, I had no choice but to take at least one hit. But this... it's not healing well."

If even Miracle Stream could only manage this much, other healing magic would be useless.

Minerva said.

"It's an ability called Gangui, right? It's because killing intent is embedded in the wound. Normally, it would be instant death."

"Baal will come back."

"Recovery comes first. Let's go to the hideout. There's a place my subordinates use."

"...Yes."

Having shaken off their pursuers, Minerva turned Jet toward the deep mountain ranges of the Huig occupied territory.

Shirone, walking down the corridor of Delta headquarters, frowned and touched his abdomen.

The wound he'd received at the Ivory Tower was throbbing.

"Ow."

Though no actual sword wound had formed, he could clearly feel the quantum aftereffects.

'An injury to one finger doesn't affect the other fingers. But the pain is felt by the whole.'

Using that analogy, depending on the severity of the injury, the whole could die.

"Phew."

Wanting to rest for a moment, Shirone leaned his back against the wall and looked at the sunset outside the window.

'The day is ending.'

Though no one in the Holy War would be able to sleep anyway.

"Mr. Shirone."

A beautiful voice echoed through the quiet corridor where most had left for dinner.

It was Miss Arachne, Barho Rangi.

'Come to think of it...'

Though they had quite a connection, the feeling of encountering her in the Holy War was completely different.

'Arachne's strength is the honey trap. And she stands at the core of that strategy.'

Why had she approached him?

As if reading Shirone's wariness, Rangi made an earnest expression and requested.

"Let's go somewhere quiet. I have something to tell you."

"...Alright."

Miracle Stream enveloped them and instantly flew through the window into the sky.

Rangi trembled upon arrival.

"Huh!"

Beyond where clouds spread like cotton blankets, a coin-sized sun lingered.

"No one will be able to hear us here."

The fact that her mind was dizzy enough to not even dare encourage lies was secondary.

Rangi said.

"I also attended Arachne's banquet. And... the person I entertained was Gis."

Shirone's expression became serious.

"Yes. The tracking article published in the newspaper - I'm the one who provided that tip."

The reporter's name was Meikl.

"The reaction was more explosive than expected, but we couldn't bring down Gis. Because there wasn't enough credibility."

Shirone just listened.

"But if I step forward, I can definitely bring him down. Tonight, I'm meeting Meikl. An article with my name on it will spread through tomorrow's newspaper."

"Why?"

As far as he knew, Jive and Arachne were allies.

"Arachne also suffered losses from that incident. To bear damage to your own country while..."

He realized it then.

"So that's how you could do it."

"Yes. From the beginning, Arachne intended to bring down Jive. The success or failure of honey traps seems to depend on strategy, but that's not actually the case."

Rangi smiled bitterly.

"The side with nothing to lose ultimately wins."

"If we bring down Jive, our side's compensation is certain. I can't tell you which country though. The problem is... regardless of that, I'm going to die."

It was something that could be easily predicted.

"They talk about asylum and identity laundering, but there's no way they'll just leave someone who knows the truth of that day alone. I'll either disappear without a trace or be murdered disguised as suicide. If you say that's paranoia, I have nothing to say but..."

Rangi looked back at Shirone.

"It's better to have as much insurance as possible. Just the fact that Mr. Shirone knows will make the pressure from my own country much weaker."

"Do you want me to make it public?"

"Yes. Please lend me Mr. Shirone's name. If you let me include it in the article, I'll take responsibility for bringing down Gis."

For Shirone, who had been deeply troubled by Flu's problem, this might be a decent outcome.

'But can I trust her? If she has ulterior motives for approaching me just like Gis...'

Shirone muttered.

"Mica."

A voice pierced his mind.

_Yes.

'Is Ms. Rangi lying?'

I cannot make value judgments. Her brain waves and heart rate are at consistent levels.

Supernatural senses provide all mathematical information in real time, but interpretation is up to the observer.

For example, Mica could track all keywords related to 'death' at this moment. But she couldn't tell whether the emotion contained in words like 'kill' was sincere or joking.

'Anyway, her current brain waves and heart rate are consistent. I can use this as a baseline to detect changes.'

Above all, bringing down Gis would be good for Tormia too.

"I'll allow it."

Returning to Delta around sunset, Shirone crossed over to the Tormia sector.

Opening the door to the think tank, Rufist was receiving a report from Flu, who had just arrived.

"After that conversation, we had dinner and parted. The next appointment is tomorrow afternoon."

Albino nodded.

"It seems like he's somewhat taken the bait. Though there still seems to be some wariness."

Though Shirone roughly guessed the context of the conversation, he sat down without saying anything.

'The bomb will explode tomorrow morning. Flu won't be able to meet Gis anyway.'

Not knowing Shirone's intentions, Rufist rather looked at him strangely.

'I thought he'd come charging in like before. Don't tell me he actually understood my words and decided to follow them?'

No, that couldn't be.

'He's not the type to give up either. Something new must have come up. Of course, he won't tell me...'

Seeing that Albino's expression was also unusual, Rufist devised a strategy.

"Intelligence from the National Intelligence Service."

He intended to probe Shirone's mind.

"It contains information investigating Gis's preferences. It's a bit ridiculous, but it's top secret. The pervert is indeed a pervert. Read it once. You'll be able to establish behavioral countermeasures."

Flu quickly skimmed through the document's contents.

There didn't seem to be any particular change in emotion, which was a natural reaction to Rufist.

"Twenty guards are always protecting Gis's side. Even when he sleeps with entertainers."

Flu passed the document.

"Shinjang. Even among the Holy War's 12 nations, they're guards with exceptional reaction speed. Assassination would be difficult."

When there was still no reaction from Shirone, Rufist finally couldn't hold back and asked.

"Are you okay? I thought you'd be jumping around frantically. You really hated this strategy."

"I still do. But there's nothing I can do about it. Even if I tried to stop it, you wouldn't listen. And regarding this matter, cooperating with Tormia has been postponed, hasn't it?"

Rufist realized.

'There's something.'

Drawing a line with Tormia meant it was more convenient to move individually.

'Actually, we didn't finalize it this way in the afternoon meeting. Something must have happened in between.'

He wanted to ask directly, but to get an answer, he'd have to give up the honey trap.

'Hmm.'

Rufist's thoughts deepened.

Having introduced mage Lilia to his subordinate, Dante immediately began investigation work.

"Look at this document."

Lilia glanced through the document and immediately put it down.

"I don't know about intelligence."

"That's why I explained everything. Tell me which of the several patterns I've presented this falls under."

She carefully examined the document again and finally nodded as if she understood.

"So that's it. You understand that the information has changed, but you don't know why it changed?"

"Exactly."

"But for something like this, there's a perfect person. Mr. Shirone. He's mastered both information and law."

Dante lit a cigarette.

"That's true, but I need to be able to trust him. No, I trust him, but I can't trust him."

"...I roughly understand. But that's the same for me. I can't fight for the kingdom. The reason I came here is solely for humanity's peace."

"It's fine, just classify that."

Since Lilia couldn't decode the cipher, he could feel secure entrusting her with the work.

It would be a lie to say he wasn't conflicted...

'Yeah, this is right. If I left it to Shirone, he'd decode everything with Ultima.'

They weren't enemies, but what they pursued was different.

"Alright. I'll try." Lilia took out a pen and turned the document.

"Hmm. This is a good omen, and this is a case where fortune turned to disaster. In this section, great fortune continues..."

If Dante's analyzed information was perfect, Lilia's words wouldn't be wrong.

'It's similar to weather prediction.'

Dante pretended to smoke while decoding the cipher of the document she was analyzing.

'So that's what it was.'

He finally understood the meaning contained in the incident.

"It went greatly wrong at this point. You say there's interference, this red line here."

Lilia's hand, which had been quickly turning pages, suddenly stopped at a certain page.

After quite a while of silence, Dante extinguished his cigarette and asked.

"What's wrong?"

"This... it's a malevolent killing star. An enormous great misfortune that would dry up all the good omens that have been building up."

"Let me see for a moment."

Sensing the seriousness of the situation, Dante snatched the document and began reading the cipher.

'It's an alliance code. The alliance structure of 11 nations against the Moon Kingdom. Why would this be bad?'

From Dante's analysis, the currently most dangerous nation was the Paras Kingdom in the Middle East.

Lilia added.

"Not just the great misfortune, but it's the first law that underwent the greatest change through pyramid construction. The information at the very bottom. I don't know what it is, but it's growing the misfortune into great misfortune."

Dante silently checked that location.

'Alliance code... Kashan.'

This is what they called the meeting of kings.

"Code One."

This carried a completely different weight from Code Two, where officials made contact, and Code Four.

"Prepare for everything."

Moon Dragon opened the door to the temporary barracks 20 kilometers from Delta and entered.

"Welcome, King of the Moon."

Uorin, sitting at the end of the round table, smiled and offered the seat across from her.

Un-ryong bowed with cupped hands.

"For Your Majesty the Empress to come personally brings honor to my face. Thank you for your bold decision."

"I was actually a bit surprised that the Moon Kingdom would propose Code One. But..."

Maids brought wine.

"I believed you wouldn't disappoint. Because you're someone with great boldness."

Un-ryong's lips curled up.

"Let's have a drink."

Though Kashan was among the top contenders of the Holy War's 12 nations, he was confident.

'She absolutely cannot refuse.'

The enormous malevolent star.
