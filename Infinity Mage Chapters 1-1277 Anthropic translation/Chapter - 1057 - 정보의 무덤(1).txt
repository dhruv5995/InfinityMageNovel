Grave of Information (1)

Though Wizard's tearful face was cute, Shirone read the desperation in that expression.

'She's really frustrated.'

Having already opened his time-explosion sense, Shirone knew how difficult it was.

'Humans are fundamentally programmed to perceive time based on light signals. To destroy that...'

The fundamental parts of the brain would have to change.

"Alright."

Color returned to Wizard's face, but Shirone said something unexpected.

"Training ends here. Your resolve seems sufficient, so let's open your time-explosion sense now."

"What do you mean?"

Since the flow of time is merely a brain's illusion, suddenly opening the time-explosion sense could be dangerous.

If the present is destroyed, there would be neither past nor future.

"The reason I gave you a day was for this moment. You need to think every possible thought about time so you can cope when the shock of broken common sense hits."

Shirone turned to look at Ikael.

"This is my mother, Ikael. An archangel's senses are far superior to humans'. From now on, you'll experience the process of mental resonance with her."

"Mother?"

Wizard craned her neck all the way back.

With her small stature, it was difficult to see the face of Ikael, who was over 2 meters tall.

"Nice to meet you. You must be Wizard."

When Ikael bowed her head and smiled with her eyes, Wizard's mouth fell slightly open.

'Amazing.'

A special dignity that transcended human aesthetic standards was embodied in her form.

The teachers and students felt similarly.

'An angel. Impossible.'

It was the moment when rumors that Shirone's birth mother wasn't human were proven in reality.

"Ahem."

Principal Nikolai approached with a fake cough.

"I've heard about the possession, but won't it be dangerous? Since I'm in a position where I must protect students..."

Though he spoke with Wizard's parents in mind, there seemed to be another reason for bringing up the conversation.

Ikael smiled and said:

"Since Shirone says it's okay, there shouldn't be any major issues. If it becomes dangerous, I'll stop it."

"Haha, not just the student, but you too must guarantee it, Ikael. You're a great star of humanity."

"You're too kind. Thank you."

Shirone watched Nikolai's smile stretch from ear to ear and narrowed his eyes.

'Could it be...?'

Amy poked his side.

"What are you worried about? Everyone has that level of interest, they just can't show it. Besides, looking at her, your mother has no interest at all."

"I know. It's just..."

Shirone had no prejudice.

He simply knew how much Ikael had loved Guffin and how happy she had been.

"Then let's begin."

Ikael stroked Wizard's head.

"Trust yourself. That's the same as trusting me. From now on, I'll absorb the photon body into your head. We'll think as one mind, and in that process, you should be able to awaken your time-explosion sense."

Shirone added:

"Remember that the present exists in the heart."

As Wizard nodded and tightly closed her eyes, Ikael absorbed the photon body.

"Gasp."

The child's chest swelled greatly, and light leaked through her trembling eyelids.

Though the surroundings remained quiet, a thunderous conversation was surely taking place in Wizard's brain.

"Hnnngh!"

After her eyelids, her shoulders began trembling, and finally her whole body started vibrating as if electrocuted.

At the peak of that vibration, Wizard opened her eyes.

"Aaaaah!"

As the barriers of time shattered, past, future - everything was being perceived as present.

'I have to grasp it here!'

Focusing on her heart, the time-explosion sense calmed and she felt her existence clearly.

"Hah! Hah!"

After breathing roughly for a moment, she opened her eyes wide at the newly opened sense.

"Huh? What?"

The present was too long.

What would it feel like to live the past, which had already passed for others, as if it were the present?

"You succeeded."

"Teacher."

Wizard, who had been approaching Shirone, stopped at the suddenly felt killing intent.

"Now for the next stage."

Shirone floated Hand of God above his head and spoke in a cold voice.

"You're going to dodge my attack."

Since Wizard didn't act spoiled during training, she immediately nodded.

"Here I come."

A giant fist of light flew at her.

Wizard's face turned pale at the speed and power that was on a completely different level from previous training.

"Wait...!"

CRASH!

As Hand of God struck the ground with a roar, her body was crushed like an ant.

The corner of Shirone's mouth rose slightly.

"Pass."

That was within a second.

"Hehe, thank you."

What remained in reality was the sight of master and disciple looking at each other with affectionate eyes.

Arriving at Kesia's capital, Shirone looked around the quiet, deserted streets.

'It looks like a ghost town.'

Only the countless human presences felt from inside buildings denied that fact.

The last time he had come to Kesia, it had been a place where murder, plunder, and arson were daily occurrences.

'What method did they use?'

Since there wasn't a single person living normally, even rumors hadn't circulated.

'Anyway, it seems certain they stopped the emotional disease. No, this can't even be called stopping it.'

Shirone stopped in front of a high-rise building with the Golden Ring's symbol hanging from its spire.

Through the glass windows, people in suits were walking around conducting business.

That scene, contrasted with the empty streets, gave Shirone an eerie feeling.

"Hello."

He spoke while feeling air colder than outside, but no one turned around.

Looking closely, all their eyes were vacant.

"Who...?"

A woman who seemed relatively normal approached, struggling to maintain her gait.

"Ah, I'm called Shirone. Is Fermi here by any chance?"

Reflexively, all the employees turned their heads, and slurred words followed.

"Shirone? Fermi?"

They're not in their right minds, Shirone thought.

"This way, please."

At the voice from the stairway, he turned to see a man with clear eyes adjusting his glasses.

"You are..."

Fermi's secretary, whom he had seen before, was staring intently at his wristwatch.

"You arrived 20 minutes earlier than expected. Well, this incident was excavated 20 days ago. I'll guide you. Mr. Fermi is waiting."

With only incomprehensible talk, Shirone followed the man into the elevator.

Arriving at the 17th floor, Fermi was waiting in an office filled with floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Shirone."

Looking much more refined than before, he spread both arms as if meeting an old friend.

"What happened?"

Since they weren't close enough to catch up, Fermi awkwardly lowered his arms.

"Sit down first. While having some tea..."

"How did you know I was coming? Why didn't the emotional disease spread? Why is no one on the streets?"

Fermi chuckled.

"You have many questions. Well, that makes sense. There are probably parts where your memory was erased too."

"Memory."

According to the Terraforce Chief Justice, Shirone had voluntarily destroyed his memories.

"Shall I tell you?"

Fermi smiled like a crack.

"How about it? You must be curious too. If you want, I could tell you what kind of deal we made."

This is why he disliked Fermi.

'But that's precisely why... I can believe that I made a deal with Fermi.'

He was indeed capable.

"Never mind. I'd rather know the full story of Kesia. What method did you use to stop the emotional disease?"

"Hmm."

Fermi, who had been thinking with his chin in his hand, pointed to the door.

"Want to see for yourself?"

The place he took Shirone was a ward where orphaned children were intoxicated with a drug called Angel.

"Hah. Hah."

At the faint moans of pleasure escaping from a young child's throat, Shirone trembled.

"What... is this?"

"A special drug I created. You saw it when you came before, right? After several stages of clinical trials, I finally created it. Angel's tears, Angel. With this, we can suppress the emotional disease."

As soon as he finished speaking, Shirone grabbed Fermi by the collar and pulled him close.

"Are you insane?"

Fermi only stared coldly.

"They're not even ten years old. You used drugs on these children? Do you even know what you've done?"

"I know."

Fermi opened his mouth.

"What about you? Have you brought anything better to the world than this current situation?"

Sparks flew from Shirone's eyes, but he couldn't completely dismiss Fermi's voice.

"That doesn't mean this result is better."

"Result? Don't be ridiculous. Are you high on shouldering all of humanity's burdens?"

"All life ends in death. That's the only result given to us. Guys like you who dream of a hopeful future might be necessary in the world, but please face reality."

"...How did you do it?"

Shirone's grip loosened.

"What kind of drug can stop the emotional disease? Seriel failed even after testing all drugs."

"Of course she had to fail. No cure has been developed. Not yet, anyway."

Shirone felt like grabbing the collar he had released again.

"Explain so I can understand."

"How do you think I knew you would arrive within today?"

"I don't know."

"Then let me show you."

Fermi gestured for him to follow and took the elevator down to the 2nd floor.

When the door marked "Recovery Room" opened automatically, 200 beds with people lying on them came into view.

"Huh?"

Shirone saw someone he knew.

"Sister Marsha?"

Despite his quite loud voice, Marsha remained motionless, deep in sleep.

Shirone turned to Fermi.

"What happened? Don't tell me you used Angel..."

"Don't worry. Of course we're administering it constantly, but not to a degree that interferes with daily life. More importantly, isn't where these people are more significant?"

"Where they are?"

Listening to Fermi's words, it seemed he didn't simply mean the recovery room.

Shirone suddenly realized.

"Don't tell me?"

When he had awakened after eliminating Valhalla Action's debt, Miro had told him something.

"Shall we go check the excavation situation?"

Fermi pointed to an empty bed and tossed a pill as small as a bean.

"What's this?"

"Dream Star. You know it, right? Ah, was that memory erased too? You really are thorough."

"I've taken this drug before?"

Shirone examined the Dream Star closely but felt no sense of déjà vu.

"Yes. You insisted on seeing it directly, so we went together. Well, that was when I was struggling alone, but anyway. Will you do it or not?"

Lost in thought, Shirone clutched the pill and followed Fermi to the bed.

Lying side by side on empty beds, Shirone sat up and asked:

"What happens when I take this drug?"

"You escape from dreams and enter the Under Coder. Before that, address matching... no, just take it first. You roughly know the mechanism. You did it in one try before too."

'Under Coder.'

When Fermi lay down on the bed first, Shirone also put the Dream Star in his mouth and swallowed.

The sleeping agent on the pill's surface dissolved in his stomach first, making his mind hazy.

Though he could wake up anytime by forcibly stimulating his brain, Shirone surrendered his body to the drug's effects.

As his sense of reality disappeared...

"Huh?"

The dream sensation of being buried among countless corpses connected with Shirone's five senses.
