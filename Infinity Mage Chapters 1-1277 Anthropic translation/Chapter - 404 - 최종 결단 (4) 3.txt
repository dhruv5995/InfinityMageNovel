[404] Final Decision (4)

Shirone's team gathered in the park after a long time to discuss their schedule during the break.

If the second half of the graduation year would be more intense than the first half, it would be better to establish strategies for it starting now.

"Last year I trained alone, but I found out there were kids who formed teams to do it. So how about we also create a group and do training camp together?"

Since this was something only Amy, who had experienced the graduation year, could easily think of, the friends were also considering it positively.

Iruki raised a finger as if something was bothering him and said.

"Of course, if it comes to hill occupation or interpersonal combat categories, students with teams would be advantageous. But do you know? Only 10 people pass anyway. Even if we form a team, to get into the final 10, we'll have to compete against each other. In other words, how much information should we share?"

If one had prepared a trump card, it was human nature to want to save it until before the graduation exam.

While a 2-person team might be different, a situation where all 5 members pass would be close to a miracle, so this was an issue that needed to be clearly addressed.

Amy hadn't brought this up without knowing either.

"I thought that way until last year too. But we don't necessarily need to use the entire vacation period. We can gather first and focus on basic training, then research finishing moves individually afterward."

Amy argued that strengthening teamwork might increase the pass rate more than researching finishing moves.

The reason was that Fermi was currently controlling the graduation class, and all of Shirone's group were on his bad side.

Since they couldn't know what situation would unfold on the day of the graduation exam, sticking together was the only way to reduce variables.

"I think Amy's words are right."

Nade was unconditionally in favor.

Actually, he didn't really care about the graduation exam, but training with friends would be tens of thousands of times more enjoyable than enduring several months in his terrible home.

"How about this? Let's do a short-term training camp for about a month, but adopt the graduation class system. We set daily targets and score each other."

Iruki nodded as if convinced.

"You mean maintain the graduation class routine. That's a good method. We can increase achievement in a short time and use the remaining time to train our individual finishing moves."

Even while various opinions were being presented, Shirone kept his mouth shut. He was just taking in each of his friends' faces one by one.

Nothing had been decided yet, but the feeling was strange.

If he had to recall something at the last moment of his life, wouldn't it be the faces of the friends gathered here now?

"Huh? Maya, are you sick somewhere?"

Shirone, who finally looked at Maya, asked in surprise.

Maya didn't look well. Her face was pale as if frightened, and her chest was rising and falling roughly as if she was having difficulty breathing.

Nade, who belatedly noticed Maya's condition, asked worriedly.

"Are you okay, Maya? Should I take you to the infirmary?"

Maya quickly shook her head.

Then, like someone returning from amnesia, she suddenly lifted her head and looked at Shirone, saying.

"Shirone."

"Yeah?"

"I love you."

Silence fell over the park bench.

Nade had his mouth open, and Iruki was blinking rapidly. Only Amy was waiting for Shirone's reaction with a calm expression.

Shirone, who had been staring intently at Maya, gulped.

This time it wasn't a joke. Her emotions, which had been falling drop by drop like water each day, had somehow formed a lake in his heart.

"Uh, well... should we step aside for a bit?"

Maya shook her head again and said.

"I don't think I could muster courage a second time, so I wanted to say it where everyone was present. I'm sorry, Shirone. But I've come to love you. Please accept my feelings."

Maya took out a letter from her pocket. It smelled of flowers.

"Will you read it?"

After handing the letter to Shirone, she stood up from the bench, avoiding everyone's gaze.

"I'll hear your answer then."

After Maya left with those cryptic words, Nade glanced at Amy. Even facing this situation, she maintained her poker face without any disturbance.

Amy, who had walked behind the bench, poked her face over Shirone's shoulder.

"How nice. Getting confessed to by a girl and all. What does it say?"

It would be rude to show around Maya's sincere letter.

But considering the subtle relationship between Shirone and Amy, it wasn't necessarily something that could be definitively said must be done.

When Shirone hesitated, Amy smiled and lightly patted his shoulder.

"I'm joking. Why are you so serious? You knew Maya liked you."

"No, it's just so sudden..."

"Go to your room quickly and read it alone. Read it two, three times. Then do what you want. Maya's a good kid. I'll go ahead. See you tomorrow. Bye."

Amy rattled off her words without pause and left.

Only her face was calm, but her voice was angry, and her behavior was awkward beyond measure.

"Hey, what are you going to do? Do you have someone you've already decided on?"

Shirone looked into the distance while holding the letter.

Amy and Maya. They were such good people that he couldn't even think of hurting either of them.

'I guess I need to make a decision now.'

Perhaps Maya's confession was a good thing.

Before discussing such grand matters as heaven or humanity, wasn't this something that absolutely needed to be sorted out first?

"Nade, Iruki. I have a favor to ask."

The next afternoon.

Shirone entered the principal's office.

Alpheas silently pointed to the bookshelf and opened the secret door.

Going down the stairs to the room, he found both expected and unexpected people waiting.

The former were Gaold and Flu, the latter were Ethella and Shiina.

"Teacher?"

"You came, Shirone."

Shiina's face didn't look good.

Having heard everything about heaven's existence and danger, the mastermind behind this incident, and the people involved, she couldn't help but have emotions.

Shirone realized why Gaold had come to find Alpheas.

With his limbs cut off, there weren't many people Gaold could ask for help. Teachers from Alpheas Magic School would be sufficient reinforcements.

"You must have suffered a lot mentally alone. Now the teachers will protect you, so don't worry too much."

While Ethella, a bishop of the Karsis Order, wouldn't fail to act in the face of humanity's survival, Shiina's decision this time was solely for Shirone.

In an event of global scale, there was no room to reveal Shirone's life, emotions, or dignity. With only a teacher's heart to protect her student's safety, Shiina willingly chose to go to heaven.

"Teacher..."

Had he been unknowingly sorrowful?

The days when he had nightmares from fear that his life would be destroyed by sudden events and worry that he might be caught by the National Intelligence Service and executed flashed by like a revolving lantern.

"You came? I called to share all information according to the contract conditions. Today we open Estas and meet Miro. We won't be able to have a conversation once she enters samadhi, but it's something we must confirm before going to heaven."

Gaold's voice was excited.

It would be a reunion with Miro after a full 20 years. He also knew it could be the last day he would see her.

"But is it okay to go like this? There might still be agents remaining."

The National Intelligence Service had set up barricades around Estas and searched the warehouses looking for the 'upper level' known to contain Miro's space-time.

Although they had returned empty-handed, the possibility that they were still lurking couldn't be ruled out.

"Hehe, it's fine. Having come this far, it doesn't matter, right?"

Gaold confidently left the room.

When the magician known as the strongest in Tormia acted as if there was no problem, the others followed without complaint.

Crossing Estas's barricade, they found ninety-eight warehouses scattered like dismantled blocks. They had stopped operating at the highest level of separation mode.

"Nothing has changed here at all."

Gaold opened the cover of Estas's control panel.

Just as his hands were wandering, not knowing what to touch first, ten National Intelligence Service agents jumped out from behind the building.

"Mikea Gaold, you are under arrest for treason under the Kingdom Security Act."

Shirone hastily took a combat stance.

When the feared situation became reality, he realized how foolish it had been to follow Gaold.

He had overlooked that even a first-class archmage was basically insane.

How could he have left such an easy judgment to Gaold? As if bewitched by something.

Gaold was examining the control panel without even looking at the agents.

"Hmm, how do you operate this thing? Hey, was it the red button?"

A cold voice came from behind the agents.

"It's the blue button, you idiot."

The agents split left and right as a man walked out.

The moment Shirone laid eyes on him, he felt goosebumps all over his body.

He had slicked-back hair with no eyebrows, and his thin, narrow lips were indistinguishable from his skin.

Most bizarre were his amber eyes. His irises were rotating tick-tock like clock gears.

"Ah, right, it was blue? I keep forgetting things as I get older."

The man ignored Gaold's words and walked toward Alpheas. Then, in what appeared to Shirone as perfect uniform motion, he bent at the waist.

"Have you been well, Principal?"

"Yes. It's been a long time, Sein."

"Se, Sein?"

Only then did Shirone turn his gaze from the agents.

One of the founding members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society that Gaold had mentioned before. He was also the person who had created Estas's master equation.

Ethella gently placed her hand on Shirone's shoulder and pointed to the agents.

"Shirone, examine them with synesthesia."

Following Ethella's instruction, he could feel Sein's spirit zone splitting into tentacle forms and connecting without exception to all the National Intelligence Service agents.

"Mental domination?"

"Right. And it's the highest level of mental domination."

If they came from the National Intelligence Service, the agents' force would be above average. Also, given their professional characteristics, they should have resistance training against mental-type attacks.

A person who had succeeded in mind control with 100 percent probability on such people.

For that to be possible, he had heard from Arin that concentration equivalent to 20 times the opponent's mental strength was needed.

Estas started operating with a humming sound.

Gaold, who had taken his hand off the blue button, introduced Sein to Shirone while still looking at the control panel. This was also part of the contract.

"Sein is a Servant and a mental-type magician. He's currently active in the Black Line under the alias Snake. He may not look it, but he's a Red Line designated Triple A-class criminal. You should get his autograph."

"Black Line?"

Shirone glanced at Sein with an uneasy expression.

The Black Line was a group of those who denied the taboos of magic and used magic solely based on personal beliefs.

It was on a different dimension from simply killing and tormenting people.

The fact that even the notorious villain Arcane was positioned at the edge of the Red Line spectrum showed this.

Only someone like Arius of the Seven Demons, who illegally infiltrated human minds and plundered intellectual property, could be classified as a dangerous factor capable of collapsing social systems.

"Usually when picking the strongest mental-type in the Black Line, about two people are mentioned. One is Guitarman of the Seven Demons, and Snake. He'll handle orders on our team. Of course, I'm the commander."

Sein snorted.

"Still talking nonsense. Did playing house at the association really make you stupid? The only reason a guy like you can even pretend to be a commander is because my orders are accurate."

'He has a similar personality to Iruki...'

Shirone saw Iruki's arrogance in Sein.

He thought that living with calculation abilities that transcend humans probably makes one's confidence in oneself reach its peak like that.
