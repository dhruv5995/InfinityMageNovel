The Five Great Systems (1)

Ethera pressed her belly firmly.

'This is bad.'

According to the topography of the laws, this place must be where illogical magic flows in.

'It's reacting.'

Every time she heard the crying, her abdomen hurt as if stabbed by a knife, but the fear was even greater.

'At this rate, I'll miscarry.'

Probably Shagal's child—the child of the man who cast her, a follower of good, into hell.

That's why she was confused.

'I don't know. What should I... do?'

The judgment was still difficult, but a woman's instinct was telling her to flee this place.

'For now, I have no choice but to protect it.'

She was too ashamed to even speak it aloud, but just as she was trying to gather courage, Shagal stepped forward.

"Tch! What are you doing?"

Everyone turned to look at Shagal.

"They're all the same hungry ghosts anyway. Hungry ghosts who can't die and just keep living. I came here to break these damn chains. I don't want to waste time in a place like this."

Since it wasn't a pleasant sight to watch for long, Sirone's group immediately followed Shagal.

Only Ethera lingered for a moment, savoring the emotions transmitted through the chains.

On the way up to the 12th floor, Benistoph explained the Hellfire Corporation's system.

"The underworld operated by Hellfire Corporation is broadly classified into three categories. First are the branch offices under Hellfire Corporation, second are the cities where demons live, and lastly are the logistics warehouses managed by the Dark Monks."

Sirone and Lian had experienced all of those places.

"What makes the Company special is the Six Brains—the central processing unit you saw earlier. Emotions are illogical, but they're not without causality. If reality centers on events, we deal with emotional causality. We call this karma."

Sirone asked.

"If we purify the Six Brains, will the True Voice be liberated?"

"Hmm. The underworld would be paralyzed. I don't know what would happen after that. But this is just hypothetical. In reality, the Six Brains cannot be purified."

"Why not?"

"The fetuses that make up the Six Brains are classified as a race called Limbo. They have no karma. Therefore, they cannot be purified."

Benistoph raised his index finger.

"Not only aborted fetuses become Limbo. The criterion is karma. Children who are born into the world but don't know logic also have no karma. Such Limbo escape to the outside following their appetite for consumption. You can see them if you go to Zone 7 of Baramhon."

When they fell into hell, Ethera and Shagal had seen them at the 'Graveyard of Spines.'

"It's best to be careful. They're weak but cruel. No, it would be more accurate to say they don't even have such concepts. The only driving force behind the Limbo race's existence is their obsession with life."

Sirone asked again.

"What if we destroy the Six Brains?"

To properly understand a target, one must imagine even cruel scenarios.

"Limbo is a law, just like Sheol. Even if the members disappear, the concept doesn't vanish. Even if you burn the fetuses, they'll be replaced with new Six Brains. Of course, serious errors would occur, but as a systems expert, I'd advise against it. What Yahweh wants won't happen."

Benistoph emphasized.

"Destruction is not a good solution. Especially when there's a lot at stake. Both reality and the underworld would become a complete mess. Would you hit a precision machine with a hammer, hoping it might get fixed? Of course, it might get fixed. But I think there's a high probability it would just become scrap metal. It would be irreversible."

Sirone fell into thought.

'It's not a lie. If it weren't the truth, he wouldn't have willingly shown us the Six Brains. But... I feel like he's hiding what's really important.'

That was why he felt puzzled.

The moment they arrived at the 12th floor, a sound so enormous that it swept away all complex thoughts reached them.

"Worship Satan!"

It was a space as magnificent as a coliseum, with people packed densely on the 10th and 11th floors.

A demon holding a microphone adorned with multiple human ears raised his hand and shouted.

"Oh! Satan! Grant us joy! Pleasure! Success!"

Then his voice was amplified thunderously through hundreds of mouths attached all around.

People gathered below the altar followed the demon's words, shedding tears of emotion.

"We believe! We believe in Satan!"

Sirone asked.

"This place is...?"

"A Satanist assembly. The believers gathered here are humans who have made contracts with Satan."

In other words, the living faithful.

Approximately 6,000 humans were in attendance, all of them candidates for Sheol.

"Submit! Earnestly desire! Satan will surely respond!"

With a momentum visible to the eye, the believers raised their hands and shouted.

Each wanted something, but to Sirone, it just sounded like screaming.

The demon extended his hand.

"I hear it!"

As if by magic, the noise disappeared and the demon's long finger pointed at someone.

"I hear the resentment of a mother who lost her child! Marie, a woman named Marie."

"That's me! It's me!"

A woman holding a dead infant in her arms jumped up and down in place.

"Come to me. You who submit to Satan have the courage to do so."

When Marie came up to the platform shedding tears of emotion, the demon took the child's corpse from her.

"This child will live. Do you believe?"

"Yes! I believe! I... I believe in Satan! If only you'll bring my child back to life..."

"No conditions are necessary! Do you believe?"

The woman screamed.

"Yes! I believe!"

"Good! In Satan's name...!"

The demon holding the child's corpse high with both hands slammed it down with all his might.

"Come back to life!"

With a thud, the child's corpse hit the ground, and all the believers applauded and cheered frantically.

"Praise Satan's greatness!"

Sirone felt like he was watching a bad comedy, but what was even more shocking was what came next.

"Oh! My baby!"

Even the mother herself was hugging the child's corpse and dancing with joy.

"Come here, my baby."

The sight of her kissing the bluish corpse of the child gave the group goosebumps.

Sirone muttered.

"What the hell... is this?"

The demon then called up a soldier who had lost one leg and a blind grandmother.

"Walk straight!"

The soldier who screamed with ecstasy began walking across the platform on his still-missing leg.

He collapsed before taking a single step, but he kept getting back up.

"I'm healed!"

Making a thud as he fell.

"Look! Now I can walk perfectly fine! I'll definitely get my revenge, you damn bastards!"

And fell again.

"I can see! I can see ahead! My checks! Now they won't steal my checks anymore!"

The grandmother flailing her hands was endlessly circling in the same spot.

Sirone gritted his teeth.

"...Fanatics."

Lete said.

"That's right. This is how Sheol is born. Blind faith that destroys logic. Hidden Code is a special phenomenon that arises from such contradictions."

She turned her head with a pitying expression.

"I don't think you looked down on them. It's just that you judged that if it's the True Voice, if it's her powerful mental strength, she could take Sheol's place, right?"

Sirone didn't answer.

"This is enormous desire. What level of emotion would it take to make a contract with Satan? A woman who lost her child in a terrible accident could be the standard. The desire of that old man who had his money stolen by family is just as strong. The True Voice can't do it. She's a human who abandoned herself for the world."

Lete was right.

When the demon sent the believers back to their seats, 20 humans walked onto the platform.

"Those are the promising Sheol candidates."

They weren't as ostentatious as the believers, but their condition looked far more miserable.

"Look, everyone. Thanks to believing in Satan, I became this rich."

Trash kept falling from his pockets.

The believers' applause continued, and his microphone was passed to the woman next to him.

She had a terrifyingly hideous face.

"Hello. I'm Mortasinger, who made it into the final 20 for Sheol selection."

Sirone's eyes widened.

'That person is... Mortasinger?'

As Sirone remembered, she was a beauty who could have participated in a world beauty contest.

Even Son Yoo-jung seemed shocked, showing a dazed expression at the appearance of the friend she had searched for so desperately.

"Satan gave me the most beautiful appearance. Look. Isn't it beautiful?"

The believers whistled.

"Um... so I'm so happy. I'll continue to dedicate my body for Satan..."

As she continued speaking in an awkward tone, the command room on the 13th floor was watching.

Pride's 1 o'clock said.

"She's done for. She handles Hidden Code fairly well, but somehow it doesn't feel 100 percent?"

They were trying to complete Sheol as quickly as possible according to Havitz's orders.

Wandering's 6 o'clock said.

"Her early growth was fast, but penetration is the problem. It's probably because she was an out-of-standard eater."

Envy's 8 o'clock said.

"Even if you twist logic, it's still logic in its own way. Trying to understand Hidden Code with childish tricks like out-of-standard eating leads to this mess. How stupid."

"More than that... look at the 12th floor."

The kindly-looking middle-aged man, Climax's 11 o'clock, gestured toward the lower floor with his chin.

"Yahweh has come."

The moment Sirone came into view, murderous intent erupted without anyone taking the lead.

"We're suffering because of that damn Yahweh. He raised that Wizard too, didn't he?"

If they could kill him now.

"...Should we go?"

"Would it be okay? Lete is right there too. There must be something they're plotting."

"What do we care? We exist only for Lord Havitz. That is Satan's Twelve Temptations."

They were fanatics called Sheol.

When the introduction of the 20 Sheol candidates ended, the demon took the microphone.

"This is Satan's power. The ability of a god with no impossibilities! Let us pray."

Passages probably written in the Devil's Bible that Gyorgi possessed were recited.

After the assembly ended and the believers dispersed, Lete took the group to the 10th floor.

"Mufa!"

The demon who had been resting on the platform spotted Lete and rushed over in a hurry.

"Oh! Boss! How did you come all the way here?"

"I'm giving these people a tour of the Company. Say hello. You know, right? Yahweh and his companions."

Any demon would normally go crazy, but Mufa smoothly extended his hand.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Mufa."

When Sirone frowned as if to say 'don't even think about it,' the hand was awkwardly withdrawn.

"Tsk! That's too much. We're in the same industry."

"Same industry?"

When anger mixed into Sirone's voice, Lete hurriedly spread both arms.

"Now, now! Enough of that. Among the Sheol candidates, there's a kid named Mortasinger, right? Where is she now?"

"She's probably praying. She's working hard these days. But why Mortasinger...?"

"Son Yoo-jung!"

At that moment, Mortasinger burst out from the door connected to the inside of the auditorium.

"It really is you! I thought it might be when I saw you earlier! It really was Son Yoo-jung!"

Even as she ran over and embraced her neck, Son Yoo-jung couldn't believe it.

"You..."

The friend with the refreshing personality who had caused countless incidents while traveling through heaven together.

"Hoho! Well, it's natural to be surprised. My face that was so ugly has become this pretty."

But what stood before her now was a madwoman whose appearance would be better off as a skeleton.
