HIGH GEAR (2)

Sirone couldn't move.

His body stiff as a wooden block, he felt an inertia pulling him somewhere.

A blue light flowed like electricity through wires, and then darkness suddenly arrived.

'Is the event starting?'

When had he closed his eyes?

Rumble. Rumble.

Opening his eyelids at the sound of thunder, he saw a sky covered with clouds like sewage water.

As cold raindrops fell, his eyes half-closed.

"Hehehe! Found one! Found a stray dog!"

He tried to lift his head at the voice from below, but chains pressed against his neck.

'I'm tied up.'

His whole body was wrapped tightly in thick chains while lying on a plank.

A man with the long chain attached to the plank slung over his shoulder walked through the mud, muttering.

"Damn bastards. How dare they ignore my achievements?"

While listening to the man's words, Sirone checked his mental state.

'Hmm, as expected, neither magic nor avatar techniques work.'

Materialization during avatar state was impossible.

Since it was Sirone's own decision, no rejection reaction occurred, but...

'This... I might be able to break it though?'

If he put his mind to it with Yahweh's realm, it didn't seem like unbreakable code.

'Even so, it's really powerful code. The coding skill seems to surpass Shura's.'

He was curious what expression the man would make if he broke the chains and stood up here.

'I probably won't be able to see it anyway.'

The moment he deviated from the designer's intention, there was a high chance the event itself would stop.

"You..."

Just then, Sirone's mouth moved on its own.

"Where are you taking me, you bastard! Let me go right now!"

The man turned his head.

"Hehehe! Awake? You're lucky. You'll be able to live forever from now on."

"No! Send me back where I live!"

"It's already too late. Why did you crawl into the scrapyard? You should have lived like a rat inside buildings."

"Aaaah! Aaaah!"

Sirone shook his head and struggled.

'Dizzy.'

Though his mind was still calm, it was somewhat unfamiliar that his vision wasn't under control.

"Hah! Hah!"

Even his terror-stricken breathing didn't seem like his own.

"We're here. We've arrived."

From his ground-level view, he saw a door opening and the ceiling immediately approached.

He was on something like a narrow operating table following the slope, and only then could he see the man's face.

A mechanical human with raggedly peeled skin was flashing blue eyes.

"Do you know what this is?"

He held out a spherical device.

'I don't know.'

Sirone wanted to say, but the event forcibly made his body tremble.

"High Gear. A semi-permanent power engine. With just this, you too can enjoy eternal life."

"No! Don't do it!"

The man ignored Sirone's answer, turned his back, and headed toward the table.

"Let me introduce myself first. I'm Doctor Martin. The developer of High Gear and a genius of misfortune. How much of a genius, you ask? I've made mistakes only once in my entire life. But that one mistake made me like this."

What Martin pulled out was a half-rusted axe.

"What was that mistake? It was giving eternal life to trash like you. Damn it. Eternal life can't even be nullified. Actually, High Gear is God's gift. As long as there's sunlight, you don't need to eat or sleep."

*Scrape scrape*

The sound of sharpening the axe blade could be heard.

"What I overlooked was that you guys are trash among trash. When I cured incurable diseases and developed anti-aging medicine, you worshipped me like a god. There wasn't a city without a statue of Martin. But once I gave you eternal life..."

Martin whipped his head around.

"These things are now trying to kill me?"

Even while breathing heavily, Sirone gradually became interested in his story.

"You wanted to kill me and monopolize my technology to become new gods. That's how I was driven out. I was miserably broken. But I didn't give up. Those who oppose God shall receive divine punishment. Ehehe! Yes, divine punishment."

Martin lovingly stroked the axe handle and spoke with an expression of madness.

"I stole the sun."

Though there was much more he wanted to ask, his mouth wouldn't open, and Martin finished all his preparations.

"High Gear, you see, will replace your heart. Countless nano machines will circulate through your blood vessels. Your brain will soon be devoured too. It doesn't matter if your arm gets cut off, and it'd be fine to attach an excavator. No immune reactions will occur."

Martin, with the axe over his shoulder, showed Sirone the High Gear once more.

Though it didn't beat like a heart, blue electricity regularly circulated along lens-like grooves.

"I'm human! I'm not a monster, you son of a bitch!"

It was an unfamiliar stimulus to utter language he normally wouldn't use.

"Then let's begin. Hehehe! Ehehehe!"

Martin placed the High Gear on the table, spat into his palm, and gripped the axe with both hands.

"No! Get away!"

Sirone's vision shook again, and Martin raised the axe above his head.

"I'll eat your heart for you!"

The moment he charged was dizzying no matter how much of a simulation it was.

"Aaaah! No! Don't..."

Before his death cry could end, Martin's axe plunged down toward Sirone's abdomen.

'Gasp!'

The moment he felt his heart drop with a thud, his vision darkened and a woman's voice was heard.

"Beginning customization."

When he came to his senses, the humid laboratory had disappeared and he was in a place surrounded by mirrors on all sides.

As he looked at his naked reflection in the mirrors, numerous gauges appeared beside him.

"This is a space for processing the user's physical form. Please create your desired form and give the completion command."

Looking roughly, all items necessary for 3D design were listed, with several locked.

'Paid content?'

After examining items like gender change, deformity, and monstrous forms, Sirone made his decision.

"Complete. I'll keep it as is."

Unlike other users, Sirone, who had accessed due to real-world problems, felt reluctant about physical changes.

"Customization complete."

His vision darkened again, then a hazy landscape appeared as if he were drugged.

"Kukuku. Fight, fight."

Martin's voice was heard.

Sirone realized he was being dragged along the ground with his chains released.

"A half-baked eternal life that can't survive without the sun. Destroy each other. Struggle endlessly."

Arriving at a sheer cliff, Martin pulled Sirone's feet and shouted.

"This is God's punishment!"

The moment he felt gravitational acceleration, the drug effect wore off and sensation returned.

"Huuuu..."

Sirone, finally regaining physical freedom, steadied himself as the distant ground came into view.

'It's incredibly high?'

If he fell helplessly like this, not just his limbs but his entire torso would be smashed.

*Activating artificial intelligence program.*

Just then, mechanical sounds echoed in his head.

"Huh?"

A blue film covered his retina and countless pieces of information were displayed in augmented reality.

*High Gear Level 1. Energy output.*

Tremendous energy burst from his heart and enveloped Sirone's entire body.

"Whoa."

The powerful force offset his fear, but it was still a height where fatal injuries couldn't be avoided.

*Kinetic energy reduction mechanism.*

Red circles were drawn on the landscape, and probabilities changing in real-time appeared along the attachment lines.

'61.7 percent.'

Sirone spotted a reasonably protruding rock on the cliff and grabbed it.

"Urgh!"

With an impact that felt like his arm would be torn off, the rock broke and he began falling again.

As his falling speed decreased, many more recommended patterns appeared and the probability increased significantly.

*Thud thud thump!*

After stepping on the rock wall several times like this, Sirone safely landed on the ground.

*Location search. Beginner zone, Iron Hometown.*

Feeling the cold wind as he looked around, countless piles of scrap metal blocked his view.

Augmented reality informed him about the objects.

'They're all weapons or armor?'

Steel helmets, rifles, grenades - things that didn't need to be made in Sirone's world.

*Ratatatatata!*

Gunshots could be heard faintly from beyond the scrap piles.

'I should arm myself too.'

Just then, a beeping sound was heard and an envelope icon appeared in Sirone's right eye.

*Would you like to view beginner tips?*

"View."

Detailed content that couldn't be heard in the tutorial was densely written.

"Hmm, there are three user statuses in total. AI level, engine output level, and selective options."

Since Sirone was currently level 1, no bonuses were attached to any category.

"I'll understand once I try it."

After roughly grasping the system, Sirone checked the next bothersome part.

'I can't use magic or avatar techniques. But...'

His senses remained.

'Is this the part from the beginner tips?'

*High Gear's combat power is calculated mathematically, but cases exist where this isn't possible.*

'Well, aspects like judgment and reflexes can't be quantified. If senses are the same...'

After thinking briefly, Sirone's eyes widened like a rabbit's.

"This is good?"

With hope of defeating operators, Sirone excitedly rummaged through the scrap piles.

He put on an old steel helmet, grabbed a rifle and pistol, then stuffed magazines into his ammo belt.

Though it was roughly over 10 kilograms, it didn't feel heavy.

'High Gear.'

The power device replacing his heart released explosive energy with each cycle.

'This is level 1 output? Then when becoming a ranker, just how far...'

His lips curved up at the rising thrill.

"Good! Let's begin!"

Sirone tapped his steel helmet and stepped into the virtual world with confident strides.

200 meters away from that point.

"He's come, he's here."

A long-haired man stood atop a scrap pile, aiming a rifle at Sirone.

When the level 7 AI implemented augmented reality, a code name appeared above the target.

"Code name Yahweh2. Oh my, it's Platinum?"

The man who lifted his gaze from the sight blinked.

'Pure bio without parts. Old steel helmet only obtainable from the starting point. And Platinum.'

There was only one conclusion.

"Kukuku."

Someone insignificant from reality had been brought in to secure an expensive code name.

'A big fish after a long time.'

As he brought his hand to the trigger, the AI automatically aimed at Sirone's steel helmet.

'The old steel helmet is a good item, but level 7 AI calculates penetration power.'

This difference was very important.

In High Gear, the brain was the only organ that couldn't be replaced with parts.

'Slow calculation is a drawback, but...'

The number next to the aim changed in real-time, then fixed at 98% penetration probability.

'Here goes.'

As he pulled the trigger, a gunshot rang out.

Simultaneously, Sirone twisted his body, and the bullet grazed past by a hair's breadth.

The long-haired man gaped in bewilderment.

"H-how?"

If his AI level had been higher, he would have detected the sniper's presence from the start.

"Dodging bullets with nothing?"

In the man's vacant eyes, the code name Yahweh2 glittered.
