[771] Gong's Doubt (1)

I've arrived in the Corona Kingdom.

'So this is what it feels like.'

Perhaps because I was returning after completing a mission, even the still-unfamiliar cold landscape felt as comfortable as coming home.

"Let's grab a meal before we go. What's the point of being a star? We're so busy we don't even have time for a single meal."

We entered the White Inn where Shirone had stayed.

"Welcome. Oh my?"

The middle-aged woman's eyes lit up at the sight of Shirone and Minerva entering side by side.

"You two have gotten quite close. Perhaps...?"

"It's business. That kid's also one of the Five Great Stars."

"Hmm, is that so?"

The middle-aged woman looked disappointed.

"Something we can eat quickly."

When Minerva acted busy, the middle-aged woman entered the dining room without complaint.

Shirone, seated at his table, looked toward a corner table.

"..."

The same four people who had been playing cards back then were still dealing cards in the exact same arrangement.

'Surely not?'

They probably went home and came back, and by chance all four happened to be wearing the same clothes as before.

Minerva, noticing Shirone's expression, turned toward the four people and asked.

"Who's winning?"

The bald old man answered.

"Everyone's losing. If the game doesn't end, there are neither winners nor losers. Only the game wins."

Shirone listened carefully to the old man's words.

'Only the game wins.'

It seemed to represent the current world situation where Yahweh and Buddha were in confrontation.

"How long will you keep playing?"

"...Until the game ends."

Minerva rummaged through her belongings and pulled out the bonds she'd received from Naamaemond, waving them.

"Can I join in for a round?"

All four people stopped their hands simultaneously.

"What are you doing right now?"

Shirone tried to stop her when she mentioned gambling, but Minerva was already moving with a chair in hand.

"Let me introduce them properly. These are the 'Card Game Players.' They're a famous attraction of the Ivory Tower. They're also famous as a photo spot for tourists."

The owner shouted from the kitchen.

"They're the White Inn's main attraction!"

Minerva assessed the card game situation.

"Fourteen years ago, four gambling addicts—that is, the world's most skilled gamblers—entered the Ivory Tower. And they made a bet. Who really wins at games?"

"What kind of game is it?"

"Tests, life, anything goes. However, the participants have different tendencies. Those who must take and those who must give, those who try to end the game and those who try to maintain it."

Shirone examined the 'Card Game Players' again.

"Who do you think will win?"

"Obviously the one who must take..."

Shirone shook his head.

"There's no winner."

"Ironic, isn't it? But that's life. For the game to end, one side's balance must collapse."

Minerva placed the bonds on the table as she spoke.

"I'll try to guess this round's winner. If I lose, you can take all this money."

The bald old man asked.

"...What if you win?"

"Then you stop the game. There will be no more 'Card Game Players' in this world."

The red-bearded man sitting across said.

"Fine. Who wins this round?"

"Hmm, let me see..."

As Shirone watched Minerva carefully examining the cards, he swallowed nervously.

'Breaking the balance.'

If someone intervenes in a game perfectly balanced between good and evil, justice and love, creating a crack.

'Who will be the victor?'

After examining the cards held by the four people for a long time, Minerva scratched her head.

"I have no idea. I have no talent for gambling. At times like this, intuition is best. Who's the one trying to maintain the game?"

Universal love, or Shirone.

"That's me."

The gaunt man who looked like a skeleton spoke.

"Good. I'll bet on you winning."

The 'Card Game Players' are the world's greatest servants, those who win at any game.

Chess where thinking is everything, probability-based card games, even sports matches where emotions come into play.

Minerva had input a new variable into the simulation that these four had been running for fourteen years.

'Now how will it change?'

She bet massive money on the one trying to maintain the game, and if Minerva wins, the game is destroyed.

'It's certainly complex.'

The one trying to end the game would lean toward Minerva winning.

'That's how the chain reaction occurs. Everyone's thinking changes.'

"Let's begin."

At the words of the man with ink-black eyes, the four people's hands moved busily.

Each drawing cards, placing them on the table, picking a card from the cards on the table.

'What kind of rules are this complex?'

The speed was so fast he couldn't tell how the game progressed, but it took over three minutes.

"The result is in."

Minerva looked at the table with interested eyes, and Shirone also stood up.

"This round's winner is..."

The bald old man turned his gaze to the red-bearded man.

"You, Gudio."

The one who must take, ultimate evil.

"..."

It was just a game, but those who played it were figures who had reached the pinnacle of action and reaction.

"Ah, what a shame. I could have won."

When Minerva clicked her tongue and returned to her seat, Shirone looked at her with a dumbfounded expression.

"Are you seriously saying that right now? What about that money?"

"Can't help it. That's what gambling is. Win and take it all, lose and give it all."

"No, if this was going to happen from the start..."

"Let's go. We have mountains of work to do, so what's the point of eating?"

When Minerva grabbed Jet and left, Shirone looked back at the 'Card Game Players.'

All four people weren't even paying attention to the bonds, heads down reviewing this round.

Shirone shook his head.

"I really don't understand."

As Shirone followed Minerva outside, the owner belatedly came out with food.

"Oh my, they left already?"

The bald old man looked up and asked.

"Do you agree?"

Everyone agreed.

"Very subtle. It seemed like it wouldn't have any influence, but this is going to split by a narrow margin?"

Gudio said.

"If this continues, the game will end."

Meaning someone's stake would hit rock bottom just before recovery.

"Who's the final winner?"

Since they weren't playing all four roles alone, they'd have to actually play rounds to see the result.

"Let's begin."

As the four people's hands crossed at tremendous speed and cards flew back and forth, the bonds fell to the floor.

The owner, who watched this for a moment, dipped her finger in the soup to taste it and muttered.

"Such a waste. Can't throw it away either."

After parting with Minerva at the Ivory Tower, Shirone arrived at the Great Star Temple where Taeseong resided.

"Hehe, you look tired."

Taeseong greeted him with a knowing smile.

"Minerva really is a difficult person."

"I heard the story. Still, I need your confirmation, so I'm asking—will you really register <Law Kill>?"

"Yes. I'd like to use it myself."

If Shirone was the owner, Taeseong had no choice.

"I understand. And..."

Her voice turned cold.

"We need to talk about the rules of Law Breaking."

Thinking that what had to come had come, Shirone silently waited for what would follow.

"You've probably already heard, but Law Breaking is dangerous."

"Because it violates higher systems?"

Taeseong made a sad expression.

"I don't want to hear Shirone say that. As I said before, nothing is predetermined. All life among the stars is simply living according to their own will."

"Then what's the problem?"

"Because we're not within a specific system—we create the system."

Taeseong pointed to the ground.

"Humans live according to their own will, but when those wills gather, certain patterns inevitably emerge. That becomes the system, and perhaps makes it possible to imagine that we might be part of a program. But strictly speaking, it's an imagination that reverses cause and effect."

Of course, that imagination might be correct.

"The reason for not tolerating Law Breaking also isn't because someone decided it shouldn't be done. It's because it threatens the system we created."

Taeseong spread both arms, and countless stars were born in a fan shape.

"The natural world exists within the backdrop of the universe, and the biological world was born from that natural world. Humans are positioned at some point in that biological world."

One star exploded, creating a hole in the universe.

"The most powerful force of the natural world punches holes in the higher system that is the cosmic realm. This is called Law Breaking."

"Then from a human perspective..."

"Yes. From the biological world's position, it would be power enough to destroy the natural world. Before reaching Yahweh's level, the most powerful magic you could wield was God's Punishment. But even that could never reach Law Breaking."

The star where Shirone lived appeared as a phantom, flickering like a small firefly.

"It's the same with any magic. Typhoons, volcanic eruptions? Stars are unfazed by any natural disaster. They won't even be destroyed by most asteroid impacts. Even if your God's Punishment fell ten thousand times, it would only scratch the star's surface. In human terms, it's just skin being torn."

Even if all humanity mobilized every resource they possessed, what would be destroyed is their civilization, not the star.

"It's not because someone decided it that way, but because it was born that way that it became a system. But you broke that rule."

Shirone could destroy stars.

"That is Law Breaking."

"Of course, I can withstand your power, but Terraforce is different. Unlike the natural world, what governs the biological world is the heart. If one sets their mind to it, they see the possibility that stars could be destroyed."

"Ymir?"

Taeseong nodded.

"Even Ankera doesn't tolerate Law Breaking. In game terms, it's cheating. Think about it—if a being with will could destroy stars..."

If they could freely destroy higher systems.

"Who would want to live here?"

The value, reason, and purpose of existence lose meaning before one who possesses the power of Law Breaking.

"There's controversy."

Taeseong turned around.

"Terraforce is an existence that far transcends human mentality. They think cheating shouldn't occur in this fight. Because if it's not a fair confrontation, dividing winners and losers becomes meaningless."

Taeseong raised her index finger.

"That's why there's Man. The biological world's limit. Shirone has transcended that Man. In terms of the universe's caste system, you're not a living being. You're a kind of natural force."

Anyone who knew what Shirone could do would have to nod.

"So what should I do now?"

"Nothing. You transcended Man through your own will. What I want to say is that there are beings who consider that cheating."

"Terraforce."

"Yes. Their council will judge. It seems like Terraforce's Chief Justice is exerting influence, but it doesn't seem easy. Stay at the Ivory Tower for a while and watch how things develop."

"What if it's rejected?"

Taeseong looked back at Shirone again.

"Nothing will change. However, if you refuse to comply with the judgment to the end..."

Her eyes were colder than ever before.

"Terraforce will cut you out from the system to protect this star's users."
