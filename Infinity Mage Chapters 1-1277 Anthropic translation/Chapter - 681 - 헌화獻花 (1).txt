[681] Offering Flowers (1)

The three ministers of Spectrum—Defense, Interior, and Military—had gathered around the round table.

After issuing the order to gather Seonghwa's output to maximum and strike the capital, La Enemy had not appeared in their memories, but that no longer mattered.

Defense Minister Plarino, who managed Seonghwa's main system, spoke.

"Thirteen percent left until maximum output. In 24 minutes, Bashka's royal castle will disappear from Tormia."

Interior Minister Raika looked at her with the cold eyes characteristic of vampires.

"Impressive. That's core code we couldn't hack for decades."

Seonghwa was fundamentally a defensive ancient weapon, but when output was raised to maximum, it could strike even the royal castle.

The reason they hadn't been able to execute this until now was because the kingdom had encrypted it during Seonghwa's early growth phase.

"La Enemy. Was he real after all?"

Though Plarino had hacked the core code, she too had succeeded based on La Enemy's memories.

This was the moment proving that he—who had no physical form and existed only in memory—had the ability to destroy this world.

"That doesn't matter. The key is for demi-humans to rule the human kingdom."

Military Minister Dracker said, building up his energy.

As the fighting spirit characteristic of dragon-men emanated from him, even his fellow ministers Raika and Plarino found it hard to breathe.

"Shouldn't we start moving? Several humans have already infiltrated Seonghwa. Let's finish this before it gets complicated."

Raika asked Plarino.

"Who got in?"

"The Magic Association Chairman and his Chief Secretary. Though the pact is broken, if we can't stop those two, everything will be for nothing. La Enemy isn't appearing. This must be our problem to solve."

"Mere humans."

Raika's body began dissolving into black smoke.

"I'll finish this quickly and return."

As he completely vanished from sight, Dracker also stood up, gripping the table.

"I'll handle the outside."

"Need my help?"

As Dracker's lips curled upward, reptilian scales rippled.

"Just keep the flower safe."

It was a double meaning—guarding Seonghwa, but also because she herself was a flower.

Though she had reached the level of suppressing reactions to others' emotions, the sensitivity characteristic of the Flower Tribe hadn't disappeared.

The Flower Tribe dedicates everything for someone who loves them.

Since she was born that way, it wasn't an unpleasant feeling, but human possessiveness was unmatched compared to other creatures.

'Protect the flower.'

Plarino took a deep breath and steeled her resolve.

'Protect the flower.'

'Can I make it in time?'

Jane, who had infiltrated Seonghwa, ran swiftly toward the main system.

With all power to the concealment facility cut, she too realized that Spectrum was preparing to intercept the capital.

'I have to succeed.'

The problem was that Aria's condition, mentally connected through the Spirit Zone, was gradually worsening.

If she lost consciousness, accessing the core code itself might become impossible.

'Was this the right choice?'

If Lupist had been here, he would have rolled up his sleeves.

'Chairman.'

She had already worked with Lupist for over ten years.

When he entered politics as a mage, she had gotten the job as his aide through an interview.

Being a mage herself had probably been crucial to her acceptance, but their relationship hadn't been smooth from the start.

"Public opinion says you're being too extreme. Especially the high nobles are opposing the excessive taxation for the purpose of increasing defense spending."

"Proceed as planned. It's necessary."

Lupist was the type who didn't add unnecessary words, and Jane was full of passion.

"So I've drafted a revised proposal. First, we'll set the tax increase rate to about 1.3 percent, and for nobles subject to progressive taxation..."

"What a damn chatty brat."

Jane's hand, flipping through documents, stopped abruptly, and she asked with a hardened expression.

"Excuse me? What did you just say?"

Lupist, resting his arms on the table, glared at Jane and spoke clearly.

"I said you're a damn chatty brat."

She stood there dumbfounded at the absurdity, then her eyes blazed as she confronted him.

"Brat? Did you just call me a brat?"

"Yeah. So what?"

"That's blatant misogynistic language! I'll report you to the National Inspection Department! And if you don't apologize properly right now, I'll go public to the press! How can a politician with gender discriminatory tendencies run national affairs...!"

"Go ahead."

Lupist cut her off.

"Go ahead. Do whatever you want. But you know what? You're fired as of now."

Jane's face went pale.

"This, this kind of unfair treatment..."

"I don't want to work with you. So get out. Scram."

Tears welled up in Jane's eyes as she breathed heavily through her nose.

She threw her file folder on the floor and slammed the door so hard it could have burst eardrums as she left, making Lupist squint one eye.

"What kind of person is that?"

That evening, having finished work, Lupist put on his coat and left the royal castle.

'I'll need to hire a new aide tomorrow.'

Without someone to handle miscellaneous tasks, he was more tired than usual.

"What?"

Jane was waiting outside the castle entrance.

Her eyes said she wanted a showdown, and as soon as she saw Lupist, she strode over and spat out:

"Hey!"

"Hey?"

"Yeah, hey! You're not my boss anymore, so what's it matter? What? Does it bother you?"

"Have you been drinking?"

"No, I'm about to start! Even if I'm quitting, let's talk. I can't sleep worrying about this country without fixing your rotten mental state."

"Then don't sleep. You don't have anything to do anyway, right?"

As Lupist tried to pass by, she moved to block his path.

"Where do you think you're going? You need to apologize properly first."

"I didn't do anything to apologize for."

"Oh, is that so?"

Jane looked around as if determined and shouted:

"Everyone look here! This politician today discriminated against women...!"

"Are you crazy? What are you doing?"

Lupist grabbed her shoulder.

"Ha! Scared of people knowing?"

"It's not scary, it's embarrassing."

"Then be embarrassed. You don't have anything to do anyway, right?"

There was no bigger troublemaker than this troublemaker.

"Fine. Let's go. Let's go."

"That's more like it."

As she turned her shoulder dismissively and led the way to a bar, Lupist ground his teeth and followed.

Two hours later, Jane, completely drunk, repeated the same words several times with unfocused eyes.

"You really can't live life like that. You'll end up with no friends. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

Lupist checked the time.

"It's late. Let's head back."

Jane's upper body spun in circles as if feeling the earth's rotation.

"If you say go, do I have to go? Huh? Are you the boss?"

Jane poked Lupist's temple with her index finger.

"Are you..."

Jane put her index finger to his temple again and pushed with all her might.

"The boss?"

Lupist's head turned, and he glared at Jane as if ready to attack, gritting his teeth.

"Sober up already. You're a mental-type mage."

"Don't want to. I want to stay drunk. Don't like it when a woman drinks?"

"I said I was sorry. Several times."

"Is saying sorry enough? What about the wounds carved in my heart?"

Jane beat her chest as if frustrated.

"You can't live like that. If you do..."

It felt like God had drawn a repeat sign on time's musical score.

"Come back to work tomorrow."

Jane burst into laughter.

"That way..."

"I won't call you a brat, won't discriminate against women, and I'll consider the proposals you suggested, so come to work tomorrow."

Her suggestions had merit too.

She bonked her head on the table and looked back at Lupist.

The mocking emotion finally disappeared from her beaming smile.

"It's hard to say with my own mouth, but you really chose your subordinate well. How far will you go? Defense Minister? Magic Association Chairman? Yeah, Magic Association Chairman would be good. I'll make you Magic Association Chairman. I'll do whatever it takes to make you Magic Association Chairman."

"Let's get up."

Lupist helped Jane up and requested a room from the staff.

Even as he carried her up to the third floor, Jane was unconscious.

"Mmm, I'll make it happen."

When Lupist laid Jane on the bed after returning to the room, she wrapped her arms around his neck.

"Where are you going? You can't go."

"You're drunk. Go to sleep. Or sober up."

If she was a mental-type mage, she could clear up with the flip of a switch.

"Hehe, don't want to. You can't live doing only work, right?"

"You'll regret this tomorrow."

Jane smiled bitterly.

"What wouldn't I regret?"

"..."

The next morning, Jane, completely sober, bolted upright in bed.

'Oh no!'

Looking to the side, Lupist had already washed and was putting on his coat.

Her memory was exceptionally good, so yesterday's events flashed vividly through her mind.

'I must be crazy, crazy, crazy!'

Jane slapped her cheeks with both hands.

Spending the night with her boss.

Thinking about how awkward future work would be, regret flooded over her like a tide.

Lupist put his pocket watch away and walked toward the door, saying:

"I'm leaving first. Come to work in 30 minutes."

"Um...!"

Lupist stopped at the door.

"You know, right? This was a mistake—no, an accident. This kind of thing will absolutely never happen again."

"I know. We're both done for."

Lupist said as he closed the door and left:

"Be careful not to cause a scandal."

Jane, who had been watching blankly in her disheveled state, made a spiteful expression and mimicked Lupist's tone:

"Be careful not to cause a scandal."

Then she raised her middle finger toward the door.

"So cold, really."

Throwing off the covers, she stood naked by the window and stretched luxuriously.

"Let's see, today's schedule..."

Like the newly risen sun of today, it felt like her first day at work.

'There was a time like that.'

Jane smiled, recalling old memories.

Since they were both thoroughly meticulous people, they never crossed the line again during their ten-plus years of working together.

Faithful to their respective roles as politician and aide, they had passed through swift years like arrows to reach this point, but whenever Jane went against Lupist's wishes, she would sometimes recall that day.

'We thought no humans were more perfect than us. Looking back, we were quite young, Chairman.'

As her heart calmed, her mind cleared.

'Right, I just need to do what I can.'

What wouldn't she regret?

As she continued down to the lower floor, an eerie energy rose from the end of the passage.

"What's that?"

The pitch-black darkness writhed ominously, then gradually took shape and began regaining color.

'A vampire.'

"I'll praise you for making it this far."

The pureblooded vampire Raika approached with his hands behind his back.

"I underestimated humans too much. My senses must have dulled considerably."

With each step Raika took, an eerie energy pressed forward like a wall, but Jane's mission allowed no retreat.

"By order of His Majesty the King. As of today, the Kingdom of Tormia takes control of Seonghwa. Surrender quietly and follow the King's command."

Jane, now returned to being a cold mage, moved her tentacle-type Spirit Zone to threaten Raika.

"Ha, after raising it all this time, now you want to take it?"

"You knew this would happen anyway. You should be grateful we let you have your way until now."

"I don't like that about humans."

Raika's lower body turned black and transformed into hundreds of bats that flew toward Jane.

"Thinking you're some great existence."
