All That Strife (1)

Under the silent pressure of the entire excavation team's gaze, Dorothy came clean.

"Yeah, that's what happened."

Whenever she reminisced about their school days over drinks, Dorothy would always bring up Iruki.

Though everyone knew how she felt and no one criticized her for it, they had to separate personal matters from work.

"I know we have no choice but to accept it anyway."

Canis said.

"But if work got turned upside down because of personal feelings, I should at least get an apology from Iruki."

Sabina twisted her lips.

"Do you need to be so persistent? Let's just let bygones be bygones and make peace first."

"I didn't join this team for money, but for the ruins. This way doesn't make up for it."

Since everyone values different things, Sabina couldn't argue with that either.

"Canis, let's just back down." Arin said.

"We're all alumni from the same school anyway. Iruki must have a lot on his mind too."

Canis felt more surprised than disappointed.

"Why are you suddenly saying that? Even setting emotions aside, that's the right thing to do considering the order of things."

Arin looked back at Dorothy.

"You know, don't you? What's happening with Iruki."

With everyone's attention focused on Dorothy, her lips turned downward.

"Iruki... might die." Closer frowned.

"What are you talking about?"

"I don't know the details either. But they say if his brain keeps getting overloaded like this, it could lead to brain death..."

Canis said.

"Overdrive."

He remembered the blue electricity that used to flash in Iruki's eyes during their magic school days.

Arin sighed.

"Iruki is unique even among Servants. I always thought he wouldn't last long. If that's true, he shouldn't be on the battlefield anymore. He needs rest."

Closer snorted.

"Is that his personality? Besides, he's the general commanding the holy war. Overload is inevitable."

Sabina smiled bitterly.

"You're really something too. Even knowing that, you still want to meet him?"

Dorothy hung her head.

"This isn't something I should say as team leader, but couldn't we help Iruki? I'm asking as a favor."

"Canis."

When Arin looked back, Canis was openly displaying his displeasure.

"...What an idiot." What does the world matter if he's destroying his own brain to fight for humanity?

"Fine."

Canis raised both hands in surrender.

"Let's do whatever he asks. We just need to leave this place, right?"

A voice came from outside the temporary building.

"No. It would be troublesome if you left." When Iruki opened the door and entered, everyone looked surprised.

"Iruki..."

Iruki chuckled as he calmly accepted their pitying gazes.

"I knew this would happen."

They were already treating him like a corpse.

"Don't look at me like that. My brain is still fine. I'm not dying to die either."

Canis snapped.

"Who cares? But what do you mean it would be troublesome if we left?"

"Exactly what I said. You need to stay here and help me with my work."

That was why he had revealed the classified information.

"There's a limit to how much you can look down on people."

"Sorry for interfering with your dream." Canis, who was about to get up, stopped abruptly.

"Honestly, just fighting the demons is overwhelming enough. I desperately need help. There's nothing better than alumni. I think I can trust you guys to handle it."

If they could take over even one part of his responsibilities, Iruki's brain would be much more at ease.

"Tch, you should have done this from the beginning."

When Canis sat back down with a sulky expression, Arin grinned broadly.

Sabina asked.

"Alright, since it's come to this, we'll do our best to help. What are we mining?"

"Radioactive materials for elemental bombs. Partner companies will arrive. Of course, you'll be in command. As long as we can meet the target amount, it's fine to protect the dwarf ruins."

Canis joined the conversation.

"How urgent is this matter?"

"Nade is already designing production lines through the company. We'll get cooperation from Ainca Alchemy."

"Ainca, you mean Richard's father?" Richard of alchemy, who was a member of the Golden Ring, graduated in the same class as Sirone.

"No. Richard is the owner now. His father Marto is in charge of the superhuman project at Valkyrie's weapons development department."

"This is practically a reunion."

It also meant that Iruki was cornered.

"I'll return to the holy war. I'll put all my effort into blocking hell's army. I won't have the capacity to think about anything else. I'm leaving this place to you."

Dorothy asked.

"How should we handle progress reports?"

"Once the production line is stable, Nade will come down soon. Discuss the details with him." Sabina rested her chin on both hands.

"Everyone's working so hard."

Their efforts would be medicine to extend Iruki's life.

Closer shouted.

"Alright, let's do this! Let's turn this whole mountain range upside down!"

Hot flames burned in each of their hearts, remembering their school days' competition.

Havitz's army was cutting vertically through the Ferris Kingdom, which could be called the center of the central continent.

"Go! Time is power!"

Before gathering the demons scattered around the world, Vulcan planned to push forward as much as possible.

While the holy war soldiers were being trampled by demons, the one who stood out most was Havitz.

"Huff! Huff!"

Sitting on his horse and breathing heavily, an army of ten thousand filled his vision.

But no one knew that Havitz was approaching.

Even when he reached the commander, the royal guards didn't move.

"Listen, proud army of Valkyrie!"

The moment the commander shouted, Havitz's sword cut his throat.

"We... Gak. We are..."

Why wouldn't the words come out?

The royal guards looked back with puzzled expressions, then shouted with shocked eyes.

"Commander!"

Though his head had already fallen and was rolling on the ground, the commander's expression seemed unaware of even that.

"Charge... charge..."

His breath stopped.

"What happened? Who on earth!"

In the vision of the royal guard who lifted his head, red light blazed like flames.

As the light cleared, what appeared was Havitz on horseback.

"It's the Emperor! Kill him!"

Forgetting even their commander's death at the appearance of this crucial factor, all the royal guards rushed forward.

Simultaneously, red heat waves rose from Havitz's body, revealing Satan's incarnation.

Incarnation Technique: Banishing (Non-event).

"What?"

The knights who lost sight of Havitz stopped their charge and looked around.

In an instant, seven heads fell.

"Huh? Huh?"

What was shocking enough to make them lose their minds was that all the dead were unaware of what had happened to them.

"What is this! What the hell is this!"

"To, Tommy..."

The comrade of the one who shouted said with a terrified expression.

"You, your face..."

"Huh?"

As if cut by Havitz's sword, everything from the crown of his head to his left cheekbone had fallen off.

"What about me?"

It was terrifying that he didn't realize half his vision had disappeared.

"You, you're dead..."

Before the words could finish, the royal guard with the fallen face rolled his eyes back and died.

"Uh, uaaah... UAAAAH!"

A royal guard driven mad by shock and terror screamed, but he didn't realize it.

The fact that his lower body was already separated.

Hearing the commotion from the holy army in the distance, Vulcan's lips curled up.

"Havitz has awakened."

He hadn't become transparent, nor was he using illusions.

'The event itself doesn't exist.'

Because he was moving outside the law, those within the law couldn't even perceive him.

Even if he broke their fingers, they wouldn't be able to feel anything strange about their broken fingers.

"That is Satan."

The crystallization of chaos.

Havitz swept through the holy army, moving freely apart from hell's forces.

'It's connected.'

Link.

The truth he realized while swallowing the woman's breast milk was a fragment of this world's core secret.

'If I put my mind to it, I can... connect with anything.'

"UAAAAH! He, hell! This is hell!"

Havitz jumped off his running horse and began wildly slashing at the soldiers.

"You! Your, your head...!"

Havitz, who had been cutting a soldier's head until exhausted, suddenly knelt and closed his eyes.

"I'm sleepy."

Infinitely free.

When he awoke and slowly stood up, lifting his eyelids, all the soldiers looked back.

"There he is!"

Havitz, who had penetrated into their perception, was indifferent even seeing the great army charging at him with spears first.

"If everything is connected, then death too..."

With a thud, a spear penetrated Havitz and protruded from his back.

"Is just one form of life."

The soldier shouted with unbelieving eyes.

"I got him! I, I killed him!"

From behind, hell's great army surged forward.

"KRAAAAH! Destroy the humans!"

In an instant, the holy army was swept away, and Vulcan found Havitz lying on the ground.

He was bleeding, pierced by the spear.

"Zetaro!"

Zetaro, officially an army medic, hurriedly turned his horse toward Vulcan.

"Why! Why! What happened...!"

He too was shocked seeing Havitz.

"Havitz! Damn it! What is Shiok doing!"

"He's already come. I sent him." Though the blood loss was considerable, no trace of fear could be found on Havitz's face.

"This is tricky. Natasha, pull this spear out for me."

Natasha approached.

"Oh? You got pierced by a spear?"

Speaking casually, she grabbed the spear and pulled it out with a whoosh, sparks flying from Havitz's eyes.

"That's it. Let's do first aid first." Watching Zetaro take tools from his bag, Havitz said in a hoarse voice.

"Doctor."

"Yeah?"

"Is there a way to save me?" Zetaro slowly turned his head with shaking pupils, looking at Havitz and gulping.

'He's expecting something.'

Havitz's eyes were sparkling brightly.

'I'm an entertainer. This has to be funny no matter what.'

Zetaro put his hand in his bag, rummaging for something, clearing his throat as he spoke.

"Hmm, so first, the method of emergency treatment is..."

Suddenly madness filled Zetaro's eyes, and he frantically stabbed Havitz's abdomen with the scalpel in his hand.

"How would I know that?!"

As the blade struck with stabbing sounds, Havitz grimaced in pain and burst into laughter.

"Puhehehe! Puhehehehe!"

"UAAH! UAAAAH!"

Vulcan grabbed Zetaro, who was giving his all to the performance, and threw him backward.

"You crazy bastard! What are you doing!"

Blood was gushing from Havitz's mangled abdomen.

"Havitz! Stay conscious!"

Confirming he had lost consciousness, Vulcan bared his teeth and glared at Zetaro.

"You..."

"No, no, Havitz likes it." Vulcan sighed.

"We retreat for now. Treating Havitz is the priority."

Since Havitz's awakening, even Vulcan couldn't guess the basis for his judgments.

'Tch, we're tied down here.' For the first time, hell's army stopped its march.
