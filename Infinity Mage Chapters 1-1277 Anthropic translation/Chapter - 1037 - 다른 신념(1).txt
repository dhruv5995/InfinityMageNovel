Emotional Disease Case, Number 13

465.

Paimon's demon realm, Emotion Scale had taken control of the southern continent beyond the central continent.

"Cough. Cough!"

A large man left alone in a huge mansion was prostrated on the stairs, groaning.

Clovis, the great tycoon of the Kaley Kingdom.

He was ranked second in the kingdom's financial hierarchy, and even throughout the southern continent, he was among the top 100 conglomerates.

"Why, why..."

Clovis made a tearful face.

"Why does it keep hurting?"

First, he killed the maid.

Next, his friend, then his 13 wives, then his 7 children.

Everything had happened in a single day, and he had just finished slashing open his beloved Cassie's belly.

"Could it be that she's still not dead?"

Grasping onto his reason that was numbing from pain, Clovis limped down the stairs.

His wives and children with their eyes open were collapsed on the cold floor, looking at him.

"Ugh! It hurts. It hurts so much."

It seemed like pain no human could endure.

"Cassie, are you still alive?"

A large breed dog was sprawled with its intestines spilled out, tongue hanging long.

"Die. Just die quickly. I'm suffering too much."

Even the sensation he felt when stabbing with the longsword hurt like breaking bones.

"Ahh! Ahhhhh!"

Only after seeing the dog's corpse with no more places to stab did Clovis realize the reality.

"What am I supposed to do! I've killed everyone! What more do I have to give up to stop the pain!"

The longsword he threw bounced off the wall and hit below a shelf holding pottery.

"Gasp!"

His complexion turned pale at the same time the shaking pottery fell to the floor.

"No! No!"

He rushed over frantically and picked up one of hundreds of fragments, his hands trembling.

"Damn it! Do you know how much this costs! You stupid fool!"

At that moment, Clovis realized his sense of pain had returned to normal.

"Money..."

Having found a new path, the first thing he did was shake his head.

"No. How could I give up the money I've earned? I haven't rested a single day since I was 7. No one can be happy."

"Bastards! Mongrels! Lowly things! How dare you covet my money! Who would want to live like you!"

Whether one piece of pottery was worth a speck of dust, the pain began to surge again.

"Ahh, no."

Terror-stricken Clovis trembled in all his limbs.

"Please, someone stop this. I'll give you 100 million gold, no, 1 billion gold, so please heal me."

Please, please...

"Ahhhhhhh!"

As the threshold increased, pain twice as terrible as before seized his entire body.

"Help me! H-help me!"

16 hours later.

When the World Health Organization arrived, the burning mansion was said to have brightly illuminated the dawn.

"Phew..."

Closing the Number 13-465 file, Seriel looked at Clovis lying on the bed.

It was a corpse as black and hard as charcoal.

"Immediate cremation?"

After signing the file prepared by the mental mage and standing up, the inspector covered the corpse with cloth.

"Yes. We contacted around, but no one came forward to hold a funeral. It's only natural."

It was a lonely death.

"Understood. Please proceed with the disposal."

Seriel's expression remained calm as she left the mortuary and even when she returned to the research lab.

What greeted her were memos stuck to the wall and large graphs recorded by time.

Reality came crashing in.

"Sigh."

What kind of life the victim had lived had long been buried under hundreds of reports arriving daily.

"Hah! Hah! Hah!"

Why couldn't it be cured?

Helplessness welled up, and to deny it, she desperately summoned anger.

"Ahhhhh! So frustrating!"

She threw everything in sight.

'Endure it! I must endure!'

Even knowing that anger couldn't solve problems, her body wasn't obeying her brain's control.

Shirone forcefully opened the research lab door.

"Seriel! What's wrong?"

When she came to her senses, the room was in chaos and blood was flowing from her hand.

"You're hurt? Why were you so agitated, that's not like you?"

As he approached to check the wound, Seriel lowered her arm and spoke in a trembling voice.

"Shirone."

Reading despair in her eyes, Shirone realized the blood wasn't the problem.

"Seriel, I know it's hard but..."

Seriel collapsed against Shirone's chest, burying her face and clutching his collar as she wept.

"Ahh... wahhhhh..."

It was a sorrowful cry.

"It's okay."

Repeating the only words he could say, Shirone stroked Seriel's back.

"It's okay. Everything will be okay."

How much time had passed?

After shedding tears until his clothes were soaked, Seriel's breathing gradually stabilized.

"...Sorry."

Unable to show her face, she pulled Shirone's collar even closer.

"What's there to be sorry about? You can cry all you want when it's hard. No one doubts your best efforts."

Even if not everyone in the world would agree.

Finally lifting her head slightly, Seriel pouted her lower lip and said:

"If you tell Amy, you're dead. Keep your mouth shut until I say something."

"Haha! Got it. Let's look at your hand first."

Though Seriel's specialty was healing magic, in situations like this, it was more a matter of mood.

The wound was long but fortunately not deep.

"How did you get so worked up?"

Sitting in a chair receiving Shirone's treatment, Seriel lit a cigarette.

"I don't know. I've been having nightmares lately. I think I should reduce the case reviews."

Shirone smiled bitterly.

"Right. It must be hard."

"Emotional disease. Having to look into a person's deepest inner self. It's not something you can endure while staying sane."

Seriel turned her head.

"You're really amazing. How can you bear it? If I were you, I would have gone crazy."

"You're doing well enough too. You created guidelines after analyzing countless cases. Just know that you've saved far more people than those you couldn't save."

"Right."

Seriel was grateful.

"Oh, I called you because I have a favor to ask. Would a business trip be possible?"

"Business trip? What for?"

Seriel put out her cigarette and rummaged through her desk.

"Where did it go?"

Fumbling through documents, she sat down on the floor and examined the scattered papers one by one.

"Yes, this is it. Want to take a look first?"

When Shirone examined it, he saw regions where emotional disease cases were reported marked on a map.

"Each red dot represents 100 people. If we reduce the scale, it becomes much more precise, but this should be sufficient."

"Yeah. I see what you mean."

It was definitely an abnormal distribution.

"Emotion Scale's pathogen spreads through wind. While humans are included in the transmission route, since most countries activated quarantine policies, the transmission power isn't great. Therefore..."

Shirone continued:

"The frequency of emotional disease case reports should be highest in the central continent and gradually decrease as you move southwest. But looking at this map, there are empty regions here and there as if the wind was cut off."

"Right. It feels like there are windless zones in the southern continent. At first, I thought it was invaded by demons, but when I inquired with the Holy War, they said hell's army is blocked at Kaley's border. So this time I investigated those regions. Whether they might be the kingdom's administrative cities or military strategic points."

"Well, in that case, announcing casualties could be poisonous to their own country."

"But that's not it."

Seriel pointed to the map.

"From my investigation, I couldn't find any reason not to report cases. Rather, most were unremarkable rural territories."

"Did you send investigators?"

"I reported to headquarters first. If my opinion is persuasive, they'll issue an emergency order, but it's uncertain whether they can postpone dealing with the nobles of each country, which should be handled first."

The issue of recovering their assets was important.

"It was frustrating to just wait for headquarters' decision, so I kept thinking about it, and suddenly this thought occurred to me. Perhaps it's not that reports weren't made, but that there really are regions overcoming emotional disease?"

A moment of silence flowed.

"Hmm, but even if that's true, happening simultaneously across the entire southern continent is too large in scale, isn't it? And it's not core cities but small villages..."

Stopping mid-sentence, Shirone connected the empty spaces on the map with imaginary lines.

"It's some kind of route."

"Same thought. So I investigated all night. Special products distributed in those regions, even agricultural tool materials. The result was that none matched. I hit a wall there, then last night I decided to really go for it. If some region's goods are being distributed to the southern continent, the place that benefited most would be that item's production site."

"You investigated all of that?"

There was only one way to find the production site.

"I pulled out all the reports from Number 1 and started marking dots one by one. Did that for about 2 hours? Suddenly I realized there was no need for this. A place that had never appeared even once came to mind."

Shirone focused.

"So I gave up on the map and went through documents until that place appeared. The result was 0. There's a region, no, a kingdom where not a single emotional disease case has been reported."

Seriel drew a border line above the Iron Kingdom at the southern continent's southernmost tip.

"Can you guess where?"

Shirone, picturing it in his mind, got goosebumps.

"Kaesia Kingdom."

It was where Fermi was.

"It's drugs."

"Right, this is a drug trafficking route. Produced in Kaesia and spread to various parts of the southern continent. And in places where these drugs are distributed, emotional disease cases aren't reported."

"But... is that even possible?"

"That's exactly the problem. We tested all kinds of morphine, sedatives, tranquilizers, even special drugs, but emotional disease symptoms weren't reduced. What on earth is this? What kind of drug are they using to overcome emotional disease?"

Shirone covered his mouth and thought.

'It's too suspicious to be a coincidence. Fermi becoming a drug trafficker happened long before the demon realm opened. There's no way he could have foreseen this situation...'

A sound escaped without him realizing.

"Ah."

It might be possible.

'Because it's Fermi.'

Shirone shook his head.

'Honestly, I don't know. But it's even harder to believe that guy stumbled backwards and caught a mouse. If all of this was calculated...'

On that day he couldn't remember, what exactly had Fermi proposed to him?

'And I...'

Why had he accepted that proposal?

"Go to Kaesia."

Seriel, who had been looking at Shirone, pressed both ends of her pen with her hands as she spoke.

"No matter how I think about it, this is impossible for investigators to confirm. Fermi has already taken control of Kaesia, so official response is awkward too. I know it's a difficult request, but I'd like you to go personally and confirm."

"Got it."

The means to suppress emotional disease was important, but before the Holy War, this was someone he absolutely had to meet.

"I'll leave now."

Another Shirone departed for Kaesia.
