Final Chapter (2)

The Terraforce soldier was bewildered.

'Rolling around on flat ground.'

No, was it really flat ground?

It wasn't simply that the direction of gravity had changed - it felt like the axis of the world itself had tilted.

'It's like falling off a cliff.'

Though he belatedly responded with a gravity field, his axis kept rotating like a compass that had lost its magnetic field.

Execution impossible. Requesting support.

The mothership remaining in the atmosphere was also carefully observing the ground battle.

"...This is troublesome."

The state of the soldiers flying around crawling on the ground was clearly not normal.

"A direct confrontation is difficult. That being's body and mind are the most perfect ideals."

Being an alien life form, they could most clearly grasp Quan's thinking.

"Activate Force Kind (Type 4 Close Encounter)."

This was the abduction method Terraforce used to investigate life forms on specific planets.

"You mean to bring that human here? We cannot carry out operations that could endanger the mothership."

"No."

Their wave eyes converted the sounds from the ground into image form.

It was like a mirage where the atmosphere was compressed, and the place where the valleys formed most rapidly was...

"Olifer Siina."

The one and only reason Quan moved.

"Tremendously emotional waves. As long as that woman is on the ground, we cannot carry out our operation."

"What if he pursues?"

"Pursues?"

Terraforce looked at his colleague.

"That's a good joke. I've studied humans extensively."

In fact, it wasn't a joke, but it was understandable that his colleague would think so.

'Well, a Terraforce soldier might be one thing, but there's no way he could do anything to the mothership.'

The commander gave the order.

"Bring her."

Meanwhile, Crown, aboard Quan's body, felt a thrilling exhilaration from the transcendent aerobatics.

"Wow, I thought it was junk... but it's ultra-high performance."

'What to do about this.'

To the Illuminati who knew the outside world, the results of reality weren't important.

Usually they guided humanity's direction from a god's perspective through war, resource control, disease, and such...

'Since there's no user, it doesn't matter if I go back.'

But precisely because this was such a rare world, there was one doubt that held him back.

'This time I'll play along.'

Accepting Quan's emotions, he unhesitatingly cut through the Terraforce.

Beep! Beep! Beep!

'What?'

At that moment, red lights began flashing from the lens attached to the soldier's gauntlet.

Gravity reversal. Prepare.

"Quan!"

When he turned his head at Siina's voice, a red flash was illuminating her.

'Force Kind. They plan to take her.'

Can't stop that.

Knowing Terraforce's technology, Crown calmly lowered his sword, but...

"Siinaaaaa!"

Quan was different.

"Kugh!"

A tremendous signal struck his mind, and Crown grimaced and staggered.

'Can't control him.'

In an instant, Siina was pulled up into the sky and disappeared into the Terraforce mothership.

Siina! Siina! Siina!

'Calm down! There's nothing we can do! And those guys are...'

Ku ku ku ku ku!

As a rough atmospheric sound erupted, all the charging soldiers looked up at the sky.

Crown did the same.

"What... is that?"

Asymmetrical pole.

As the world's axis shook, the city-sized mothership was swaying.

Protect! Protect! Protect!

"Crazy..."

Before he could finish speaking, control passed over and Quan's body flew up into the sky.

Crown tried his best, but he couldn't overcome the single signal of "protect."

'This guy...'

Why is he doing this?

'He endlessly destroys himself. Unlike Garas. This actually moves him further from reproduction.'

Love.

'What meaning does it have in this universe?'

Perhaps this question might be the only remaining task in the outside world.

The survivors had finished their preparations for departure before humanity's final war.

"Let's fight. We are the masters of this world!"

Among the resistance forces gathered in the cavity were the Parrot Mercenary Corps who had once commanded the world.

"Sister."

The operator came to Marsha.

"Why are you here? The demons will come soon. Hide somewhere safe with the other operators."

Even if she was number one in combat power in High Gear, in reality she was just a smart girl.

"You'll come back, right?"

Well, if they lost the war, all life forms on this planet would lose their home.

"Don't worry."

Freeman spoke bluntly.

"I'll protect my woman."

"Pfft."

At those words, Marsha, whose tension had eased, kissed the operator's head.

"Yes, I'll come back. I promise."

As the operator went down to the underground with a forced smile, Marsha rolled her eyes.

"Your woman?"

"So? Who else in the world is going to take you besides me?"

In a way, that's exactly why.

"...What a really shitty world."

While the executives burst into laughter, Marsha regained her composure.

'Can the ground forces hold out?'

According to the future information she had seen, it would probably be close to this point.

'Cell Buster.'

North Pole.

A pair of man and woman arrived at the wasteland where even the ivory tower, symbol of intelligence, had disappeared.

"Is this the place?"

Jin Seong-eum, who was in the room based on the boundary line, pointed to the sky and said.

"It will start from there."

When Guitarman looked up, there was a gray mass gathered like a huge moon.

"According to Sing's calculations, it's in 5 minutes. Please stop it for humanity's sake. No, hold out as long as possible."

'Humanity.'

Ranstin took a few steps forward.

"Go on."

After Jin Seong-eum watched for a moment and then closed the ether wave, the Arctic wind blew.

Whiiiiii.

Rin grumbled.

"It's cold. What song with not even one audience member?"

"Hehe."

Ranstin laughed.

"When did we ever make music caring about such things? Let's have fun our way."

"Ah. Ah."

Before long, Rin was warming up her voice, and Ranstin was tuning his object <Guitaru>.

It could make the sounds of various instruments simultaneously, but had no killing power in itself.

'Death Pattern.'

What killed living beings was ultimately Ranstin's mental resonance magic.

"It's coming."

Rin looked at the sky and said.

As the balance broke, Anti-Cell, which had been a perfect sphere, was falling in a water drop shape.

"They're coming to kill us first."

Rin's voice didn't reach Ranstin's ears.

Daddy. Daddy.

He heard his daughter's voice.

Play guitar.

At the point when Anti-Cell had traversed half the sky, Rin turned her head in an upright posture.

"Aren't you going to do it?"

Daddy, I love you.

'Why?'

Do you live like this?

'An unsuccessful artist? Because my wife cheated? Because my daughter died of a cold?'

The moment Anti-Cell swooped down to crush them.

"Kick!"

Ranstin burst into an incomprehensible laugh and played his guitar violently.

Jijijijijiji!

'Death Pattern (Fingerprint of Death).'

Anti-Cell, swept up in the sound waves of high-speed arpeggios, vibrated and exploded.

Rin did exercises while muttering.

"Going up."

The altitude increased from the explosion's impact, but this time it split into two and fell.

Jijijijijiji!

With the continuing high notes, explosion after explosion, it instantly multiplied to 32 pieces.

"The audience is growing."

Guitarman's ability had more powerful control as the number of listeners increased.

This was the strongest technique of crowd control that Fermi had conceived as Anti-Cell's countermeasure.

"Slowly..."

At the point when Anti-Cell became 128 pieces, Ranstin stopped playing and straightened his back.

"Shall we start?"

It seemed the warm-up was over.

On the ground. Not far from the cathedral, the universe's strongest martial arts unfolded.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Hearing the earth-shaking roar, Mini returned to human size and crawled on the ground.

"Ariana, are you okay?"

Her partner, the blonde beauty, was also covered in blood and could barely breathe.

"Yeah. But... did we really lose?"

The two women looked around the battlefield.

Ikael's triangular demon Ashur was competing with Girsin with swords.

"They're all monsters."

And farther away, the archangel Ikael remaining on the ground and...

"Kahahaha!"

The strongest, Ymir, collided.

Kururururu!

On the earth with nothing left to protect, Ikael's mind was in perfect battle mode.

'Side. Rear. Side.'

Tracking Ymir's speed, which left no afterimage, with 'looking down,' she gritted her teeth.

'Here!'

To simply turn her body 115 degrees required approximately 12,000 amplifications.

'Amplify!'

Ikael's fist made a smacking sound as it struck something in the air.

"Kughhhh!"

Ymir, hit squarely in the jaw, leaned back and retreated dozens of meters.

"...Ehehehe."

Behind him, a hill of dirt had been created.

"Magnificent. To produce such destructive power from such a slender body. Truly an archangel."

Ikael grabbed her numb wrist.

'Incredibly hard.'

"Honestly speaking, I've been interested since heaven. Your battles were always elegant."

"Such desire arose."

Ymir, who had created six arms, bent his knees and the air became heavy.

"What if I beat you until I kill you?"

The moment he kicked off the ground, the earth collapsed as if a nuclear explosion had occurred underground.

Ymir arrived as quickly as that force and struck Ikael with six fists.

"Huk!"

"Yes! That's the face!"

Unlike Lian or Augent, the expression that tried not to lose dignity until the end by frowning.

It wasn't particularly likeable, but that's exactly why he wanted to break it at least once.

"Here I come!"

Though it was a fist coming from behind his shoulder, it seemed to rush in from the distant universe beyond.

'Gigantification.'

Before Ymir's endlessly growing fist, Ikael's eyes sank into despair.

"Lord Ikael!"

Just as Ashur, who had just cut through Girsin's body, was about to move with Signal's signal.

"Grahhhh!"

Girsin regenerated dozens of legs below his torso and embraced him.

"I can't die alone!"

The legs writhing like bugs seemed to show Girsin's desperation from before.

Ashur couldn't move.

'Damn it! The signal!'

He could collect all signals in the universe, but the panel's domain had to be perfect.

"Taha!"

Then Ariana caught Girsin's two longest legs under her armpits.

'Telekinesis...!'

Giant swing.

Squeezing out the last signal to throw Girsin, Ashur's body finally disappeared.

"Kugh! How dare these things...!"

A shadow fell over Girsin's face as he couldn't maintain balance with too many legs.

"Huh?"

Mini, transformed into a super giant, lifted her foot and trampled Girsin like an ant.

Kuuuuuu!

"Phew."

Mini, who had returned to human size while bending both knees, touched the ground and said.

"Hah, we won."

"But isn't this a disqualification?" Somewhat against the rules.

"Who cares? That's the charm of professional wrestling."

"True."

Ariana giggled.

Meanwhile, Ashur, who had moved to protect Ikael, witnessed an amazing sight.

Under a mountain-sized fist, an archangel about one-thousandth that size was standing.

"Uriel."

Ikael saw his back as he supported Ymir's fist with only his right hand.

"...Why?"

Uriel only turned his head slightly toward her and said nothing.

"Kukuku."

Ymir's mouth corners tore.

"I knew it. If I beat up what you love most, you'd appear."

The end of the world is good for this reason.

No matter what beliefs you have, you ultimately have no choice but to clash with yourself.

'That is universal supremacy.'

But Ymir was still unsatisfied.

Was Lian's final blow simple luck, or a leap to a new realm?

'Come quickly.'

Ymir touched his fist and tilted his head.

"It won't be boring."

Regression, 293rd cycle.

Sirone, who had blocked the solar wind, once again ran toward Nane at full speed.

"Uahhh!"

A speed 32 seconds faster than existing history.

'It worked!'

This should be enough.

"Amita..."

But what entered Sirone's eyes was...

"No, don't!"

"Avalokitesvara."

The sight of Nane killing Amy with a frightening expression, shedding tears of blood.

"Naneeeee!"

Sirone shot forward.

678th cycle.

'Faster! Faster!'

Time didn't matter anymore.

The problem was that Nane's life was responding precisely to match Sirone's time.

"Please..."

Sirone arrived gritting his teeth, and saw Nane putting his palms together.

"Kughhhh!"

Blood from burst capillaries dripped down from Nane's bowed face.

"Why?"

Nane asked, and Sirone shouted.

"Why exactly!"

Why do you have to go this far?

He had already lost his loved one hundreds of times, and killed his loved one hundreds of times.

"Sirone!"

Buddha was also filled with evil.

"I won't give up! Accept the emptiness! Don't leave any more pain in this world!"

"Uahhh!"

Sirone flew toward him.

2,469th cycle.

At a point where both time and space had completely changed, Yahweh and Buddha met again.

It was after Amy had disappeared.

At a distance they could reach in an instant if they threw themselves, both their eyes were terribly exhausted.

"Let's compromise."

Sirone said.

"I'll die instead. Save Amy. Just let her live in this world."

Nane shook his head.

"I can't do that. If separated from the outside world, your world will become perfect. But Sirone, what if that world becomes stained with evil? Then there will only be suffering."

"Whatever situation comes, it's what we chose. And we'll definitely choose good."

"We."

Nane was bitter.

"Not just you alone?"

Sirone ground his teeth and clenched his fists.

"...I'll fight."

"So will I."

The compromise had failed.

6,579th cycle.

Sirone was already crying.

"Uahh..."

Repeated so many times, his heart now seemed made only of sadness.

'I can't do it.'

Honestly, he didn't want to go.

Because he could no longer bear the heart-tearing pain of experiencing it even once more.

'I don't want to see it.'

But he missed her so much.

Just imagining it felt like cool water seeping into his dried-up mind.

"Ah..."

Sirone headed there without realizing it.

"Amy."

Alpheas Magic School.

Sirone, who had been looking around the park for Amy, saw her sitting on a bench.

His heart unknowingly pounded at the sight of her back with red hair tied tightly.

'Yes, let's meet.'

Just as he was about to take that step, Ceriel came running from far away, waving her hand.

"Amy!"

As if he had committed a crime, Sirone hurriedly hid behind a tree.

Amy's voice was heard.

"What? Why are you so late?"

"Hehe! Sorry! I overslept."

"Honestly."

Having met with difficulty in their busy schedules, they complained about the hardships of being seniors.

"The monthly evaluation is the problem. Especially interpersonal combat. Since points are at stake, even after getting along well, it becomes awkward."

Ceriel grinned.

"Hihi, I know."

"What?"

"You're worried about fighting Sirone, right? What if things get awkward?"

"Wh-what are you talking about? Where are personal feelings in a test? I don't get upset over such things."

"Who said anything? The problem is what if Sirone gets upset."

"Sirone!"

Amy stopped speaking.

"Would he really get upset?"

"Hmm."

In front of her friend, Ceriel was also serious.

"Tell me honestly. Sirone or the test? If you really think the test is important, then first..."

"I like him."

Amy was also honest.

"I like him. That's why it's complicated. Just being with him makes me nervous and excited. Honestly, well..."

"Kissing would be possible?"

"Yes. Ah, but I absolutely hate doing it first. It's not that I dislike Sirone, it's just..."

"I know what you mean."

Worry crossed Ceriel's eyes as she said that.

'Should I tell her?'

About Fermi.

Amy tilted her head.

"What? You seem more worried than me. Do you have someone you're dating?"

"No. It's not like that..."

Ceriel, who had been conflicted, smiled bitterly.

"I'll tell you later. Later."

In the end, Sirone couldn't meet Amy.

'That's fortunate.'

Just hearing her voice had brought him to the brink of losing all will.

'Why didn't I know?'

No, he knew even then, but his current emotions were beyond description.

'I shouldn't have gone to meet her.'

He had thought too easily that he couldn't love her more than this.

"I'll go save her! I'll definitely save her!"

If he didn't grasp even that hope, he felt like he would really give up everything.

"Amy."

A name he could exchange for his life.

"Amy."

The shape of my heart.

"Am..."

Sirone stopped walking.

"Huk."

As if realizing it for the first time, the world without her felt too vividly real.

"Uh uh uh. Uh uh uh."

He could only cry like a fool.

Killing intent flashed in Miro's eyes.

"Come at me!"

Beyond the endlessly surging demons, Satan with his pitch-black body was sneering.

"What a stubbornly old-fashioned woman."

Havitz stretched out his hand and commanded.

"Go, my dogs."

"Uahhh! Charge!"

Since disobedience meant eternal suffering, the demons charged with fire in their eyes.

The incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara struck down the demons like lightning, but there were too many.

"Damn...!"

When Havitz activated Death Field, thousands of demons burst into flames.

"Grahhhhh!"

Since Satan had already lost even the concept of allies, the radius covered the entire earth.

"Huk!"

Even the incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara turned to black charcoal, transmitting terrible pain to Miro.

'What kind of thing is this?'

Purely according to his whims.

If Nane fought with righteousness, then Havitz was perfect wrongness itself.

"What are you doing? You claim to be good?"

When Miro looked up, Havitz had somehow approached.

"The villain boss is right here." The silhouette without even a face spread both arms and shook his hips mockingly.

"Hyahhhh!"

The incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara unleashed tremendous rapid strikes, but only pain was felt.

Miro gritted her teeth and retreated.

"Huh uh uh."

Her trembling hands were smoking, and she could think of nothing but pain.

'How do I beat this?'

"What are you doing?"

Satan's lower jaw split wide open.

"If you won't fight, I'll play with you?"

"This..."

Fire sparked in Miro's eyes again.

"You bastard!"

The furious incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara delivered 30 million hits toward Satan.

JIJIJIJIJIJIJIJI

It was a miracle achieved through time fragmentation, but what returned was corresponding pain.

"Ahhhhhhh!"

Miro ended up screaming.

"Puhahaha! What's that? What kind of ultimate good is that? You're just like other humans!"

She didn't notice Satan's change as he gradually adopted a child's speech pattern.

'It's frustrating.'

Why can't I win?

'Ultimate good and ultimate evil.'

If they define each other, they should at least be able to fight like Gong and Ae.

Kneeling, Miro shouted.

"Why! Why exactly are you doing this!"

Even to the contextless question, Havitz's answer was the same.

"Because it's fun."

His body gradually grew larger, becoming dozens of meters in size as he lifted his foot.

"This is gigantification."

Before Satan's ability to manipulate the world at will, Miro's face turned pale.

"I'll leave your mouth open."

Havitz said as he brought down his foot.

"I want to hear you beg me to kill you."

At that moment, tremendous air pressure as if the entire sky was pouring down crushed him.

Ku ku ku ku ku ku ku!

"...Huh?"

He tried to endure but eventually seemed unable to bear it.

"Uh uh?"

Such overwhelming scale.

Satan hurriedly reduced his size and crouched, and everything on earth was crushed.

Ku

The demons within the radius were crushed with a thud, and only Havitz remained standing.

"Kugh ugh."

Gaold was slowly walking over.

"You're quite something for your age."

If it had been normal planetary durability, the entire area would already have become a lava sea.

The next moment, Guitarman's performance echoing from the sky began changing to heavy metal.

"Ah..."

It might have been mere coincidence, but Miro found herself naturally recalling the life of the man who had arrived at the battlefield.

"Gaold."

As he passed by Miro's side, he looked down coldly.

"Leaving me behind to go off alone?"

"No, that's..."

At Miro's first flustered appearance, Gaold chuckled and moved forward.

"Leave it to me."

Havitz spat savagely.

"How dare you startle me? Do it one more time and I'll burn you. You'll suffer eternal pain."

"Eternal pain? Fire?"

Gaold's teeth ground together hard.

"Perfect."

His mouth corners tore upward and the ultimate technique of Great Heat Hell completely changed the landscape.

"That's my specialty."

Whooooosh!

Havitz quietly watched the scene of fire igniting at his fingertips and toes.

"Huh? This..."

At that moment, hot pain was felt and...

"Uahhh! It hurts! Ah...!"

Gaold's fist, carrying the power of Air Press, sent Satan flying far away.

As Gaold advanced, hundreds of demons were crushed, and Satan charged again.

"I can't be the only one in pain!"

Gaold's face contorted as he watched the form flying toward him with body spread.

"Ku, kukuku."

Stupid fool.

'Pain, you see.'

Unprecedented Air Press crushed the earth and...

'Can't be shared with others.'

A tremendous fiery explosion occurred due to the friction of the ground compressed over 10 meters.

Puuuuuung!

Even as the flames rushed toward them, Miro was lost in her own thoughts.

'Why?'

Why does ultimate evil, which ultimate good cannot touch, succumb to human realm?

The Terraforce Chief Justice had said this.

Evil cannot be defeated alone.

'And also...'

Winning is also evil's methodology. When all of good, evil, gong, and ae mesh together, humanity will make its final choice. We must endure until then.

The flames were suddenly blocked right in front of her.

"Huh?"

When Miro turned her head, Zein and Gang Nan, Sing and Zulu were walking over.

"You guys..."

Zein extended his hand.

"Finally found you. Well, not you, but Satan."

Unable to respond even to the pointed joke, Miro turned her gaze beyond them.

A human army was charging.
