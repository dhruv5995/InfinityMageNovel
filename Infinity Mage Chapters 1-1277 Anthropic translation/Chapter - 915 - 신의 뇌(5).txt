God's Brain (5)

"You're taking everyone?" Icael asked back.

"That's right. The shackles of creator and created. Isn't it a much more constructive proposal than arguing over who is god?"

That was certainly true, but Icael shook her head.

"Impossible. Yes, I'll honestly admit it. Your Idea - that is certainly a record-breaking event in this universe."

Taesung recalled the moment when light first entered the Gaian's eyes. Like Argoneth, no being in heaven could explain it.

"Perhaps there might be something called an outer world. But whatever it is, we cannot go out."

Because they had no Idea.

No, to be precise, their Idea was not the outer world, but themselves.

"I've done much research since leaving Ultima."

When Goffin spread his palm, a hexagonal light called Hexa rose like ice crystals.

"What is the signal of Idea? And if we could analyze that signal..."

Though Gaians possessed all the tendencies of Banya and Yaksha, they were also excellent scientists.

"Couldn't we create it artificially?"

The Gaians wore blank expressions.

"Create it... artificially?" If this world was composed of signals from outside, creating an Idea was the domain of god.

"That's right. That's Hexa. You could say it's a signal with information from outside, one that doesn't exist in this world."

When Goffin raised his arm, the Hexa shattered with a sharp sound and settled down as smoke.

"Miracle Stream."

Where the smoke of light passed, vines grew and flowers began to bloom rapidly.

The angels stirred.

"H-how...?"

Life could only be created when Ankera, Gaia, and Argoneth functioned simultaneously.

Goffin, who had raised both arms, looked fondly at the flowers blooming around him.

"This is my current level, but with continued research, I should be able to create more complex life."

Cariel murmured.

"Life..."

To him, the archangel of birth, Goffin's ability looked exactly like a divine miracle.

Goffin spoke to Icael.

"Do you understand what I mean? If we can conquer Idea, this world won't be the end for you either."

Though no one liked Gaians, this time even the archangels watched Icael's reaction.

"Not the end?"

A cold voice echoed.

"That too is Gaian thinking. You've left the human group and now try to become god? How utterly arrogant."

"If god is indifferent..."

Goffin's eyes gleamed.

"It wouldn't matter to drag him down, would it?"

"Blasphemy!"

As Ataraxia expanded sharply, her voice rang out thunderously.

"To us, there is only the eternally immortal Ra as god. Do you think we'd be deceived by your ridiculous hypothesis?"

Denying an angel's reason for existence was no different from telling a human to deny their parents.

"But..."

Goffin sent a pitying look.

"You wanted to go, didn't you?"

Icael's eyes widened as she bit her lip.

'That was true.'

When the Gaians first tried to leave the photon system, she had definitely wavered.

Even if the thought that this was the last chance had strongly influenced her, it was an irreversible mistake as an archangel.

"I changed after that."

After hearing Ankera's stern rebuke, she vowed never to doubt again.

"Gaians, abandon false hope. When Ankera resets the world, you too will disappear. Everything will return, and the law will be peaceful."

The now-restored Hand of God curved its fingers like a beast's claws.

A billion voices arose simultaneously.

"Did you think we'd just stand still? We'll stop the reset and annihilate Ankera."

An ultimately unbridgeable gap.

As the killing intent from both sides grew taut again, Satiel spoke in a trembling voice.

"Couldn't we at least try?"

When the archangels' gazes focused on her, she was terrified, but she found more courage.

"If angels and Gaians joined forces, we might be able to reveal the truth of this world."

Goffin also needed the archangels' abilities to delve deeper into his research on Hexa.

'Above all, Ataraxia.'

If they could amplify and investigate Idea's signal, Goffin's utopia wouldn't be just a dream.

"What are you saying?" Though killing intent gleamed in Icael's eyes, Satiel courageously opened her mouth.

"So at least talking about it..."

Metiel, the archangel of union, blurred.

BANG!

Swinging her arm at tremendous speed, Satiel took the blow to her face and flew away fast enough to disappear.

RUMMMBLE!

Dust clouds rose from where she crashed, and Metiel dusted off her fist, muttering.

"What a disgrace to angels."

With an arrogant and beautiful expression, she raised her fingertip and pointed at Goffin.

"Listen well, humans. God does not compromise. We will punish you and stabilize the world."

No need to complicate things - once Ankera succeeded in resetting, everything would be over.

"But before that..."

Metiel's sacred light body expanded into a halo.

"I'll kill you myself."

As if thinking the same thing, the five archangels except Icael spread their halos.

Maisin asked with serious eyes.

"Goffin, what do you plan to do?"

"Don't interfere. Ultima might waver. While I fight, stop Ankera's reset."

If Ultima wavered even for a moment, Ankera would activate the reset.

'Then it would be irreversible.'

Goffin's judgment was correct.

But it didn't seem like he could face all the archangels without being able to activate Ultima.

"Miracle Stream."

As golden smoke coiled like a snake around Goffin, Icael lifted her chin.

"Ataraxia."

The archangels' concepts were amplified, and Uriel opened the battle with Ragnarok.

"I'll teach you the terror of the world."

A physical attack containing all the fury from taking that blow struck Goffin hard.

Sparks flew from Goffin's eyes as he was pushed back 3 kilometers.

'As expected, not easy.'

Getting excited because an archangel took one hit was premature.

'It bounces.'

As Miracle Stream swirled, Uriel's body went over Goffin's back.

"Ugh!"

Uriel, caught by rotational inertia, drew a huge curve and crashed vertically 1 kilometer behind.

CRASH!

Hearing the roar, Goffin planted both feet on the ground and smiled at the archangels ahead.

"Shall we begin god's game?"

Metatron of existence, Rayel of light, and Phaiel of annihilation formed a battle line side by side.

"He bounced Uriel."

Meaning pure impact force alone couldn't break him.

"I'll go."

Leading the charge, Phaiel's judicial halo spun rapidly, transforming into an abyss vortex.

"Words of nothingness."

As the light of Miracle Stream surrounding Goffin disappeared, Metatron extended his hand.

"Gravity tyranny."

Dozens of black spheres formed, twisting Goffin's waist and spreading his limbs wide.

'I'll tear you apart.'

Just when he thought it was over, Goffin's body stopped upright in midair, defying the gravitational waves.

"Let there be light."

A massive hexagonal light rose, then decomposed into smoke and enveloped Goffin.

"Hexa has no cause."

That's why even if Phaiel annihilated it countless times, it could resurrect without reason.

"Sleep."

As the smoke of light spread, the spheres of gravity tyranny began disappearing one by one.

"Never wake again."

At that moment, Rayel, the archangel of light, activated his judicial halo Accelerator.

WHIRRRRR!

The halo rotating at light speed rapidly contracted and disappeared, stopping time.

'Can he block this too?'

In the 0-second timeframe where even planetary rotation couldn't occur, Rayel threw his punch.

Photon signal - normally impossible to transmit physical signals when time was stopped, but...

'I am the archangel of light.'

His unit of perceived time was the minimum value of the timeline that Sirone had dismantled.

The moment Rayel's fist touched Goffin...

'This is the point.'

The independently arranged temporal event moved to the immediately following event.

Since it was the minimum unit of time divisible by law, no living being could react.

WHOOSH!

At the point where Rayel's punch ended, the atmosphere was pushed back dozens of meters before exploding.

"What?"

Rayel looked down in disbelief.

"Slow."

Goffin, who had twisted his torso to evade, was smiling, showing sharp fangs.

'Dodged light speed?'

That couldn't be.

There were no events between the moment the fist made contact and the moment light speed was released.

'Light speed. I split time to its limit. Between time and time, there should only be nothingness...'

A chilling assumption flashed through his mind, shaking his sacred light body.

'Did you slip through nothingness?'

Super light speed.

Penetrating between the minimum units of time, creating signals of existence from nothingness.

'Are you... truly a god?'

The moment the question arose, Goffin's fist struck Rayel's face directly.

"Ugh!"

BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

Like a stone skipping horizontally across water, Rayel's body bounced across the ground.

Cariel and Metiel, who had been in the rear, stopped abruptly seeing the archangel rolling on the ground.

"Ah..."

In this moment, even the Gaians and archangel Icael forgot their original purpose.

"Our intellect transcends infinity..."

The hexagonal light floating between Goffin's palms shattered and scattered like flower petals.

"To god's world."

Watching the starlight rise high into the sky on the wind, the Gaians fell into thought.

'That is Hexa.'

God's language that doesn't exist in this world.

"AAAHHH!"

Sirone's scream burst forth as a roar, enveloping the entire Alphoneth mountain range in white light.

The core transmitting all of Omega's records, Carador, also groaned.

'Tremendous amount of information.'

From that alone, the Infinite Dragon sensed which point of Omega Sirone had reached.

'Year 201.'

The point when Macclain Goffin first proposed the possibility of Hexa.

'The transmission speed is too fast. I need to control it.'

Concerned that Sirone might break, Carador slowed the information transmission speed.

"Ugh!"

But as if Sirone was forcibly drawing it in, the speed began accelerating even more.

'No! At this rate...!'

Stopping his thoughts there, Carador rolled his eyes and realized a new possibility.

'I see. It's only natural.'

Because Sirone was Hexa.

'He's not accepting information through thought. Information combines with information to become new information.'

Or perhaps perfect information.

The reason Sirone's scream had burst forth was actually because he was startled by the enormeness of enlightenment.

'Endlessly becoming one.'

The moment when vast feelings existing before human language and academic thought combined...

"Hah!"

Sirone's eyes snapped open.

'Miracle Stream!'

A hexagonal light rose above his head, shattered with a sharp sound, and dissolved into smoke.

"Sirone. Accept his thoughts, reasoning, everything."

Carador spoke.

"It is god's brain."
