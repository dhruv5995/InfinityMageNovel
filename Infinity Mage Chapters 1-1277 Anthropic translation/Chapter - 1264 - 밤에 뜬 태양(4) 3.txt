The Sun That Rose at Night (4)

"There's no time!"

At Sirone's shout, Entara asked.

"What's wrong?"

But before she could hear an answer, Sirone transformed into a flash of light and streaked across the night sky.

"Mica!"

Time until solar wind arrival: 7 minutes 48 seconds.

"Damn it!"

The current time at the Holy Land was midnight.

Therefore, to block the solar wind, he needed to circle roughly half the planet in about 7 minutes.

'I can't use Simultaneous Events.'

Because no one in outer space could define Sirone's existence.

"Blocking it is also a problem. What's coming to the planet now is the strongest law in the universe."

Mica's pointed observation was annoying at this moment.

"I'll manage somehow."

Sirone's heart was also the strongest in the universe.

And at the same time he departed, Amy and Ikael arrived at the Holy Land.

"Gasp!"

Amy, who had suppressed her fire incarnation, took a deep breath.

The air entering her lungs after so long was thrillingly paralyzing to her brain, but she soon regained her composure.

"What happened?"

Ikael approached, surveying the surroundings.

"It's the Holy Land. We arrived faster than light. It seems we were transmitted via quantum signal."

Then Amy saw it.

"Huh?"

A small light from the west, where the sun could never rise, growing as large as the sun itself.

When Nade hesitated, Iruki gestured for him to come in.

'He really can't read the atmosphere.'

Of course, Iruki didn't sense anything particularly special from the current Ymir either.

'I've heard about this.'

When someone reaches too high a level, lesser beings can't even sense their killing intent.

'Are we... lesser beings?'

At least Nade didn't think he was lesser, so there were two possibilities.

'Either this is more manageable than expected...'

Or Ymir had become an unimaginably monstrous entity.

"Ymir."

Gaold stepped forward.

"Seeing you here feels quite different. But this time won't be easy. This isn't your world." Ymir remained silent.

'He speaks as if he knows me well.' Of course, he had fought most of the strong opponents, but Gaold's words had thorns.

Deep Layer Stage 1, the workings of the unconscious.

"Well, fine. Some are meeting for the first time, others are old acquaintances. I can see you've scraped together quite the elite force."

The moment Ymir's killing intent emanated, one side of Nade's face completely contorted.

"Gugh!"

At the reaction like a tiger meeting a dinosaur, Iruki made a troubled expression.

'This is serious. If that guy is terrified to this extent.'

Then a butterfly made of light flew swiftly and reached Jinseong-eum.

Reading the information reflected on her retina, she stepped back.

"A new mission has arrived."

And perhaps this mission was the greatest variable that would determine the world's fate.

With the group's silent agreement, Jinseong-eum disappeared through ether waves.

"Now, those who were leaving have left..."

Ymir wiggled his fingers at them.

"Come at me, all of you."

Since everyone gathered here had never thought of losing in battle.

'Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara.' Starting with Miro's Avatar Technique, each person's specialty began to unfold simultaneously.

Surprisingly, the result was...

"Kekeke."

Completely one-sided.

"Kyaah! Someone help!"

Those staying at Delta Headquarters were running through the corridors regardless of their status.

"Kill them! Kill them all!"

No, could this place even be called a corridor?

In reality where Bakji's curtain had disappeared, blood, pus, and flesh were stuck to the walls.

"Heuk!"

An arm sharp as a demon's tusk pierced through a maid's back and lifted her up.

"Ahhh! It, it hurts!"

"What a pleasant sound."

When he swung his arm, the maid's body slipped off and crashed into a wall with human hands attached.

"Oh! Oooh!"

The hands of the dead, protruding from the wall like emerging from a grave, tore at the woman's body.

The demon chuckled.

"They're pathetically weak. What was Hell's army doing? I should have enlisted instead."

Even Hell's residents with poor combat abilities were no different from devils to humans.

"Don't let your guard down. We're just exploiting a gap created by the merging spaces. Humans are strong. Hell's army being annihilated was absolutely no coincidence."

"True... tsk."

It was natural it seemed easy since they had infiltrated while ignoring all human-made barriers.

"Well, Satan will handle things. Meanwhile, let's have some fun. Look here. There are incredibly precious materials overflowing everywhere."

Severed body parts, blood, organs - in the underworld, these were no different from gold and silver treasures.

When the demon turned his head, the maid whose legs had given out was startled and crawled away.

"Please spare me!"

"Hehe! I'm hungry first."

The moment the demon raised his awl-sharp arm, a burning sound came from his eardrums.

"Huh?"

With a bang and explosion, half his face was blown away.

"Kiiiii!"

The demons who discovered their fallen comrade made fearsome expressions and turned toward the end of the corridor.

Mito Shirano, currently heading the International Court, walked over grumbling.

"What are you guys? Where did you come from?"

Since the soldiers were busy protecting their own national figures, the mages from the five major departments had stepped forward.

Socrates, who had blown off the demon's head, said.

"The spaces have overlapped. This is pretty serious. It means the sector's protective barrier has been completely breached."

"Hmph. Those who should die must die. In this situation, what fool would think someone would protect them?"

While Shirano's words were realistic, protecting innocent people was also important.

Alpheas said.

"The Tormia Faculty will take the cafeteria area. We need to evacuate people to a wide space."

"Yes, please do."

Shirano's tone softened.

Alpheas was a respected mage, and Vice-Principal Olivia was also a certified Second-Class Grand Mage.

"I'll go too!" When Dorothy, serving as acting commander-in-chief, stepped forward, Liz, who had attended as an economist, also joined in.

"Me, me too."

Though her face was extremely tense, they were also professionals, so Alpheas accepted.

As the faculty moved, each nation's departments also found and moved to their own roles.

Socrates clicked his tongue.

"What? If everyone leaves, what are we supposed to do?"

Shirano said.

"Stop being petty, you former association president. Please have some sense of responsibility." She walked forward and asked the demons.

"Where's your boss?"

Since the active personnel from each nation had to protect their kings and couldn't leave their posts anyway.

'I should meet him once.'

Perhaps this too was a privilege of those who had retired from the front lines.

"We'll take you there."

The demons who said this charged with bloodshot eyes.

"After we cut off your head, that is."

"Hoho."

As the Swamp Witch Shirano's fingernails turned red, Socrates backed away with a disgusted expression.

In the basement of Delta Headquarters.

When the bell announcing midnight stopped, Habitz lowered his sword and nodded.

"I lost."

Defeat always felt bad, but this time it didn't seem quite so.

'I have to grant what she wants.' His heart pounded wondering what conditions the Wizard who had kissed him would impose.

"Tell me. What do you want me to do?"

"No."

The Wizard said indifferently.

"It's a draw."

Habitz's brow furrowed slightly.

"...I don't understand."

"The proposition I presented in this game was this: either love you or hate you."

"Right. So you kissed..." Habitz was sad.

"You hate me."

The Wizard nodded.

"You couldn't kill either Sirone or Uorin anyway. Since I could never lose, I'm ending this stupid game. Whether I win or lose, I hate you."

"...You won."

Those were the rules.

"What do I care about your true feelings? You proved it. The fact that you love me is true."

"You're wrong."

When the Wizard was first proposed this game, only one thing came to her mind.

'A draw.'

Victory or defeat wasn't the issue.

The reason Habitz liked winning in the first place was simply because it was more enjoyable.

'If losing were enjoyable, he might willingly lose. You can't catch him that way.'

If the Wizard had wished for death as the condition for victory, would he have committed suicide?

'I can't know.'

His heart was chaos.

'But with this method...'

The Wizard said.

"It's over. Don't ever look for me again."

Leaving those words, when she really departed, Habitz was mentally stunned.

It was a complete severance.

'How is it, Habitz?'

Natasha, who held the image of the outer world, observed Habitz's reaction.

'How does it feel to experience it directly?'

"Uh..."

A tear trickled down from one of Habitz's eyes.

"Uaaahhhhh!"

The enormous rage that surged after the sadness completely twisted his facial muscles.

Crrrack!

As his face contorted, breaking even bones, Kido hastily thrust out his spear.

"Uorin! Get up quickly! Quick..."

And the next moment, everyone present was horrified at Habitz's appearance.

"Uuuuuhhhh..."

His hair had all fallen out, his face and body were charred black like coal.

"Wi...zard." Only his jade-white eyes were moving.

Vanishing, the law of avoiding death, and even the chaos that comprised him had disappeared, leaving only:

Evil.

"I will have her."

Pure evil.

It should have been completely devastated.

Kukukukukung!

The moment Gaold's Air Press was applied, nothing should have remained.

'Cushioning effect.'

Miro instinctively realized someone was blocking the energy being applied to the planet.

'A Taeseong-in?'

She had heard he did terrible things to Sirone, but that wasn't important right now.

Because a giant's fist was right in front of her, just one centimeter away.

'Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara.'

It was sufficient distance.

'Hundred Void.'

Time slowed, and countless hands of Avalokitesvara born from her tapped Ymir's arm.

The only problem was the power.

"Heuk!"

The fist that destroyed Miro's Avatar Technique penetrated even Eden's barrier.

Kwaaaaang!

"Miro! Eden!"

Both women rolled on the ground simultaneously, and Lian rushed in like a countercurrent, swinging his great sword.

"Hiyaaah!"

That monstrous strength again.

Ymir's focus wavered slightly as he blocked with his arm, but soon his lips curved upward.

"Keke, so that's how it is?"

Ymir's mind's eye penetrated his opponent.

"This is the last time, isn't it?"

Lian's heart sank.

The swordsman who had risen again and again even when his body was broken no longer existed in this world.

"You can't fool my intuition."

Pushing away the great sword, Ymir twisted his body.

"Shall I confirm it?"

Just as he thrust his fist, flames flew and pierced through his side.

"Kruaaaah!"

Cells that were unaffected even by lava were burning.

"Grrrr!"

Even after the flames passed through, he staggered and glared ahead with furious eyes.

"What are you supposed to be?"

Amy was sitting in front of the group.

"Whew."

"Amy!"

Tess immediately ran over and covered the naked Amy with her own cloak.

"What happened, you idiot!"

"Hehe, long time no see."

At the confident smile that always reassured her, tears welled up in Tess's eyes.

"What's with you? Acting all stoic. You've become incredibly strong."

Ikael said.

"This isn't the time to be relieved. There's a more serious matter."

"Serious? The world has become like this, what could be more serious than this?"

"Something's coming."

Ikael's gaze turned to the night sky.

"Huh?"

The next moment, everyone realized.

From the space with its back to the sun, another sun was approaching.

Something that arrived at light speed burst with light.

"Grrr!"

In a world that had turned to broad daylight, a man wrapped in radiance wore a sad smile.

Amy's expression became blank.

"Nane?"

The final code chosen by the god of the outer world.

"Amy."

The Great Sun Tathagata.

The End of History (1)

Wings of light covering the sky flapped.

Wind pressure close to an explosion pushed Sirone away, and finally the boundary between night and day became visible.

'There!'

The boundary line of sunlight cast on the earth was winding along mountains and fields.

The moment he crossed that boundary line, the wide-open view briefly blinded Sirone.

'Almost there.'

From that point, Sirone broke through the atmosphere and went into space to calculate the time.

68 seconds remaining.

It wasn't visible within sight, but it was tremendous energy approaching at the speed of light.

If he couldn't block it, half the planet's hemisphere would be cooked, and ultimately it would mean extinction.

What was detected earlier than the solar wind was a disc-shaped vessel, a creation of extraterrestrial life.

'Terraforce.'

At a very high speed by human standards, it was flying to the opposite side of the planet from where the Holy Land was located.

'They've come.'

The final confrontation between good and evil.

If evil won here, Terraforce would also erase humanity from the universe.

'User protection device.'

Because no human would want to live under the rule of absolute evil.

Yahweh.

The voice of Terraforce's Chief Justice was heard.

"We announce to humanity's representative. Now we will judge humanity's end."

Sirone didn't object.

It was something he couldn't object to, but the biggest reason was because he believed in the power of good.

"We absolutely won't lose."

I hope so...

The Chief Justice's signal, which had been moving away, approached again.

"Do you intend to block the solar wind?"

"Yes."

About 30 seconds remained now.

"Sirone."

"Yes?"

Though he asked quickly in the urgent situation, the answer was delayed for quite a while. The topic that even the Chief Justice, who had clearer standards than humans, was conflicted about was precisely...

Amy's death.

Since they were a species that could hear all of humanity's sounds, they also knew Omega's records.

"O one who stood against the sun for humanity's sake, if you could save everyone, could you give up one person's life?"

"Yes."

Sirone added.

"If it were my life, by all means." What could be said?

As Terraforce's vessel disappeared beyond the planet, the Chief Justice bid farewell.

"We wish you good fortune."

Sirone, having composed himself, faced the tremendous energy he was beginning to sense.

Time until solar wind arrival: 9 seconds. 8 seconds.

'Miracle Stream.'

His heart, having reached Yahweh's level, created a lens-shaped barrier larger than the planet.

2 seconds. 1 second.

Kurururururu!

As the solar wind flowed along the barrier, the entire defense shield shook and Sirone's mind grew distant.

"Uaaaah!"

On the earth devastated by the battle between dragon and angel, tremendous heat haze rose.

"It's hot."

Fire Dragon Infercus looked up at the sky where the sun from 8 minutes ago was blazing.

Air Dragon Argan said.

"He intended to roast everything whole. Even though the Messiah is blocking it, this level of radiant heat."

Without Hexa's barrier, everything on the ground would have burned.

Asriker said.

"He's coming."

Sirone was falling without wings.

"Nane."

While Extreme Good Miro watched with frightening eyes, Nane's face was peaceful.

"Why did you return?" Nane remained silent.

And that was precisely proof that he had descended as a being from the outer world.

"To destroy this world?"

"No."

Nane shook his head.

"There's nothing to destroy in the first place. I intend to send everyone back. To paradise where there's no pain or hatred."

That might be so.

"Is that... the conclusion Buddha reached?" Miro disliked it.

"Not a conclusion, but truth. When you awaken, you'll understand. The attachment to this world is an insubstantial illusion."

Shura flew over.

"O Buddha."

The one who returned from the outer world, the only person who knew this world's secrets.

"Yes, Shura."

"Did you find out? What exactly is there? What is this universe? What do we become when we awaken?"

Nane knew what truth the God of Lies yearned for.

"Do you desire enlightenment?"

"Yes. Please grant me teachings."

Since knowing and realizing are different things, there was only one thing Nane could do.

"Sermon."

Pa.

A sword that flashed like lightning flew in a curved path and pierced Shura's torso.

"Gasp!"

Her eyes rolled upward, then she lost consciousness and fell toward the ground.

"Damn!"

Since he couldn't just watch someone fall, Nade caught her.

"Hey, are you okay?"

"Gah! Grr!"

Even in a state where she couldn't breathe, her gaze remained fixed on Buddha.

'Why?'

Nane said.

"Awaken from the dream. Pain is only temporary. Abandon attachment and be liberated from current suffering."

"Hey! Get it together!"

In her fading consciousness, Shura struggled.

'Is that so?'

If she gave up her life like this, would she come to know the universe's secrets?

'The universe's secrets?'

A person was about to die.

"Grrrr!"

Shura, activating Gestalt's ability, shattered the sermon with the power of lies.

"Hah! Hah!"

When Shura glared at the sky, Nane made a pitying expression.

"Why do you refuse?"

Well, why indeed?

"I don't know. I was prepared to give my life if I could understand the secret. But I think..."

That's it.

"It doesn't seem like the truth."

"It is the truth."

Nane was truly frustrated.

"I'm not killing you. I'm trying to give you everything I felt. Once you follow my teaching, all doubts will naturally be resolved."

That would also be true.

"Then you should have killed me." "If you're truly Buddha, truly righteous, you should have killed me without giving me time to doubt. Then I would have gained enlightenment in the outer world. But you couldn't."

Miro perceived it.

"You're still... not perfect?"

Shura nodded.

"If you were truly void, you wouldn't care what happens to this world. But Buddha returned. In other words, don't you have some attachment, some care for this world?"

"Hmm."

Nane couldn't deny it.

And his gaze slowly moved to Amy on the ground.

'Yes.'

It was an attachment to his previous life that he couldn't ignore even after awakening in the outer world.

"That's why I came."

To break even that last remaining attachment and liberate all of humanity from suffering.

"Sermon."

Behind Nane, swords that seemed to gather all the colors of this world spread out like a fan.

"Ku."

Infinite swords shot at light speed began falling from the sky's edge.

Buddha's enlightenment aimed at only one thing.

"Dodge!"

Amy.

"Ahh!"

Sirone clutched his head and awakened.

"Are you alright?"

When he raised his head, all 12 apostles were making worried expressions as if competing.

'I lost consciousness.'

Sirone shouted.

"How long was I unconscious?"

"About 3 seconds. Not very long. But the shock seems considerable."

"There's no time."

It was ominous.

For unknown reasons, it was the most frightening feeling in his entire life.

"What on earth is happening..."

Sirone's words suddenly stopped.

"Huh?"

An abnormally large amount of tears poured out.

"Huh? Huh?"

His face crumpled into a crying expression and his whole body began trembling as if struck by lightning.

"Messiah! What's wrong?"

"Uaaaah...!"

A tachyon signal traveled back in time and brought one fact.

The deal with Fermi.

"A-Amy."

The reason he explored that moment he had never revisited, combining consciousness and unconsciousness, was because:

"Amy is going to die."

It was more painful than himself dying, more than all humanity disappearing.

"No way!"

Sirone's body, activating Simultaneous Events, evaporated.

Kwarrrrrung!

As the sermon devastated the ground, the scattered group searched for Amy.

'Nane, you...'

Miro perceived Buddha's thoughts.

"Protect Amy! Even if we die, we must definitely protect Amy!"

The condition for Buddha to become perfect, and the condition for Yahweh to lose everything.

'Amy's death.'

But there was a massive wall called Ymir preventing Miro's instruction from succeeding.

"Kahahaha! This is killing me!"

The King of Giants who had exceeded his limits wasn't losing at all against the strongest practitioners.

Gaold's expression became serious.

'He's actually overwhelming us.'

Taking a horseback stance, new arms extended from Ymir's shoulders and sides.

"Hehe!"

Six fists swung like a gale, and everyone who rushed in was knocked away.

Meanwhile, Nane's sermon was endlessly pursuing Fire Incarnation Amy.

"I. Gang. O. Yeong. Si. Sang. Che. Ryang." Each word became a sword and penetrated Amy's incarnation at tremendous speed.

"Grrr!"

Finally, half the incarnation returned to human form.

'The incarnation is breaking.'

"Ja. Yo. San. Chi. Na. Ryeok."

And finally, the fire incarnation was completely destroyed and she rolled on the ground.

"Grrr!"

As she sat holding her shoulder, swords stuck around her and cylindrical light shot up.

"Amy!" Miro's Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara and Zulu's Force Metery deployed simultaneously, but it was useless.

'The concept itself doesn't work.'

Imaginary time.

Sirone wasn't the only one who handled tachyons.

"Let go! Let this go!"

Amy, trapped in the cylindrical light, floated in the air, and countless events overlapped.

"Change your thinking."

"No!"

No matter what cause tried to persuade her, Amy wouldn't bend her beliefs.

"I won't change." If she had lived a different life, she would have lived that way.

'Meeting Sirone.'

Even if it were repeated thousands, tens of thousands of times, she would choose that moment again.

"I'll never forget."

Nane couldn't change Amy's outcome.

"...I see."

Everyone was like that.

Even if there was heaven outside, would they abandon their beloved family and give up their lives?

'Even if it's just a dream...'

Would they wake from this dream with their beloved lover?

'But.'

How many humans in this world of colliding good and evil were suffering?

"I will return everything." To void.

Kukukukukukukuk!

As the world vibrated, the ground battle stopped and all eyes turned to the sky.

"Th-that's..."

A golden Buddha risen to chest height above the horizon was smiling benevolently.

"Nam."

Two giant palms that shot up from underground came together like prayer hands, covering Amy.

"No!"

Everyone poured attacks toward the sky, but couldn't break Buddha's righteousness.

"Mu-pyo."

Gradually the palms came together, pressing on Amy caught in the middle.

"Heuuuu!"

Nane hesitated.

'I can feel it.'

Amy's breath, her being alive.

Buddha's last remaining love was trembling so pitifully between his palms.

'Really, really... will I erase this woman?'

'I can do it.'

The reason it wouldn't close despite producing power to destroy the entire universe was because of an equivalent heart.

"Gwan..."

Destroy that.

"Amy!"

At the same time Sirone arrived via Simultaneous Events, Nane's shout shook heaven and earth.

"Shi!"

Damn this world.

"No! Don't... urk!"

The moment Buddha's two hands met, Sirone collapsed as if struck by lightning.

"...eum."

With hands clasped in prayer and head deeply bowed, bloody tears dripped from Nane's eyes.

'Take refuge in Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.' Karmis Amy.

Deceased.
