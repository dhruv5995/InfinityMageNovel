Chain Reaction (4)

Gis studied Flu's face.

'Hmm.'

According to information from the department Dante commanded, Gis's tastes were quite hardcore.

He wouldn't be interested in ordinary beauty and such. Sexual pleasure was intertwined with his desire for dominance. He'd welcome even an ugly woman if she were a princess of a nation.

Albino added.

Of course, I don't mean you're ugly.

Gis nodded.

'Not bad?'

He liked Flu's attitude of not showing distaste despite feeling his gaze.

'Secretary General of the Magic Association...'

Of course, his experience wasn't shallow either, so he wouldn't reveal his emotions from the start.

"Come to think of it, we haven't had any exchanges with Tormia's Magic Association yet. How are things going?"

"We're doing our best."

"Well, it's difficult work. This thing called politics, you know, you can't make it work by flying solo."

"Yes. Of course."

Though it sounded like ordinary conversation, the administrators analyzing every word at the nano level saw through it.

'Tormia can't even make a peep.'

That reconfirmation of power made something rise from deep within Gis's body.

'Ah, I'm suddenly getting aroused.'

Gis placed his hand on Flu's shoulder and said.

"Anyway, haven't we all gathered here for world peace? I have some time to spare, shall we have tea?"

"It would be an honor."

Flu's eyes turned cold as she followed Gis.

'Not today anyway.'

He wasn't careless enough to do anything in front of all the administrators from other nations.

Fermi, who was walking from the opposite direction, glanced sideways at Gis and Flu.

'Already making his move. Faster than expected?'

From when the rumors spread in the daily newspapers, he thought whoever would go for it would go for it.

'But Tormia. That innocent Sirone wouldn't have suggested this.'

Then Sirone, who had belatedly left the conference room, looked at Flu with a serious expression.

From that sight, Fermi realized.

'It wasn't discussed?'

This is pretty intense.

'Lufist. Definitely a formidable opponent.'

While other nations were calculating, he had bitten with animal instincts.

Fermi, who briefly made eye contact with Sirone, passed by with an indifferent expression.

'Hang in there. You're going to have some headaches for a while.'

This could also be a good business opportunity, but the pyramid was more important to Fermi.

'Uorin running off probably means the laws, the system has changed.'

Fermi looked out the window.

"Not bad."

Apocalypse.

Five High Gear administrators gathered in a place where Mucus covered the entire world.

"Finally completed."

A white sphere resembling a snow crystal slowly rotated above the Operator's palm.

"Ice Blood."

It was special code that could harden Mucus when injected into Digital Ra's core.

Shortly after, a voice came from behind.

"You're here already?"

It was Sirone and the executives of the Parrot Mercenary Group who had entered Apocalypse after receiving word.

Marsha pointed.

"Is that the virus or whatever?"

"Yes. It's incredibly powerful. Once we plant it in the core, even we won't be able to control it."

"Doesn't matter. It's an abandoned world anyway."

Sirone looked at the landscape.

"It seems to have increased more. The height of the Mucus is different. The excavator has disappeared too."

"Huh? You're right?"

When Marsha checked, the Mucus ground was covering much more of the sky than before.

Sirone guessed the reason.

'It's because of the pyramid.'

Since the laws were twisted enough for the angels' status to fall, Apocalypse had changed too.

'More Mucus. What does this mean?'

Vice-captain Freeman said.

"Let's go down first. We haven't been able to mine for several days. You seem to be in a hurry too."

The Parrot Mercenary Group also knew about the pyramids erected around the world.

"Yes, that's right."

The moment they took their first step, the Mucus that felt the vibration fiercely surged up and flew at them.

"Ugh! What!"

While the High Gear administrators were startled, Marsha slashed with her short sword, cutting the tentacles.

The fallen tentacles writhed for a moment, then became mucus again and were absorbed into the ground.

"Ugh, annoying. But why is it so violent? It wasn't like this before."

'The nature of the Mucus has changed.'

That meant the algorithm of Digital Ra buried underground had changed.

'Rejecting life with stronger force is a hint about the future that's to come.'

Sirone activated Miracle Stream.

"I'll do it."

As smoke of light spread, the surface of the Mucus began to recede like waves.

"I've covered it with a curtain and pressed it down with pressure. It won't be broken through with ordinary force."

Of course, if the mass covering the entire world concentrated in one place, that would be a different story.

'That would be total war.'

Contrary to their worries, the Mucus didn't shake greatly, and the group safely reached their destination.

"Digital Ra is below here. To be precise, we have to go quite far riding a strange device."

Even if Sirone didn't remember, Fermi knew the geography of Apocalypse.

"Then..."

Sirone, who had gathered the smoke of light again, cast Hand of God above his head.

"Be careful."

The Parrot Mercenary Group executives escorted the administrators.

'Mucus keeps regenerating. Digging in as fast as possible is the best method.'

Hand of God raised its index finger and thrust straight down toward the Mucus.

Feeling tremendous vibration, the Mucus erected giant tentacle pillars dozens of meters away.

Lollipop Mark shouted.

"Aaah! It's coming!"

At the same time, Hand of God stuck in the ground rotated like a drill and sank down with a thud.

"Jump down!"

Avoiding tentacles flying from all directions, the mining team quickly threw themselves into the pit.

The narrowing hole completely closed, and the tentacles stuck on the surface exploded like water masses.

"Aaaah!"

Smile Mark, a middle-aged hairy man, screamed like a girl at the endlessly falling depth.

'Incredibly deep.'

Hand of God was drilling faster than gravitational acceleration, but that made it more problematic.

'The pressure is getting too intense.'

Looking up, the spear-like tunnel Sirone had drilled was rapidly closing.

'Huh?'

At that moment, the tremendous resistance that had been pressing against Hand of God disappeared like a lie.

"Sirone!"

Marsha shouted.

"Ugh!"

Sirone, who had converted Hand of God back to Miracle Stream, caught everyone.

"Haa! Haa."

Floating in the air, the Operator looked down at the city 200 meters below.

"How... did this happen?"

In the interior that should have been full of Mucus, there was a space roughly the size of a city.

Marsha flew to Sirone.

"Thanks. That wasn't a speed I could handle with flight magic."

"Yes. But where is this?"

They were trapped in a giant dome, and a curtain of Mucus spread along the city's outskirts.

"Maybe it's something like this?"

Marsha raised her index finger.

"The Apocalypse world responds to changes in reality. If the expansion of Mucus proceeded faster than normal speed due to some future event..."

"Areas where air gets trapped would form."

"Right. Mucus predicts that Sell Buster will occur in reality. But the reason the ground rose isn't because the quantity increased, but because it swelled up. Probably there are spaces like this throughout the Apocalypse world? Like inside cheese."

Sirone agreed too.

"Let's go down and take a look."

The mining team that had cast magic to descend to the ground first looked around the city's scenery.

"It's changed a lot indeed. There are buildings I haven't seen before too. This complicates the situation."

There were remnants of Mucus on the ground too, but not enough to make exploration difficult.

The administrators entering Apocalypse for the first time became melancholy at the quiet scenery.

"Don't people live here?"

Marsha had been thinking about it too.

"There weren't none at all. Children of the Sun, Dynamic Human. But..."

Now there was nothing.

"Most were probably swept away by the Mucus flood. It's not strange. To this extent..."

Uuuuuuh. Uuuuuuh.

The group's steps stopped at groaning sounds coming from somewhere.

"What's that?"

Sirone, who quickly surveyed the surroundings, ran toward the source of the sound.

It was a square iron structure.

'I've seen this before.'

The memory of Maze Andre came back.

'World Number 19000.'

Among the countless worlds humanity could reach, a place that had met its mental end.

"Let's just go."

"What are you talking about? People are trapped inside."

Marsha, who had jumped onto the warehouse, grabbed the iron door's handle and pulled.

"Ugh."

When it wouldn't open, Freeman came up.

"Move aside. I'll break it."

He loaded a magic bullet and aimed his gun barrel at the mechanical panel next to the door.

"Wait!"

Lollipop Mark raised his hand to stop him.

"Please leave it to me."

The boy who had climbed onto the warehouse holding Freeman's hand carefully examined the panel's form.

"Wow, this is awesome."

The Operator asked.

"Can you open it?"

"10 seconds."

When he brought out a card made directly from Under Coder, the panel became transparent and the code was visible.

"Hmm. The technology is excellent, but the pattern is simple. Did they just need to lock it?"

Click, the device was released.

"Convenient. How did you do that?"

"Hehe, you brought me because I'm an expert in this field, right? Anyway, it's okay to open it now."

Marsha grabbed the handle.

"Let's see..."

The door opened, and as Sirone had expected, a shocking scream burst out.

"Kyaa! What is this!"

From children to elderly, from men to women, they were all entangled together naked.

"Human storage."

Everyone turned to look at Sirone.

"The worst situation humanity will face is happening right here, right now."

"Worst situation?"

Marsha looked down into the warehouse.

The sight of people surviving by licking liquid from each other's bodies was definitely not human life.

"So... this is Apocalypse, right? It's constructed based on information from reality."

"Yes. In other words, if there's no change in reality, this is what we'll become in the distant future."

"Why?"

Marsha's eyes shook.

"Why do we become like this? Why us?"

"We can't know yet. To find the cause, we need to go deeper. And to mine, we first need to plant the virus."

Sirone turned around.

"Let's go. Even while we're doing this, the real world is moving toward this moment."

While Marsha wore a dazed expression, Freeman quietly closed the iron door.

"Let's go, Marsha."

With the mood dampened, the mining team walked with reverent hearts.

The one consolation was that the route to Digital Ra remained.

"Here it is."

Sirone looked at the monument erected next to the building.

'Fairy Biomimetics Research Institute.'

Since he had come with lost information, it wasn't in his memory, but because of that, there was a fact he had learned.

"Wait. Fairy?"

Long ago, fairies were split in two by Guffin.

"What's wrong, Sirone?"

Marsha asked, but Sirone couldn't answer.

'Elves combined with Norr through Agape's power. Fairies controlling humans from heaven.'

And now, the fairies who had commanded heaven were staying on Sirone's planet.

"They weren't elves."

While Marsha blinked, Sirone's face twisted terrifyingly.

"It was the fairies who were ruling the human world."
