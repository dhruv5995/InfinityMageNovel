Reload (4)

The average level of the creatures bombing all cities in High Gear reached 700.

Though weaker compared to Dr. Martin, it was a figure that surpassed the existing boss creatures of High Gear.

"TOTAL. HUMAN. EXTERMINATION."

The bombardment erupted.

All the beautiful structures, or those that had been at the cutting edge of technology, were collapsing.

"Damn! This is disgusting! I'm not doing this stupid simulation anymore. Hey, let's all get out of here."

Users tried to disconnect one after another, but not a single one could escape.

"What, what's going on?"

Only after seeing the system message that disconnection was impossible did they finally feel fear.

"Kiiiiiii!"

Bat-like creatures dove from high altitude and attacked the users, biting them.

"Ugh! Gaaaah! What is this?"

[Unidentified program detected]

As the AI became infected with the virus, users began attacking other users.

"You idiot! How can you shoot at us!"

"TOTAL. HUMAN. EXTERMINATION."

The infected all spouted the same words, and the city instantly transformed into chaos.

Number Seven, watching High Gear's apocalypse from the dark space, felt disturbed.

"Are you satisfied now?"

It was the world the Operator had loved.

"I knew from the beginning. The heart of an adolescent girlâ€”I knew it all along, yet let myself be used."

From now on, she would live in reality.

'How nice.'

She would forget the adventures that happened in the virtual world and exchange genuine feelings with real humans.

"Tch! Live well."

He actually hoped it would turn out that way, but why did his heart feel so empty?

"Number Seven!"

A voice came from beyond the darkness, and electromagnetic fields spread as if hitting a transparent wall.

The administrators were infiltrating.

"Hey! What are you doing? Hurry up and stop this event! At this rate, High Gear will shut down."

"...Such a fuss."

Number Seven looked back at the virtual wall where electromagnetic ripples were occurring.

"It's just one simulation ending. It's not like it's a big deal if this one thing disappears, right?"

"Are you crazy? This is the world we've built all this time. You're going to destroy it on your own whim?"

"We built it? Only the Operator can create this world. We're replaceable, but the Operator isn't. And she says she's quitting."

"So if we stay and hold out..."

"That's what I hate!"

Number Seven shouted.

"Stay for what? Stay so pathetically to become a dog guarding a house after its owner has left? I hate that."

At that moment, tearing through the dark space, a small child's avatar holding a lollipop entered.

"Number Seven, bro."

"Lollipop?"

Though he couldn't move due to the firewall, the fact that he had infiltrated this far was impressive skill.

"Bro, I have something to talk about. Please block the outgoing signals for a moment."

"I have nothing to say. And when did we ever meet for you to call me 'bro'? How do you even know if I'm male or female?"

"I've met the Operator in person."

The signal was blocked.

"What? Where?"

"In reality. Since she was busy with in-play, I went to find her."

For Number Seven, this was more shocking than the Operator kissing YHWH2.

"Why did you?"

"Just, I was curious. When I said I wanted to see her in person, she told me to come to her workshop."

Number Seven was curious too.

"How was it?"

"Haha, exactly the same. Prickly, doesn't talk much. But she doesn't seem to have a bad personality. She even gave me snacks."

Some image came to mind vividly, but that didn't make his curiosity disappear.

"Let's meet outside, bro."

Number Seven remained silent.

"Let's meet up. She hates reality, but she doesn't hate the connections from this place. That's probably why she agreed when I suggested meeting."

"Connections?"

Wasn't this the world she fled from because she hated it?

"Never mind. Why would I meet the Operator? We were enemies here anyway."

"She talked about you then, bro."

Number Seven's head turned.

"About me? What did she say?"

"Just, well... nothing special. She said your way of speaking is rough, always grumbling and annoying."

Sensing Number Seven's disappointment, Lollipop burst into laughter and continued.

"But she said your skills are the best. There's probably no one who understands their world as well as you do, bro."

That was only natural.

"Stop it now, bro. There's no need to destroy it. Leave this place as it is, and let's go to reality."

Though that was also a terrifying thing to say.

'I want to meet her.'

He wanted to see directly the only programmer in Under Coder who surpassed him.

"If you destroy High Gear, there won't be a chance. Don't hurt her anymore."

"Damn it!"

Number Seven turned around and said.

"Help me. I made it with service termination in mind, so all the code is tangled up."

"Hehe, that's my specialty. But first, this firewall..."

At that moment, Number Seven suddenly let out a short cry and collapsed to the ground.

"Bro!"

Seeing his avatar fade transparently, Lollipop gulped.

'His connection was forcibly cut off.'

High Gear was still racing toward destruction.

[We've awakened him.]

The Little Witch received the communication.

[Keep him detained for now. He'll be useful later. Don't break anything or do anything like that.]

It was the logical next step to handle things before Number Seven could possibly change his mind.

[Understood.]

After ending the communication, Wuorin captured Shirone charging at Dr. Martin's main body.

'The world's secret?'

She had never been interested in such things from the beginning.

'Shirone, I only need you.'

If High Gear shut down abnormally, the Operator would feel frustrated.

If the Apocalypse mining was postponed, Shirone would eventually come looking for her.

'Fermi. He's no ordinary guy.'

There was no way that snake-like cunning fellow hadn't noticed her obsession with Shirone.

'Yet he agreed to the deal because his perspective on this situation is the same as mine.'

The difference is...

Fermi wanted Shirone to win.

[Your Majesty.]

Another communication came.

"Hehehe."

Having heard all the information Number Seven had confessed, she flew up into the sky.

"I won."

At the same time, a thunderous roar erupted and Dr. Martin's main body swayed back and forth.

"It's over!"

Shirone flew with boosters and fired the Michelan Gun's flash directly at the center of the massive body.

All 750 million durability was shaved off, and the main body collapsed amid chain explosions.

"I, I did it."

The rankers who had been fighting creatures all turned their heads to look at it.

"They... defeated that thing?"

The Operator, who hadn't even dared to join the battle, dropped to her knees with a thud.

"I protected it."

Then the flattened main body of Dr. Martin shook, and its central part exploded.

"Kiaaaaa!"

A phoenix-like avatar that burst out from within spread its massive wings and glided.

The Operator, who confirmed the avatar's information through augmented reality, cursed.

Boss Creature Real Martin.

Soon other users would also see the avatar's durability of 3.2 billion.

"Kiaaaaa!"

As if Real Martin's screech was a signal flare, users swarmed from all directions.

They were the virus-infected ones.

"TOTAL. HUMAN. EXTERMINATION."

The Operator couldn't contain her boiling rage.

"Uaaaah!"

Real Martin's flash cannon swept across the world, and countless rankers turned to ash and disappeared.

"It's not over yet!"

Only Shirone didn't give up and flew into the sky, firing the Michelan Gun rapidly.

The rankers could only watch the spectacle of incomparable firepower crossing paths.

"TOTAL. HUMAN. EXTERMINATION."

The infected no longer attacked users but formed barriers with their avatars.

Beyond that, creatures that blackened the sky flew in to attack the survivors.

The Operator gritted her teeth and stood up.

"Fight! Don't retreat!"

A great battle unfolded between Real Martin and Shirone, creatures and rankers.

'Damn it! Let me out! Please let me out!'

Meanwhile, the users trapped inside the avatars could only serve as walls and watch the war.

In the world-splitting battle, Shirone brought down Real Martin.

"Kieeeee!"

Just before the 3.2 billion durability dropped, the avatar rapidly changed and transformed into a new form.

'Real Martin Stage 2?'

Creatures ambushed the rankers who were stunned by the 13 billion durability.

"Uaaaah!"

As more became infected, Shirone activated the Michelan Gun.

[Insufficient Output]

"Urgh!"

From Real Martin's hideous avatar, tens of thousands of guided missiles fired simultaneously.

It was literally the entire landscape, and Aegis flew up to activate the ballistic deception system.

[This is the last time.]

Aegis's avatar, which had lured the guided missiles and drawn them in, was caught in an extravagantly luxurious explosion.

"Damn it!"

As Real Martin flew over, Shirone retreated and responded with Air God.

The durability decreased by 10.

"...It's over."

The rankers who confirmed the speed at which the number 13 billion was decreasing finally realized reality.

"It's all over."

Shirone loaded Air God.

"Reload!"

Creatures following behind Real Martin could be intercepted sufficiently.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

As countless creatures crashed, YHWH2's experience points began rising rapidly.

The level of experience required for the 300s was much lower than rankers...

'Level up.'

As soon as 1 level was gained, High Gear and the Michelan Gun's power was replenished.

"Iyaaaaa!"

As a sphere of light condensed at tremendous speed in YHWH2's palm, the Operator shouted.

"It's not over yet!"

YHWH2 stopped retreating and charged forward.

"Maximum output."

The Michelan Gun's massive flash cut through the atmosphere and directly hit Real Martin.

A thunderous roar erupted, and all creatures around Real Martin exploded.

'Level up!'

Charging was complete again.

'Level up!'

The moment Real Martin's durability hit rock bottom, a thunderous roar shook the world.

"Kieeeeeee!"

The roar alone caused ground users to explode, and YHWH2's avatar crashed to the earth.

"Damn it! That's also..."

Shirone's expression went blank.

"What is that?"

Real Martin's hideous avatar expanded even more massively, filling the sky.

Real Martin Stage 3.

Durability: 1,400,000,000,000/1,400,000,000,000

Thud, thud, the rankers fell to their knees.

Volga's Son also stopped fighting, and the Little Witch watched the Operator's shoulders shake.

"Hic. Hic."

She was crying.

Though tears don't flow from a mechanical body, it was the most sorrowful crying sound of her life.

"What is this, you bastard?"

Everything she had designed was being denied.

'It's over.'

The Little Witch smiled.

'Completely broken. She can't recover now.'

The users trapped in infected avatars were also hearing the Operator's voice.

'This is really fucking meaningless.'

Had they devoted all that time just to be mocked by such number games?

'What the hell have I been doing here? Just end it quickly. Let's throw it all away and get out.'

As if their voices could be heard, Wuorin looked at Fermi and shrugged her shoulders.

'I won...'

At that moment.

"Re...!"

Someone shouted.

"...load!"

Where everyone turned their heads, YHWH2 with Air God loaded was rising into the sky.

"Huh?"

The Operator, who had been looking up at him, felt her heart start beating again.

Thump, thump.

It was everyone's heartbeat.
