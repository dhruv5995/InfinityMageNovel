**[600] A Tree Without Roots (2)**

Shirone, having woken from sleep, couldn't get out of bed until well past noon.

"Guffin..."

His words circled through Shirone's mind like a riddle.

"I need to go check."

Getting up, Shirone finished washing his face and headed to the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Lab.

Taking a deep breath, he cast Time Bomb, and the temporal energy swirled as it blasted through the barriers of time.

The noisy sounds from the upper floors could no longer be heard.

'It's closed.'

Now that Miro had emerged into the world, Hexar could no longer serve as barrier material, and thus the upper floors had no reason to exist either.

'He's gone.'

The thought that Guffin had completely left filled Shirone with a sense of emptiness as he slumped onto the sofa.

'I have no origin.'

It felt like being alone in the universe.

"Shirone, what happened?"

Amy and Iruki entered.

"Huh? Are the evaluations already over?"

"The evaluation schedule is a complete mess. Because of Scramble Royale."

Without Nade's return, the alliance team had no choice but to forfeit.

"You weren't at the dorm, so we came here. What on earth happened? When I asked Anchal, he said to hear it directly from you."

"Right, where's Anchal?"

"He left. Dropped out, apparently."

"I see."

He had expected as much.

"Now tell us. You promised."

"Well..."

Shirone recounted everything that had happened in the upper floors without omission.

Since there had never been secrets until now, they understood quickly, and in the solemn atmosphere that followed, Amy made a sad expression.

'Poor Shirone.'

To think that after giving up even his dream of becoming a mage to find his roots and deciding to go to heaven, it would end like this.

"I have no roots. I don't know what that means, but I don't want to know either. It feels too terrible."

"There's no result without a cause. Even if it's perfect coincidence, that doesn't make your meaning disappear."

Amy added to Iruki's words.

"That's right, Shirone. There must be some reason. Guffin used the word 'once was' too. Don't give up already."

Thinking he had brought up too dark a topic, Shirone changed the mood.

"But what about Nade? Don't tell me he still hasn't come back?"

"He probably feels responsible for leaving Scramble Royale. He'll need a bit more time."

"But we won. Nade should know that. I'd rather go look for him myself. I should visit the West family."

"He wouldn't have gone home. He's probably roughing it somewhere."

It was hard to understand why someone with both a home and money would sleep rough, but Iruki was certain.

"Tell me, Iruki. Why is Nade like that? I should at least know what happened if I'm going to convince him."

If Nade wasn't going to leave forever, it would come to light eventually anyway.

"Shirone, you may have no roots, but..."

Iruki began carefully.

"Nade's roots are diseased."

The wind in the early autumn mountains was even colder at night.

"Ugh, so cold."

Nade curled up by the campfire, trying to sleep.

"Please let me get through tonight safely..."

Nineteen years ago, an unprecedented genius was born to the West family, but no one in the family knew this fact.

"Ugh, so annoying!"

Nade's mother, Teria, had been sitting at her vanity redoing her makeup for an hour already.

'Using such cheap cosmetics...'

In a normal wealthy family, complaints about extravagance and wasteful spending would never be heard.

Who could have known?

That the West family, which had been real estate tycoons for generations, was carrying massive debt.

'One bad marriage ruined my life.'

She had first met Nade's father, West Ballroom, at a high society party.

When she saw his expensive watch, famous designer clothes, and the craftsman-made carriage the size of seven pyeong, she thought a rosy future was unfolding.

She got drunk and became pregnant with Nade, thus becoming a member of the West family, but it was like boarding a sinking ship.

"What a pathetic man."

Though the household was falling apart, Ballroom, the family head, was still mired in drink and gambling, not even coming home.

Even when she yelled at him to somehow save the family business, he only acted annoyed by Teria, who he had embraced for just one night's fling.

"The young master is crying again."

At the nanny's words, she threw the brush she had been using to comb her hair onto the floor.

"Then quiet him down! That's what you're here for!"

"But once he starts crying..."

"So annoying!"

Teria pushed past the nanny and went to Nade's room.

"Mommy! Mommy!"

Seeing her son crying with his mouth wide open like an idiot reminded her of her foolish husband, making her hair stand on end.

"Why...!"

Teria screamed at the top of her lungs.

"Why are you crying! Why on earth are you crying! I'm splitting our meager income to give you everything! What exactly are you dissatisfied with!"

"Strange sounds... sounds..."

"Are you stupid? Why are you stupid too, making life hard for me!"

Contrary to Teria's misunderstanding, Nade was suffering from overflow, having grasped some principle of the world.

Nade was only three years old at the time.

"Mommy. Mommy."

Teria's face contorted viciously with rage, and she slapped Nade's cheek hard.

The physical shock allowed the child to hold back his tears momentarily, and until Nade's mind was completely destroyed, this method was Teria's only recourse.

"Gasp!"

Sitting up abruptly, Nade hurriedly looked around and let out a sigh of relief.

"Phew, thank goodness."

The fact that no lightning had been discharged meant he was beginning to regain control, but his heart still felt miserable.

'I should head back soon.'

Having abandoned Scramble Royale, he had no face to show his friends.

"I should at least wash up first."

By the time he descended the mountain and reached the city, dawn had broken, and Nade entered a public bathhouse to wash away the weariness of camping.

There weren't many people, but they all glanced at Nade's body.

The burn scars covering his entire body were traces of torture by the notoriously cruel Chicken Head bandits.

Perhaps he should have died, but Nade had saved his body by killing his mind.

"The wounds are still..."

In the mirror's reflection, the nail marks he had carved into his own face still remained.

The scabs had peeled off, but it would need a bit more time to heal completely.

'Anyway, since I can control it, I should sleep in an inn starting tonight.'

Nade still had no intention whatsoever of returning to school.

"He's not here. Where on earth did he go?"

Having wandered Creas City all day, Shirone sat on someone's rooftop and sighed.

Countless people passed by on the streets below, but those weary of life seemed to have no leisure to look up at the sky.

He couldn't search the entire city in one day, but if he expanded his Spirit Zone in Diamond Armed state, it didn't seem entirely impossible.

"Did he really go into the mountains?"

If so, there would be no way to find him anyway, so it would be better to examine the city a bit more.

Spreading his light wings and taking flight, Shirone observed the ground with an eagle's eye through Armand's neural enhancement.

"Huh?"

And finally, he spotted Nade coming out of a bathhouse on a street three blocks away.

"It's not like he's some old man..."

Clicking his tongue, Shirone immediately flew across the blocks and landed on a shopping district rooftop.

His tentacles lightly struck the ground, making his body spin, and by the time he was falling downward, Armand had already been deactivated.

The moment he landed on the ground with nimble movements, people jumped back in surprise.

"Wh-what? Is it a circus?"

At the murmuring sounds, Nade turned around and his face hardened.

"Haha! Found you!"

"Shirone?"

Nade frowned and lowered his head, then turned and started running away before Shirone could even speak.

"Hey! Why are you running?"

Shirone, who had been staring in bewilderment, immediately gave chase.

"Shirone! Don't follow me!"

"Then why are you running away?"

"I don't know! Just leave me alone!"

Even getting caught in crowds and tripping over street vendors' goods, neither of them stopped.

'He's so persistent.'

Knowing Shirone's stubbornness, Nade cast teleportation and flew into the sky.

"Kyaaa!"

Passersby jumped in shock, and several merchants pointed at the sky and shouted.

"It's a mage! That's definitely magic!"

While it was everyday life for magic school students, most people never had the chance to see magic in their lifetime.

"That's...!"

Looking up, Shirone gritted his teeth.

Nade had calculated that Shirone wouldn't be able to cast magic in front of people, but having already heard the story from Iruki, Shirone wasn't giving up this time.

"Stop right there! Just wait until I catch you!"

As light burst forth, economic activity on the street stopped, and everyone looked up at the sky as if time itself had frozen.

Nade shouted at Shirone, who was closely pursuing him from behind.

"Ahhh! Are you crazy? What if someone reports this to the school!"

"Then why are you running! Let's just talk for a minute!"

'This is bad. That guy's serious.'

Knowing Shirone's movement skills, Nade eventually imagined being caught and gulped.

"Don't be ridiculous! I'll show you my real skills!"

One minute later.

"Ahhhhh!"

Caught by Shirone, Nade fell into the middle of the marketplace and rolled on the ground.

"Come here!"

"Someone help!"

His freshly bathed body became covered in dust, but Nade crawled on the ground.

However, the moment he got up, he was caught by Shirone and pushed against a wall.

"It's over now! Give up!"

As Shirone's face suddenly approached, Nade hurriedly turned his head away.

He couldn't bear to show his face.

"Look at me! Don't turn your head away!"

"I don't want to."

"This is really!"

When Shirone changed position and stuck his face forward, Nade's head swiveled to the other side again.

As the actions of someone trying to avoid eye contact and someone trying to make eye contact repeated, murmuring sounds could be heard from around them.

"What are they doing from this morning? So unseemly."

"Wait, aren't they both guys?"

His face reddening, Nade shook off Shirone's arm on his shoulder and shouted.

"Ugh! Let go! People are getting weird ideas because of you!"

"Then why did you run? Did you commit some crime?"

After fuming for a while, Nade suddenly made a sad expression and hung his head low.

"I'm sorry, Shirone. I ruined everything. I was the one who dragged you all into this too."

"How can you say that? You fought your best too. I heard from Iruki. Plus, we won Scramble Royale."

While this was the most reassuring news for Nade, it only increased his guilt.

"Sigh, I should have been there."

"Everyone's worried. Let's go back to school for now."

Meanwhile, a man and woman who had just arrived in the city were bewildered by the commotion that had occurred in broad daylight.

"What's all this fuss about, from earlier?"

The blonde man was strikingly handsome, and beside him was a woman exuding the sophistication of the capital Bashka, arm in arm with him.

"Something about mages over in that block. From what I heard, they're still young."

"Then students? From Alpheas Magic School."

At the man's words, the woman smiled.

"That might be possible."

"My goodness. I guess student management is sloppy in the provinces. This could never happen in the capital."

The woman rolled her eyes.

"Are you insulting my alma mater right now?"

"Haha! Is that how it sounds?"

"Anyway, let's go see. I'm curious. Who knows? I might meet some junior I know."

"We're busy, let's just go..."

As the woman pulled the man's arm and started walking, the man had no choice but to click his tongue and be dragged along.

"Hehe, what kind of kids could they be..."

The woman who arrived after pushing through the crowd spotted two boys bickering and opened her eyes wide.

"Huh?"

"Why? Do you know them?"

The man asked while yawning, but she didn't even respond and approached them.

"Nade! You are Nade, right?"

Turning his head at the voice calling him, Nade stopped in place with a soul-drained expression.

"Liz... senior?"

"Wow! You really are Nade! How long has it been?"

"Senior, how are you here..."

Aple Liz.

The former president of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society and Nade's first love, who had pulled him out of hell.
