Fine Tuning (4)

Sirone gazed at Rian's broad back.

"Rian?"

His shield-like broad back gave the usual sense of reassurance, but his temperament was different from before.

His will, which had seemed like an erupting volcano, was now densely compressed.

"Sirone, I'll handle this."

There was no room for argument when it came to Rian, but one thing needed to be clarified.

"Be careful. This guy has Ymir's demon."

"Ymir?"

Rian wanted to eliminate every potential threat that could reach Sirone.

In that regard, Ymir was a mountain that had to be overcome and his strongest rival.

"...Hmm."

Rian frowned as he exchanged glances with Monoras across the great sword.

"That's hard to believe."

He was certainly strong, but his temperament was too low-grade to be called Ymir.

"It's a complicated matter. Probably."

If Sirone was postponing the explanation, Rian had no intention of digging deeper either.

"Got it. Leave this to me."

Rian also knew that subduing the president of Kashan was the top priority.

"I'm counting on you."

As Sirone flew toward the city, Monoras twisted his body and took a stance to follow.

"Can't let him get away."

"Hey."

Rian called out.

"Your opponent is me. The moment you show your back, your torso will be split in two, so keep that in mind."

Normally, Monoras wouldn't have paid the slightest attention, but this time he couldn't move.

Rian's muscles twisted grotesquely as he took on the complete form of a burning yaksha.

"Not bad—!"

Before he could finish speaking, Rian's fist struck Monoras squarely in the jaw.

The pig's face seemed to crumple as he was sent flying hundreds of meters forward and crashed into the ground.

KWAAAAANG!

As Rian pulled on the great sword and lunged forward, Monoras burst through the smoke.

"Graaaah!"

KUUUUUUUNG!

The moment fist and great sword collided again, a flash erupted and shockwaves swept through.

Both were shocked by the unimaginable resistance, and Monoras tore at the corners of his mouth.

"It's been a while since I had to exert myself."

Why was pain so enjoyable?

"GRAAAAAAH!"

When his earnest punch struck the great sword, the impact traveled up the handle.

"Urgh!"

Rian's skin was torn to shreds, and Monoras's fist broke with cracking sounds.

'It still won't break?'

<Idea> cannot be destroyed.

"Huuuuu."

As Rian slowly stepped back and released the great sword, it fell to the ground with a clang.

Monoras looked at the great sword while also watching the chains connected to his palm.

"What's that? Hmm."

Gehenna.

"Fire that burns everything."

Rian heated the great sword red-hot, pulled on the chains to grasp them, and aimed.

"Your demon... I'll take it."

If it truly was Ymir's demon, even Rian wasn't sure if he could completely purify it.

"Hmm."

Even Monoras, who had no interest in Hell's system, knew about Gehenna's chains.

"Keke. Kekeke."

Monoras's muscles bulged, and for the first time, murderous intent flashed in his eyes.

It was unmistakably Ymir's aura.

"I'll devour you."

Leading an aura greater than Mount Tai, Monoras charged forward with his upper body thrust out.

'I'll swallow everything whole.'

Lete, who had entrusted Sirone to Monoras, arrived at Magrit's underground laboratory.

"President! Please show mercy!"

The generals all knelt at once and pleaded, but Lete's reaction was cold.

"Magrit, you've disappointed me."

Magrit, embedded in the laboratory wall, was seriously injured by hellfire.

"I won't make excuses. But I did it for Satan. You know this, don't you?"

"Satan?"

Lete sneered.

"Satan is merely a creation born from Hell's system. This isn't a world made for you to manipulate as you please. Kashan's regulations are strict."

Magrit nodded.

"I see. Now I understand. From the beginning... however this world turned, it was irrelevant to you."

"What are you trying to say?"

"I just want to ask one thing. Since we've been together for 500 million years, you'll answer me. Or was even that time merely an instant to you?"

It wasn't a question to ask before death, so the generals looked puzzled.

"Your Grace, what do you mean..."

Magrit asked, cutting off the noise.

"Who exactly are you?"

"Why do administrators exist? If what happens in this world doesn't actually matter? Whether Satan wins or Yahweh wins, whoever wins..."

Magrit's gaze pierced through Lete.

"As long as this world can be maintained, you don't care either way, do you?"

"You've lived too long, Magrit."

Lete looked sad.

"What does that matter? You're all just my children. If you hadn't betrayed me, this wouldn't have happened."

"Betrayal? What betrayal?"

Magrit frowned.

"You already knew my intention to help Satan. So that's not it. What you fear most is..."

The administrator's mission.

"System integration. When the systems you manage separately are integrated, we can go to the outside world. That's why you tried to prevent my alliance with Yahweh, isn't it?"

"That story again? You people really—"

Lete looked troubled.

"I really don't know. Whether there's an outside world or not, what kind of place it is—even as an administrator, I can't know. My authority only extends to this world."

"I think so too. So this is just my stubbornness. I can have delusions. Even if you truly don't know about the outside world..."

Magrit raised his gaze.

"You actually do know, don't you?"

Emotion disappeared from Lete's eyes, and a chill that couldn't exist in Hell began to rise.

"Rest."

As purifying flames ignited on Magrit's body, the generals all rushed forward.

"Your Grace!"

But before they could even approach, hellfire began to burn their bodies as well.

"Lady Lete! Mother of Hell! Please consider our loyalty!"

They weren't afraid of annihilation.

What was truly frightening was the fate of disappearing with the truth before them.

'Are we...'

Unable to approach the truth?

Even as the generals were being annihilated, Magrit was desperately trying to prevent purification.

"Yes, you were an excellent child."

Royal bloodline.

"But that's not the ability I gave you for this purpose. Isn't that right, Archduke Magrit?"

As murderous intent settled in Lete's eyes, the purifying flames blazed dozens of times larger.

"AAAAHHH!"

The moment the archduke's scream erupted, Hand of God flew in and snatched him away.

'Hand technique.'

An ability that deceived even Lete's perception extinguished the purifying fire and moved Magrit to safety.

"Lete."

Where she turned, Sirone stood.

"Yahweh..."

He didn't know how much Sirone had heard, but his expression said everything.

"Foolish to the end. Annihilating Magrit would help humanity, wouldn't it?"

Magrit, his entire body charred like coal, leaned against the wall and spoke breathlessly.

"Yahweh, kill Lete. As long as that woman exists, we can never integrate."

"Let's do this."

Lete took a step.

"I'll cancel the demon realm. Also, demons will no longer disturb the human world."

"You'll cancel it?"

Sirone gritted his teeth.

"Do you know how many humans died? To hear those simple words from you, do you even know how much this world has been destroyed?"

"Just live like that."

Sirone's eyes widened, but she remained calm.

"Why are you so obsessed with truth? If you dig deep, you end up knowing nothing. Even as things become clearer, you eventually end up with neither this nor that—that's the essence of this world."

Humans cannot be perfectly defined.

"For example, love. The degree of understanding you feel the moment you hear that word is the human world. Well, physical intimacy can be defined. Dig deeper and it's chemical reactions in the brain. But chemistry is molecular interactions, molecules are atoms, atoms are quantum particles, and quantum particles are..."

Lete stopped her explanation there and spread both arms.

"Where is love in all that? See, you don't know. It breaks when you dig too deep. So you people should just live in this world without thinking."

It was such a cold world.

"Tell me just one thing."

Sirone asked.

"What is the terrible truth? What exactly is that truth you tried to confirm with your own eyes?"

"He will return."

Lete seemed to be performing high-level calculations.

"But by then, everything will be over. Your beliefs will also come to nothing. Do you really want that?"

The archduke spoke.

"It's useless. No matter what you say, her heart won't change. Because she has no heart."

Sirone, reaching the same conclusion, spread Miracle Stream and approached.

"Then I have no choice but to input the signal directly. I'll watch what output comes out."

Lete muttered.

"Monoras."

When there was no particular response, her pupils began to shake rapidly.

'Why isn't he coming?'

The moment Sirone rushed in like lightning, Lete, abandoning her calculations, shouted loudly.

"Void!"

Black smoke rose in front of her, and Deputy Director Void blocked the way.

Simultaneously, Sirone struck, and Miracle Stream began to be absorbed into Void.

"It's useless."

Darkness was rotating in Void's eyes.

"I am the void of the universe."

If the universe were so full that it couldn't store information, new concepts couldn't be created.

Time wouldn't flow either.

'Entropy administrator.'

Sirone pushed Hexa with all his might, but it felt futilely vast.

"No matter how much you struggle, you can't escape the void. Give up."

"Is that so?"

The ultimate of heart—Agape.

As Miracle Stream blazed with brilliant light, Void's face crumpled.

"The human heart transcends the universe."

When one piece of information grew so large it couldn't be stored anymore, filling capacity to the brim.

"Graaaah!"

The black pupil cracked, and pure white light began to leak out.

'It's just simple information. Process it. Just compress it as much as possible and send it somewhere—'

The only thing the universe cannot contain.

"Damn it."

As the massive void filled with light, it became unable to process even the slightest signal.

"We will advance to the end."

At that point, the world stopped.

"UOOOOH!"

Void's body cracked, and thousands of rays of light leaked out, dismantling the signal.

"Whew."

Sirone exhaled deeply and looked around, but Lete was nowhere to be seen.

"...Above."

When the dying archduke pointed at the ceiling with his index finger, she could be seen not having gone far.

Sirone guessed the reason.

"Rian."

She who had tried to get as far away from Yahweh as possible was forced to remain in the air because—

"...No. It's impossible."

She had witnessed the evaporation phenomenon of the earth being purified to the horizon's end.

"GRAAAAAAH!"

Monoras, with the great sword embedded in his chest, was grasping the blade and screaming.

'That's not a level of demon a human could handle.'

Then what was that?

Following the chains, Lete's gaze examined the ignition point of the massive flames.

'Idea.'

One yaksha was enduring hellfire while spewing white smoke from his mouth.
