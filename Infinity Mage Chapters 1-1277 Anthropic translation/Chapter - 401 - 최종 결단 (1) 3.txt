[401] Final Decision (1)

Shirone, who had handed Flu some coffee, asked if she had brought any spare clothes with her.

Flu said she had used everything up on the way here. Bandages, rope, and other items had been needed frequently in emergency situations.

While changing into the clothes Shirone had given her, she told them the whole story during the time she was recovering her strength.

The reason Gaold had been able to avoid capture was thanks to his paranoid-level distrust of humans.

No, perhaps it was because his desire had become so desperate that he could no longer trust anything in the world.

This could be seen from the one iron rule Gaold had established when he started the project 20 years ago.

If even the slightest variable occurred, all plans would be completely canceled and the situation monitored.

There had been a time when Kando had been absent from the Magic Association for about two hours without reason.

In truth, it might have been just a trivial personal matter that could happen to anyone.

But Gaold didn't let it slide, disbanding his guard unit while also leaving the association himself.

However, the royal palace's response was much faster than expected, and most of the guard unit was captured.

Only Gaold, Gangnan, and Flu succeeded in escaping through force, but the association's pursuers also tenaciously followed on their tail.

After being chased and chasing in return, they eventually arrived at Gaold's alma mater, Alpheas Magic School.

Shirone looked at Flu with a pitying expression. According to her story, it was a miracle they had arrived here alive.

"You really went through a lot."

Thanks to the sugar intake, Flu's complexion quickly improved.

She stretched out her arm to activate Cubic, and a magic staff with a phoenix ornament materialized in front of her palm.

"We didn't really have anywhere else to hide, but that's not the only reason we came here. The association president wants to meet with Mr. Alpheas. But the pursuit was too intense, so he sent me. If I get caught, I just die and that's it. Anyway, Shirone, we need your help."

With Gaold's abilities, normal tracking methods would be difficult, but since the association also had many unregistered individuals positioned there, it was better not to show himself in preparation for any contingency.

"Where is the association president now?"

Flu got down from the bed, quickly spun her magic staff, flipped it behind her back, and headed for the door.

"I'll guide you. That is, if you're willing to follow."

Flu's words contained a warning. If he wanted to get out of this situation, this was where it should end.

"First, I'd like to meet and hear what he has to say."

Betting one's life on false hope was inefficient.

Anyway, from the moment he entered the association, he had become entangled with Gaold. In such cases, rather than just hiding under the covers with only his face covered, he needed to find a solution directly.

'You've trained desperately, Shirone.'

Shirone's temperament was different from three months ago. Just as life evolves in extreme environments, Shirone had also grown through the fierce competition of the graduating class.

"Yes, first listen to what the association president has to say and make your own judgment. But if it's possible..."

Flu flipped her staff behind her back and bowed silently.

"I hope you'll help us."

These were words she could never say in front of Gaold. It was also the first gesture treating Shirone as a mage.

"Let's leave now."

Shirone postponed giving a definitive answer and opened the door.

The two people wearing raincoats climbed the mountain behind the building. Using magic would be convenient, but there was close to a 100% probability that Zoner would detect it.

Gaold was hiding on the opposite side of the mountain range surrounding the magic school. It wasn't far in terms of distance, but since they had to cross the mountain, it was already dawn when they arrived.

Climbing a mountain on a rainy day was no ordinary forced march, but Flu didn't even have time to catch her breath as she flipped back her raincoat hood and entered the cave.

"Association president, I've brought Shirone."

After letting Shirone in, she went back outside the cave to watch for any possible pursuers.

Inside the cave, only darkness was visible.

A flame suddenly flared up from the end of the darkness, and Gaold appeared as if only his face was floating.

Gaold, who was leaning against the back wall of the cave with one leg raised, smiled and raised his hand.

"Hey there, Shirone."

Just looking at Flu's condition, one could guess how difficult the fugitive life had been, but Gaold was as robust as ever, and his characteristic mad smile remained unchanged.

"You look relaxed."

"Kekeke, the unemployed life is quite manageable. Well, I didn't do much work at the association either."

Gaold pointed to the front seat.

"Sit down. I can't serve tea, but I have a bundle of stories you'll like."

Shirone asked directly.

"How did this happen to you?"

Gaold rested his chin on his hand and closed his mouth like a folding fan. Rather than feeling frustrated or resentful, his main emotion was indignation.

"Kando exposed my corruption. Of course, most of it was fabricated corruption. It seems King Adolf thought this time was unforgivable. Actually, he had been quite patient for a long time. The problem is that most of my guard unit has been detained or is currently being hunted down."

"Why didn't you anticipate Kando's betrayal? Your guard unit was made up of carefully selected people."

"That's a very you-like question. Certainly, I have nothing to say about that part. I was thoroughly defeated. But thanks to that, it became easier to investigate who was behind it. Probably Theraze is behind Kando."

"Theraze..."

The Empress of Kashan. Also Worin's mother whom he had met in Kazura, and the leader of the Valkyries.

Just listing what he knew, it was easy to guess how powerful Theraze was.

However, he still couldn't understand why Kando's betrayal was connected to her.

"You met Worin in Kazura, didn't you?"

"Yes. I received a lot of help. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be sitting here now."

"Hmm, you received help. Yes, that's right. Keke."

Shirone made a puzzled expression. He had saved his life thanks to her, so what was there to laugh about?

Gaold's laughter suddenly stopped.

"Probably Theraze is... Mitochondrial Eve."

"Mitochondrial Eve?"

"Excluding the Holy See, very few people would know about this. Probably the woman called Worin that you met is Empress Theraze."

"Please speak so I can understand."

Gaold explained about Mitochondrial Eve.

Theraze could transmit her memories to her daughter through mitochondrial mutations. The timing of memory awakening was presumed to vary by individual.

However, if Worin had already awakened at that time, then Shirone would have met Empress Theraze, not Worin.

"In this way, Theraze possesses all memories from the origin of humanity to the present. Through that vast database, she penetrates the essence of humans. To her, you are also just a component that turns the wheel of history. The proof of that is the strongest objet you're carrying, <Magic Sword Armand>."

Shirone touched Armand at his waist.

He had expected it wasn't simple goodwill, but hearing it made his skin crawl. What was most frightening was that even now, having realized Theraze's identity, he couldn't even guess what meaning she had given this gift.

"Theraze's abilities aren't limited to that. As you know, we live in a peculiar world. Guffin's erasure. That is, it has already been reset, and we're living our lives again after the reset. From here it's speculation, but there's a high possibility that Theraze still retains memories from before the reset. If so, it would also explain how Kando could enter the guard unit by breaking through my paranoid management."

"So she foresaw today's events from the moment Kando was born and planted him."

If understanding was quick, there was no need to waste time. Gaold honestly nodded.

"I was properly had. No human could predict that far. It's only possible because it's Theraze."

Certainly in such a case, even the great Gaold couldn't help it.

In the end, all his limbs were cut off and the project he had planned for 20 years turned to bubbles.

But having lost everything, there was probably only one thing left that Gaold could choose.

"What are the remaining odds of success?"

Gaold would go to heaven. Even if he lost his guard unit, even if the plans he had designed for more than half his life turned to bubbles, he would go. Because he was someone who would sacrifice all of humanity's lives to save Miro.

Gaold leisurely leaned back and crossed his arms.

"I can't do anything as things stand. But I haven't just been playing around for 20 years either. It's not much to call a final resort, but I haven't lost everything. Anyway, you're here too."

"I haven't said I would help you yet."

"Kekeke! Kid, don't strain yourself too much. The reason I told you about my situation was to make you understand the instructions I'm about to give you. Just grant me one favor and we'll part ways. Study hard and graduate."

Shirone was convinced by these words.

At the point of fighting against the world, there was no leisure to worry about a student's safety.

"But you made me a proposal, didn't you?"

One of Gaold's eyebrows rose.

It had been a deal when everything was perfect, and most importantly, when a year's time was given.

"You're not saying you found a method, are you?"

"Not quite a method, but..."

"Hmm."

Gaold stroked his beard.

This wasn't a child who would make proposals with clumsy lies. But his tone lacked confidence to believe he had really found something.

"Fine, let's hear it. How will you destroy heaven?"

"Before that, promise me. If I meet the conditions, please share all the information you know. It's directly related to my life too. Also, the final choice to decide on going to heaven must always be mine."

It was an unreasonable deal.

While Gaold would have to reveal all information that could endanger his safety, Shirone could withdraw at any time.

"Fine, let's hear it first."

Gaold readily accepted.

Negotiation was a process where two selfish people met to find a compromise anyway. Rather, if emotional words had come out, he wouldn't have been able to trust Shirone.

It couldn't really be seen as disadvantageous either, since Shirone had attached the condition "if the conditions are met."

Of course, if there was a way to destroy heaven, he could take any risk.

But even though he had given a year's time, it was work he had entrusted from the beginning with the thought that there was nothing to lose. If it was an absurd method, he could just ignore it.

And probably, given Shirone's current abilities, the result would inevitably be the latter.

'There's nothing bad about obtaining even trivial information.'

That's what Gaold thought.

"Basically, it's magic using Ataraxia."

"Probably so."

Shirone spent 10 minutes explaining the magic.

Gaold never interrupted once. He just listened while looking down at the ground until the story was finished.

"...So then, no, maybe heaven could be destroyed... well, something like that..."

When there was no reaction from Gaold, Shirone's voice gradually became smaller. Having actually spoken it aloud, the obstacles he had only thought about in his head seemed even higher, causing his confidence to disappear.

Even after Shirone finished speaking, Gaold gave no answer. He was just endlessly reviewing, reviewing, and reviewing the story he had just heard.

Shirone, becoming even more intimidated, added more words.

"I mean, you said so yourself, association president, that if we could just find even a possibility..."

"Ke."

A metallic sound leaked from Gaold's mouth.

"Kekeke! Kekekeke! Kekekekeke!"

No matter how much he tried to suppress it, laughter scratched at his throat. Finally unable to bear it, he raised his head and burst into mad laughter.

"Kehahahaha! Kehahahahaha!"

When the cave rang loudly, Flu entered with a surprised expression. But confirming there was nothing particularly wrong with Gaold's safety, she returned to her ironclad vigilance.

Shirone stared blankly at Gaold. He couldn't understand what meaning was contained in his laughter.

Gaold glared at Shirone with his mouth corners stretched to the limit. His eyes reflected in the flames were blazing.

"Cra...zy... bastard."

It was the highest praise Gaold could give to anyone.
