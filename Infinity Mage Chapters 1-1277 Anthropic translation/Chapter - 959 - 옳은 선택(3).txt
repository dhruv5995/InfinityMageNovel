**The Right Choice (3)**

Taeseong's pupils lost focus.

Her eyelids trembling as she processed the shock, she let out a long breath after a moment.

"Haaaaah."

It must have been caused by the shockwave from earlier.

'Strong enough to shake the earth all the way here.'

Odaeseong's expression grew serious as he watched Taeseong's condition.

'Is she really okay?'

Taeseong was a star.

However, while existing in her incarnated state, she took on the status of a biological being.

'To manage the planet's changes.'

The star wouldn't immediately split apart, but if shocks like this accumulated, the system would become unstable.

'Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions. Regardless of war, countless humans would die.'

Therefore, Taeseong used a method to separate herself from the star's system.

She absorbed most of the shock delivered to the planet to stabilize the system.

Freed asked.

"Why are you going this far?"

"It's fine if some humans die. No, if humans disappeared, the wars would disappear too. Life would flourish on the planet again, and everything would return to its proper place."

"The reason nature is beautiful... is because humans were there to say it was beautiful."

Freed closed his mouth.

"When this universe first existed, all things simply remained in their places. Grass consuming sunlight, insects eating grass, animals eating insects..."

Despite her pain, Taeseong smiled.

"There was no reason. It was just a system. A very cold system. But one day, humans said this: 'Isn't this beautiful?' From that moment, amazingly, my system became beautiful."

Odaeseong listened intently.

"Humans assign meaning to many things. This is comfortable, that is unpleasant. When you give a flower with a special name as a gift, it becomes a way to convey love..."

That's probably when it all began.

"For me, being a system within a system, the truth or falsehood of the outside world doesn't matter. The reason we call humans 'users' is because they assign meaning to all things. The beings who define this world are the ones who use this world. If all humans were to disappear..."

If there were no beings left to define her.

"Nothing would be beautiful. There would only be a cold system operating according to natural laws."

Before the maternal love of Gaia, the mother of the world, Odaeseong was momentarily moved.

"But they're using it wrong."

Amanta said.

"Humanity as it currently exists can never be unified. If they had such high-dimensional consciousness, things never would have reached this point. You're harboring difficult expectations, Taeseong."

"Not expectations. Hope. Humans must reach Ultima again, and without that power, they cannot stop Ankera or Buddha."

Taeseong added.

"Human survival is important in that sense. When humanity achieves a unified mental system, the greater their destructive power, the more greatly the natural laws will change."

"If I may speak boldly..."

Sting said.

"They probably won't reach it. Starting with myself, I perceive others as illusions. Guffin left and humanity is divided. Ultima ended in the age of the Gaians."

"No."

Though it was a thread-thin hope.

"It's definitely continuing. The will of the Gaians, through Guffin to Shirone."

Minerva asked.

"Can Shirone lead all humans to Ultima? You know too, Taeseong, how self-centered humans are and how poor their understanding of others is."

"One moment is enough."

Taeseong said with force in her eyes.

"For current humanity to reach Ultima would require much time. But if they could be perfectly unified for just one moment..."

They could strike a blow against the world.

"Guffin's left-behind messiah, Shirone will do it. Before that, as many humans as possible must survive. That's why I need to meet Lian."

If the demon realm commanders opened their domains simultaneously. If those who had reached the realm of transcendence engaged in all-out war.

"The current shock is just the beginning. Before long, even I won't be able to endure it. Before that... Ugh!"

Taeseong curled up with a pained expression.

"Taeseong! Are you alright?"

Odaeseong rushed to check her condition, but rather than shock, Taeseong felt more bewildered.

'Why?'

Despite rerouting the shock signals, residual shockwaves were still transmitting pain to the planet.

By human standards, it felt like her bones were ringing.

'It's Ymir.'

Having experienced similar shocks long ago, she could recognize this fact.

"I'm fine now. Let's depart quickly."

Contrary to her words, seeing the pale Taeseong, Freed clicked his tongue and looked back at the grassland where he'd thrown Gaold.

'Tch! Because of one lunatic... Gaold going berserk whenever he loses his memory has delayed us.'

But they couldn't just abandon him, as he would destroy the planet if left alone.

"Hey, get up. We're leaving."

As Freed walked into the grass to pick up Gaold, his brow furrowed.

"Damn it..."

Minerva asked.

"What are you doing? Hurry up and bring him. We're almost there now..."

"He's gone."

"Huh?"

Freed looked back at the group.

"Gone, I said. That bastard."

In the grass where a person had been lying collapsed, Gaold's warmth still remained.

To escape the endlessly spreading shockwaves, Miro linked mass teleports.

They finally arrived at the middle slopes of the underground mountain range overlooking Baska's scenery.

"Phew. Crazy bastard."

Even Miro was disgusted by Ymir's destructive power.

"Hm?"

When white noise-like clamoring reached them from the distant surface, everyone's gaze turned in that direction.

"My god..."

Like an isolated island, demons formed a sea beyond Baska's walls.

Amy said.

"Tell me now. What don't I know about this operation? What was the intention behind the flower garden?"

"Orders came down from the Holy See."

Though Dante's explanation was shocking, Amy's eyes became rather calm.

"...I see."

More than any explanation, the fact that it was Iruki's judgment would have been decisive.

'If that guy said it wouldn't work, then it won't work.'

He was more coldly rational than anyone, but he wasn't someone who would calculate efficiency with other people's lives.

Lufist said.

"To summarize the situation: the flower garden is annihilated and demons are gathering in Baska. When the elemental bomb drops, this entire area will become a sea of fire. However, the demon elite are no longer here. Also, Heaven's army is pursuing us."

Listening to the screaming rising from Baska, the executives fell into thought.

'I want to go into the capital and fight. But what meaning would that have? When the elemental bomb explodes...'

"We're getting out of here."

Miro said.

"There's no need to fight directly. If we're lucky, we can deal with Heaven's army with the elemental bomb too. From now on, we move stealthily and get out of the blast radius."

There were no objections.

However, everyone couldn't take their eyes off the tragedy unfolding in Baska.

'We're not running away. It's to fight more.'

Just as they steeled their hearts and were about to turn away, two halos rotated in the sky.

"No, we cannot leave this place."

"Sein."

As the Sun-Moon Aureole was released, the Havitz assassination team appeared one by one.

Mayray was nowhere to be seen.

'Did Havitz take her?'

Miro's thinking involved examining all directions, not prophesying the future.

'But...'

In her assumptions, the current situation was entirely possible.

'Quan lost one eye.'

Since this was the same, Miro shouldered all emotions and asked coldly.

"What do you mean we can't leave?"

Sein said.

"I read Havitz's mind. The 9th Corps Commander Paimon plans to open the demon realm timed with the elemental bomb's explosion. And when the demon realm opens, something terrible will happen."

"What kind of demon realm?"

"Disease. But not simple illness. It will sicken not only the body but human minds as well. There's no time to explain in detail. We need to enter Baska right now and eliminate Paimon."

Dante stepped forward.

"Wait. If he's going to open the demon realm, why does he need to time it with the elemental bomb's explosion? Why is that important?"

Sein said.

"Because Havitz wants to enjoy minds. What would happen if humanity's decision they thought was best produced the worst result? Humanity would fall into despair, and the more they despair, the stronger demons become."

"Satan will be delighted."

At Miro's words, Sein nodded.

"Right. We eliminate Paimon before the elemental bomb explodes. We have no choice but to enter Baska."

Even if it meant getting caught in the explosion.

"I see."

Though their chances of death had suddenly increased, everyone's expressions were rather relieved.

Miro's ears perked up.

"They're coming."

The sound of giants moving echoed from the opposite side of the underground mountain range.

Miro looked around at everyone.

"We're entering Baska."

No one objected, and moments later, the flash of mass teleport curved down toward the capital.

Hell's army trampled the humans they saw with cruel brutality, without even military discipline.

"S-save me! Aaaaah!"

Though they could hardly be called an army, this was their true nature.

"Give it to me! It's mine!"

"No! I caught it first! It's mine!"

Two demons holding the upper and lower body of a human woman argued over ownership.

"Kyaak! It hurts! It hurts!"

Unable to withstand the demons' strength, the woman eventually tore in half, her spine dangling.

"Kek! Kek!"

The demons watching the woman in shock licked their lips, then immediately turned away.

"Doesn't matter! There are plenty anyway! Kahahaha!"

The demons didn't distinguish between strong and weak, nor did they care about occupation.

"Found one! I'm first!"

Just as humans might select livestock breeds, demons too had special preferences.

Young women.

"Please spare me! Please spare me!"

Children.

"Waaah! Mommy! Mommy!"

Of course, there were occasional oddballs who had no interest in youth or beauty.

"Kahahaha! Come here! I'll pluck out your eyes first!"

If one knew where demons were born from, there would be no need to question their preferences.

The smell of blood, the smell of entrails, the smell of filth.

As what had been inside humans burst forth, the streets of Baska reeked with terrible odors.

Paimon raised both arms and shouted.

"Hohohoho! Very good! This is what hell should be! It feels as comfortable as coming home!"

Where her gaze was directed, giants taller than the walls were poking their faces in.

People went into convulsions.

"Aaaaah! What is that thing!"

"What is the capital defense force doing! Hurry up and kill that monster!"

Since most forces had been deployed to the flower garden, no army remained to protect the citizens.

At the center of that horrific scene, Paimon looked up at the sky and burned with the demon realm's will.

"This will be a good place to do it."

Being a military officer herself, she knew the allied forces had hidden intentions.

"Hehe, fine. Do as you please."

She would show them what truly unimaginable worst-case scenarios looked like.
