[597] The Cube of Time (4)

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 2 hours 32 minutes.
Space: Warehouse 19.

Warehouse 19 of destiny.

If anyone remembered the records of Estas's upper echelons, they would have called it that.

After Hexa died to Rukang, Yorga wandered around searching for Miro, who had left her position.

'Nothing is over yet.'

Miro would somehow find a solution.

'That's the kind of person she is.'

Some might place Miro and Yorga's names on the same level, but to her, Miro was a little sister she could respect.

Miro will one day save this world.

That was why she could remain calm even when faced with a certain boy's confession in the upper echelons.

"So this is where you were."

The warehouse door opened and Nickel, the Mars captain, entered.

He hadn't brought his subordinates, but blood clung to his body like a second skin.

"Nickel."

"I confirmed the child's death."

"Yes. If this incident concludes as is, peace will return to humanity once again."

Unlike Yorga, who only worried about Miro, Mars had entered this place with the mission of protecting the kingdom.

"You've worked hard."

That's why Nickel had one more incident that needed to occur before this case could be closed.

"Not at all. It would have been impossible without the sacrifice of the Mars members."

Yorga smiled, but her eyes were still sad.

"...If I may ask, is there truly no way to escape?"

There is.

If Guffin had orchestrated all of this, then Miro achieving her goal and returning to the world would be part of his plan.

"The coordinates have become jumbled. Whether we can find an exit..."

If the closed-loop incident completed one full cycle like this, everyone would have no choice but to become specters of Estas.

"I see."

Lost in thought, Nickel placed his hand on his chest with a grave expression and spoke.

"On behalf of the kingdom, I thank you."

Yorga looked into Nickel's eyes for a long time.

"Not at all."

But she wasn't someone who calculated emotions.

"Rather, I should be the one..."

The moment she bowed her head to Nickel, a dagger plunged into Yorga's heart with a thud.

"The kingdom's artifact, White Porcelain Blade. Even you won't survive this."

A wicked assassination weapon that, once it enters the body, melts its blade and turns all the blood in the body white and solid.

Coughing up a basin's worth of blood was Yorga's final words.

"Yorga!"

Edgar struck Nickel's head sideways while Mustang caught the falling Yorga in his arms.

She was already dead.

Faced with the horrific situation where Yorga's sincerity was repaid with murder, bloodshot veins appeared in her comrades' eyes.

"You...!"

Half of Nickel's face was already blown away, but befitting a Mars captain, he was still breathing.

"Why did you kill her?"

Nine approached, gripping his sword.

"Because she's dangerous. I'm a soldier. I only carry out the king's orders."

Yorga's ideology was dangerous to the monarchy.

"You bastard!"

Just as Edgar approached to finish him off, Mustang saw Nickel's eyes and shouted.

"Get back!"

Another artifact, the magic bomb Expos, emerged from Nickel's chest.

"Long live the Kingdom of Tormia!"

Before Nine's thrown sword could reach him, Expos's glass orb shattered and a localized magic storm swept through.

The life-burning heat wave was created from the blood of countless races and the sacrifice of magesâ€”priceless in monetary terms.

After the terrifying blue light swept through everything and disappeared, Yorga's comrades lay collapsed on the floor with grief-stricken faces, their lives ended.

"...So that's how it happened."

The warehouse door opened and Fermi entered.

Even faced with the death of his mother and the uncle and aunt who had doted on him so much, Fermi remained unshaken.

'Calmly, coolly.'

He turned toward Warehouse 44, where the safe was located.

"To bypass time..."

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 48 minutes.
Space: Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society.

In Miro's arms as she returned to Estas through Guffin's door, the Prince of Kazura was sleeping.

Sirone, who followed behind, still felt uneasy, but ultimately this was a choice that had to be made.

"Sirone, you don't need to think about it so complexly."

Miro said.

"To you, the present is my future. Return with the secrets of the upper echelons. Just do what you can do there."

Then the door opened and Yorga entered.

'So it's finally happening.'

Sirone tensed, wondering if she would meet another version of herself, but there was no one beside Yorga except her companions.

'The incident has twisted again.'

Then who exactly had sent Yorga here?

"Miro, who is that child you're holding?"

Miro's eyebrows twitched.

'She knows. Who could have told her?'

Even if they had met in a different timeline, this was something that should never be revealed to Yorga.

"It's the Prince of Kazura. Hexa no longer exists in this place. So sister, please give up too."

"No."

Yorga's gaze turned toward Guffin's door.

The dimensions would remain connected until the closed loop was completely sealed.

"If it's now, we can reverse it."

"It can't be reversed. Not as long as I'm here."

"Miro, don't just call it the sacrifice of a few people. This is denying the value of humanity as a whole. If we can't choose our own future, we'll end up perishing."

Yorga's insight looked beyond 100 years, 1,000 years, to over 10,000 years ahead.

"You mustn't create a history for humanity where they depended on a single transcendent being for everything."

"Guffin fought for humanity."

"But he's not our god. Let us choose. That's the only way for humanity to become infinite."

"If we don't stop it now, there will be no future. I'll sacrifice everything in place of Guffin's will."

As expected, no compromise could be found, and Yorga spoke quietly with force in her eyes.

"I won't let that happen."

Miro turned around and said.

"Guard Guffin's door."

The moment Yorga's companions moved, Sirone and Anchal blocked the door.

'Is this really the right thing to do?'

Sirone thought both of their arguments had merit.

Life was like that anyway, and that's why choice might be a punishment.

'I can't waver. I just need to do what I think is right.'

Gaold had done that, Zulu had done that, and Flu had done that.

'That's what it means to be a mage.'

She decided to trust Miro.

For reasons unknown, she had sent Hexa to the original world instead of trapping her behind dimensional walls.

That was the only ray of hope guiding Sirone.

"It's too late, sister."

Miro floated the Prince of Kazura in the air and then set him down in a corner.

"Are you telling me to kill you if I want to?"

Now that the exchange with Hexa was complete, there was no reason for Miro to risk her life protecting the Prince of Kazura.

"Because that would be a sacrifice."

Light rippled in Miro's eyes as a massive avatar of Guanyin, unlike anything seen before, bloomed forth.

"From now on, things will be different."

The avatar of Maria also bloomed from Yorga's body.

"Even if it's Guanyin, you can't break my avatar."

"Not if it's Saint Maria."

As Miro's hands crossed, hundreds of Guanyin's palms overlapped and fell toward Yorga's crown.

"Just keep getting beaten."

CRASH!

As the warehouse shook, Yorga's companions charged toward Guffin's door.

"I'll handle the woman. Guard the door."

Anchal lured away Mustang, while Edgar and Nine attacked Sirone from left and right as she stood alone.

Reading their movements with Armand's keen senses, Sirone exhaled deeply.

"Huuuuu!"

The mind of the mage who had added her opinion for humanity's future no longer wavered.

'Antithese!'

As the artificial brain Oega changed to Akamai's eyes, the bodies of Edgar and Nine, who had approached within arm's reach, froze.

"Urgh!"

Their will to act was momentarily constrained, and the boundaries of Sirone's Spirit Zone disappeared.

Elision.

Sonic Explosion.

Light was born inside Edgar and Nine's bodies and began rapidly expanding.

'Impossible!'

No Spirit Zone could cause phenomena inside living beings with their own minds.

But since Sirone had no mental boundaries, she could simply cast on space itself.

'If this hits, it's instant death!'

No matter how skilled they were, if explosions occurred inside their bodies, there was no way to endure it. Edgar and Nine activated desperate schemas and barely escaped the Antithese.

That alone could be considered impressive skill, but they couldn't completely avoid the exploding mass waves.

Two explosive sounds burst in succession, sending both men flying to the wall.

Though they avoided having their bodies explode, Edgar's mechanical arm was shattered and Nine suffered severe internal damage.

Mustang, who was fighting fiercely with Anchal, looked back at Sirone in disbelief, and even Yorga trembled in her Saint Maria state.

"How..."

Not because she saw something completely different.

Rather, it was the shock of seeing a phenomenon that was all too familiar yet could never be imitated.

"Guffin's Ultima System?"

Miro shrugged as if it were obvious.

"That child is the future Hexa."

Yorga's eyes shook with shock as she looked at Sirone.

As Lycan, betrayed by Fermi, changed his behavioral patterns, Rukang once again met his death at Miro's hands with his lower body crushed.

Yorga's kiss was a bonus.

Leaving Rukang's corpse behind, as they set out again to find Miro, Fermi appeared before them.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 10 minutes.
Space: Warehouse 65.

"Who are you?"

"I'm a merchant. I came here because I smelled money."

Yorga stared intently at the young man's face, which gave off a nostalgic feeling, then finally smiled.

"Merchants are everywhere."

Mustang said.

"He looks like Fermi."

At the pointed remark, Yorga asked.

"May I know your name?"

"Coincidentally, my name is also Fermi."

Fermi scratched his head as he approached and asked.

"You must know a Fermi too?"

"Yes. He's the most precious person to me."

Fermi secretly bit and tore off a piece of flesh from inside his lower lip.

As long as Yorga didn't waver, he couldn't waver either.

"So did you find anything profitable?"

Fermi pulled out dozens of <The Jager Family's Final Cry> that he had brought in his pocket.

"Yes, quite a bit. This much should easily be worth hundreds of billions of gold."

Yorga stared intently at Fermi's smile.

"How long have you been here?"

"Since there's no clock here. In biological time, it seems like quite a while."

Since Yorga's questions, even when they seemed off-topic, always hit the core, Fermi hastily changed the subject.

"Please take them. It's a trade."

When he offered the entire pouch containing the objects, Yorga obediently accepted it and checked the contents.

"These are good items. They're replicas."

It wasn't by chance that Fermi had chosen <The Jager Family's Final Cry> as the items to take to the upper echelons.

Though he didn't say it, Yorga would already know too, and she shook her head in embarrassment.

"I've received dozens of lives' worth, but I don't have the ability to pay that much value."

"I don't need money. I already have more than enough. I'm quite capable, you see."

Yorga laughed as if delighted.

"That's truly impressive. Then what do you want from me?"

"There's something I want to ask. Getting advice from a great mage is worth that much."

Yorga's head tilted like a cat's.

"If it's something I can answer."

Fermi dropped his smile and asked.

"Am I... doing well right now?"

For him, this was a question he couldn't buy even with billions of gold.
