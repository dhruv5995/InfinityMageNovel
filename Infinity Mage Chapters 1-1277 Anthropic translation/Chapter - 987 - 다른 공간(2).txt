Another Space (2)

?

The royal castle of Tormia, Creta.

The screams that had echoed throughout the capital all night long finally quieted down as dawn broke.

Miro took in the pale, sickly landscape of dawn from the highest watchtower.

'They must have found their own way.'

Because there can be no lazy humans in the face of pain.

"Haah."

Miro was the same.

Having sealed her heart to protect good, nothing precious existed for her.

The only way was to accept the pain.

'It's agonizing.'

It felt as if blades were mixed in her blood vessels.

Every time air entered, it felt like her organs were being torn apart, making her afraid to even breathe.

'I wish time would stop.'

In a life where every moment is pain, who could dream of a hopeful future?

'I must endure.'

At least Gaold did, so she clenched both fists and took a deep breath.

"Kugh!"

Just as the signal of pain pierced her brain, Gaold's voice came from the direction of the watchtower door.

"At first..."

Standing side by side with Miro, he looked down at the cityscape and spoke.

"You get angry. When you're too angry, you try to fight the pain. You dig at the wounds, stir them up. But how long can you do that? In the end, you're the one who hurts."

Before contracting the emotional disease, he thought enduring pain was everything.

'Pain isn't like that.'

No matter how terrible the pain, you can endure it if you have hope that it will disappear someday.

'True pain is...'

The fact that it never ends.

'Can I endure it? Can I fight until the end without surrendering to pain?'

Like Gaold.

'Stupid bastard. How... how do you live like this?'

In the journey to reach the pinnacle of goodness, he thought he understood all human emotions.

How arrogant.

'Humans shouldn't speak carelessly about things they haven't experienced.'

Gaold's pain - he thought he understood it.

It must be painful enough to die. It must hurt thousands, tens of thousands of times more than a cut on my hand.

That must be truly terrible.

'...or so I thought.'

He should have remained silent.

At least regarding his pain, he shouldn't have made any judgment.

Gaold asked.

"Are you really going?"

There's no way to survive in Ymir's mind where 10 billion Gaians are integrated.

"If you're planning to pay with your life for sightseeing, I won't stop you, but..."

"No."

Miro shook her head.

"I don't care what kind of mind it is. What's needed to eliminate evil is simply there."

"What are you planning to do? You don't really think you can pull it off, do you?"

"Why are you asking me that?"

Miro looked at Gaold and smiled.

"You're the one who has to find the method."

"Find it. Whether you chase after me to protect me, fight the enemy, or beat up Ymir - solve it. Somehow make the Ultima System come into my hands."

"I won't... say no. But what if it's impossible? Some things are impossible."

"Really?"

Miro grabbed Gaold's collar with both hands.

"Then I'll die. Do you understand what that means? It means I can't be happy. Do you want me to die in agony?"

Even while receiving Miro's resentful gaze, Gaold's expression didn't change.

"Haah."

Miro sighed and pressed her forehead against Gaold's chest.

"Do you know what makes me angriest?"

"What?"

"That you're stronger than me. This human called you is so annoying and bothersome I could die, but I can't throw you away because you still have value to use. That makes me so angry."

"...I'll try somehow."

Miro's head shot up.

"Let's go in together, into Ymir's mind. I'll come up with a method, so you just worry about your emotional disease."

Gaold thought simply.

He would just have to raise his pain threshold much higher than now - unimaginably higher.

"I'm going to tell Shirone."

As Gaold tried to leave the watchtower, Miro, who had been watching his back, spoke up.

"Let me ask you one thing."

Gaold stopped at the door.

"Why do you like me?"

When he tilted his head as if unexpected, Miro shot back.

"Am I that pretty? Do I have a good body? Or is it just stubbornness? I always make things difficult for you."

"What about you?"

With an absurd smile as if he'd hear all sorts of things, he pulled the door handle and said.

"Why do you hate me?"

Even after Gaold went down the stairs, Miro remained lost in thought for a long time.

She was equally unable to say anything.

A three-way intersection 32 kilometers from Bashka.

A double-horse carriage stopped, and Iruki and Nade got out carrying large travel bags.

"This is the right place?"

Iruki checked the signpost.

"Right, the crossroads of the journey. Did we arrive early?"

Just as they were about to check the time, Miracle Stream smoke condensed before their eyes.

"Shirone!"

Shirone, who appeared before them through quantum transmission, smiled and raised his hand.

"Have you been waiting long?"

Nade said.

"No. We just arrived too. But what about the carriage? Should we leave it here?"

It was time to prepare for two days and begin their mission in earnest.

Iruki and Nade were scheduled to follow Shirone around the world, spreading the Ultima System.

"We'll mainly go through remote areas, so that would be good. And I'm sorry. Dorothy and Liz, actually it would be fine if they came too."

Iruki shook his head.

"The castle is severely short-staffed. At times like this, we have to pull in every connection we don't even have. Dorothy said she'd bring an excavation team."

Nade said.

"Liz will join Pony's side too. She's handed over everything about the elemental bomb manufacturing factory."

If it extends to friends' friends, and their friends' friends, where exactly is the enemy?

Nade estimated the weight of his backpack on his shoulder and asked.

"So where should we go first?"

Though Shirone had mastered all the world's geography through Omega, he couldn't know the aftermath of war.

"How about this?"

Iruki unfolded the mental world map he'd been storing since his days as Valkyrie's general staff.

"To explain my map, all the places Hell's army passed through are lit up. The dark parts are sparse like islands. If we use those places as points and move around, it should work."

"Ah. Then where's the closest place?"

As he mentally enlarged the world map, thousands of place names within the radius came to mind.

"The Borshia region."

Shirone nodded.

"The Kingdom of Across."

A country stretching long along the coastline, bordering Tormia to the north.

"It was almost destroyed by war, but near the coast doesn't seem to have much damage. Let's go there first."

Nade asked.

"But what about the emotional disease? Right now we're buying time with Shirone's ability, but later it'll be unmanageable."

"We have to consider there's no turning back. If Shirone and Lian purify the other world, it'll be solved. If it's impossible..." Iruki shrugged.

"It's the same anyway, isn't it? The world ending."

"Of course. What I'm worried about is us becoming incurable before the other world is purified."

The pain threshold rises endlessly, and to calm it, Hexa's power must also keep getting stronger.

Shirone said.

"It's bad if our ability to act deteriorates at the crucial moment. But this is the best we can do. According to Seriel..."

Shirone conveyed information just received from the World Health Organization.

"It seems the emotional disease can also spread through human bodies as carriers. Emotional disease cases have been found in areas different from the wind direction. The World Climate Organization confirmed it."

Iruki's expression became serious.

"Hmm, then the spread rate will be faster than expected. There will be those who abandon their hometowns to ease the pain. Materially, it's like giving up their house, the biggest real estate."

"Yeah. Pony implemented emergency quarantine measures, but since even soldiers are infected, it's impossible to prevent escapes. That's why we made the decision. People performing core missions will use Hexa's ability to extend the incubation period."

Since they were all in the same boat, Iruki and Nade readily accepted the opinion.

"Understood. Then let's depart."

Though the world was rushing toward destruction day by day, the three felt a little excited.

Nade said.

"Come to think of it, this is our first trip since graduation. We promised before, to stay together even after entering society. Our dream has finally come true."

"That's because you're carefree. Was being unemployed your dream?"

At Iruki's words, Nade pointed accusingly.

"You're unemployed too! Just wait until the emotional disease is cured. I'll make tons of money."

"Haha!"

Listening to his two friends bickering, Shirone burst into refreshing laughter for the first time in a while.

'Right, this is where it starts.'

So everyone can smile.

"Shirone."

Miro came to his room.

"What's the matter?"

Since Lian would soon depart for the other world, the atmosphere in the castle could be called heavy.

"An interview. You heard from Gaold?"

"Yes. We decided to go to Drimo together. We'll depart right after Lian's work is finished."

"Yeah. There's something I want to discuss beforehand. I can tell you anytime, but once we enter Ymir's mind, I want to focus only on the mission."

It seemed like she was about to give homework.

"Yes, please tell me."

"About Havitz."

Miro's eyes intensified.

"Through this assassination attempt on Havitz, we gained a lot of information. I'm certain he's the most dangerous individual. If circumstances align, he could even kill Buddha."

Shirone just listened.

"Quan, who attacked Havitz while hearing God's frequency, described the situation like this. He felt ashamed. Like he'd become a child lost in delusion."

"I see."

Quan's feelings were completely understandable.

"But Havitz definitely exists. Not only Mayray, but Lian also definitely felt something at some moment. So it's not a delusion - we're the problem for dismissing it as delusion."

"The limits of perception."

"Right. The barrier of quantum phenomena you mentioned. If the human mind defines everything, then Vanishing is the opposite. Havitz exists in a realm where nothing should be defined."

"For instance... purity?"

Miro snapped her fingers.

"Exactly. A pure being. In other words, couldn't a child who just opened their eyes, who accepts the world without any preconceptions, see Havitz?"

"Hmm."

Shirone rested his chin on his hand.

"Probably, no, definitely they could see him. Because..."

Both said simultaneously.

"Even if they see, they're not seeing."

Miro nodded.

"That child can see Havitz. Because they don't know what form Havitz is. Without any preconceptions, just absorbing all the signals caught by their optic nerves."

"...Not invincible."

Shirone, who had been deep in thought, said.

"But isn't it the same? How could a newborn baby who doesn't even know what Havitz is help us?"

"There's one person."

Shirone's eyes widened.

"Though not perfect, a child who's still close to that state. No, that child might even be able to kill Havitz."

"Who... is that?"

Miro raised her index finger and said.

"Wena Wizard."

It was a name listed in the Ivory Tower candidate rankings at 6th place, alongside Nane, Jinseong-eum, and Shirone.
