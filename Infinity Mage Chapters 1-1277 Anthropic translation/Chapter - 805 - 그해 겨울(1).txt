**That Winter (1)**

Shirone and Minerva wandered across the world, searching for traces of *Judicial Murder*.

"Target forfeiture."

Minerva said, sitting on the jet.

"When a user's killing intent is reset, that's called target change. And when the dagger is destroyed..."

Shirone continued her words.

"*Judicial Murder* reappears before the closest person capable of eliminating the target."

"But if a new user has a change of heart and doesn't kill the target, *Judicial Murder* destroys itself and forfeits the user."

What happened after that, even Shirone didn't know.

"*Judicial Murder's* killing intent is powerful enough to twist the laws. That's why it shatters the moment it cannot kill. To put it in human terms, it's like exploding with rage."

"Hatred."

"Right. When target forfeiture occurs, *Judicial Murder's* hatred is maximized. Even though Havitz exists outside the laws, if it's *Judicial Murder* in target forfeiture state, it won't be an easy match."

Shirone looked straight ahead.

"Where could it be?"

"Target forfeiture is *Judicial Murder's* maximum function. But the downside is it doesn't appear before people."

"Then there's no way to find it."

"It's difficult, but it's not like finding a needle in a desert. If *Judicial Murder* was just born now..."

Minerva's eyes filled with sadness.

"That entire area would already be devastated."

While Shirone's team was retrieving *Judicial Murder*, the Ex Machina team entered final preparations.

Thousands of papers with algorithms drawn on them were stuck to the walls, and documents were piled high on the table.

"Alpha Fish, or Pilot Fish, enters the aquarium first to create an environment where Beta Fish can survive," Iruki said, organizing documents.

"The fact that Abella had a change of heart means Havitz has also accepted her," said Gudio, recording on the blackboard.

"The strategy that someone born with a witch's fate could capture Havitz's heart was effective."

Iruki nodded.

"I don't know how sincere Havitz is, but this will bind him somewhat to the laws."

Alpha Fish was meant to create that environment.

"We lost Crouch as the price, but..."

After briefly paying respects, Iruki put the last document in the safe and stood up.

"Now our job is to create the ultimate law to snipe Havitz before we retrieve *Judicial Murder*."

Agaya opened the door.

"They say *Judicial Murder* in target forfeiture state doesn't twist the laws. Instead, it becomes the law itself."

Gudio, Mais, and Nes followed behind.

"Besides Gustav Unit 4, there are countless bulletproof units and facilities protecting Havitz. As long as he resides in Marsak, sniping is impossible by any means."

An impregnable fortress that couldn't even be approached without Alpha Fish.

"Our role is to create a gap in that fortress."

Iruki, last to leave the room, arrived at the Ex Machina device underground.

'I will definitely find it, that gap.'

The door opened with a burst of steam, and the world's five most outstanding Servants entered.

**Eastern Region, Moon Kingdom**

Moon, one of the Seven Royal Stars, was the leader of the seven eastern kingdoms excluding the Jincheon Empire, a nation at the forefront of sorcery.

"Ugh. Death, I can see death."

At the foot of Mount Chiak, the royal sorcerer's hand holding the bell trembled.

"We cannot ascend. From here on, only darkness deeper than the abyss awaits us."

Mount Chiak.

With its treacherous terrain, it had been uninhabited since ancient times, a natural mountain guarded by fierce magical beasts.

"I get it, so hurry up. They're waiting behind us."

Minerva pointed to the long line of Moon Kingdom soldiers trailing behind.

"Are you really going up? Though I am the royal sorcerer, I cannot block this aura."

Shirone looked up at the snow-covered mountain.

'This is Miss Minerva's...'

The killing intent that had made him feel like losing his mind when he first met Minerva dominated the mountain.

"See, if something like this happened, you should have reported it quickly. Really, these kings."

The disaster came to Moon Kingdom two months ago, but the kingdom covered it up for diplomatic reasons.

According to village rumors, the screams of magical beasts from the mountain could be heard almost daily.

"It must be *Judicial Murder's* work."

Minerva stood beside Shirone.

"The resentment of being unable to kill the target of killing intent amplifies endlessly, sweeping away everything around it."

Without *Judicial Murder* even needing to move, ordinary creatures would die from the killing intent alone.

"Let's go up first. We need to check."

Following the path made by mountain animals, Shirone discovered the snow-covered corpses of countless beasts as they climbed.

"They're all dead."

Herbivores like rabbits and deer that lived in the middle of the mountain were dead in frozen states without a single wound.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

The low-ranking soldiers began vomiting first, then even the officers started dry heaving.

"We must stop here. We cannot go any further!"

The sorcerer warned again.

"Really so weak."

Though they were also elite troops, the *Judicial Murder's* aura spreading through the mountain was Minerva's.

"Wait here. Only Shirone and I will go up."

No one objected to the Five Great Star's order, and the two headed past the middle slope toward the summit.

"My goodness..."

In the barren field where even grass had died, they saw the corpses of vicious monsters, goblins born from emotions, and magical beasts as large as houses.

"They fought back."

Minerva, who had somehow changed to her young girl form, had a desolate emotion in her eyes.

"First the grass died, then the herbivores. When there was nothing left to kill, it wandered the mountain and pierced whatever it encountered."

All the corpses showed signs of being pierced through.

"Whether they had intelligence or not, they instinctively realized that if they couldn't eliminate that sword that suddenly entered the mountain, they would all die. So they chased *Judicial Murder* all the way here..."

The result was total annihilation.

"That was the hatred I harbored toward the world."

Just looking at Mount Chiak's landscape, one could tell how terrible young Minerva's heart had been.

"And now it's become an indestructible fragment, still wandering the world."

The girl arrived at the mountain's summit, where *Judicial Murder* was embedded in the cold snow like an engraving.

In the entirely white world, only around *Judicial Murder* shimmered with purple light.

Minerva reached out and grasped the dagger.

"That's why, though I already gave it to you, only I can retrieve *Judicial Murder* in target forfeiture state."

They had found *Judicial Murder*.

"Miss Minerva..."

Just as Shirone stepped forward to offer comfort, a voice came from across the mountain.

"Too late. With two busy Five Great Stars traveling together, perhaps you've let your guard down?"

The moment they saw the man walking through the snow with crunching steps, Minerva frowned.

"Mahoro Amanta."

The one who turns the World Wheel, a Five Great Star of the Balance Department.

"This is my first time meeting Shirone. I should offer congratulations, but I've been quite busy."

Minerva returned to her adult form.

"'Shirone'? He's clearly a fellow Five Great Star. And isn't Shirone the one with the most influence?"

Though Minerva was the one among the Five Great Stars who addressed Shirone most casually, Amanta paid no attention.

'A Five Great Star of the Balance Department?'

He had brown skin, a bald head, and deep wrinkles around his eyes showing traces of age.

*Tirirririri!*

When he flicked his middle finger, a small wheel-shaped World Wheel spun between his thumb and index finger.

"So? What business brings the busy Five Great Star of the Balance Department here?"

"Now that Buddha has disappeared, there's no counterpoint to benevolence. I was worried you might be going too far."

Minerva didn't give Shirone a chance to intervene.

"Your meddling is as vast as the universe. You don't need to worry about that. We're doing much better than you."

"It doesn't look that way to me."

*Tirirririri!*

The sound of the winding mechanism was extremely irritating.

"Shirone's benevolence is also just the aspiration of 'certain' people, not representing the entire world."

Finally, Shirone stepped forward.

"Wouldn't it be enough if we could love each other without people suffering?"

"No, it wouldn't."

Amanta was firm.

"This world is merely a 'backdrop for living,' not a rule about how one should live."

The Balance Department encompasses all users of the world.

"Shirone, you're an ability user who can break time. Depending on usage, you possess powerful strength that can disturb the world's order. Therefore, your benevolence without the balance of justice is nothing but cheating."

"I was permitted to break the laws."

"Buddha permitted you to break the laws, but didn't support you. That's why I've stepped forward."

Minerva asked.

"So? Are you planning to fight us?"

"I'm trying to restore balance."

The World Wheel detached from Amanta's hand flew rapidly toward Shirone.

"Shirone! Dodge!"

Minerva shouted, but Shirone, already angry, caught the wheel with his hand.

"Your argument is also just one way of thinking. I have absolutely no intention of bending my beliefs."

Amanta pointed to the sky and spun his finger in circles.

"You're wrong. To me, it's not thinking. I'm simply activating the user protection program."

"What do you mean...?"

"I am one who has realized the center of the universe."

Therefore, he leaned toward nothing and was authorized to turn the World Wheel.

"With that authority, I will seal your benevolence."

"Shirone! Let go of the World Wheel!"

Before Minerva's words ended, the caught World Wheel began spinning at tremendous speed.

"Urgh!"

Amanta released Shirone.

"There is no power that can overcome balance."

Shirone's wrist twisted, his arm twisted, and finally his entire body from the shoulder began rotating.

'I'm being sucked in.'

His entire body was already twisted like laundry, and the whole world rotated with the infinitely growing wheel.

Light and darkness alternated repeatedly before his eyes, and even his mind began to blur.

*Whoom! Whoom! Whoom! Whoom! Whoom!*

When he heard sounds like massive blades rotating, Shirone regained consciousness.

He was looking at the ceiling, where a metal fan over 200 meters in diameter was spinning.

"Why have you come here, representative of humanity?"

As an unknown language was decoded by Ultima, Shirone quickly looked around.

It was a dome-shaped space with wheel patterns carved into the inner walls.

"Where is this?"

The Terraforce priests surrounding him 360 degrees spoke in unison.

"The Prison of Balance. A perfect isolation space that restrains things that violate the universe's balance."

"Until when?"

"You have committed the breaking of time's laws. You cannot leave this place until Buddha appears in the world."

"Please call the Terraforce Chief Justice."

"This is a perfect isolation space. You exist outside the laws, only you who break balance exist here."

Shirone sighed.

"I was permitted to break the laws."

"We are the user protection program. Our only function is to isolate errors until system recovery is complete."

"No, that's not what I mean..."

Shirone shook his head and spoke again.

"I was... permitted to break the laws."

As Yahweh's light rose above Shirone's head, the massive fan on the ceiling stopped moving.

'Reverse it!'

As the fan gradually began rotating in the opposite direction and picked up speed, a ring of light formed.

"Stop! If you escape from the Prison of Balance without permission...!"

What would happen?

Since it was unprecedented, even the Terraforce priests couldn't continue their words.

'Whooosh!'

As the scenery before his eyes changed, the World Wheel rotating in reverse restored Shirone's body.

"What are you doing?"

As Shirone threw the World Wheel into the snow and gritted his teeth, Amanta's eyes shook with shock.

"How did you escape...?"

Since it confined concepts themselves, even Yahweh shouldn't have been able to escape normally.

"Could it be?"

Amanta suddenly realized.

'There's only one possible case.'

The system not recognizing Hexa as an error.
