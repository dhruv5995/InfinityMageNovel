[604] To Someone (2)

"Did I make a mistake telling him the location?"

Having sent Neid away like that, Liz thought about the reason Neid had gotten angry at the research club.

He still hadn't let go of his feelings.

When Neid had formally confessed to her, she had firmly drawn the line, but looking back now, she seemed to have been flustered.

'What was I afraid of?'

The truth was, he wasn't as comfortable a junior as she made him out to be.

Though they got along without reserve, she always felt a subtle tightrope-walking emotion whenever she was with Neid.

'The timing wasn't right.'

For a woman who had graduated from a prestigious school and was full of dreams about her future, a junior's confession was like throwing herself into darkness where she couldn't see an inch ahead.

She simply... couldn't choose.

'Because I didn't know what would happen to my future.'

And now beside her was Oscar, who guaranteed her a happy future.

'Right, this is how it should be. Things from the past...'

Liz shook her head to erase the past.

"Neid."

But the reason his name slipped out again at the end of her resolve was because of that unforgettable day from four years ago.

"What's wrong?"

When Liz, who had been approaching him for nearly three months, was nowhere to be seen today, Neid looked around the dining hall.

'Hmph, she can handle it herself.'

After receiving such embarrassing treatment from his senior for months, it was about time to give up.

"What happened to Liz? She went out yesterday and didn't come back, right?"

Despite his intentions, Neid's ears perked up.

"That's right. She said she had something to resolve for the research club."

"She wasn't captured, was she? I heard those alchemy trading company guys are really vicious."

The mention of an alchemy trading company captured Neid's attention.

"Those bastards. They completely loan-sharked her by taking advantage of the fact that she's a student."

Neid slammed down his utensils with a clang.

"So damn noisy."

With all the students staring, Neid got up from his seat and went to Liz's friends.

"If you're so worried, why don't you go check on her? What are you chattering about while eating?"

Her friends frowned as if looking at something hideous.

"What's it to you? Are you bored because Liz isn't here? You should have been nicer to her usually."

Without responding, Neid pulled out a chair and sat down.

"Tell me the details. So what happened?"

The place Neid arrived at after leaving school was the middle of a secluded alley in Creas City.

"Idiots."

According to what he heard from her friends, the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Club had conducted soul transmission experiments.

They had used the alchemy trading company's financial products to procure equipment, but seemed to have gotten caught by crooks.

Though he hadn't gotten any hints, finding Liz wasn't difficult for Neid, who knew the ways of the back alleys.

After walking for a while, he found some low-level organization members smoking and chatting.

Neid approached without hesitation and asked cockily.

"Hey, you guys come here for a second."

The organization members turned their heads with tense movements, then made bewildered expressions after confirming it was just a kid.

"What the hell, this brat? Do you know where you... Guhk!"

All they saw were the afterimages of blue lightning that occurred in an instant, and everyone except one lost consciousness.

"Where's Liz?"

When Neid grabbed his throat and asked, the terrified man's pupils trembled as he shouted.

"I don't know! I don't even know who that is!"

Of course that would be the case.

"Then find someone who does know."

Having dug into the underworld organization like that, Neid received news that she was imprisoned in alchemist Wiz's private residence in the forest.

"An alchemy trading company."

Upon infiltrating the residence, he found a warehouse built 200 meters away with two sturdy guards protecting it.

As Neid approached, rough voices could be heard as expected.

"Who are you? How did you get in here?"

"Hand over the woman."

Just from hearing those words, the experienced guards sensed the situation and simultaneously rushed toward Neid.

KRRRRRUMBLE!

At the sound of thunder, everyone in the warehouse turned their heads toward the door.

"What's happening!"

Then the warehouse door was smashed and Neid entered.

"Neid?"

Liz, with a haggard face, muttered in surprise.

'She's still safe.'

Seeing the documents tangled up complexly on the table, it seemed they had been negotiating all night.

Of course, Neid could guess these were things absolutely unacceptable from Liz's position.

These were people who could casually offer not only ridiculous loan shark rates but also body forfeiture agreements.

'They're professionals.'

Unlike other loan sharks, alchemy trading companies dealt with large amounts, so all their hired help were also mages.

Seeing seven mages standing with murderous intent, Neid let out a hollow laugh.

"Really crazy senior. Did you know what kind of place the trading company was when you rashly borrowed equipment? And as a student, no less."

Liz made an aggrieved expression.

"I paid all the rental fees! But they keep saying there are defects in the equipment and I have to purchase it!"

Since this was the typical method of crooked dealers, Neid examined the equipment Liz had brought.

"An Ultrix."

It was equipment that discharged high-output electrical energy all at once, an expensive item difficult to purchase unless you were a related industry company.

But correspondingly, its durability was guaranteed.

"There are defects? Open it up. I'll check it for you."

As Neid approached, Wiz held out his hand.

"What are you? Some kid who's still wet behind the ears is going to inspect an Ultrix? Do you know how much this equipment costs?"

"Well, we'll see about that. You know the internal trading company regulations, right? Article 7, Section 3. If you're caught cheating, you're permanently expelled."

Wiz's eyebrows twitched.

"Are you an alchemist?"

Of course, Neid didn't have official certification.

But having studied magical engineering since childhood, his skills were no less than a professional's, and thanks to that, he was well-versed in industry taboos.

"If you're really worried, why don't you leave it to a company? Choose. Will you take it as a rental and back off, or should we go to the guild with this equipment right now?"

"Surround him."

As soon as Wiz's words fell, the mages moved.

"Neid!"

Liz tried to approach, but flames spread in concentric circles around her.

"Don't move. You'll be roasted."

If they were only good enough to be hired by a trading company, they were probably guild dropouts, but correspondingly, they were veterans at making threats.

Wiz glared and asked.

"Seems like you've picked up some knowledge somewhere, but honestly, it'd be better to talk. Who knows you came here?"

Neid sneered.

"Unfortunately, I don't have any friends..."

'That idiot!'

Despair filled Liz's eyes.

Even if it was a lie, he should have involved someone else to safely get out of here.

"Is that so?"

As expected, Wiz's face turned sinister.

"Deal with him."

Six mages rushed in simultaneously.

Even if they weren't officially certified, each had at least one killing technique learned through real combat that possessed considerable power, so attacks that maximized their respective attributes flew in sharply.

KRRRRRUMBLE!

In an instant, the warehouse flashed with blue light, then with the sound of thunder, dust filled the warehouse thickly.

"Cough! Cough!"

Wiz, who coughed up the dust, opened his stinging eyes and looked forward, his face hardening.

With a single strike, six professional mages were electrocuted with their limbs twisted in strange ways.

"Grrrrr!"

Watching the mages grit their teeth and endure the shock, Liz's face also turned pale.

'He really is strong.'

She had thought he was just a junior with a rougher personality than others.

So the sight of Neid emitting blue electricity where the professional mages had fallen was an intense shock.

"I wonder if he's doing well?"

Shirone, still remaining in the research room even after Neid left, muttered.

"He'll manage. Surely he can at least bow his head?"

As Iruki said, Neid wasn't foolish, but a bigger problem than that was his emotional wounds.

"It's graduation exams now. He needs to get his head straight by then."

Iruki, who glanced at Shirone, closed his book.

"Do you really think so?"

"What do you mean? Of course he needs to get his head straight."

"I told you before. Neid was captured by bandits as a child and tortured with electricity. Very cruelly."

"I know. That's why he became 'like that.' Honestly, I still don't understand it. That he can control it."

"That's what I mean. Maybe it's better for Neid to wander around like this. For your sake too, Shirone."

"For my sake?"

"The reason you're giving up on evaluations - you're thinking that you can't become a mage just by getting good grades."

It was an awkward topic to discuss between friends.

"Iruki, I..."

"It's okay. Once we enter graduation exams, I'll have no choice but to fight you too."

Iruki got up from his seat.

"But the problem is Neid. He probably can't become a mage. No organization in the Red Line will hire a mage in 'that state.' Unless he bounces around guilds or falls into the Black Line."

"Neid will never become like that."

"I think so too. But Shirone, Neid is completely different from you in nature."

Iruki looked back at Shirone.

"You have limitless potential, but Neid's limits are clear. He's just at the peak. He became the strongest at eight years old, and since then, Neid has remained the strongest. And in my judgment..."

Iruki's eyes turned cold.

"At your current level, you can't surpass Neid."

"It doesn't matter if Neid is stronger than me."

Shirone was sincere.

"But we can't make definitive judgments. If we both do our best..."

"You've never seen Neid's true face, have you?"

Shirone closed his mouth.

"I have. And several others have too. Their opinions would be the same as mine. Neid isn't a mage. He's just magic itself."

Iruki sighed.

"I think it's rather fortunate. Neid has no future as a mage anyway. So for your success..."

"I hate that kind of thing."

Shirone gritted his teeth.

"Sacrificing the future for a friend? If the reason Neid is being lazy is because of me..."

"It's not just because of that. You know that, right?"

"No, even so, I can't accept it. Sacrifice in competition? That's nonsense!"

Iruki couldn't choose what was right.

Shirone was also a precious friend, and Neid's power was at least cheating at the magic school level.

"I want to go see Neid. I'm worried after all."

Understanding Shirone's feelings, Iruki got up and followed.

"Let's go together."

The sound of knocking on the door could be heard.

"Oscar? You're early?"

Liz, awakened from her reminiscence, quickly approached and opened the door, but contrary to expectations, Neid stood there with a dark expression.

"Senior, I came again."

Perhaps because she had reflected on events from four years ago, Liz's heart was in a softened state, different from a few hours earlier.

"Come in. Did you meet Oscar?"

"Well... Oscar might be a bit late."

At these incomprehensible words, Liz opened the door and gestured for him to come in.

Upon entering the room, the sight of Oscar's clothes neatly folded pained Neid's heart.

"Sit comfortably. What do you mean he'll be late?"

Neid, who sat on the chair, still couldn't decide whether he should tell her exactly what he had seen.

"Senior, do you really love Oscar?"

"Hoho! What's this all of a sudden? I'm marrying him because I love him."

This was hell in a different sense.

'I shouldn't have seen it.'

If he had just overlooked it, there might have been no burden on his heart.

"Senior, it seems like Oscar has..."

Toward an unknowable future, Neid threw out his words.

"Another woman."
