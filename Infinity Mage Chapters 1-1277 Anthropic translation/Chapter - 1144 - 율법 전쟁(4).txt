The Law War (4)

Hwaja Management Corporation

System Control Branch.

The System Control Branch was as vast in area as the scale of the hidden world itself.

Beyond countless buildings including warehouses and machine rooms, a modern building came into view.

Lychera said.

"That must be the System Control Branch headquarters. Be careful. There are many administrators."

Son Yoo-jung swung her two staffs.

"Hmph. Administrators or whatever, I'll smash them all. How dare they kidnap my friend?"

"No, getting hired there wouldn't be kidnapping, would it? Probably that friend of yours..."

"Shut up! Want to die?"

Son Yoo-jung lifted the chain from her waist and shouted into Lychera's ear.

In her state of being only a face, even that was torture, but no one sympathized.

"Damn it! I'm so miserable I can't stand it. Is there really no hell? No chains either."

"Hohoho! Of course! I'm invincible under heaven. Even hell can't stop me."

Shirone frowned.

"Son Yoo-jung."

As Gingko shrank, her face turned pale.

"S-sorry!"

"Don't be arrogant. You must never forget for a moment why I sent you to hell."

As Nane's face appeared, the one who had thrust the sword of Parji, Son Yoo-jung's eyes blazed with fire.

'Buddha. That bastard.'

The only difference from Shirone's Super Ego Bardo was that she couldn't get out on her own.

'For her to return to reality, she must reach Parji. And that means...'

It meant she would understand emotions.

"Let's go."

When they arrived at the entrance of the System Control Branch, people in suits were standing guard.

Lychera said.

"Those are administrators. They call them agents. I heard those guys are really vicious."

Agents were patrolling inside the grounds as well, and among them, black monks could be seen.

'Agents.'

Though Omega's records contained very little information about hell, their notoriety was well known.

They were system specialists of the hidden world who performed duties related to purification.

'When black monks capture someone, agents pass judgment. Their authority in hell is absolute.'

Ethela said.

"Charging in head-on doesn't seem like a good method. Even if we defeat them..."

Handling the purification system was a different matter entirely.

"Nonsense."

Chagall stepped forward.

"We can break these damn chains, so what's there to hesitate about? Just kill them all."

Lian blocked the path with his great sword.

"Shirone's decision comes first. If you interfere with the operation, you'll taste my blade."

"Go ahead. That woman will die too."

"How cowardly. Are you such a pathetic fool that you can't uphold your convictions without hiding behind a hostage?"

Chagall's eyes hardened.

"What do you know?"

"I know well. A hyena-like human who only bullies weak opponents. If not for the Taiji chains, you would already be dead."

Phantom daggers flickered around Chagall.

"Really? Let's see you try."

Ethela said.

"Stop it. This isn't the time for us to fight each other. Gathering information comes first."

Though they understood with their heads, the two men who were already fired up wouldn't look away.

"You're a piece of trash."

Lian hated Chagall, and anyone would have.

"Hehe, do you hate me that much? Why? Because I'm tormenting this woman? For such a trivial reason?"

"Such a trivial reason?"

The moment Lian couldn't hold back and took a step forward, Chagall yanked the Taiji chain.

Hiding behind Ethela, he shouted.

"Puahahaha! That's right! I'm trash! If it can make you all uncomfortable, I'll do anything!"

Shirone stepped forward.

"Let Teacher Ethela go."

"Then you all need to work harder. Hey, woman. Tell these guys. From now on, follow my orders. If you don't..."

Chagall stabbed a knife into his own thigh.

"Ugh!"

As the pain transmitted directly through the Taiji chain, Ethela's face contorted.

The blade stabbed repeatedly.

"Say it! Quickly!"

Lian, having lost his reason, charged.

"You bastard!"

"Puahaha! Want to cut me? Go ahead! I'm dying to see what happens!"

Chagall pushed Ethela aside and spread his arms wide, waiting for the great sword.

Lian gritted his teeth.

'I want to cut him! This absolute villain!'

But knowing that Ethela would suffer pain, he had no choice but to withdraw his sword.

'Still...'

His left fist rose.

'I'm sorry, Ms. Ethela. I have to punch him at least once!'

If he didn't do this much, Chagall would continue trying to control the group.

On top of that.

'I need to vent my emotions a bit!'

Just as his fist shot out at tremendous speed, Ethela embraced Chagall.

"Ugh!"

As she stopped his motion with her divine transcendence ability, wind pressure spread in all directions with a bang.

Ethela said.

"Please stop."

Lian had nothing to say to her either.

"Hehehe, you charged like you'd kill me, but this is all? In the end, you're just all talk too."

Ethela turned Chagall's face toward her.

"You stop too."

"Stop what? I don't listen to anyone. I'll torment and torment you until you go crazy."

Just as Shirone couldn't stand it and was about to step forward, Ethela said.

"You've never tormented me."

'Teacher.'

She turned to the group.

"The Taiji chain circulates endlessly. No one can say they're the only victim. It's not just his fault."

Rather, it was Chagall who was bewildered.

"What are you talking about?"

Ethela recalled the last moment she spent with Chagall in reality, just before her life ended.

"I was the one who accepted Chagall. I'm the only one who has the right to resent him. But I don't resent him anymore. Because I've realized what I must do."

The fate of Taiji.

"This man's life is my life. So please, everyone, treat Chagall kindly too."

Everyone fell silent.

'Sacrifice.'

Even though it wasn't their own affair, they felt the pain of sacrifice that seemed to rot their insides.

'That too is conviction. It is a sword.'

Lian said.

"I understand. Having heard Ms. Ethela's resolve, I won't judge Chagall anymore."

Ethela turned to face Chagall again.

"Please help us too. You want to break the chains, don't you? If we work together, we can do it."

Is that so?

'Do I... want to break the chains?'

Shirone said.

"Then let's make a plan. First, we need to understand the hidden world's system."

Even while the group was making plans, Chagall stayed far away from them.

Ethela's heart was transmitted through the chain.

'What a hypocrite.'

A warm and kind feeling.

'You must find me disgusting. If I die unluckily, you'd be as happy as if you owned the world. So...'

Chagall's eyes reddened.

'How annoying.'

Piercing through that nameless enormous emotion, sharp anger like a blade surged up.

'Don't pity me!'

The evil of all evils.

"Graaaah!"

When everyone turned their heads at Chagall's scream, he was already running toward the System Control Branch.

"Chagall! Kyaa!"

The chain stretched out 30 meters with a whoosh, and finally Ethela was dragged across the ground.

"That idiot!"

Led by Lian, everyone gave chase, but Chagall had already reached the entrance.

"What's that guy?"

The agents discovered Chagall and put whistles to their mouths, but their demeanor was calm.

Puffing their cheeks, they blew the whistles, and a shrill voice echoed through the clear sky.

"Intruder! Kuhaha! It's an intruder!"

Agents in identical outfits working in each sector swarmed like bees.

"Grrrr!"

Chagall, who could no longer see anything clearly, perceived that vast number as a single enemy.

'Speed Sword.'

Heat haze shimmered around him, and an enormous number of speed swords poured down like rain.

An agent grabbed Chagall's shoulder.

"This bastard...! Gak!"

As the blade pierced his right eye, dozens of holes appeared in his suit simultaneously.

"Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!"

The agent instantly became a pincushion, but Chagall showed no signs of stopping.

"Uaaah!"

Anger does not diminish.

'Die! Die! Die!'

If his stamina was preserved, he seemed like he would repeat this mechanically forever.

'You ignore me? Am I funny to you?'

The emotion of wanting to destroy something was clear, but since he didn't know what a destroyed state looked like.

"Uaaah!"

He kept stabbing.

Until the form changed, until every single cell was completely destroyed, until even atoms were crushed.

'I'll do something to them! I'll definitely do something!'

That level of persistence.

The Shirone group arriving at the entrance was speechless before the scene of brutal overkill.

"My goodness..."

The malice was so intense that even agents couldn't carelessly approach - it was unparalleled even in hell.

Ethela shouted.

"Stop it!"

When her heart was transmitted through the chain, Chagall struck back with even greater malice.

"Uaaah!"

Why was it shameful?

'That woman is the one who was shamed. Why am I... Why does it have to be me...!'

Why me?

'That's right, I'm a murderer. I killed them. I'm a villain of villains. That's why I'm being punished. I died. I fell to hell! If that's still not enough...'

Even if I suffer greater pain, I don't mind.

'Just let me ask one thing.'

Why me?

'Why don't I have a past? Why did you make me love Tia? If it was all fake anyway...'

If something like a god exists, shouldn't I at least be allowed to ask that much?

"Chagall!"

Ethela desperately sent her heart, but the more she did, the stronger Chagall's anger became.

"Graaaah!"

Thousands of daggers slashed forward, tearing the agent's body to shreds.

A voice came from the sky.

"Thank you for the generous purification. Remaining purification time: 87 eons, 2,875 kyeong, 3,241 trillion, 6,401 billion, 7.21 million and 38 hours."

Shirone looked up.

"What?"

As he remembered, it was roughly 4 billion hours of purification.

'So this is how it works.'

The karma of Taiji. But the two people involved were half out of their minds.

"Stop! Please stop!"

When Ethela cried out with all her heart, Chagall's attack finally came to a halt.

"Haa! Haa!"

What remained where the speed swords had disappeared were horribly mutilated corpses.

"Chagall, Chagall..."

Ethela's hands trembled violently as she shared their emotions, and bloody tears flowed from Chagall's eyes.

"Teacher, are you okay?"

Realizing how the two people's Taiji amplified each other, Shirone was finally certain.

'This is hell.'

If Ethela forgave Chagall, he would trample on her with even greater anger.

'An infinite repetition of that.'

The threshold would continue to grow, and only those enormous emotions seemed to erase their karma.

"You've done quite spectacularly."

The agent walking toward them with black monks in tow had a different aura from the other agents.

"System Control Branch, Purification Team Leader Macula. If you had given us advance notice, our staff wouldn't have made mistakes."

Lian asked.

"Are you saying you'll let us in?"

"Of course. You're VIPs of our company. Please follow me. I'll guide you."

As Macula turned around properly and walked away, Lian asked Shirone for his intention.

"What should we do?"

"Whatever their scheme, it's better than fighting. Let's enter the headquarters for now."

As the group followed Shirone, Ethela and Chagall slowly got up as well.

The two didn't make eye contact.
