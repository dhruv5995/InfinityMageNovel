Unsolved Case (4)

The Other World.

If the Hwagongsa headquarters was the heart of hell, then the System Control Branch was hell's brain.

Commonly called the Company, it was an organization that systematically processed all incidents and corrected errors.

"How peaceful."

A man in a suit yawned lazily while looking at Melkidu's system logs.

Though his rank was a lowly employee, they too were administrators called agents.

"Peaceful my ass. There's a mountain of work to do. We're just not doing it."

There were no layoffs at the Company...

"Tch, do you know how long I've been doing this job?"

But no resignations either.

"By the way, why is it so noisy? The security guys have it good. They can walk around freely."

"They say Yahweh has come."

"Hmm, Yahweh." It took quite some time to restart a brain that hadn't been used for a long while.

"What! Yahweh?"

The man jumped up with a surprised expression, but his colleague remained indifferent.

"Keep it down. Don't you know what happens if this facility gets discovered? Yahweh is also in Melkidu—"

The man examining the monitor sat down.

"...What's going on?"

"The team leader said dozens of agents were taken down at the entrance. If they had been hit the same way, the Company factory grounds would have been devastated."

"Good grief, so they let Yahweh into the building? No, before that, did the branch manager approve this?"

"You don't seem to understand. It's not at that level. The president directly ordered this."

"Lady Lethe..."

"Yahweh coming is probably about the true voice issue. Fortunately, it seems the president was also near the Valley of Weeping. The order was to buy time until she could come to the Company. That's probably why they let Yahweh enter without bloodshed."

The man frowned.

"Lady Lethe directly? Is that really necessary? The Other World is the system where the most administrators work. If we mobilize all the world's Howling and agents, there's nothing we can't stop."

"They eliminated the chief secretary, Lord Monorath."

The man's mouth hung open in shock.

"That's a lie."

"I thought so too at first. If Lady Lethe can reduce everything in hell to magic, Lord Monorath can devour all of hell's magic. And what he devoured was none other than the strongest creature in the physical realm, Ymir."

His colleague turned his head.

"Who do you think defeated him? Yahweh? No, it was a human traveling with Yahweh. Someone who can control Gehenna's chains. In a narrow sense, that's the same as Lady Lethe."

The man finally realized the gravity of the situation.

"Stay quiet until Lady Lethe settles this. It doesn't seem like it'll be resolved easily though."

"What if it's not resolved?"

"Then... well..."

His colleague looked back at the monitor.

"Either them or us - one side will meet their end."

"Why are they so late?"

Shirone's group, who had entered the office building after passing through the factory grounds, had been waiting in the guest room for about two hours.

"I can't stand it anymore!"

Son Yoo-jung jumped up.

"I'm going to meet Mortasinger right now. Anyone who gets in my way will get smashed, that's all."

Shirone spoke curtly.

"Son Yoo-jung."

Her shoulders flinched.

"Stay put. Don't mess things up."

"Ugh. Fine."

Son Yoo-jung turned around with her head hung low and was about to sit back down in her chair.

"...is what you'd expect me to say!"

Suddenly she kicked off the ground and leaped toward the door, thrusting her right staff straight out.

Just then, the door opened.

"You guys stay here—"

The moment Son Yoo-jung saw Lethe's familiar face, she bared her teeth.

"Get out of the way!"

Shirone's eyes widened.

"Gasp!"

As Gingoa shrank, Son Yoo-jung collapsed as if a string had been cut.

"Ow, I'm sorry. Please..."

Lethe looked at the writhing Son Yoo-jung, or more precisely, at Richera's face attached to her waist.

'How annoying.'

If not for the head of that escapee who knew hell inside and out, Shirone wouldn't have made it in time.

'Is this fate too?'

Raising her gaze, she looked over Shirone, Ryan, Ethella, and Shagar one by one.

'Yahweh, Gehenna, Taiji. Just how many years of karma is this?'

They were super VIPs.

"Hello. I'm Lethe, president of Hwagongsa. So we finally meet like this."

There was no response.

Stepping over Son Yoo-jung with large strides, she sat at the table across from Shirone.

"Fine, I'll compromise."

After a long staring contest, Lethe closed her eyes as if giving up.

"I'll offer myself. The most beautiful me in the Other World should leave no complaints."

"I'm not in the mood for jokes."

Lethe slammed the table.

"Then what do you want me to do! The true voice cannot be freed! It's systematically impossible!"

"It's possible. If you purify hell."

"Then all the demons will be annihilated! What do you think the duty of an Other World administrator is? Do you know how hard I work to manage this place?"

Lethe was extremely agitated.

"Yahweh, Buddha - honestly, you don't get particularly good treatment in reality either. You're probably wandering around lost in ideologies and beliefs, so why are you only thugs in hell? Why do you come here and act violent!"

Fighting humans was Satan's job. She only wanted to maintain the system.

"Think about me too. Just as Taeseong exists for humans, I exist for demons. What you're saying amounts to nothing but 'let's fight.'"

"Taeseong exists for humans" - Shirone found those words quite pleasant to hear.

"Let's do this. I'll eliminate the demon realm in reality. Instead, you bear your karma here. With your karma, all the demons in the Other World could live for 10,000 years, so there's plenty of room for negotiation."

"Eliminate the demon realm. But I can't give up the true voice. And I heard there's one way."

Lethe blinked.

"Huh?"

"You can escape through Sheol. There should be one spot open right now. Since I killed him."

To be precise, Wizard had killed one more recently, so two spots were open.

"Sigh."

Lethe leaned back in her chair.

"This is really frustrating. Of course the Company creates Sheol-related code, but do you even know what Sheol is?"

"Fanatics."

"So those fanatics are... Never mind. I'll show you directly. How about it?"

Son Yoo-jung, sitting in the corner with a sullen expression, said:

"I can meet Mortasinger too, right?"

"Mortasinger? Oh, of course. He's in the Sheol candidate pool. Honestly, he seems to lack talent though."

Lethe stood up.

"Let's go. The chance to tour the System Control Branch, the Company, doesn't come often."

Lethe's mind raced quickly.

'I need to buy time.'

Yahweh with an agape heart was a tyrant in the Other World, but different in reality.

'Satan's law will handle it. If we finish him in reality, the Other World will be safe.'

She had said Giorgios had a plan.

"Then let's depart."

Hiding her true thoughts and wearing a pure smile, Lethe opened the door and stepped into the corridor.

Men in suits were waiting.

Even though they were fellow agents, they had a completely different presence from those Shagar had dealt with at the entrance.

"Who are these?"

Lethe introduced them.

"Hwagongsa's board of directors. There's also the Company's branch manager. They'll guide you."

A white-haired elderly gentleman bowed his head.

"I'm Branch Manager Venistov. You seem interested in hidden codes - I'll escort you."

With him leading the way, Shirone's group and the directors walked down the corridor in formation.

"Agents."

When Shirone muttered, Lethe said:

"This is the place with the most administrators among the five major systems. Processing emotions is that difficult a task. But agents can do it. They understand hidden codes from the very beginning of their existence."

"So emotion equals logic."

"Yes. If you define agents from an outside world perspective, they're autonomous processes that perform specific tasks. They find hidden codes as natural as humans feeling gravity."

The reason for mentioning the outside world perspective was probably to gain Shirone's trust.

But it only made him think it was dangerous.

"This is where we control the concentration of the flames..."

True to the purpose of a tour, Venistov added explanations each time they passed a department.

'It must be Lethe's instruction.'

Making Shirone understand the Other World would make future negotiations much easier.

Venistov pointed to the stairs.

"Let's go straight to the 12th floor. It's where Sheol candidates take their tests. If you go there..."

"Wait."

Shirone interrupted.

"What's that door?"

It was a door with no department name engraved on it, just sitting there alone.

"That door is installed on every floor. There's an identical door on the 12th floor too."

His obvious attempt to divert attention in a situation where careless lies could be poisonous was clear.

"So what is it?"

"...It's a door leading to the engine room."

"Engine room?"

When Venistov glanced at Lethe, she nodded with pursed lips.

"I'll guide you. Please follow me."

Instead of explaining, he opened the door and boarded a spherical elevator descending underground.

After hearing heartbeat sounds, the sphere carrying the group plummeted at terrifying speed.

Standing at the entrance of the straight tunnel, horrible white noise transmitted through the walls.

It sounded like hundreds of thousands of people screaming in different voices.

"Beyond that wall is the central processing unit that handles all of hell's magic."

"I see. It really was nothing special."

When Shirone looked dismissive, Lethe made an aggrieved expression.

"That's why I brought you here. I have no special intentions. It is a core device, but it only has information processing functions. The reason I didn't want to show you was actually for your sake."

Since the Other World's devices were made of living beings, it wouldn't be a beautiful sight.

"I need to see it directly."

Lethe sighed and nodded, and Venistov proceeded without hesitation.

"This is it."

In a valley large enough to contain a human city, something like a giant brain was floating.

'No, it's not a brain.'

From fingernail-sized to human forearm-sized, countless fetuses were clinging all over it.

Even the bold Ryan frowned at the sight of them crying and making all sorts of noise.

"What... what is this place?"

Lethe said:

"I told you you'd regret it. As you can see, those are fetuses. Specifically, aborted children. They don't have the same logic as humans, but they have identical emotions. Through that fear of death, they cross over to the Other World."

Shirone's expression wasn't good either.

"Central processing unit..."

"Yes. Only fetuses can calculate the Other World's magic. The reason the Company was built here is also because such magic flows in according to the terrain of the law. It's chaotic magic with no logic, only pure emotion."

The group watched the fetuses writhing their underdeveloped bodies to avoid falling.

Below the valley was fire.

'Poor children.'

Ethella, who had been making a sad expression at the back, suddenly frowned.

'Ugh!'

At the sharp pain felt in her womb area, her hand automatically moved to her lower abdomen.

'Could it be? No, that's impossible.'

Shagar, connected by Taiji's chains, looked at Ethella with a hardened expression.

"You..."

"It's nothing. Don't worry about it."

Ethella coldly shut down Shagar's concern and despaired before the chilling truth.

'I definitely haven't menstruated since coming here. I thought it was because I was already dead.'

What if there was another reason?

'Maybe... it could be possible.'

Because she had fallen into hell in a living body.

"Waaah... Ah! Waaah... Ahhhhh!"

The abandoned fetuses were crying.
