The Only Chance (3)

Destroy

02.

In the urban jungle where only the steel frames of buildings remained, various creatures from level 20 to 80 inhabited the area.

Therefore, Destroy-02 was not only a place for rapid leveling up, but also a battlefield where the East and West Nations collided.

"Hahaha! You idiot! What? Why don't you act all tough like before?"

From 1-Minute-Before-Chaos to 5-Minute-Before-Chaos, five West Nation users surrounded Strongest-Codename, who was equipped with a White General set.

"Damn it! These bastards...!"

Strongest-Codename tried to straighten his upper body, but his left leg had been blown off by 3-Minute-Before-Chaos's bombardment.

"Urgh!"

The Chaos gang was enjoying themselves by dragging out time instead of eliminating Strongest-Codename.

Since "hostile acts" were naturally established between the East and West Nations, there was no need to be cautious.

'The White General set is tempting too.'

There was a rumor that the more parts you destroyed, the more loot you'd get when they died.

It was a kind of superstition, but from Strongest-Codename's perspective, it wasn't actually bad.

"You're only cocky for now. Once my friends arrive, you guysâ€”"

5-Minute-Before-Chaos burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! You think a bunch of mere level 10s can beat us? Right?"

1-Minute-Before-Chaos fell into thought.

He was a user equipped with the Amara integrated type, said to be most efficient at level 70.

Though his egg-shaped body and stubby arms looked clumsy, the firepower of his machine gun that fired seven shots per second was outstanding.

'He seems to have something he's counting on. Does he have a major guild backing him?'

West Nation users could only check the codenames of East Nation users.

Once you became a ranker, you could know detailed information through the rankings, but that was a distant dream for them.

"He's quite the bluffer. Just smash him."

Anyway, no one in Destroy-02 could surpass the Amara integrated type.

3-Minute-Before-Chaos said:

"Let's not do that and smash his limbs first. Leave only his face and torso."

"Haha! That sounds good?"

5-Minute-Before-Chaos, whose anger from being beaten by Yahweh-2 hadn't subsided, aimed his bolt gun.

"I'll make you crawl around like a bug."

Just as the muzzle was about to flash, Yahweh-2's voice was heard from across the city.

"Stop!"

5-Minute-Before-Chaos turned his head.

"Haha! Finally making your appearance! Where's the hero of justice..."

Silence fell.

The codenames were clearly visible, but their machines were suspicious enough to doubt if they were AI.

"...What? They came equipped with strange parts."

A form that exuded the aura of a predator among insects.

"Could that be...?"

The elongated limbs were slender but represented the essence of mechanical engineering that could handle several tons of weight like feathers.

"Grim Reapers."

They were products of Metal Genome Corporation, recognized as masterpieces even by intermediate users over level 200.

"Aren't they fake? How can all those guys be equipped with Grim Reapers?"

If they were seven times more expensive than the Amara integrated type, you could say the cost-performance ratio was the worst.

'If you equip that at level 20... you literally become a death god.'

"Crazy bastards. They bought Metal Genomes just to catch us? What are they going to wear from level 70?"

"Wait. Let me check."

It was then that 1-Minute-Before-Chaos encountered new news on Atogram's free bulletin board.

Title: Electronic Warfare Emperor Aegis Appears in Atogram!

Following the link, there were over 200 recorded videos taken by users.

Below a photo of Aegis bowing his head to Yahweh-2, detailed information was attached.

Thus, this reporter came to track the movements of Yahweh-2's party. As a result...

Parts shop. Who's the branch manager? Bought out everything.

Presumed to be VIP.

1-Minute-Before-Chaos, who quickly scanned the article content, spoke in a modulated voice:

"Those guys are Golden Circle."

"What?"

The Chaos gang looked back at Yahweh-2.

"Check the Atogram bulletin board. This isn't a joke right now."

Their pupils moved rapidly.

"Oh, that's right."

It was the strongest guild in the East Nation that could uniquely oppose the West Nation's Ascension Guild.

"...This really sucks."

1-Minute-Before-Chaos made a decision.

"Let's retreat. There's nothing good about messing with Golden Circle. If we fight, we'll just embarrass ourselves."

Of course that was true, but 5-Minute-Before-Chaos already had a mountain of grievances piled up.

"It's not over yet."

He aimed at the back of Strongest-Codename's head and shouted:

"You bastards! Give me back my bolt gun! If you hand it over quietly, I'll let this guy go!"

Destruction-God-707 snorted.

"You're talking nonsense! Do you think that'll work as a threat? Go ahead and kill him if you want!"

It was already a closed matter.

"Damn it! This is so annoying I could go crazy! What can we do? Even if I have to wash my codename, those guys..."

Then Shirone shouted:

"Let my friend go! If you send him over here safely, I'll forget everything that happened so far."

"Huh?"

The Chaos gang was more confused than Destruction-God-707's party.

'What kind of bullshit is that?'

If you die, you just start over again.

Of course, there's a chance of losing parts when you die, and the White General set was quite expensive...

'But those guys are Golden Circle.'

Would guys wrapped head to toe in Metal Genome's Grim Reapers even glance at a White General set?

Destruction-God-707 looked back at Shirone.

"Hey, what are you doing? Strongest-Codename can just die. Then those guys will go crazy with frustration."

"Yeah, that's right. But..."

Shirone looked at Strongest-Codename lying there with his left leg destroyed.

"Just because they're unhappy doesn't make me happy."

"I don't want to see Strongest-Codename die. Of course, he can start over and there will be days when we need to use the system, but anyway, dying feels bad, right?"

Even if it's a virtual world.

"I don't like giving up when there's a chance to save him. It would be best if we win without anyone dying. How they feel about it isn't an important issue for us, I think."

Destruction-God-707 stared with his mouth agape.

'This guy is really weird.'

But if there was a way to not kill Strongest-Codename, nothing could be better than that.

"Then what are you going to do?"

"Leave it to me."

What he realized in Mid Gear.

If this simulation also has time relativity in the electrical world, then 'I can do it.'

As Shirone raised his concentration to the extreme, 2-Minute-Before-Chaos muttered:

"Why are they acting like that? It doesn't seem like they want to fight?"

"Hehe, now I get it."

5-Minute-Before-Chaos twisted his lips into a grin.

"Golden Circle's honor. What happens if their guild member gets completely destroyed by guys like us who have nothing to lose? If we record it and post it on the bulletin board, it'll probably cause an uproar."

"Oh? That's right? The West Nation will mock them endlessly. We'll become heroes."

"Exactly. If worst comes to worst, we can just wash our codenames. We win this fight."

5-Minute-Before-Chaos shouted:

"Hey! Give me back my bolt gun! Or bring 1 million galactic currency! Then I'll let this guy go!"

Destruction-God-707 shouted:

"You idiot! Why would we give you 1 million galactic currency?"

"Oh yeah? Then I'll smash all this guy's limbs? It's okay if I record and spread it around, right?"

"Ugh! Come to think of it..."

There was still a political problem.

"Now's the time."

As Shirone, who had been staring intently forward, took a step, the Chaos gang shouted.

His steps stopped again, but Shirone's senses were already penetrating the depths of the world.

'The mind is the world itself.'

Park Ji's sense of crossing between dimensions began extracting signals contained in the scenery.

'I can feel it.'

A festival of all kinds of information, where even blanks were coded as electrical signals, flowed like rapids.

Shirone jumped between codes.

"Cheonny Bardo."

A kind of memory jump - in reality, it was like traveling through a wormhole.

"Huh?"

When Yahweh-2 suddenly disappeared, 5-Minute-Before-Chaos frantically manipulated his AI.

"Behind! Behind!"

At his comrade's terrified scream, he turned around to find Yahweh-2 already embracing Strongest-Codename.

"You... you..."

Clank! Clank!

Shirone's right upper arm opened and an output device shaped like a bird's talon popped out.

'Energy beam.'

When the thick beam struck his solar plexus, the armor's durability dropped to 500, 400, 300.

In 2 seconds, the armor would burn through.

"Aaaaah!"

As 5-Minute-Before-Chaos writhed and collapsed, his comrades raised their muzzles and fired.

"Kill him!"

Gunshots erupted, and Shirone, carrying Strongest-Codename, kicked off the ground and moved away.

"Damn it! How is he so fast?"

Like a wasp in flight, only black afterimages were visible as sparks flew uselessly into the ground.

Shirone's friends joined the battle.

"Alright! Let's begin!"

2-Minute-Before-Chaos and 3-Minute-Before-Chaos were consumed by energy beams.

"Aaaaah! So annoying!"

There were limits to output based on level, but the durability was definitely Metal Genome quality.

"Puhahaha! This is really killer!"

Durability 5,687/7,000.

No matter how much they were hit, the armor showed no signs of being penetrated, and meanwhile 4-Minute-Before-Chaos fell.

"These bastards!"

The Amara integrated type aimed forward roared with motor noise as it poured bullets like a downpour.

Rat-a-tat-tat!

As Destruction-God-707 rolled on the ground, sparks covered his armor and durability dropped to 4,544.

Hey, you okay?

Death-Princess communicated.

Yeah. These parts work even at level 60, so I can handle it. Just don't take direct hits.

"Come on! Come at me! You sons of bitches!"

Amid the frenzied barrage, fragments flew and in the hazily blurred vision, Yahweh-2 burst out.

"I'll handle this!"

1-Minute-Before-Chaos also spotted Yahweh-2.

"That guy..."

His approach, as if jumping through space, couldn't even be caught by AI.

'He's using a strange option.'

Like a black wasp hunting, Shirone rapidly circled around the Amara integrated type.

'He jumps through space. But he can't freely determine his position.'

He moves following code.

"Here!"

1-Minute-Before-Chaos, who had grasped the movement pattern, twisted his direction 60 degrees and fired predictive shots.

'Got him!'

Yahweh-2 was approaching while evading between the bullets.

"What the hell is this? Shit...!"

Moving agilely in slowed time, Shirone activated his selective option.

'Turbo.'

Charging forward while receiving doubled output, he raised his left hand.

'If I bring him down, we win.'

A flat output device popped out and a blade-shaped energy cutter turned on.

1-Minute-Before-Chaos, gripped by terror, let out a shriek.

"Aaaaah!"

Sparks flew from the Grim Reaper's armor and durability began dropping rapidly.

'6,871, 6,123, 5,231...'

Shirone's AI, having deflected the barrage with no blind spots with his body, approved the penetration judgment.

'Now!'

The energy cutter pierced through the Amara integrated type's armor, but the Grim Reaper's left arm was also destroyed.

With a bang, they collided physically and the machine weighing over a ton tilted backward.

"Huh? Huuuh?"

Though the weight distribution was low due to being specialized for attack, once it fell over it was hard to get back up.

Kuuuuuung!

The ground shook and where the gunfire stopped, the half-destroyed Chaos gang wore bewildered expressions.

"Haa. Haa."

Yahweh-2, with his left arm torn off, was stepping on 1-Minute-Before-Chaos's stomach and aiming his gun.

"Surrender."

The Amara integrated type struggled briefly then seemed to give up, reducing his output.

Wuuuuung.

The passionate noise subsided and a voice was heard.

"...Surrender."

"Also apologize for attacking Death-Princess. And never interfere with us again."

"We weren't planning to mess with you anyway. You guys, apologize if you have something to apologize for. We lost."

"Tch."

5-Minute-Before-Chaos turned his head.

"Sorry. That good enough?"

His machine, damaged from the battle, had only his face and half his upper body remaining.
