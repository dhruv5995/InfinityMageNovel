The Scale of Desperation (2)

?

Omega Year 689.

The Gaians, who had been strong enough to keep Ankh Ra in check, saw their numbers drop drastically starting with the Great Purification.

"Ataraxia."

As Ikael's judicial halo blazed with light, six archangels charged toward the Gaians.

"Damn it...!"

With the population reduced by the Great Purification, the power of the 'Hand of God' had significantly weakened.

"Ragnarok."

As Uriel, wrapped in white lightning, charged forward, a massive path opened through the space filled with humans.

"Maintain formation!"

Like cells repairing a wound, the Gaians clustered together in perfect unison, making Metiel click her tongue.

"Still struggling, are we?"

Truly, this was the age of resistance.

Having evaded the Hand of God's attack, she raised her hand toward the sky.

"Small-scale high-velocity rounds."

Hundreds of tons of metal filling the sky were fired at supersonic speeds.

The impact was equivalent to a small meteor collision, and the Ultima System shook violently.

"Hold on! For the new age!"

Before the Hand of God could reform, Raiel, the Archangel of Light, infiltrated and swung his fist.

It was an utterly simple attack, but there was no way to block the physical force coming at light speed.

"Ultima System!"

An invisible barrier ballooned up from the center of the Gaians, expanding rapidly.

"Hmph."

As Raiel threw his straight punch, horizontal flashes pierced endlessly through the barrier.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Following the trajectory of the flashes, powerful chain explosions generated intense heat in succession.

"Won't you be satisfied until everyone's dead?"

Raiel flew into the sky, spinning his accelerator while arrogantly tilting his chin up.

"Satisfied?"

Light entered the Gaians' eyes.

"Are you speaking to me?"

As hundreds of millions of voices unified into one, the Hand of God clenched its fist tight.

"Same old pattern. It won't work anymore."

Just as Raiel spun his judicial halo at light speed, preparing to burst forward—

"Stop it!"

Satiel stepped between them, spreading both arms wide.

"You've fought enough already! If one side gets wiped out like this, everyone loses."

Raiel snorted.

"Stand aside, Satiel. I've left you alone until now because I recognized your neutral stance. But if you take the humans' side, that's a different story."

"I'm not taking anyone's side. I'm saying there's no point in continuing this war."

The Gaians thought:

'No point?'

Among those who had resolved to leave the Photon System, only Gorphin remained as a human.

'Right. Why are we fighting?'

It had been so long ago that they'd forgotten what they were even struggling for.

Satiel spoke to their representative:

"Request a ceasefire. There's also the option of angels and humans joining forces to create a new world."

"We've come too far for that. If this is all there is to it, what about our ancestors' war that lasted through eons? What about the hundreds of billions of humans who died in the Great Purification?"

Ikael amplified his voice:

"Do you still think you are gods? Look—you've lost the war and your state is pitiful. As far as I know, no such god exists anywhere."

A voice came from the ground:

"Could anyone be more pitiful than me?"

As Gorphin, wrapped in rags, limped forward with ragged breathing, Ikael frowned.

'Fighting even in that condition?' His appearance after single-handedly swallowing Ankh Ra's fury was no different from a wreck.

'He stopped the Great Purification, but...'

The fury capable of destroying the entire world wasn't something one human could handle.

Ikael ground his teeth.

'Foolish human.'

While the downfall of a formidable enemy was satisfying, his heart also ached seeing Gorphin's broken state.

'Well, we have indeed fought for a very long time.' From the beginning until now.

"Just give up, Gorphin. The Gaians have declined and your condition isn't normal either. This war is our victory."

Gorphin smiled dryly.

"I can't do that."

"Why? Why do you try to shoulder everything alone? It must be hard enough just maintaining your sanity after swallowing the Great Purification."

As the twisting pain in his heart surged again, Gorphin grimaced and clutched his chest.

"Graaah!"

"Arrogant, so arrogant. You are not gods. You're just mutations that destroy the stability of the world."

"That might be true."

Gorphin readily admitted it.

"We might be errors that destroy this world. And among them, I'd be the worst error of all."

"If you know that, then stop. When you're already overwhelmed just handling the fury of the Great Purification, why do you try to fight?"

"Because I hate it."

Gorphin's eyes widened.

"Because I hate this cold world so much. Now I don't care whether I'm a god or not. I will become a god."

"Don't mistake delusion for reality. It's a perfect world. We are beings born from the law."

"Is that what a god is?"

Ikael fell silent.

"If you just make everything perfect, is that the end of everything?"

From this moment on, Gorphin's philosophy would come to completely deny the world's laws.

"Despite bearing the grand name of god, for the world you created, for the creatures living in that world...!"

A massive hexagonal light arose.

"You can't have even a shred of compassion?!"

As Miracle Stream created a dragon fist, a tornado of light swept the surrounding area.

Metiel muttered:

"He's not in his right mind. Mad with fury."

At the same time, the six archangels surged against the Miracle Stream toward Gorphin.

The combination of supreme concepts shook the world, and thunder crashed down from the sky.

'I thought he'd become a wreck... but Gorphin was still Gorphin.'

As the evenly matched battle continued, Ikael's eyes flashed as he opened Ataraxia.

The archangels' power was amplified to the extreme.

"Got you!"

The six who had trapped Gorphin in the Movement Zero domain simultaneously delivered their strongest strike.

'It's over. There's absolutely no way to avoid it.'

Just as Raiel was certain—

"Graaaaaah!"

Gorphin, eyes rolled back showing the whites, pulled Miracle Stream toward himself.

'This cold world!'

As the smoke of light compressed between his palms, it glowed brilliantly.

'I can't accept it!'

Break.

"What...!"

An incomprehensible inertia rushed in, sending all six archangels flying in the same direction.

Even though the attack was thwarted, none of the archangels understood the current situation.

"H-how..."

Ikael, the first to realize, forgot even his dignity as chief angel and accepted the tremor.

"He stopped the rotation."

The planet had been braked for about 3 seconds, causing volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis across entire continents.

'Just one human...'

If you desperately wish for something from the heart, even the laws of the universe can be changed?

Ikael found himself muttering unconsciously:

"A god with a heart... you say?"

If there were a god who could endlessly watch over the world and sympathize with the pain of his creatures...

'Under that god's mercy...'

Angels, humans, mountains and seas, fields and trees—

'Nothing would be insignificant.'

Gorphin's hands blazed with Miracle Stream's light as he charged toward the archangels.

"I will become a god!"

Just as Uriel raised his arms in a defensive stance, Gorphin's eyes suddenly widened.

"Gaaah!"

He then spewed a bowlful of blood and staggered, losing his momentum to pain.

'Damn it!'

Ankh Ra's fury was surging again, causing his entire cellular structure to go into shock.

Uriel spun his Bliss Staff.

"...Don't resent me."

Gorphin hastily activated Hexa, but before it could complete, the Bliss Staff struck his abdomen hard.

As if vaporized, Gorphin's body flew like an arrow.

"No!"

Satiel screamed and spread her angel wings.

"Sa-ti-el!"

At Ikael's voice, so powerful it shook heaven and earth, she ultimately couldn't chase after Gorphin.

"Urgh!"

Ikael's figure, spreading a massive Ataraxia and looking down, was undoubtedly the most noble being.

"Satiel, I can no longer tolerate your willfulness. I command you—do not move a single step."

Though the command was directed at Satiel, no angel could leave their position.

'It's the first time I've seen him this angry.'

Ikael turned toward the direction Gorphin had flown.

"I will settle this myself. You all stay here and stop the Gaians."

He felt it was right to end at least Gorphin with his own hands.

Landing where the scrape marks on the ground ended, Ikael looked straight ahead.

"You again? At this rate, I might grow fond of you."

Gorphin's body, leaning against a pile of collapsed rocks, was stained with blood.

"How pitiful, human."

Ikael slowly stepped forward.

"We've fought for such a long time. If I'd known the end would be this pathetic, I should have finished it long ago."

"Heh heh. Heh heh heh."

Gorphin laughed, his shoulders shaking, then asked:

"How does it feel? The feeling of defeating the strongest enemy who was hindering you?"

"Neither good nor bad. I am a noble archangel—I have no emotions toward humans."

"Is that so?"

Gorphin reminisced about Ikael—getting angry, annoyed, flustered, and sometimes... even smiling.

"Well, history belongs to the victors. Record it however you want. But make sure to write truthfully about the part where I was handsome."

"Is that all for your last words?"

Gorphin looked up at the sky and fell into thought, but it was a burden he didn't want to impose on anyone.

"Yes."

Fire flashed in Ikael's eyes.

"Arrogant to the very end. Even though you nearly succeeded in defeating a god with a human body, you have nothing to leave for posterity?"

"What can I do? I took a solid hit."

Ikael spread his wings and shot forward at tremendous speed, his hand-blade raised like a sword.

The hand-blade stopped right in front of his eyes, and Gorphin asked, calmly looking at her fingertips:

"What's wrong? Did you really grow fond of me?"

"Shut up."

Though this was the moment he'd dreamed of his entire life, now that it had arrived, everything felt confusing.

"Surrender."

Ikael said:

"It's not too late even now. Raise the white flag and surrender. I'll take responsibility and protect you all."

"I told you I don't want to."

"Get a grip! I said I'd help you! I'll even record it in history as a draw."

Gorphin didn't blink an eye.

"Do you like me?"

"Don't talk nonsense. I'm not doing this because I like you. If you die, that Hexa..."

The possibility that everyone could be linked.

"Are you really going to end it like this? Was your mercy in watching over the world only this much?"

"It's impossible."

A hexagonal Hexa floated above Gorphin's palm with a clear sound.

"Hexa is a signal that comes down from higher dimensions to lower dimensions. Just like Idea. But to link you all, it would have to go in reverse—sending a signal from lower dimensions to higher dimensions."

"It's incredibly difficult. Like a drawing breaking through paper and jumping into reality."

Ikael's eyes wavered.

"Impossible?"

"However."

Gorphin pointed to the holy light body.

"If we could amplify Hexa's signal infinitely with Ataraxia, that might be different."

Examining the possibility with an archangel's senses, Ikael shook his head gloomily.

"No. They can't combine. Even if everything were amplified, Hexa is a signal that exists outside the law."

"We can't be certain."

"Hm?"

As Ikael blinked, Gorphin extended the Hexa toward the holy light body.

"Shall we try?"
