[507] The Backlash of Evil (1)

After confirming that Satiel had been blown away, Ikael examined Shirone.

He was hunched over with his waist bent and both arms hanging limply.

Though his body was standing, his mind seemed to already be lying down, and there was no spark of life in his eyes.

"Shirone."

Ikael flew toward Shirone as he slowly began to collapse forward.

But before she could reach him, someone ran over and caught Shirone.

It was Flew, who had been unable to step forward in the face of combat that transcended human limits.

"Shirone! Get a hold of yourself, Shirone!"

Flew placed Shirone's face on her lap and patted his cheeks, but he didn't move even slightly, like a corpse.

The massive flash of the Photon Cannon had been so intense that even Flew, who had been away from the battlefield, felt as if she were seeing it right before her eyes.

She couldn't know what method he had used to draw out such power, but one thing was certain: in the world of magic, there was no reward without a price.

When Shirone showed no signs of regaining consciousness, Flew finally turned her head and glared at Ikael.

"What happened? Why won't Shirone wake up!"

Even facing an archangel, Flew felt no fear.

This was partly because her mind had also reached its breaking point, leaving only evil behind, but it was also because she couldn't detect even the slightest malice in Ikael's aura.

Rather, Ikael was looking at Shirone with more worried eyes than anyone else.

'Shirone...'

From the moment he cast Ataraxia through close combat, his mind had already been shattered to pieces.

But by reaching the state of Prajna, he had postponed the mental explosion.

If he had stopped there, perhaps there might have been some hope.

"Shirone defeated Faiel through Ikasa's judicial halo, Valhalla Action. He's currently paying the price for that."

"Valhalla Action?"

Flew looked back at Shirone with surprised eyes.

Considering the scale of the final Photon Cannon, the price Shirone had to pay was unimaginably large.

"How long... will he have to remain in this state?"

Ikael shook her head.

No one could know except for the calculation trigger called Valhalla Action.

"I don't know, but it will be much longer than you think. Fifty years, a hundred years, perhaps even two hundred years."

Annoyance filled Flew's eyes as she looked back at Ikael.

Was an angel really saying such a thing?

"Two hundred years? Shirone is human. Humans can't live that long. Then the magic shouldn't have been cast in the first place!"

That was certainly true.

If the result couldn't be reached, the cause shouldn't have existed either.

But conversely, one could also say that since the calculation determined that the result could eventually be reached, the cause was established.

"Valhalla Action is merely a trigger that mediates the Akashic Records. According to human common sense, cause should precede effect, but Valhalla Action reverses that logic. In such cases, we must consider that since the result has appeared, the cause is also possible."

Though it was still infuriating to hear, Flew was not a foolish mage either.

"Then what if Shirone dies of old age? No, what if he's killed before that? The result has already appeared, so how can the cause change?"

"I don't know. But that is the Akashic Records. Changes in parts have no meaning to the whole. No matter how parts change, the whole is always perfect. If Shirone dies, some kind of change will occur. But even that would be meaningless to the whole."

"God is indifferent, is that it?"

Though the angel's god and Flew's god were different concepts, Ikael nodded.

Only living beings assign meaning to things like a lover's death, incurable diseases, or heinous crimes.

To the whole, Shirone's death would be an event of exactly the same weight as a pebble rolling once in some mountain.

"That's right. And perhaps... that might be one of the ways to get Shirone back."

Flew's eyes lit up.

"What do you mean?"

Ikael shook her head again.

Without knowing what calculation Valhalla Action had performed, even an archangel couldn't know.

She just wanted to convey that it was a matter of that level.

"Unfortunately, it's beyond my capabilities. But Shirone is human, so ultimately it's an answer that humans must find. Isn't it human nature to endlessly seek answers even in despair?"

Flew was about to shout something but closed her mouth and looked down at Shirone's face with a dejected expression.

Ikael was equally sorrowful.

'This is truly regrettable.'

Perhaps... if he had progressed normally through time, Shirone might have found a way to subdue Faiel within about ten years.

The Shirone that Ikael observed had that much potential.

But there are no hypotheticals in the Akashic Records.

That's why Valhalla Action must have calculated the time when Shirone could absolutely reach that level and demanded it as payment.

While it was difficult for human lifespan to exceed a hundred years, it wasn't impossible.

After all, there were countless beings in Shehakim who were over a thousand years old.

"For now, there's no need to worry. He reached the state of Prajna and prevented the explosion. Valhalla Action cannot put debtors of desire into an unpayable (moratorium) state."

At the news that he wouldn't die anyway, Flew set aside her worries for now.

Though it wasn't easy, there were currently mountains of other concerns.

"Gasp!"

At that moment, reaching some thought, she looked back at Ikael and spoke.

Even by sensory perception, quite some time had passed.

Carrying anxiety that it might already be too late, she shouted.

"This is terrible! God's punishment...!"

Ikael, who had been focused entirely on Shirone, also hurriedly looked up at the sky.

Her eyes filled with shock as she surveyed the heavens with her gaze.

"Oh no..."

Gaold was surrounded by fallen angels, being attacked like prey.

Already unconscious and only swinging his hands, the angels with fierce eyes around him repeated attacks and retreats, gradually cutting off his breath.

They weren't employing this strategy simply to torment Gaold.

It was fear.

The memory of him invading Rakia and slaughtering countless fallen angels and Maras made them hesitate even to approach Gaold.

But Kang Nan's heart, watching this scene from atop the castle wall, felt torn into a thousand pieces.

"Aaaaah!"

The more this happened, the more she poured her strength into breaking her own wrists.

Crack! Crunch!

With each swing of her arms accompanied by scream-like battle cries, her palm bones gradually crumbled.

Divine Transcendence.

Yaksha.

That's how Uriel defined Kang Nan's state.

Those who burn their will with the power of anger to change the laws of their flesh.

Gaold's pain seeped entirely into Kang Nan's rage, making her will even stronger.

Crunch! Crunch!

Finally, as all her palm bones crumbled, Kang Nan's broken fists broke free from <Self-Harm>.

Though her body, tormented by pain all night, could barely take a single step, Kang Nan burst into sorrowful tears and fell from the castle wall.

Landing somewhere between a landing and a crash, she crawled for a while before getting up again and walking toward Gaold.

"Uncle... Uncle..."

"Kraaaak! Kraaak!"

Gaold flailed his hands without even knowing Kang Nan was approaching.

His consciousness, memory, and thoughts had already flown away.

What moved him was only the flash called pain that flickered in the darkness.

Following that light, he spun his body and snatched at the air, and watching this made her feel sick to her stomach.

"Uncleeeee..."

Kang Nan approached with her two broken fists hanging limply at her sides.

'It's okay if you love Miro. It's okay if you don't come to me.'

Because she knew what he was fighting for.

'It's okay if you don't know how hard it was for me. So...'

Kang Nan embraced Gaold's waist.

Then, surprisingly, the flailing of the unconscious Gaold stopped.

"So..."

Kang Nan shed hot tears and raised her head.

"Don't be in pain. I'll do all the fighting, so please don't be in pain."

"Now's our chance!"

As Gaold's agitation subsided, the fallen angels mustered courage and all rushed in.

If they didn't eliminate him now, they didn't know how long they'd have to maintain this blood-draining standoff.

Just as Kang Nan flinched and glared at the approaching enemies, she heard Gaold's weak but clear voice from above her head.

"Mutt..."

"Uncle!"

Kang Nan looked back at Gaold with surprised eyes.

Though his face was so weakened compared to before coming to heaven that he could be called a corpse, he was still wearing that wonderful smile.

"Are you okay? Have you come to your senses?"

"...You're keeping the house well."

Kang Nan burst into tears.

Even in a situation where his mind had already fallen into hell, he had crawled up to convey these words.

From that deep, deep abyss, he had pulled this out to see her one last time.

"No, Uncle! Don't go! Don't leave me behind!"

"Strike down heaven's enemy! We must finish this in one blow!"

Turning his head, Gaold looked at the fallen angels surging toward him and grotesquely split his lips.

"Kekeke."

Pain amplified by 100 million times? 1 billion times? 10 billion, 100 billion times?

'Who cares?'

"No! Uncle! Don't do that!"

"Pain and such..."

Gaold looked down at Kang Nan and stroked her head.

As if trying to carve his voice directly into her mind.

"It's just sensation."

Air Pressing.

Whoooooooooooooooong!

The moment a rich, heavy sound without form exploded, the ground shook as if an earthquake had occurred.

And then there was nothing.

"Waaaah! Waaaah!"

Kang Nan wailed in the arms of Gaold, who had cast magic and then collapsed to his knees.

Though Gaold's appearance with closed eyes and a smile looked peaceful, the price he had to pay to show that one smile was the deep, deep fires of hell's pit.

"Waaaaaaah! Uncle!"

Uriel, remaining on the castle wall, watched this scene with her arms crossed.

What she had to confirm by following Kariel like a duty was her final understanding of humans.

'Is that... human?'

In the end, Gaold had erased Rakia.

One human had swept away all the fallen angels and their Maras.

'Humans' endless, mad obsession.'

Gaold was neither Prajna nor Yaksha.

So that wouldn't be all of humanity.

But that was certainly an extreme of something humans possessed.

'Should I eliminate him now?'

Uriel summoned Paradise Lost.

"..."

And she took in the sight of his miserable state after fighting countless powerful enemies and losing everything.

Angels' activities are forbidden.

Ra's command that she couldn't understand at first.

But now Uriel understood exactly how the situation was unfolding.

'It would be better to eliminate him if possible, but...'

On the other hand, she also felt like leaving him as he was.

The finishing opportunity obtained by the total mobilization of forces in Rakia.

But that was a method that didn't suit Uriel, the Archangel of Destruction, at all.

Kukukukukukuku!

As Uriel spread her wings of light, the castle wall shook.

"Satan."

The strongest enemy in heaven at this moment.

Slowly rising above the castle wall, Uriel transformed into a flash of light and flew toward the center of Jebul.

"Waaaah! Waaaah!"

Kang Nan's screams seeped into the silence of Rakia.
