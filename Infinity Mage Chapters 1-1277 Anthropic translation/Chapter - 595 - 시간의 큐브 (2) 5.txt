[595] Cube of Time (2)

Yolga's face turned white as she looked down at the young life that had died in her arms.

"What...!"

Everyone turned their heads in shock to see Lukang, with one arm crushed, standing against the wall with his hand pressed against it.

"Who are you?"

Yolga recognized Lukang, but his temperament was so murky that she couldn't believe this was the same person she had seen just moments ago.

His bloodshot eyes were unfocused, and his entire body was covered in blood.

"Heh, heheheh."

He spat out a gush of blood and collapsed, painting the wall with blood as he fell.

"Now... I can go home."

"Hexaaaaaa!"

Miro screamed and ran over to retrieve the child's corpse, but having taken a direct hit from the chain sickle, it was already beyond revival.

In shock, she turned her head to see Shirone also standing there with a pale, ashen face.

Hexa was dead.

'Then what about me?'

Looking down at his palm, he saw that his naturally colored skin was turning gray.

He was dying.

The monochrome coloring confirmed it, and Shirone felt dizzy and staggered.

"I'm dying. I'm dy—"

"Get a hold of yourself!"

Miro ran over and grabbed Shirone's shoulder.

"It's not over yet!"

"But I'm dead. I'm—"

"Listen carefully. A closed curve cannot separate cause and effect. For the event that just happened to conclude, time must complete one full cycle."

Hearing that, Shirone suddenly snapped back to his senses.

'I can change the event.'

"Go move Estas. Don't let Yolga and me meet. Got it?"

Shirone immediately nodded and launched himself forward.

Watching him disappear into the distance, Miro glared at Yolga.

"Are you satisfied now?"

If asked whether she was satisfied, it wasn't a disappointing result.

Still, what puzzled her was Lukang's appearance.

"How was he still alive?"

"The events are overlapping."

Mustang said.

"New events are rushing in before the existing event completes one full cycle. It's proof that space is collapsing."

If the event where Lukang didn't die had rushed in faster than before, it meant the same could be true for Hexa.

"Nothing is over yet."

Only then did Yolga turn to look at Miro with sharp eyes.

"Damn it! What the hell is going on?"

Raikon descended the stairs, avoiding the rushing Martian forces.

Still, Martians were spread throughout every room.

'This is completely different from what Fermi said.'

As Estas changed its structure repeatedly, his route was becoming increasingly complicated.

"Who is that bastard?"

When Martian Squad 4 blocked his path ahead, Raikon immediately launched himself into the side passage.

'I'd like to fight them if I could...'

It would be meaningless.

Most importantly, he had the <Last Cry of the Yeager Family> on him.

A single-use object.

If he found himself in danger even once, the object's ability would activate, and he would lose 10 billion gold before he could even replicate it.

'This thing is more trouble than it's worth.'

Normally it would be a precious item that saves the bearer's life, but for Raikon right now, that very feature was getting in his way.

'Almost there!'

Raikon ran at top speed toward the end of the corridor visible in the distance.

It was the warehouse where the vault Fermi had designated was located.

Failure, failure again.

Within the complexly moving warehouse of Estas, Shirone encountered countless events but couldn't reach the space he wanted.

"There he is! Catch him!"

"Be careful! He's strong!"

Martian Captain Nickel gripped a longsword, standard issue for Tormia's military, and charged forward.

His skill was first-rate, each sword technique he unleashed flying toward Shirone's throat.

'Rampage!'

A curtain of light exploded, pushing back the Martian soldiers at equal distances.

Photon cannons shot out and the flashes of Shotgun Movement painted the corridor.

"Got you!"

Just as Nickel, who had persistently followed Shirone, swung his sword, two tentacles caught the blade.

"Grrk!"

Then two more tentacles struck him squarely in the abdomen.

Nickel's eyes widened as blood spurted from his mouth, and his subordinates' faces turned pale.

"Captain!"

'I don't have time for this...'

Shirone desperately drew up his mental strength.

"...at all!"

Elision broke down the boundaries of the Spirit Zone, and photon cannon flashes wove like a net throughout the entire corridor.

"Aaaahhhhh!"

As if shaking off the soldiers' screams, Shirone turned and cast Invisible again.

As the time period changed, the Martian forces disappeared.

"Hurry! Hurry!"

Shirone had already bypassed space seven times, but the timeline was too complex, and no matter what method he used, he couldn't prevent Hexa's death.

'The problem is the man with the chain sickle. Miro definitely succeeded in her mission. Something I didn't perceive got tangled up.'

As his thoughts concluded, he could see the engine room in the distance.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 57 minutes.

Space: Estas Warehouse 9.

'That's it.'

Opening the warehouse door and entering, Anchal suddenly popped out.

"Shirone?"

"Anchal!"

Shirone looked around and then ran to her.

"Have you been waiting here all this time?"

"No, I just arrived. What's going on?"

Shirone bit his lip and walked to the control device.

"I failed. The events keep changing and I can't prevent it no matter what."

"What are you talking about?"

As time passed, Shirone's heart grew more anxious.

Once the closed curve's time completed one full cycle, the event of Hexa's death would conclude, and when that happened, everything would be over.

"Damn it! What should I do? How can I..."

He had already operated the device seven times, but couldn't overcome the event of Hexa's death.

'I need to attach the Supernatural Psychic Research Society to Room 36. Then bypass Room 11 and go around...'

Failure.

Martians were already waiting there.

'Right, I should attach Room 55 upward instead. If I make a big detour in time from there, I can start over from the beginning...'

Anchal approached and pulled Shirone's shoulder.

"What are you doing? You said it was dangerous to twist events."

"Everyone's going to die anyway!"

Shirone was nothing but frustrated.

"I have to turn it back. I have to—"

"Tell me what happened. I haven't encountered any events yet."

"It's my mistake. I shouldn't have let Yolga meet Miro from the beginning."

"What?"

"Hexa. I died. I'm going to disappear soon too. I have to save myself within that."

As Estas stopped operating, Shirone turned and said.

"Help me! This way!"

Anchal still didn't understand but had no choice but to follow.

"Tch! What the hell is going on?"

This was the eighth attempt.

The exact time was impossible to determine, but Shirone had the intuition that this would be his last chance.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 0 hours 58 minutes.

Space: Estas Warehouse 65.

As space became tangled up chaotically, the closed curve events continued to overlap, and Lukang was shocked to see himself dying with his lower body crushed.

"Wh-what is this?"

The Lukang leaning against the wall was equally surprised.

"Am I dreaming? Grrk!"

Blood poured from Lukang's lower abdomen.

It was definitely himself, but in its destroyed form, he couldn't find even a trace of familiarity.

'This is hell.'

Lukang realized only one thing.

"I have to get out."

"Huh? A survivor..."

The warehouse door opened and Yolga and her companions entered.

"No, not a survivor."

Mustang stopped Yolga.

Lukang with his lower body crushed and another Lukang with his right arm crushed were facing each other.

"How did this happen?"

"The events are overlapping. It's probably not unrelated to Estas's changes."

"Damn Yolga!"

The collapsed Lukang spat out curses.

"This is all because of you! You're the one who made us like this!"

As always, Yolga bowed her head this time too.

"I'm sorry. I have no words to say."

Just like that, Lukang died, and the Lukang with the crushed right arm approached Yolga.

"What's going on? Why am I dead!"

"..."

"Answer me! Why did you bring us to such a horrible place!"

There was no way Yolga could know.

But her insight would traverse countless times and variables to reach some blind conclusion.

"Do you want to get out of here?"

"Don't talk nonsense! I know that once you enter, you can't leave!"

"There is a way."

Lukang, who was about to attack desperately, stopped dead in his tracks.

"There's... a way?"

After thinking for a moment, Yolga nodded as if she had gained certainty.

"Due to some variable, you have escaped from the event of death. So from now on, follow me. And..."

Yolga squeezed her eyes shut.

Wisdom

Paramita.

"When you get the chance, do what you must."

That was the natural order.

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 32 minutes.

Space: Estas Warehouse 13.

'Finally arrived!'

Opening the warehouse door and entering, he saw Miro holding Hexa and panting after wiping out the Martian forces.

"Who are you guys?"

Miro was extremely wary, but Shirone didn't have time to explain everything.

"It's a long story! We have to go now!"

"What are you talking about?"

"Guffin's Door! If we don't arrive faster than any other event, Hexa will die!"

She had already been puzzled by Hexa's fading presence.

"So it was you guys! Why did you enter Estas anyway? Don't you know what this place is?"

Anchal said.

"We entered because we know. The situation is serious. We came from a world that has already experienced three resets. We need information from the upper levels."

Miro understood immediately.

"Fine! Guide us quickly! There's no time!"

Shirone immediately turned and ran toward the Supernatural Psychic Research Society, taking Miro and Anchal with him.

Since he had manipulated the warehouse, he knew the way perfectly.

Also, having encountered numerous events, he could bypass places where Martian units were stationed.

'This action will twist the events once again.'

According to the original events, many more battles should have been fought before Miro reached the Supernatural Psychic Research Society, but by avoiding them through Shirone's guidance, the events themselves would change again.

"We're here!"

<Event Coordinates>

Time: 1 hour 40 minutes.

Space: Supernatural Psychic Research Society.

Having arrived 8 minutes earlier than the previous events, Shirone looked around.

Since he couldn't reverse the event of meeting Yolga, she would somehow arrive here.

However, since he had advanced the time, he could prevent contact with Miro.

'Good. Success!'

Miro, who had entered the research society, looked at the activated Guffin's Door and said.

"From now on, we're going to another space through the dimensional door."

Miro held Hexa even tighter.

"What's in the other space?"

"A sacrifice. You could call it a scapegoat."

She had no desire to make excuses.

That was Guffin's will.

"To save the world, someone has to sacrifice. And beyond this door is the sacrifice for cosmic reset."

This was why Miro couldn't tell Yolga the truth.

'Yolga could never do it. I have to do it.'

Only an individual can sacrifice for the whole.

If the mission succeeded, today's events would be completely forgotten, but her life would unfold by paying a price anyway.

Miro looked back at Shirone in front of the door.

"You're Hexa?"

The fact that Shirone's body was becoming transparent over time was proof.

"Yes."

"Want to see for yourself? You have the right."

"I'm going too."

When Anchal spoke, Miro nodded as if it didn't matter and headed toward Guffin's Door.

After Miro passed through the light barrier and disappeared, Shirone also glanced at Anchal once before pushing his body into Guffin's Door.

White light filled his retina, then a night scene unfolded... and he could hear mountain birds crying in the distance.
