[705] Desert God (4)

Southern Akard Desert.

Withstanding the sandstorm of Noscarta was the pyramid of the most famous archmage in the Paras Kingdom.

Zulu's dungeon was a void space where countless adventurers stopped by to seek the secrets of death.

But currently, it reeked of human presence due to cohabitation with unwelcome guests.

Gangnan, her hair tightly pulled back, entered the great hall carrying a basket of wet laundry.

She could feel the vibrations of the pyramid shaking from Noscarta, and it was getting stronger with time.

"Is there anything else you need me to do?"

Zulu sat in the corner like a soulless doll with a pacifier in her mouth, just blinking her eyes.

"......"

She didn't read books, had no hobbies.

Except for the minimal food needed to sustain life, she put nothing else in her mouth, filling most of her time with emptiness.

"I don't remember asking you to do anything."

Gangnan said while hanging laundry on the drying rack.

"Aren't you bored? Sitting there blankly all day like that."

"Without a heart, there is no time."

It was fitting words from one who had reached the extreme of desirelessness.

"Tell me if you need anything."

Wiping her hands with a towel and walking to the bed, she looked pitifully at Gaold, who showed no signs of waking up.

His once robust body had withered like a skeleton, and his beard, which he had given up grooming at some point, had grown down to his chin.

'Won't you wake up now?'

Porridge was always prepared beside Gaold, and Gangnan spooned some into his mouth.

"He's getting thinner. At this rate, he might really..."

"He won't die."

Gangnan turned her head with a brightened expression.

"Do you think so?"

"He should have died already under normal circumstances."

"......"

"If he has transcended the phenomenon of death, then Gaold's end won't be death. It would be something more serious than that."

"He'll come back. Because here there is..."

Gangnan bit her lip and said.

"A maze."

This time Zulu didn't argue either.

"Perhaps then he might transcend even the maze."

Knowing how persistently Gaold pursued strength, it was a contradictory feeling of hoping for it while also feeling sad.

'Just wake up first. Then I can fight too.'

Grrrrrrrr.

The ceiling shook and a wind sound like the crying of the dead was clearly transmitted along the walls.

"It's really tremendous. Just how big must the pressure difference be for a storm to form in the middle of the continent?"

Whooooooo!

It sounded like Gaold's screaming.

"It's not wind, Gangnan."

Zulu pointed at the ceiling and said.

"The wheel of law. The ethics of this world operate at a much deeper level."

Vanguard was closed.

Welcoming the Maga Bandit Group that entered boldly, Momodo approached with her strongest subordinates.

"Welcome. I am Momodo, the 32nd administrator of Vanguard."

When the name of the most famous heroine in the central desert appeared, the vice-captain's eyes sharpened as he spoke.

"We stopped by briefly on business, so please cooperate."

Instead of answering, Momodo examined the woman beside the vice-captain.

With disheveled hair and loose clothing ties, she looked as if she had been assaulted and dragged here.

But just being near her transmitted a throbbing sensation like being beaten with fists - her aura was not normal.

'Is she really human?'

She prided herself on having met every bizarre human in the world, but this time she had to think differently.

This woman was the ultimate monster.

"You must know the situation. Until Noscarta passes, no violent acts of any kind are allowed in Vanguard..."

Baknyeo approached Momodo.

"I'm looking for Banya."

The moment she saw those beast-like eyes, her heart pounded as if it would burst, like prey pinned under a lion's belly.

'I'll die. I'm going to die.'

Fight or make way.

Faced with this binary choice, Momodo's decision was swift.

"Please enter. Just don't cause too much commotion."

Baknyeo moved without hesitation even among the armed men, and the vice-captain snorted at Momodo before following behind.

Shirone's group, having returned to their lodging, each took a bed in the corners except near the door.

"Phew, I'm tired. I think I drank too much."

"Hehe! But it was fun, wasn't it? We learned new facts after 20 years."

Rian laughed looking at Shirone's flushed face.

"What if she appears in your dreams? Shirone, how many pairs of underwear did you bring? Keep them next to you while sleeping."

"Shut up! You were just as dazed, so don't act like an adult!"

Kido, having stripped down to just ragged shorts, sat cross-legged on the bed.

"Whatever. You humans can handle your own affairs. I'm going to meditate, so don't bother me."

Though the goblin's body with its scrawny limbs and protruding belly looked unsightly, when he began breathing exercises, alcohol rapidly left his system and the smell of liquor spread.

"Kido, you..."

As Shirone, remembering the warning not to disturb him, closed his mouth, Kido's eyes sank into an even quieter state.

'It's incarnation technique.'

Despite his frivolous manner of speaking, the goblin incarnation rippling from Kido's body was surprisingly serene.

"Shirone, what do you think?"

Leaving Kido alone, Rian sat on his bed and asked.

"About the prophecy we heard today. Could that really be my end?"

"Are you still worried about that? The people at the tavern said it was a lie."

"But you know it's not a lie, don't you?"

Shirone slowly removed his robe as if delaying his answer.

"I think of law as rules. Countless gears meshing precisely to produce fixed results."

Uorin's History Search and La Enemy's event manipulation were possible because the gears of law applied to them.

"If Clarisse made a prophecy based on law, that really could be our end."

"...I see."

"But there's no predetermined future. Sibulsang Pokbae and your Denai are both acts that break the teeth of gears."

"They're just teeth though."

A few missing teeth wouldn't stop the gears from operating or bring different results.

Leaning back on his arms, Rian said.

"How enormous must it be? The gear wheel called fate."

It would probably be the size of the universe, and certainly not something that could be destroyed by mere Axing.

As the atmosphere grew solemn and they fell into thought, screams came from the end of the corridor.

"Kyaah! What is this! Suddenly barging in!"

The vice-captain stared blankly at the man and woman who had turned pale while covering themselves with blankets, then turned toward the next room.

'These ones aren't them.'

Though he didn't know their appearances, his skills weren't poor enough to fail to recognize Banya and Yaksha.

"What! How dare you barge into my room so rudely...!"

He slammed the door shut and his steps quickened.

'Where are they?'

Since the building's exterior was already surrounded by his subordinates, there should be nowhere to escape.

"This is the last room."

At his subordinate's words, the vice-captain spent a long time sensing the atmosphere inside the room before raising his fist to pound on the door.

"Are you there?"

No answer came.

"It's urgent business. Please open the door."

Still not even a sound, so his face contorted like a beast and he kicked the door to pieces.

"When someone calls you... Huh?"

A flash of light struck him.

"Ugh!"

The vice-captain hastily leaned back but couldn't overcome the momentum, lifting both feet and spinning around.

As the Photon Cannon that grazed past struck the wall behind him, his subordinates rushed into the room.

"Kiiiii!"

Kido rolled across the floor unleashing Blade Hell, but felt no contact with his blade tips.

Confirming the scattered bandit group, Kido bounced his back to flip his body and landed in a prone position.

"Be careful. These guys are incredibly strong."

Shirone was also gauging their skill from the man who had dodged the Photon Cannon at close range.

"Get out! Let's fight outside!"

"Iyaaaah!"

Rian swung his great sword to tear away an entire wall.

"Catch them! Don't let them escape!"

Kido went outside the railing and climbed up the wall, while Rian and Shirone each leaped in opposite directions.

'I need to call Ratusa.'

Running down the corridor and looking left and right, he saw the perfectly sealed Vanguard landscape.

'Then where to?'

At the chilling killing intent, he whipped his head around to see a sword blade rushing forward, seeming to hold flames as it reflected the torchlight.

'I have to dodge...!'

He tried to lean back with Armand's reflexes, but his heart felt like it would burst from frustration.

'I'm hit!'

A clear, clean wind sound followed as Shirone's neck fell off with a thud.

This all happened in one second.

"Hah! Hah!"

Shirone, who had retreated 10 meters through teleportation, looked ahead while supporting himself with his hand on the ground.

The violent motion had twisted her clothing, revealing the form of a woman whose body was completely constrained.

"You... Ugh!"

Belatedly, a shockwave burst from his chest.

When Shirone looked down, he saw Armand's chest plate had a silver scar-like mark from Ringer's armor plate.

'I couldn't dodge it?'

Probably wind pressure.

But looking at the metallic wound, he couldn't believe it was made by wind.

"Sibulsang, huh."

At Baknyeo's voice, having grasped the level of his senses from his reaction to one sword strike, Shirone looked up.

"What are you? Why are you attacking us?"

"The Ten Elders Council was conflicted."

'Ten Elders Council?'

"Whether you come first, or Ankera comes first."

"I don't understand. Why would the Ten Elders Council?"

"Shura reported to Amita. You cannot achieve Gung. Therefore, we..."

As Baknyeo lowered her stance, a whirlwind arose.

"Follow Ankera."

As Baknyeo's form disappeared from view, Shirone activated Sibulsang Pokbae without even looking around.

'How is she so fast!'

But as time passed, the sword blade's movement accelerated, and eventually he couldn't sense the sword's trajectory even with Sibulsang sense.

"Die."

Axing

Nirvana E

Engine (Nirvana Power Inline 8-cylinder).

As the cylinders of law granted power to a single motion, the sword struck down like lightning toward Shirone's crown.

The floor exploded with a roar, and in the rising smoke, Baknyeo remained motionless for a long while.

'How?'

It was a result that even her monstrous senses couldn't capture.

'I couldn't see it?'

Before she knew it, Shirone had moved behind her and was taking a fighting stance while panting.

'Magic?'

As Baknyeo kicked off the ground for confirmation, Shirone's body disappeared like a ghost passing through the corridor floor.

'Unpleasant.'

The unknown was always unpleasant.

"Grrrr!"

Baknyeo, cycling at tremendous speed, struck the floor and created a huge hole.

Upon landing, what entered her view was Shirone heading outside while ignoring all physical barriers.

"No way."

Baknyeo's pupils shook with shock.

"Gongpa (Void Break)?"

The reason space could be destroyed was because the terrain of the real world and the reverse world were different.

Paths blocked by barriers in reality had no barriers in the reverse world, allowing breakthrough via the shortest route.

"If it didn't end at Sibulsang..."

The underground here might be a basement in the reverse world, and the sky might be the rooftop of a tall building.

"A little closer to the ultimate."

The moment Baknyeo's muttering ended, Shirone burst through the ceiling and turned toward her while casting Shining magic.

'Good. I can fight with this.'

The first ability he developed through Uorin's advice was the seventh sense that utilized routes in both the real and reverse worlds.

Bakjigyeong

Chogni Bardo (Border of Life and Death).

In other words, the boundary between this world and the next.
