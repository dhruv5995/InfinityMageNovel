[789] Windless Zone (2)

Every time Arachne's dancers performed, their feather decorations swayed dazzlingly.

In the mesmerizing spectacle, someone suddenly approached Shirone's side.

"Truly... is it not beautiful?"

It was a man in his thirties with hair sticking out like a magpie's nest and a sparse, patchy beard.

"Ah, yes."

"I've watched this competition without fail since I was old enough to afford travel expenses. Does it please the eyes? It pleases the brain. If only it didn't have one drawback."

"A drawback?"

The man spoke with a sad expression.

"I can't get married."

As Shirone tried to leave, the man grabbed his arm and pulled him close, whispering.

"It's not just beautiful. The women participating in this competition possess intellect, virtue, and beauty - they're the finest bride material. So how could I ever get married? Everyone tells me to wake up from my dreams, but aren't dreams meant to be dreamed?"

The self-proclaimed beauty pageant maniac seemed to have faced many injustices in life.

"Do you know what my dream is? Amazingly realistic, actually. To go on a date with one of those women. I've even started a savings account."

Shirone felt he'd gotten caught up with the wrong person.

"They appear in my dreams every night. If I could date the most beautiful woman, I'd be happy to die that day. This is my dream! The most magnificent dream a man can have!"

"Excuse me, I have some urgent business..."

"You must come to the competition. Take this."

As the man opened his crossbody bag's zipper and rummaged around, Shirone waved his hands dismissively.

"No, you don't need to do that."

It seemed like he was trying to give him an entry ticket, but Shirone could enter anytime he wanted.

"Here, take it."

What the man pulled out wasn't a ticket, but a competition flyer that could be picked up anywhere on the street.

"...Ah, yes. Thank you."

The man turned mechanically, cupped his hands around his mouth, and shouted at the parade.

"I love you! Miss MÃ¤rchen!"

Shirone quietly slipped away to a secluded spot and stuck out his tongue.

'There really are all kinds of people in the world.'

On his way to the royal castle, he looked at the flyer and saw portraits of past winners.

'Wow, they really are beautiful.'

While human charm comes in all varieties, their appearance certainly had something uniquely outstanding.

"Huh?"

But what caught Shirone's attention wasn't the portraits, but the list of invited singers from various countries.

"Maya?"

Even squinting and looking closely, the name of the singer from Tormia was indeed Maya.

'Come to think of it...'

Remembering Iruki's words about signing with a famous agency, he finally became interested in the competition.

'I should check this out.'

If it really was the Maya he knew, he was thinking of making time to visit.

'I hope it's Maya.'

With such expectations, he started walking again when commotion broke out at the far end of the parade.

"Abolish the beauty pageant!"

People in black masks and black clothes were holding up signs and staging a street protest.

"Don't commercialize human beauty! The Arachne government must immediately repatriate the participants!"

Just from the slogans, it was clear what was happening.

'It's chaos here too.'

Tormia also had beauty pageants, and critical voices were consistently heard during such events.

'I understand the sentiment, but...'

What Shirone had realized in life was that there are truly many people living in the world, and finding a system that can satisfy them all is extremely difficult.

"Ugh, my head hurts."

Humanity.

Wasn't this the homework that neither Buddha nor Yahweh could solve?

The administrators who had worked overtime at the Arachne royal castle were all hoarse from screaming since dawn.

"Hurry! There's still dust over there!"

The reason for the record-breaking castle cleaning was intelligence that one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower was coming.

'This is killing me! Even when kings from other countries visited, we weren't worked this hard.'

From the lowest ranks to nobles, everyone without exception held dusters, and the maids were drenched in sweat.

"Ugh!"

Those who avoided the labor were few, but their mental stress could be considered even worse.

"Why does a Star have to come, of all people?"

King Paronica of Arachne, who was waiting in the Grand Hall while adjusting his attire, struck the armrest.

With golden earrings hanging down to his shoulders, he had a stern appearance that combined both continental and southern bloodlines.

"Your Majesty, please be patient. The Five Great Stars are not easily received dignitaries. Doesn't it also have symbolic meaning?"

Although belonging to the Seven Kingdoms, Arachne wasn't notably more powerful than other nations.

The ten island kingdoms were bound together under the name 'Cartesia,' and Arachne was merely their representative.

"That may be so, but..."

Therefore, a Five Great Star coming to Arachne would be good prestige for the other ten island kingdoms.

"I'm a practical person."

Everyone knew that the Holy War's Valkyries were fiercely blocking the Gustav Empire's expansion.

'It's probably about the war.'

If the Holy War directly intervened, they could demand appropriate compensation.

'That's why they deliberately sent a Star. This way, there's no benefit our country can gain, is there?'

Uorin is a penny-pincher.

"Moreover..."

The administrator reported again.

"The kingdom's biggest event is currently at risk of being disrupted. Setting aside other matters, if it's a Five Great Star, shouldn't we gain something?"

"Are you talking about the terrorist threats? Hmm."

"From what I hear, the Star called Shirone isn't as strict as other Stars. There are rumors that he received a massive sum from South Eymond and gained governing rights over North Eymond. This suggests he's not entirely without material desires."

"But the situation is different from South Eymond. We can't pay such a large sum for just this matter."

"Of course not. So how about providing something other than money to win his favor?"

"Something else... I see. Would it be possible?"

The administrator smiled with his eyes.

"Leave it to me."

The administrator who left the Grand Hall headed to the office of the chief administrator hosting the World Beauty Pageant.

"Welcome, Administrator. You must be busy with official duties, yet you've come all this way..."

"I came because I have a request."

First, he felt uneasy.

"A request, you say...?"

"Miss Arachne, Barho Rangi. We need to use that child for something important."

The uneasiness became reality.

"...The Ivory Tower's Star?"

"I like that you understand quickly."

The administrator shook his head.

"That's not the issue. Having Miss Arachne entertain foreign dignitaries would diminish our national dignity."

"Who do you think made that Miss Arachne? It's His Majesty's order. Prepare her immediately and send her."

"Couldn't it be another woman? There's never been a case of Miss Arachne entertaining before. She's a child who endured all sorts of hardships looking forward to just this."

"Listen here, Administrator."

The administrator's shoulders flinched at the chief administrator's gaze.

"Am I telling you to die? Am I asking you to pluck a star from the sky? What's impossible about something humans can do! Do you need a knife to your throat to come to your senses!"

The administrator bit his lips and bowed his head.

"I'll try my best to persuade her. But if she refuses even after talking..."

The chief administrator turned coldly and opened the door.

"It would be better to listen when words are still being used."

Shirone, who arrived at the royal castle, entered the Grand Hall while receiving greetings from high officials.

"Welcome, great Star of Intelligence."

When Paronica rose from his seat, his large frame, a head taller than Shirone, was clearly revealed.

"Yes, nice to meet you. I'm called Shirone."

Even the name he introduced was short, certainly different from other Stars.

"Haha! You truly have outstanding spirit. Come this way. We've prepared a modest banquet."

While all kinds of food were laid out on a 10-meter-long table, only two people were enjoying the banquet.

Since nitpicking every small detail would be endless, Shirone sat down without a word.

"As you must have seen on your way here, a parade is currently in full swing. If you had given us advance notice, we would have come out to greet you."

"Not at all. I enjoyed watching something interesting after a long time. It seems like a wonderful festival."

Nothing was worse than fighting demons.

"That's fortunate. While each nation is troubled by the war with demons, we must live joyfully, especially at times like these."

The World Beauty Pageant was a cultural business that brought enormous profits to the Kingdom of Arachne.

"The reason I came here is..."

Getting straight to the point, Shirone conveyed most of the information except for classified details.

"I would like the Arachne government to cooperate in examining refugee records."

"Of course we should help. However, with just names and characteristics, it will take time. We'll need to review all refugee records from roughly the past 10 years."

"I don't have much time. How long will it take?"

"As you know, Arachne supports free asylum. Still, mobilizing all our personnel, we'll have it processed by tomorrow morning."

It was an acceptable timeframe, but it was suspicious that they would so readily share their national secrets.

'This is going too smoothly.'

In any case, since the Arachne side promised full support, waiting was the best strategy.

"You're free to use all of Vangol's facilities. We've reserved a hotel suite for you to stay in."

"Yes. Thank you for your consideration."

While Shirone traveled to the hotel by carriage, the World Beauty Pageant administrator arrived at Miss Arachne's lodging.

"Rangi, I'm coming in."

Opening the door, he found a beautiful woman who could be believed to be a brown angel, curling her eyelashes.

Miss Arachne, Barho Rangi.

Born into a mid-level military officer's family, she had studied history before entering this world as a talent.

"What's the matter, coming so suddenly?"

Looking at Rangi's indifferent face as she focused intently on her makeup, the administrator gave up on beating around the bush.

"You need to entertain someone."

The hand holding the mascara stopped abruptly, but that expression of the sky falling was all there was.

"Why? Did some foreign president arrive?"

The administrator gritted his teeth.

"If it were just a president, I wouldn't be doing this."

Rangi continued with her makeup.

"You can say no if you don't want to. No, of course you wouldn't want to. But I need to hear it directly before I can act."

"How do you plan to handle the aftermath?"

"You're Miss Arachne. If you refuse, no one can force you. The moment this gets out, the kingdom's major business would be disgraced."

Understanding the administrator's difficult situation, he sighed and turned around.

"Then I'll assume you're refusing..."

"I'll do it."

Rangi finished her makeup and stood up.

"Are you serious?"

"Why act surprised about being serious... I know better than anyone how scary political people can be. It's better to just squeeze my eyes shut and get through it."

Walking past the administrator, Rangi extended her hand.

"Where should I go? Give me the profile."

Ashamed that he had already prepared it, the administrator squeezed out his voice and handed over the documents.

"Since there's a competition, I requested that there be no injuries."

That was the extent of his consideration, and Rangi coldly curled her lips as she flipped through the file.

"Huh?"

Having expected someone of high imperial rank, she blinked as she looked at the profile.

"A mage?"
