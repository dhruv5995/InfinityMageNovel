[676] Radum's Secret (4)

"What's with that guy now?"

The members of Speed Killer and Mad Species glared at Shirone with displeasure.

Just how many times did their meal have to be interrupted?

If it hadn't been for the mage who had blown off Pedu's head in one strike, they would have already lost their minds.

"Joshua, Kargin. Are you okay?"

Since enemies were right nearby, the two quickly nodded their heads.

Shirone confirmed that Joshua's ankle was twisted and made eye contact with Marta.

'As expected, that one...'

She was the strongest sub-human here.

"Stand down."

"What? Stand down? Are you out of your mind?"

Goblins, whose fear threshold was far higher than humans, didn't get scared easily in any situation.

"There's no way we'd give up such delicious food, right?"

Shirone had once asked Flu if there wasn't a peaceful solution to be found.

At the time, her answer not to force his ideals on others had felt cold, but now he understood.

"You're all the same living beings."

Marta scowled as if insulted.

"I don't want to engage in meaningless killing. But I don't know how to save my comrades without fighting either."

"So what? Want us to beg for our lives?"

"Run away."

A Photon Cannon appeared above Shirone's palm.

"That makes it fair."

"Kook kook kook kook!"

Marta's shoulders shook with laughter.

"Hey, human. This is your first time doing this, isn't it?"

Shirone didn't answer.

"You think you're a dragon or something? How many species in the world do you think can negotiate with goblins? Just fight. Whether we live or die, we'll handle it ourselves."

Marta bared her fangs as she spoke.

"Go eat goblin shit."

As the members of Speed Killer and Mad Species charged simultaneously, Kargin, who was holding Joshua, squeezed his eyes shut.

"Hyaaah!"

A battle cry rang out from atop a building, and Rian, who had overcome gravity with his bare body, swung his great sword with a thud.

As four Pedu were sliced clean through, Marta clicked her tongue and charged forward.

"What's that supposed to be?"

As the goblin's characteristic swordsmanship unfolded, rolling on the ground and targeting ankles, Rian hastily stepped back.

'Definitely fast. So this is a goblin.'

In terms of speed alone, it surpassed Schema.

"Taha! Taha! Taha!"

As she rolled forward and slashed continuously, Rian began counterattacking by spinning his great sword with his wrist.

"Kik kik! Too slow, idiot!"

The moment Marta rolled on the floor to avoid the horizontally slashing great sword and aimed for Rian's ankle:

"Huh?"

Defying common sense, the sword's trajectory curved, and the great sword held in reverse grip struck down precisely on her torso.

"Kwaaaaak!"

Even pinned to the ground like a bug, she couldn't understand it.

'How...'

She had never even imagined swordsmanship where the trajectory could change mid-swing.

"Cockroaches are hard to catch."

Rian, who had forcibly reversed the sword's flow with Divine Transcendence, muttered while feeling the aching pain transmitted through both arms.

"Martaaaaa!"

Normally they would be terrified when their leader died, but the goblins' fighting power rose even more sharply.

"I'll stab you hundreds of times!"

Despite their bold declaration, the goblins charging from all directions suddenly stopped in unison.

The blood drained from their characteristic green faces, turning them a pale purple color resembling corpses.

"Wh-what is that?"

Centered around Shirone with his outstretched hand, the landscape began turning hellishly red.

Inside the scenery that formed a clear boundary with the real world, buildings could be seen beating like hearts.

"Come forth, Egor."

And from that hellish world, Egor, the Lord of Terror sitting on a dead horse, emerged dragging his spear.

"Lactas Sagaar Bero Dem."

After uttering his characteristic phrase, he thrust his blue flame spear into the ground, and blue lightning spread in concentric circles.

"Kwaaaaah!"

Landscapes of memories born from within flashed rapidly across the goblins' and Pedu's retinas.

Being naturally warlike species, the trauma they experienced was on a different level from humans.

"Uwaaaah! Just kill me! Kill me instead!"

Memories of their leader torturing them for fun when they were just born flashed through their minds as real pain.

"Damn it! Why am I seeing this stuff!"

When one goblin clawed at his own eyelids with sharp nails, blood streamed down.

What kind of sight could make a species that enjoyed the cruelest acts for fun gouge out their own eyes was something one didn't want to imagine.

For them it was an eternity, but in reality it was just an instant - phantoms of trauma flashing by.

Eventually, the sub-humans, overcome by fear, began screaming and scattering in all directions.

"How can this be..."

Kargin and Joshua gaped in shock.

They couldn't believe the sight of those creatures who had been treating them as mere food and cackling now wailing in terror.

"I told you to run away."

Homing Photon Cannons appeared around Shirone.

As the Seeker's lasers looked around and locked onto targets one by one, they curved in at terrifying speed.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

"The light is bending?"

Kargin bit his lips as he watched goblins and Pedu collapse, spilling their brains as if struck by iron balls in the head.

'It's on a different level. This wasn't a battlefield that street rats like us could fight on.'

He could finally understand why it was 100,000 gold, what it meant that there's no such thing as a free lunch.

Egor, who had been proudly looking down at the battlefield where enemies were annihilated, turned to Shirone and said:

"You summon me often."

Even in the other world, since the spatial domain was the same as reality, it would be hard to meet once they left Radum.

"Get back in. I'm not in the mood for jokes."

There could be no mercy in the magic of a mage with 90 percent Kar value, but his emotions were still human.

"...It's a matter of that world."

As he turned away from his sense of thin ice, the other world closed again and Egor's figure disappeared.

Shirone, who had calmed his mind with the Thoughtless breathing technique, jumped down from the building and looked at Kargin and Joshua.

What he newly realized was that for the first time since combat began, Shirone had moved from his position.

"How's your leg?"

"Ah... I'm fine."

He didn't look fine at all.

"Please bear with it a little. Let's go find the other members first. It would be better to treat it after that."

Since enemies could appear again at any time, Shirone turned around, but Kargin anxiously rolled his eyes.

"Um... Captain."

When Shirone turned back, Kargin knelt and pressed his forehead to the ground.

"Please! Let us go back!"

Joshua said with a bewildered expression:

"What are you suddenly talking about..."

But she too had to close her mouth after seeing Kargin's expression as he turned his head away with tears.

She could read his desperation to go together.

'He wants to live.'

He wanted to live desperately.

"I'll give back all the money I received! I'll pay the penalty too! Please let Joshua and me go!"

The reason for organizing the mercenary group was to unofficially infiltrate Ruptist into Radum anyway.

Nevertheless, since the mercenaries had also joined prepared to die, leaving now was a breach of contract.

"I know that mercenaries who betray once can't set foot in this business again. How will you pay the penalty?"

"That's..."

Did he think they would let him go easily since he was their benefactor who saved their lives?

At Shirone's cold response, just as his blood was running cold, Joshua crawled over on her broken ankle and prostrated herself flat.

"I'll do anything humanly possible to repay you. Please show mercy. I want to live."

'Hmm, there might be morale issues too.'

Such thoughts briefly crossed Rian's mind, but the decision was Shirone's to make anyway.

'Well, I'll keep fighting regardless.'

In some sense, he thought that a swordsman's life, where you only had to think about one thing, was also blessed.

When Rian deliberately stepped away to save face for the two, Shirone let out a big sigh and said:

"Go."

When permission was granted, Kargin and Joshua jerked their heads up to look at Shirone.

It wasn't the kind face they had expected, but it didn't contain emotions of reproach either.

"If you make it out of Radum safely, go find Brooks and write a new contract. Return the commission fee too."

Just the thought that they wouldn't die here made Kargin's heart swell as he bowed repeatedly.

"Thank you! Thank you so much!"

Shirone deliberately turned away coldly and flew up to the building, saying to Rian:

"Let's go."

Rian climbed the building by stepping on walls, following the rapidly distancing Shirone, and landed on the rooftop.

"Are you going to look for the other members too?"

"We have to."

Perhaps like Kargin and Joshua, they might say they want to leave Radum, but they were still strictly Shirone's members.

Shirone, who had been silently jumping over buildings, asked:

"...What do you think?"

"You know. Swords don't judge."

"Not as a sword, but as my friend Rian. Do you think it was foolish to send those two back?"

After maintaining silence for a moment, Rian chuckled.

"There's no way that's true, dummy."

The very idea that someone who doesn't know that even one person's life is precious could care for 10,000 lives is a delusion.

Shirone was Shirone through and through.

"What? What the hell is going on!"

Brooks, having received reports from his subordinates, hurriedly walked down the corridor.

Screams from the three-brained Venetia were leaking out from the room at the end of the corridor.

"Stop! Please stop it!"

When Brooks reached the room, his face turned pale seeing Venetia's eyes filled with madness.

"Hey! Get a grip! What's wrong!"

The time zone Brooks was in was the present.

"Wasn't this what you wanted?"

La Enemy speaking to Venetia was from the past.

"No! This isn't it!"

When La Enemy visited Brooks' mansion, Venetia had decided to face him directly.

"What are you plotting?"

Since she had given up her position as head of Spectrum, she thought there would be no reason to be used by him.

"How about seeing it directly?"

La Enemy's memories began flowing into the brain dedicated to Venetia's past.

'This is...'

An incident.

La Enemy's story from the distant past that couldn't even be called history.

"Kyaaaaaak!"

Bloody tears flowed from Venetia's eyes.

'How, how could such a thing!'

Was this disaster or blessing?

What was certain was that it was an incident that had reached a singularity impossible to analyze or predict even with a three-brained species' minds.

"Ah, ah..."

Venetia's painfully contorted face suddenly became dreamy as if fallen into ecstasy.

'I see. God. This is exactly...'

The shocking truth that God had been hiding.

'We can't win. No matter what means we devise, we can never defeat Ra.'

La Enemy approached with a sad smile.

"That's right."

As he slowly extended his hand and lowered Venetia's eyelids, she could feel life gradually fading away.

"That's exactly what I am."

Venetia prayed desperately.

'Come out of there, Shirone.'

Her body collapsed forward, and her three brains stopped functioning in sequence.

'You must not meet La Enemy.'

No one should try to save humanity.

"Hey, Venetia! Get a grip!"

Brooks flipped Venetia over and shook her shoulders, but her body was already cold.

"Damn it! Do you know how much this cost! Call a doctor! Right now!"

La Enemy, existing in the past, looked at Venetia's corpse, then slowly turned and left the room.

Brooks shouted:

"Damn it! Do you know how much this cost! Call a doctor! Right now!"
