Law's Tremor (2)

Jive Capital Hospital.

The gangster Travis was able to easily penetrate what should have been tight security.

'Even if it's lunch time, it shouldn't be this empty.'

His contact with Gis's aide Myron had been two hours ago.

Handing over a large sum of money, his instructions were to silence a journalist named Maikle.

Myron had said:

"You know what I mean. Just stop him from writing the article. Use any means necessary."

Feeling the weight of the briefcase, a thrill ran down Travis's spine once again.

"That's all?"

It was easier than expected.

"That's all. I've handled the preparations and follow-up measures, so you just go in and do your job. But preferably no deaths. You're a professional. Once this job is done, you won't need to do thug work anymore."

The dream of a dramatic rise in status that seemed like it would never come in his lifetime was becoming reality.

"Leave it to me. I'll stake my life on it."

Travis boldly entered through the main entrance.

"Alright, let's do this."

Once inside the hospital, the security guards didn't stop him.

'So this is where the nobles get treated.'

He remembered when his son broke a bone playing, carrying the crying child and running through the city.

'Room 607.'

Even though he'd heard it was the VIP section, no bodyguards were visible.

"Heh."

Feeling dizzy again at Myron's power, Travis opened the door and entered.

"Who, who are you?"

In the spacious ward were three beds and one patient, Maikle and his wife.

"Are you Maikle?"

His wife pressed the call button, but the emergency bell didn't ring - the wires must have been cut.

Maikle blocked his path.

"I asked who you are. What the hell are you? How did you get in here?"

"Don't need to know. You have an article you're planning to write today, right? Hand it over. Then I'll leave quietly."

As Travis moved toward where the typewriter was, Maikle threw a punch.

"You damn thief!"

Travis's jaw turned, but this would only fuel his anger.

"Get lost right now! Do you know who I am?"

As soon as he finished speaking, Travis drove his fist into Maikle's stomach.

"Ugh!"

As he collapsed, his wife rushed over.

"Honey!"

"Don't, don't come!"

Stopping his wife, he pleaded:

"Why are you doing this? You're making a mistake. If you do this, you too will... Gack!"

Travis kicked his face and checked the child sleeping in the bed.

'So that's how it is.'

You want me to take all the blame.

"Hey, Mr. Journalist. I'm a man with nothing to lose. Nothing good will come from getting involved with someone like me."

Maikle thought while lying face down:

'Why isn't anyone coming? Could it be that Mr. Raymond has some weakness being exploited? That can't be...'

The Raymond he knew was a true politician, thorough in managing his personal security.

"You keep acting tough, is that it? Then I have no choice but to take action."

Maikle prostrated himself.

"Don't touch my son. He has a weak heart. He's a poor child who's only ever known hospital life."

Travis's nostrils flared with force.

'Damn it.'

He had a child too.

"So don't write the article. Then your son will live and nothing will happen to you."

"Listen carefully. This isn't just my problem. The kingdom's future is at stake."

The kingdom's future?

"Is that so?"

He didn't know what the kingdom's future meant, and if he did know such things, he probably wouldn't be living like this.

"You're really pissing me off."

Does that kingdom's future include thugs like me?

"Do you take me for a fool?"

Travis knocked over all the hospital equipment and grabbed the child by the collar, shaking him.

The child was much lighter than expected, and Travis felt his heart burning.

The wife rushed at him.

"No! Don't!"

"Get away!"

The moment he shoved her with his arm, the child he was holding by the collar rolled under the bed.

In an instant, the ward became chaos, and Travis's mind was extremely agitated.

"When I speak, listen! Listen!"

Every time he stepped on the unconscious child, his jaw trembled and strength drained from his body.

"Graaah!"

Do it. Just do it.

'I can endure it. Just 10 minutes, no, 5 minutes with my eyes shut tight. Then my family will live.'

Feeling his resolve weakening, he let go of even his last thread of sanity.

"Die! I said die!"

Money.

"Think I'll give up? I'm a thug! Human trash!"

That damn money.

'Hand it over!'

His facial features collapsed as he stupidly screamed and kicked the child's stomach.

"Give me the money!"

The wife screamed, and Maikle crawled over and grabbed Travis's leg.

"I'll do it! I'll destroy everything, so please stop! I'll do anything, please!"

"Hah! Hah!"

When Travis stopped, Maikle put the documents from the typewriter into the trash can and set them on fire.

"There, okay? It's over now. Please leave. A doctor, please call a doctor! Please!"

Travis didn't want to open his mouth.

"If, if, if you do that one more time..."

His voice was trembling too much, and it seemed he shouldn't say anything more.

Spitting out curses, he strode through the hospital corridor with bloodshot eyes.

His whole body convulsed.

'It'll be okay. I didn't beat him to death. They said not to let anyone die.'

The truth was, he was scared.

"Huh!"

Entering the city, he exploded with all the emotions he'd been holding back.

"Graaah! Graaah!"

He couldn't even think to hide his tears.

'What is this, damn it! What the hell is this! Let me live a little too! Is this how people live?'

People's attention was brief, as an explosion sounded from the block across the way.

Following screams, smoke rose, and Travis stopped in his tracks.

"Overthrow Jive!"

A group wearing chicken heads attacked citizens through the smoke.

"Huh? Huh?"

Maybe it was unrelated, but feeling an ominous sensation, just as he was about to turn around:

"Gack!"

A long sword pierced his heart from behind.

"Got him, got him!"

Coughing blood and falling to the ground, the chicken-head group gathered around Travis.

"No, no..."

Travis's hand reached toward home, and countless swords pierced his body.

"Hahaha! Die! Die!"

Under the lynching by unidentified terrorists, the last emotion he felt was helplessness toward the world.

'Sorry, honey... our son...'

The bombing terrorist incident in the capital was reported to Delta headquarters through breaking news.

Fermi walked down the corridor reading documents.

Investigation of explosive entry route ongoing. Based on appearance, presumed to be same type as Delta headquarters terrorists. In drug-intoxicated state. Identity verification impossible.

'Drug soldiers. If the brain's memory components are damaged...'

One kingdom was identified.

"Iron."

It was the only nation in the southern continent that Fermi, who controlled it with drugs, couldn't reach.

'Under royal orders, they manufacture drugs and develop soldiers with them. Indiscriminate terrorism is also a major means for them to strengthen royal power...'

"Fermi."

At the familiar voice, he looked up to see Seriel standing there.

Gis's aide Myron entered the Iron sector, avoiding people's gazes.

'The major hurdle is past.'

Entering the secret room, Iron's King Basak and Arachne's Prime Minister Fedra were there.

"Hey, Myron. Congratulations. Clean job?"

"All thanks to Your Majesty."

Eliminating Travis with Iron terrorists was the most reliable method.

Fedra cackled.

"In terrorism by extremists rebelling against democratic monarchy, nobody cares about one thug dying. That's what citizens love most - good triumphing over evil."

So did evil lose?

"Tomorrow the Jive scandal will quiet down too. Hey, Myron. What are you doing? Come sit here."

"Ah, yes."

Fedra smirked.

"What, are you holding onto something? Because I sucked a bit out of Jive, hm? Feeling betrayed?"

"Of course not."

Myron's eyes narrowed.

'Betrayal, what betrayal.'

When he didn't trust the human species to begin with, what reason was there to feel betrayed?

Basak asked:

"Where's Gis? I heard his daughter died too. I was going to buy him a consolation drink."

"Ah, he has a lunch appointment."

"Heh heh, even with all this going on, women? What a beast. That's why I like Gis. He's got guts."

Myron said:

"More importantly, the press conference coming up is key. For Jive, it's not over yet."

Fedra smirked.

"My, what a loyal retainer. Why worry so much? Mr. Gis will handle it well enough."

"But..."

"I said it's fine. Citizens hate thugs, murderers, and rapists, but they don't hate us. They actually love us. Know why?"

Myron shook his head.

"No matter how much they deny it, hidden in their hearts is the desire to become like us."

"Humans, you see, can't 100% condemn someone they want to become. Their subconscious stops them. Because there's even a slim chance they could become that person. No, even if they don't, they imagine it."

Fedra spread both arms.

"In the end, we're the embodiment of human desire. We live inside everyone's inner self."

"You mean everyone's the same?"

"No."

Fedra grinned wickedly.

"We are their very definition of justice."

Myron remained silent.

"Mr. Gis will be fine. He might be a bit annoyed, but nothing will happen."

'Is he being serious?'

Fedra winked and pointed at Myron.

"Trust my words. A situation where you lose power will absolutely never happen."

The moment he felt relieved by those words, Myron realized there was no lie in Fedra's statement.

'I'm human too.'

Because he was a monster of self-rationalization.

Gis and Flu had a lunch appointment.

Since he'd recently received news of his daughter's death, Flu's words and attitude were cautious.

"First... I'm sorry this happened."

Gis looked up puzzled, then realized and made a sad expression.

"Ah, you mean that."

Tears flowed from his eyes.

Since the grief of losing a child must be greater than anything, Flu's heart softened this time.

"Take heart. Take some rest for a while..."

Gis looked up.

"I'm fine."

Seeing his composed expression, so different from moments before, Flu even felt eerie.

"Heh, why? Strange?"

"Well, that's..."

"Of course losing my daughter is sad. Even now my heart feels like it's tearing apart. But what would I gain by following my emotions? I never could have come this far with such a weak mental state."

He chewed his steak.

"Let's be honest. You must have expectations of me too, right? That I can give you something. Ah, right. How about bearing my child? I just lost a daughter, after all."

'He's a monster.'

She understood why Gaold, the former Magic Association president, never dealt with politicians.

"Then, how about the Magic Association president position in Jive?"

"Magic Association president. Good. I like you because you have clear judgment. How about tonight? Is your schedule free?"

"Of course."

Flu smiled.

'Yes, Gis. I'll give you my body and heart. But this time, you should be prepared.'

After the assassination game, Tormia's strategy had also changed.

'Today, you die in my arms.'
