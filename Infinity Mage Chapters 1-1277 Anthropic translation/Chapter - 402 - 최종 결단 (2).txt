[402] Final Decision (2)

Middle East. The Kingdom of Paras.

On the western map of Paras, the birthplace of ancient civilization, the world's largest Akkad Desert was painted in ochre.

An endless sea of sand.

It was extremely difficult for any living creature to survive in this place that had been scorched by eons of time.

However, human footprints were imprinted on the sand that spread smoothly as if cream had been applied.

Where the footprints led, a massive pyramid called ancient ruins rose like a mirage.

The central part of the Akkad Desert had all its oases dried up, so even travelers didn't come near, but a few people knew that this was the dungeon where the world's most famous magician resided.

A dungeon with infiltration difficulty A2.

The person walking leisurely through its interior was Kang Nan, former chief secretary of the Tormia Magic Association.

Wherever she had passed, monsters of Tier 5 and above were embedded in the walls, writhing.

The clicking sound of high heels on the stone floor echoed oppressively, crushing the creatures' groans.

Kang Nan's attire was a mess from prolonged combat.

Buttons had come off, leaving her front open, and her stockings had expanded in droplet patterns here and there.

In her right hand, she held a long horn, one of dozens of horns attached to some monster's tail.

The tail was connected to a green body that looked to weigh at least 2 tons, and at the end of the body, a desert king basilisk with a grotesquely sunken nose was being dragged along with its tongue hanging out.

Drag, drag, drag.

The sight of Kang Nan dragging a monster more than 20 times her size was certainly incongruous, but even that was a minor issue compared to her light gait that seemed to feel no weight.

Reaching the end of the labyrinth, Kang Nan pushed open the stone door and entered.

It was a massive cavity, and numerous creatures that lived in the desert were preserved like taxidermy with their skin dried and stuck like tree bark.

80 meters away at a table, someone wearing a turban could be seen with their back turned, absorbed in their work.

Instead of knocking, Kang Nan dragged the basilisk's tail and threw it.

Kuuuung!

A magnificent echo reverberated through the great cavity.

"If you know I'm here, couldn't you just let me in?"

The turbaned figure finally turned around. It was a slender woman wearing a desert-colored cloak.

Her eyes were large and long without double eyelids, and her chin was delicately narrow to the point of fragility. She was sucking on a baby pacifier, which contrasted with her deep, dark pupils to create an overall mysterious atmosphere.

"It's been a long time, Kang Nan."

The woman's name was Zulu.

She was a certified First-Class Grand Magician of the Kingdom of Paras and the strongest summoning magician on earth, the only one among Tier 1 monsters who could summon a lich.

"Yes. You seem to be doing well."

Kang Nan spoke in Middle Eastern, but Zulu insisted on using Continental.

"Me? Well. I haven't gone out much since then."

Her habit of adding honorifics to specific endings remained the same.

It didn't match Continental grammar, but if that had been her habit from the beginning, there was nothing to be done about it.

"Sit down. I'll bring something to drink."

Kang Nan moved with an uneasy expression.

With Zulu's abilities, she could create moisture on the spot, but the problem was that she didn't do so. It seemed that being a First-Class Grand Magician came with its own unique rationality different from common sense.

As expected, Zulu poured an unidentifiable liquid into an experimental beaker and placed it on the table.

Kang Nan's expression was uncomfortable looking at it.

If not created by magic, water in the desert was more precious than jewels. Even if not drinking water, vast amounts of moisture would be needed to operate the experimental equipment in the great cavity.

The fact that the monsters preserved around them were squeezed dry without a drop of moisture wasn't due to eccentric taste.

Zulu removed her pacifier and savored the liquid in the beaker. Since it was precious water, Kang Nan had no choice but to at least pretend to drink it.

"I'll drink it well. It's not something like desert maggot urine like 10 years ago, right?"

"I couldn't give something like that to someone visiting after so long. That's very precious water."

Kang Nan slightly tilted the beaker to taste it.

Once her tongue began to get wet, ecstasy rose in her throat.

"It's not bad. So what is this?"

"It's my urine."

Kang Nan held the beaker to her mouth and spat out the water she had been holding.

The fact that she didn't spill it on the floor could be said to be an enthusiastic response to the First-Class Grand Magician's hospitality.

Zulu smiled and said:

"Don't worry. It's distilled water."

"Of course it should be. But with this, I feel like I have a lot in my body too."

"Hehe. You're still the same, Kang Nan."

Zulu recalled meeting Kang Nan for the first time 10 years ago.

She had been much more rustic and youthful in appearance, but her sharpness that had controlled the world's madman Gaold was no less than now.

'You've grown a lot.'

The Kang Nan of that time was a bleeding wolf. A beast full of hostility that bared its fangs at anyone.

But now even that belligerence had been much tempered.

If she had come down to the 19th floor underground of the pyramid without Gaold, it could be said she had overcome her inner demons.

"The elements of nature circulate. There are cycles within cycles. The act of us drinking water is not about possessing water, but about entering the great cycle of life and death and creating another cycle. When humans entrust their bodies to the perfect cycle where there is nothing to discard and nothing to keep, they can assimilate with nature."

Kang Nan listened carefully to Zulu's words.

Though not a magician, truth meets at the summit.

There was nothing to discard from a First-Class Grand Magician's teachings.

"Is that the secret to controlling the King of the Dead?"

A lich was a thought-form created by the condensed resentment of a grand magician. Therefore, since it was already a dead subject, it was known that it couldn't clear extinction, the final stage of necromancy.

In academic circles, there were rumors that Zulu herself had become a lich and the summon was merely a doppelganger, but Kang Nan, who had actually seen her summon a lich, knew it was a lie.

When she saw it 10 years ago, she had only thought it was overwhelming, but working as chief secretary of the Magic Association had made her truly curious about that secret.

"How exactly is that possible?"

Zulu turned her head with sad eyes.

"This place is the land of death."

The explanation ended there, but Kang Nan seemed to understand.

If a magician had realized the principle of circulation—that one must empty to fill—there would be no reason to hide the secrets of necromancy from the beginning. It was just that it was her entire life, too vast to contain in words.

"I see."

The pyramid's great cavity was Zulu's cradle.

Abandoned here as an infant, she had survived alone without anyone's help.

Had the dungeon's monsters become her parents?

Zulu wasn't certain.

When she reached an age of awareness, she was still alone, and all that remained was a small pacifier her parents had left behind.

From then on, Zulu had lived making the massive dungeon her home.

Death was always perched on her shoulders. When sleeping, when needing to eat, even when breathing.

It was survival in a different sense from what people in slums like Radum experienced.

For Zulu, survival wasn't a yearning to crave life, but just another form of death that had merely changed shape.

Kang Nan could also be said to have lived a rough life, but she couldn't even imagine what Zulu's life had been like.

A girl who had spent her childhood with hundreds of species of monsters in a dungeon where neither food nor even water could be obtained.

Perhaps it was inevitable that Zulu became the world's strongest summoning magician.

"I came because I have a favor to ask."

Getting to the main point, Kang Nan bowed her head until her forehead nearly touched the table as she pleaded.

"Please help Gaold."

Zulu was lost in thought, her gaze fixed somewhere. Then she slowly opened her mouth and answered in Middle Eastern.

"Understood."

Kang Nan's head shot up at the quicker acceptance than expected.

Actually getting Zulu out of the pyramid was an extremely difficult task. Countless grand magicians, even Paras royalty, had pleaded for her to become their close associate, but all had been rejected.

Most importantly, Zulu didn't know the current situation. Now that things had completely diverged from the plan discussed 10 years ago, she would have to shoulder risks with almost no chance of survival.

"I'm sorry. There's something I didn't tell you. The situation suddenly changed..."

"Gaold is like a child."

Zulu recalled when she first met Gaold.

"He doesn't try to empty anything. Even when he's so packed he's about to explode, even when he's in agony to the point of death, he tries to hold on and not let go until the end."

Kang Nan kept her mouth shut and listened.

"The reason he could endure nonetheless was because he was waiting for the time to pour everything out. I think now might be that time. If this too is part of a great cycle, I think it would be good for Gaold to finally be at ease."

"Zulu."

Kang Nan exerted effort to hold back tears.

Why did tears come at words that understood that detestable human disaster?

Was it sympathy for a madman abandoned after 20 years of hardship? Or perhaps...

"And."

Zulu said with a childlike, pretty eye-smile.

"Because interesting things always happen when I'm with Gaold."

Kang Nan raised the corners of her mouth with wet eyes.

That was it. Pure obsession that ordinary people could never understand.

Perhaps she had been bewitched by the madness of one who had staked everything on just one thing.

Zulu got up from her seat and prepared to leave.

All she did was put the pacifier in her mouth and pack two water bottles in a small bag. It was modest luggage for a First-Class Grand Magician's departure.

"Let's go. If we take Kaidra, we'll reach the continent quickly."

Kaidra, a Tier 3 summoned monster, was a giant strange bird that could fly 7,000 kilometers per day.

Kang Nan watched Zulu's retreating figure as she left the great cavity, then bowed her head in the characteristic posture of Ramuai.

She was someone she respected in a different sense from Gaold.

'Thank you.'

Kang Nan looked back at the beaker on the table.

Circulation. One can only fill by emptying. If one cannot fill, one cannot empty either.

Taking a deep breath, she picked up the beaker and drank down the water that was more than half full in one go.

"Ugh."

As expected, she couldn't get used to this.

The taste was definitely water, but it seemed that the mystery of "all things are created by mind alone" wasn't for just anyone.

Wiping her uncomfortable mouth with her tongue, Kang Nan followed Zulu out of the great cavity.

Sirone went to the principal's office as soon as the sun rose.

What Gaold had primarily asked was to deliver a note to Alpheas.

Seeing Sirone's sudden visit, Alpheas showed a surprised expression, but after reading the note, he silently nodded.

Sirone also left the principal's office without saying a word.

Kingdom intelligence agents would already be positioned around the school.

Without confirmation that Gaold was coming, the security wouldn't be as tight as in the capital, but it was dangerous for Gaold to act alone.

'If it's the principal, he'll handle it.'

Alpheas, who had been through all kinds of hardships, could be trusted.

Also, with Olivia, a certified Second-Class Grand Magician, by his side, they would find a way somehow.

This wasn't the time to worry about Gaold. Sirone was a suspect entangled with Gaold, and if things went wrong, he might end his life without being able to do anything.

In the face of the globally critical matter of heaven, there was no one to care about Sirone's safety.

It was a situation where he had to make his own judgments and seek a way out.

'Ikael...'

There was a reason he had to meet her at least once, even if it meant abandoning everything, but the situation was different from a year ago.

Even if he returned alive, he would inevitably become a lifelong fugitive as a traitor.

The fortunate thing was that Sirone still held the initiative.

Having discovered the possibility of heaven's destruction, Gaold would classify Sirone as a key figure in the project, which meant at least the foundation for survival was established.

'Information gathering comes first. I need to proceed carefully, one step at a time.'

If the situation had grown uncontrollably large, myopic thinking might actually be more effective.

The best approach was to grope blindly through immediate problems and solve them one by one.
