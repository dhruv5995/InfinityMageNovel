Groggy (3)

Marin looked back at Veterus, then examined Shirone again with a shocked expression.

She too had spent considerable time eating meals on battlefields, so she knew of countless mythical events.

'If that boy is Yahweh...'

And among those myths was the story of one swordsman who cut down demons and traversed Kashan.

'The Knight of Maha.'

Her eyes fell on Lian, who was casually observing the weather despite demons approaching within striking distance, showing no tension whatsoever.

'Why are guys like this here?'

Hadn't they looked exactly like defeated soldiers?

According to her common sense, whether it was a holy war or another nation's army, they should be lifting them up and escorting them away.

As thirty demons gathered in a circle, Shirone pointed to one of them.

"Come over here."

"M-me?"

Denying reality, it looked left and right, but no other demon would make eye contact.

The terrifying thing about Photon Cannon was that light particles fundamentally destroyed demons' information.

The surviving demons had already realized this fact, and Shirone before their eyes looked like Buddha to them.

"I have something to ask you."

The demon approached the spot Shirone pointed to with his finger and crouched down.

"How can I summon Hell?"

"Hell?"

Though demons were residents of the other world, extremely few had even heard of Hell.

When Shirone stared intently, the demon flinched and waved his hands.

"I really don't know! I've never even heard of it!"

He thought as much.

"Don't be afraid. I'm neither Yahweh nor Buddha. I'm just an ordinary human."

Strangeness filled the demon's eyes.

'Neither Yahweh nor Buddha?'

If that were true, the demons no longer needed to fear Shirone.

"R-really?"

"Yes."

The demon looked back at his companions behind him, shrugged his shoulders, then extended his finger toward Shirone.

"You w-won't get angry?"

As if handling explosives, he carefully poked Shirone's cheek, but no shower of light came down.

"Right. I told you, I'm just an ordinary human."

The corners of the demon's mouth, who had been lost in thought with shocked eyes, twisted eerily.

"Kekeke, that's right!"

The killing intent rising from the demon synchronized with that of his companions standing behind, flaring up like flames.

"Kugh!"

Veterus and Marin hastily took defensive positions, but if they acted, stopping them would be impossible.

"What are you doing?"

Marin shouted at Lian, who was still just watching.

"You need to stop them quickly!"

Even if not at Yahweh's level, Shirone wasn't someone who would fall to thirty demons.

But there was a deeper meaning to why Lian wasn't moving.

"Guys! This is our chance!"

The demons, baring their sharp teeth, stomped loudly as they rushed toward Shirone.

"Detestable Yahweh—no, human! From now on, we'll strip every piece of flesh from your bones!"

The moment the demon Shirone had called over stood up arrogantly and raised his claws, Shirone spoke.

"And now."

Light radiated from Shirone's body, rising like a heat haze.

"I'm Yahweh again."

It was the light of Yahweh.

Looking up at the light haze rising ten meters high, the demons were dumbfounded.

"You bastard."

At Shirone being cursed by a demon, Lian burst into laughter.

'A state of mind isn't something you lose.'

It's simply a specific form of mentality that can be reached at any time by flipping one's mindset.

Of course, flipping that mindset might be the most difficult thing for some, but mages were experts in handling the mind.

"Come here."

When Shirone, wrapped in light, gestured, the demons' legs trembled.

But they couldn't refuse, and the demon who had raised his claws sat down obediently.

When Shirone reached out toward the red, fierce face, the demon's eyes squeezed shut.

"I'm sorry."

At first, he doubted his ears.

When he opened his eyes at the gentle touch stroking his cheek, Shirone's eyes were filled with sadness.

"I didn't try to understand with my heart. I judged only by results without examining the cause."

Just as Veterus had judged Shirone.

"The cause of your birth lies with humans. Since you were born from evil in the first place, you have reason to feel wronged."

The demon trembled.

"What are you doing right now? Saying such things only gives me hives."

"Repent. Save the world together with me."

The demon lowered his head.

"...Thank you for saying that, but."

From the demon slowly standing up came killing intent incomparable to anything before.

"We cannot do that. Just as we cannot live without eating, for demons, this is natural."

Shirone's eyelids half-lowered.

"This is your last chance."

"Yahweh, destroy us. If that can make you suffer—"

The demons rushed forward simultaneously.

"That's the greatest pleasure for us!"

The moment thirty demons covered Shirone, a blindingly intense explosion of light occurred.

Hundreds of light barriers per second pounded their eardrums, and the demons left not even a trace.

"My god..."

Marin couldn't even grasp what had happened, and neither could Veterus.

"This is... magic?"

No mage on any battlefield could turn demons to powder in such a short time.

The survivors who had looked down on Shirone slowly backed away, but Shirone was lost in other thoughts.

'My pain is the demons' pleasure.'

He had reached the stage of understanding them, but true universal love still seemed distant.

"Let's go, Lian."

When Shirone stood up abruptly, Lian followed without complaint.

"Please wait!"

Veterus approached and knelt down.

"Please take me with you! I beg you!"

Marin quickly joined in.

"Me too! I beseech to follow the great swordsman!"

Shirone didn't want to take them.

Until he apologized to the Augent family, it seemed he couldn't accept anyone.

Lian spoke.

"If you follow us, what about the remaining survivors? Weren't you supposed to be responsible for them?"

"Th-that's..."

"Forget what happened today. It has nothing to do with what you did. We go our own way."

Veterus bit his lips.

'Damn! Such an opportunity...'

Though Lian said it didn't matter, Veterus couldn't help but regret having disrespected Shirone.

'I should have recognized him from the start. If I had done well, he definitely would have taken me...'

Lian turned to Shirone.

"It's raining, will you be okay? Should I ask for a horse instead?"

"No. It's fine now."

Shirone lightly tossed his Law Kill and activated Material's ability, causing metal to begin attaching.

What landed with a thud was a monster with a massive body and four legs.

"Let's ride Slaughter."

Lian nodded and climbed onto Slaughter, with Shirone slowly following.

The survivors' gazes at seeing Slaughter were clearly felt on the back of Shirone's head.

Shirone, who had stopped walking, raised his head.

"Lian."

Lian understood what he wanted to say.

"Do as you wish."

Just the responsibility for killing Gai was overwhelming enough that Shirone didn't want to be responsible for anything else for a while.

'But...'

He couldn't do what wasn't right.

"Everyone, please follow me. I'll give you a ride until we reach a nearby city."

The survivors looked bewildered.

"You'll take us with you?"

Since he wasn't the type to dwell on decisions already made, Shirone smiled.

"Yes. It's dangerous here. Let's go to a safe place."

Shirone also spoke to Veterus.

"Just pack necessary supplies and food simply. We'll depart in ten minutes."

"Why..."

Veterus was puzzled.

"Why do you care about us? You didn't even recognize a great mage and actually looked down on him?"

"You're not really asking because you don't know."

Shirone placed his hand on Slaughter's body.

"This is the right thing to do."

The reason he didn't give trivial explanations was because any human would know.

"But no one lives that way."

Perhaps that was also true.

"Yes."

When he enhanced Material's ability, Slaughter's body began expanding to an enormous size.

Looking back at Veterus, Shirone gave a sad smile.

"That's why it's so hard."

The state of Yahweh.

Though he couldn't understand even one hundredth of it, Veterus seemed to know what Shirone was carrying.

"I'll prepare as quickly as possible."

When Veterus went to gather food, Marin also hurriedly stood up and directed the survivors.

'Shirone.'

Lian looked down at Shirone with affectionate eyes.

'You say I'm great, but I don't have the confidence to live like you.'

That's why he had become Shirone's sword.

'How strange it is. Even though you're doing the right thing, everyone suspects you.'

Shirone wasn't wrong.

"Quickly. Move quickly."

One hundred survivors who had efficiently finished preparing to leave boarded Slaughter.

An ordinary monster's leg bones would have broken, but Slaughter, made of metal, didn't budge.

When it moved with thundering steps, even Veterus, a mage, turned pale.

"The size is so big you might get motion sick. I'll still increase the speed."

When Law Kill accelerated Slaughter, its legs began moving at the speed of a galloping horse.

"Aaaahhh!"

People's screams echoed through the desolate city.

Emergency was declared at the Holy War's command.

"Report! A demon army of three million is advancing from the southeast of the Kettler Mountains!"

"Reporting! The Altras region has been occupied. Casualties reach four hundred thousand!"

At the dire reports flooding in from armies in all directions, Iruki's expression darkened.

"Damn."

The fact that the Gustav Empire had completely disappeared from the map was already known through urgent intelligence.

'They finished them off too cleanly.'

Though Shirone hadn't intended it, it was complete annihilation that didn't even require turning toward headquarters.

Absorbing the remaining demons and waiting for the right moment would be one method, but Havitz's military strategist Vulcan didn't give them time.

"Report! The port city of Tostra has been hit. Casualties reach one million!"

When he heard that far, Iruki struck the round table hard.

"Aaaahhh! Aaaahhh!"

Four hundred thousand, one million—numbers that would be sufficient to say in one word.

"Damn bastards!"

But to recite the lives contained in those numbers would take more than one person's lifetime.

"What shall we do? There's no way to stop them."

Iruki checked the overall map.

The place where hell's armies rushing from all directions would converge was Tormia, and there wasn't much time left.

"A method..."

There wasn't none.

But if Iruki commercialized this technique, humans wouldn't be safe either.

'Pandora's Box.'

Another report came in. Two hundred thousand had died.

'I'm sorry, Shirone.'

At humanity's final point, Iruki suddenly remembered his days at Alpheas Magic School.

"I'll go to Tormia myself."

The commanders looked at Iruki.

"Now? More importantly, are you going personally, sir?"

"If we delay, we'll miss our only opportunity. I'll go briefly. Please organize an escort team."

Iruki, who had been heading for the door, turned back again.

"Oh, and please call Nade. Tell him I'll explain the reason when we meet."

It was time to mobilize connections.
