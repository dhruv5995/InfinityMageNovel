[738] Toward the Stars (2)

"Come in. It's here."

The third-floor room 12 where Minerva was staying was a small room with simple furniture and a single bed.

Not only was there just one bed, but even for a married couple, it seemed too small for two people to sleep together comfortably.

Shirone noticed a long broomstick, presumably hers, leaning against the wall.

'A witch's broomstick.'

Minerva's broomstick was introduced in history books as one of the fastest objects in the world.

Minerva asked while taking off her top.

"What kind of play do you like? I'm not particularly picky about preferences. Just tell me and I'll accommodate you."

"As I said before coming in, I didn't follow you here for that kind of thing."

Minerva lifted her head and laughed.

"Who would believe that? Men are all the same anyway. If you followed me all the way here, you must have had some thoughts, right?"

Though it seemed like their gender roles were reversed, Shirone didn't mind.

"I was so tired I would have followed anyone to a place where I could sleep. And you promised to take me to the Ivory Tower."

Having removed all her outer garments, Minerva looked back at Shirone while standing in front of her folded pajamas.

"So I kept my promise. This is the Ivory Tower."

Shirone's eyes widened.

"This is the Ivory Tower?"

"To be precise, it's more like the terrace of the Ivory Tower. The Corona Kingdom is a nation established by the residents of the Ivory Tower. Since the residents can never leave the Ivory Tower for their entire lives, they need a space with various convenience facilities. It's also convenient for entertaining guests."

"Then where is the Ivory Tower?"

Minerva said while putting on a silk robe.

"You can get there through the magic circle in the underground of the royal castle. And other than that, there's no other way to reach the Ivory Tower. Under normal circumstances, that is."

Because nothing is absolute.

"Except for you. A magician who reached transcendence in a human body might find a way somehow."

Minerva collapsed onto the bed in a seductive pose.

"If you please me tonight, I'll let you use the royal castle's magic circle. How about it? This is a fair trade."

Shirone looked at her with disdain.

"I'm used to that kind of look. Anyway, nice to meet you. Let's get along well as fellow members of the Five Great Stars from now on."

"Five Great Stars? Me?"

Minerva's eyes became serious for the first time.

"Maha Garuta has left the world. The position is currently vacant, and I returned to the Ivory Tower to mourn him. It's not decided yet, but I think Taesung feels the same way."

Shirone would fill the vacant position in the Five Great Stars.

"Left the world means..."

"That's right. He completely opened the Immortal Function. Though you returned to this world."

Minerva suddenly sat up.

"I don't understand. Why did you come back? This world is just about eating, shitting, and fighting... that's all there is, right? Honestly, I agree with his opinion. If he had ended everything."

Minerva shrugged her shoulders.

"It would have been fine. It's returning to before birth. You know what? Before birth, you don't even have the thought of being alive."

"But we are alive, aren't we?"

The obsession with everything that exists - that was the only realization that allowed Shirone to return to this world.

"It's humans who define murder as evil."

Minerva said with a snort.

"If he kills most of humanity, he'll become the worst murderer. But if he kills everyone, then it's not a matter of good and evil. Because it transcends existence."

Shirone was unwavering.

"The reason you can love even the smallest creatures equally is because of your extremely low Kar. But in the end, you're also human. You should think about why Gauffin couldn't achieve his goal and had no choice but to transcend the photon world."

'Gauffin has also left.'

As Shirone crouched against the wall, Minerva patted the bed and said.

"Don't do that, come up here. I'll really just hold hands and sleep."

No answer was heard.

It was probably a nightmare.

Even as Nane was stabbing him with a colorful sword, Shirone couldn't move a single finger.

"You are a lowly creature."

The pain became despair that ravaged his mind, and even knowing it was a dream, he couldn't open his eyes.

"Ugh!"

The gaze of a being with near-perfect Kar looking down was so stern it froze his heart.

"You are the lowest grade in this universe..."

The dark sword slowly pierced through his solar plexus.

"The lowest existence."

"Aaaaah!"

Light burst from Shirone's body, blowing away Nane's afterimage, and dark space enveloped his surroundings.

'Small World Creation...'

Shirone's mind finally regained stability upon realizing it was Armand's space.

"Natural enemies are fearsome."

The sound of sharpening a blade could be heard from where a small torch was burning.

"Armand..."

The body that had been a mixture of various monsters was now neatly organized into the form of a beautiful female figure.

"Without natural enemies, there is no circulation, and a world without circulation is dead."

The blade that had been sharpened since the moment it was born as a demon sword was now so thin it was transparent like glass.

"What are you sharpening the sword for?"

"...Promise me."

The sword completely disappeared.

"There will be one opportunity."

As Armand turned her head and smiled, her sharp fangs glinted in the torchlight.

"One opportunity to wield me for all life. Don't miss it."

As she raised her hand, fluffy particles of light floated up and flew toward him.

"Material."

The moment Shirone gently embraced the light, the darkness disappeared and far away, giant eyelids opened as light entered.

"Huh?"

The sound of fierce Arctic wind could be heard, and soon cold air rushed in, making his body shiver.

"Ugh, it's cold."

Upon waking and looking around, Armand's robe had completely disappeared without a trace.

'It wasn't a dream.'

Each time Shirone broke through a level, Armand, who was synchronized with him, changed its function.

'Material.'

As Shirone opened his palm, light with substantial mass inflated like a balloon.

"I see."

If he became an infinite magician capable of controlling all information with Yahweh's light, there was no need to maintain the form of a sword.

"For example..."

As Shirone thought of something, Material's radiance disappeared and it was converted into matter.

It was a heavy gold bar reflecting the morning sun.

"The source information that transforms into all matter."

Shirone dropped the gold to the floor like a stone and again materialized Material to create soap, toothpaste, and a toothbrush in succession.

"...I feel kind of sorry about this."

If backed by engineering knowledge, he could create much more complex objects, but this was sufficient for now.

It could truly be called an infinite tool befitting an infinite magician, but Shirone pondered Armand's last words.

"She said one opportunity."

And when that opportunity came, Material would become Armand again to wield the concept of infinity.

"What are you muttering about?"

As Shirone looked up, Minerva was smiling in the adorable form of a young girl.

Since there was no longer any need to verify her true form, Shirone dusted himself off and stood up.

"Nothing. Are we going to the Ivory Tower now?"

Though Minerva had witnessed Material's transformation up close, she seemed to already know without explanation.

"You were incredibly noisy last night. Crying and making such a racket that I couldn't sleep a wink."

This was why sharing a room was burdensome.

"I'm sorry. I had a nightmare."

"It seemed like it. It was cold last night too. Your coat disappeared, and no matter how much I shook you, you wouldn't wake up."

Shirone's eyes narrowed suspiciously.

"Is that really all?"

"That's what I'm saying."

Minerva walked toward the door, swinging her broomstick.

"Wash up and come out. I'll be waiting outside."

Unlike before, she quickly left, making it even more suspicious, but there was no way to find out anyway.

'What kind of Five Great Star acts like that?'

The fact that he wasn't afraid even with the Witch of Fear right in front of him was proof that Shirone had earned the qualification of a star.

Going down to the first floor, the residents who had been playing card games the night before were still continuing their game.

Minerva, waiting with a broomstick taller than herself, gestured toward the outside.

Following the path where snow had piled up to their knees overnight, they arrived at the royal castle where members of the royal bloodline greeted them.

Unlike officials from other countries, the fact that they weren't afraid of stars revealed the relationship between the Corona Kingdom and the Ivory Tower.

"It's been a long time, Lady Minerva. You're still as beautiful as ever."

"Ho ho ho! I look young for a grandmother over seven hundred years old. Ambassador, you've aged quite a bit since I last saw you."

"Humans are bound to age after about twenty years."

The ambassador smiled even at Minerva's blunt words.

"The reason someone who lives like the wind has returned home must be because of the altar matter, right?"

"Yes. I don't think we can stop Nane. This world will probably end soon..."

Suddenly frowning, Minerva turned to Shirone and poked his head with her index finger.

"It's all because of this guy in the end. An infinite magician who can't even stop someone like Nane and comes all the way here."

Shirone felt wronged.

"Try facing him directly and then talk. If you're so frustrated, why don't you stop him yourself?"

"This educated kid is talking nonsense. If you couldn't stop him, how could I?"

The ambassador bowed to Shirone.

"Thank you for protecting human life. Humanity is always receiving help from the Five Great Stars."

"I haven't become a Five Great Star yet. And... I didn't fight only for humans."

The ambassador, who had welcomed stars for decades, understood exactly what Shirone wanted to say.

"I see. You must have deep meaning behind it. Please follow me. I'll guide you."

While following the ambassador, Shirone asked.

"By the way, what is an altar?"

Though Shirone had gained infinite omnipotence by opening the Immortal Function, transcendent intuition was all he had in terms of omniscience.

Because knowledge doesn't originally exist.

"It's a gate that eliminates the boundary between reality and the other world. They're trying to bring the hell that humans created into reality. According to the Ivory Tower's investigation, 3,600 altars have been constructed worldwide."

"3,600..."

"When the altars are activated, this world will become hell. The law will lean toward Nane, and after that, eternal annihilation."

"Why would it lean toward Nane?"

"You're probably the only one who thinks otherwise."

Because only Shirone denies Nane.

"How many humans do you think will find hope in terrible suffering? Nane is right. The only refuge for living beings is ultimately annihilation. You're the one denying that."

Minerva's eyes grew cold.

"Imagine this. If you were a being who felt pain from birth, if your throat tore with every breath, your eyes burned with everything you saw, and your tongue was blistered every time you spoke."

She stopped walking and turned to Shirone.

"Would you still choose life? Could you endure the pain every single day, every single second, waiting for your lifespan to end?"

Shirone couldn't be confident.

"I know someone like that."

He knew such a person, but he could never tell that person to live that way.

"You mean Gaold?"

"Yes. The driving force for enduring pain is his love for Miro. But in the end, he fell into hell. And I'm... telling everyone to live that way."

"Good that you understand."

It would be a difficult fight.

"If Nane hadn't become extreme, you wouldn't have stood at the opposite extreme either. For ordinary people, well, they're just caught in the middle of a whale fight."

Minerva patted Shirone's shoulder.

"Anyway, the people supporting you in this universe will be as few as your Kar level. You'll have to push forward from there."

The ambassador said.

"We've arrived."

The magic circle leading to the Ivory Tower was waiting.
