[400] Rapidly Changing Circumstances (4)

The Kashan Empire.

The hegemon of the continent's northwest, the coronation ceremony of the Kashan Empire's emperor—which occupied one-third of humanity's territory—was now just one hour away.

The succession procedure was, as always, unofficial and secretive.

Only the two Terajes who shared the same memories and a select few who knew private secrets remained in the 23rd floor spire of the massive palace Aganos.

The transfer of power from Teraje Mistra to Teraje Uorin.

From the outside, it appeared to be a common imperial succession where a parent passes the throne to their child, but someone knew the truth.

Only the name had changed.

Teraje was the proper noun for 'something' that had lived through the ages, repeatedly reincarnating itself.

"That concludes the handover regarding the Holy War. Well, now that the Holy War is over, I suppose everything is settled."

Fourteen hours ago, Uorin had stopped by the World Conference Hall in the central continent on her way here.

There, she was first introduced to the Holy War, and in one hour, she would ascend to the Three Emperors.

Even within the Holy War, the world's strongest superpower, Teraje's influence was formidable.

Below the Three Emperors were the Seven Kings, rulers of the seven most powerful nations on the continent, and the Two Military Kings, leaders of the fairy and dragon races.

These twelve monarchs belonging to the Holy War could truly be said to stand at the pinnacle of the world.

Though Uorin had instantly transformed from a princess of Kazra to a ruler of the world, no joy could be found in her expression. After all, everything was merely a subset of the name Teraje.

"Small talk is unnecessary. We've already verified that there are no discrepancies between your memories and mine. But I have a question."

Uorin stopped walking and turned to look at Mistra.

"Why so fast? I thought it would take at least four more years for me to ascend to the throne."

Since mother and daughter shared memories, the two were both separate and one. Therefore, any divergence in their thoughts was an issue that had to be addressed.

"Hmm, well, you see..."

Mistra looked back at Uorin.

While she had black hair and intense eyes, Uorin had white hair and a transparent impression.

Neither her husband Orcamp nor herself had white hair. Therefore, she was a mutation.

She was the 'self' who possessed the extremely rare 'future sight' among the abilities of 'History Search' that had made the current Teraje possible.

Perhaps it had been predetermined that among her many daughters, Uorin would become emperor.

However, today's imperial ascension was an irregular move that hadn't been calculated even in Mistra's mind.

"Don't worry. I'll make sure to disappear properly. It's just that among the memories formed since you were born, there are things I absolutely must pass on, so I followed you to Aganos."

Since Uorin had ascended to the Three Emperors, there was no reason for Mistra to exist in this world. However, there remained tasks that had to be completed in her generation.

The reason for advancing the imperial succession by several years, and for rapidly pushing forward with plans even while framing Mikea Gaold for treason, was for this purpose.

Entering the room, Mistra took out a locked box from the desk drawer. She handed it to Uorin, who was waiting on the sofa, then sat across from her and crossed her legs.

"This box contains all the answers to your questions. I'm sure you'll figure it out, but it's a secret of current humanity that no one knows. If used well, it could become a powerful weapon, but given the circumstances, I had no choice but to act first."

"How do I open it? I can't break it."

"I have the key. I can't show you yet. Before that, there's someone I need to introduce you to."

Right on time, there was a knock at the door.

Since only a handful of people worldwide had permission to enter the 23rd floor of the massive palace Aganos, Mistra immediately told them to enter.

A tall man entered. He had narrow eyes and a kind impression, with purple hair slicked back except for one strand that hung down.

It was Gando, former security captain of the Tormia Magic Association.

As Teraje Mistra's first son, he was biologically Uorin's older brother, but from a psychoanalytic perspective, he would be her son. This was why bloodline genealogy held no meaning for Teraje.

Gando bowed toward the ambiguous position of his two mothers.

"Did you call for me, Mother?"

"Yes, come here. You handled this matter well."

For Gando, who had been adopted to Tormia immediately after birth and raised by spies, the Tormia Magic Association was essentially his entire life.

But it had all been a lie.

Even joining Gaold's guard unit was just a false life designed by his mother.

In that life filled with lies, the only genuine feeling Gando had discovered was his reverence for Gaold.

But in the end, he had framed Gaold for treason and fled to arrive in his mother's embrace.

"Mother, why do you look like that? Don't tell me it's because of Gaold? You didn't have personal feelings, did you?"

"The only person precious to me is you, Mother. But... as a mage, I express respect for his achievements."

"Sigh. Gando, you are Teraje's son. You don't need to respect some mere magic association president."

Gando closed his mouth.

The Three Emperors would certainly have the right to say such things. But having spent most of his life in Tormia, he still couldn't distinguish which side was the truth.

Uorin examined Gando and nodded.

"He's certainly different from Zion. You picked well this time."

"Hehe, right? I didn't expect much from a son. He has talent, so should I develop him as a mage? You can use him if you want to keep him by your side."

Gando lowered his head.

Picked well? Develop him properly?

What kind of existence was he to Teraje?

Human? Creature? Or perhaps a gear component stuck inside a clock, destined to turn for life?

"Keep by my side? Hmm, I'm satisfied with Crouch. Come here, Gando."

Gando approached Uorin like a slave sold at a slave market. Every time her gaze penetrated various parts of him, he felt as if those areas were being stripped bare.

He couldn't show his discomfort.

Today, Mistra, his biological mother, would disappear. If abandoned by Uorin, only death would remain.

"Well, I suppose... I'll keep you around for now? I'll need to pay attention to Kashan for a while anyway."

"Thank you, Mother."

Gando bowed deeply. His eyes, looking down at the floor, trembled.

He was going to die.

If Uorin was Mistra's incarnation, he shouldn't believe any words that came from her mouth.

"However, I have two conditions."

Uorin burst into laughter. Making conditions to Teraje, one of the Three Emperors, meant he desperately wanted to live.

"Speak. If it's something I can grant after hearing it..."

"Please ensure I don't conflict with anyone in Kashan."

He meant recognition as an independent institution. If he had to survive and assist Uorin, it was a natural measure.

"Fine. What's the second?"

"Please don't make me criticize Mother. I am merely a warrior who fights blindly for Mother."

Though wrapped in packaging, it meant to use him like a dog. A desperate but unwilling descent to the level of servility.

Perhaps that too was a mage's cold-hearted solution, but Uorin didn't care.

There was nothing wrong with raising a puppy.

"You've saved your life, Gando."

"I can only be grateful for Mother's benevolence."

Mistra waved her hand dismissively.

"Go on out. There's remaining business."

This would probably be the last meeting between Gando and Mistra, but no maternal feeling could be detected in her tone.

As Gando left the room, Mistra took out a key from her bosom as if the time had come.

"The reason for succeeding to the throne faster than planned is to create variables. Gaold will go to heaven and do something. Ultimately, it will help us."

"Do you think he can succeed? Twenty years of planning have been disrupted at once."

"Success or failure doesn't matter. What matters is that something changes in the end. The reason humans gamble on low probabilities is that the reward of victory overwhelms the frustration of defeat. I simply gave him that."

"I still don't understand. I don't know what you're thinking. How can you do this?"

"Of course. That's why you need to open the box. It contains déjà vu records of the 'underlying events' that only I know. Reading that will let you understand my thoughts exactly."

Teraje possessed all memories from ancient times to the present and could rapidly search through those vast memories with the unique ability called 'History Search.'

Initially, it was merely simple data retrieval.

But when the Guffin Reset occurred, this ability underwent explosive evolution. That is, as new history was created after the reset, 'underlying events' were formed beneath the existing history.

A kind of future prediction ability created when two different timelines sharing the same time period were contrasted through déjà vu.

With 'future sight' added to that, Uorin might not just be dreaming about conquering heaven in her generation.

"The reason I hid it until the end was that exchanging opinions might introduce subjective judgment into History Search. See and judge for yourself. After all, I am you, and you are me."

Mistra walked to the desk. With the handover of the key, all missions of her lifetime were complete.

Uorin asked.

"What will you use?"

"Anything is fine, but just cleanly."

Mistra picked up the ceremonial sword placed on the desk. The blade drawn with a smooth sound scattered the light in the room.

Uorin nodded and inserted the key into the box. Meanwhile, Mistra gripped the handle with both hands, raised her head, and brought the blade to her nape.

Looking up at the ceiling and blinking, she suddenly remembered something and turned to Uorin.

"Right, you said you'd consume Sirone? That thought hasn't changed?"

Uorin shrugged while opening the box.

"Ataraxia, and he's handsome, right? The rest doesn't seem particularly important. Why, is there an anxiety factor?"

"No. Well, then."

Mistra raised her head again.

Her intuition felt slightly off, but this too was common. Teraje's long history wasn't weak enough to provide variables to a mere boy.

The moment Uorin opened the box, Mistra's sword moved sharply with a swoosh, and a fountain of blood spurted up. Shortly after, there was a thud as Mistra collapsed.

Uorin didn't even glance over. Her interest was solely in the information contained within the box.

The box contained documents on two matters.

The title written on the first document's cover was 'Guffin Erasure.'

Since the reset was estimated to have occurred 19 years ago, Uorin, who was born after that, had hazier underlying events than Mistra. However, since this was currently a matter that had been investigated by the Holy War as well as major institutions of various countries, it wasn't particularly important information.

Uorin set aside the first document, which had become a relic of the old era, and picked up the new document underneath.

'So this is it...'

Her hand reaching for the coffee cup paused, then returned to grip the document with both hands. She savored the title written in the center of the document for a long time.

Ankera Erasure

Uorin quickly flipped through the pages. Storage came first, analysis second.

Having memorized every single word of 200 pages in 5 minutes, she brought over a candlestick and burned the document.

Uorin's eyes watching the flames were sharper than ever before. She finally understood what Mistra had wanted to convey.

'You were right, Mistra.'

Gando knocked and entered. Though he briefly held his words at the completely changed scene from when he left, he soon returned to a calm expression and bowed his head.

"Mother, it's time to hold the coronation ceremony."

"Understood. I'll go now."

Gando turned his head toward Mistra collapsed on the floor.

She had cut her neck with the ceremonial sword. Even without looking, he could tell it was a cut without the slightest deviation.

"What should we do with the body?"

"Clean it up."

Uorin answered curtly as if telling him not to disturb her thoughts.

Gando carefully disposed of the corpse, even being cautious of his footstep sounds.

She was the mother who had given birth to him. But now Mistra was Uorin. An existence that couldn't be treated with human common sense. That was Teraje.

Uorin kicked back her chair and strode out into the corridor.

At the end of the 23rd floor tower was a balcony from which the plaza where hundreds of thousands of imperial citizens had gathered could be seen at a glance.

Pushing aside the curtains and stepping onto the balcony, an enormous crowd stretched to the horizon.

A tremendous roar erupted from the ground upon discovering Teraje. Heaven and earth shook, and the heat rose to the very top.

"Long live Her Imperial Majesty! Long live Her Imperial Majesty! Long live Her Imperial Majesty!"

Uorin raised her hand. The volume, which seemed impossible to rise further, shot up more than double, paralyzing hearing.

The entire world lay beneath her feet, but Uorin merely looked down with cold eyes.

Humans were peculiar creatures with as many diverse personalities as their population, but when gathered together, they were also a species that ultimately became bound under the single name of humanity.

Not someone, but just the massive monster called humanity was roaring toward her.

'Sirone, there's no time. Meet Ikael. You must change things. If you don't...'

Uorin looked up at the sky. Only the sun was positioned higher than her.

'Humanity will perish.'
