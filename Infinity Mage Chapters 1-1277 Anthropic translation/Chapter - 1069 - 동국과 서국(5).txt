East Country and West Country (5)

"Th! Th, this...!"

As the distance between him and Yahweh2 gradually closed, Chaos5MinutesAgo's expression twisted.

'What? What is this?!'

Having grown skilled at tormenting beginners in the neutral zone, he had his own manual.

Most beginners were all pride with no substance, so if you provoked them a few times, they'd charge at you just like Yahweh2 was doing.

Even if he attacked first, the moment they counterattacked, both sides would become hostile - that was High Gear's system.

In that state, if you eliminated your opponent, you could obtain spoils of war even if they were from a different nation.

The spoils were random - you could receive 10 percent of their galactic currency, or steal specific parts.

For masters with dozens of trillions, 10 percent of their galactic currency would be a huge jackpot, but Chaos5MinutesAgo had been having a decent time obtaining parts from beginners.

And even now, he thought he could devour these players who had just equipped beginner packages.

'But then...'

Even when he raised his High Gear's output to maximum and fired, not a single shot hit Yahweh2.

'How is this happening?'

Faced with a situation beyond his experience, Chaos5MinutesAgo panicked, and finally his evasion rate dropped below 20 percent.

"You bastard!"

Sirone shouted as he raised his arm, and energy bullets pounded Chaos5MinutesAgo's body.

"Gaaahhh!"

Of course, since his durability was good compared to his firepower, getting hit a few times wouldn't lead to immediate death.

'This is strange. It's a bug. A system error.'

Chaos5MinutesAgo felt a chill.

Like a cuckoo clock he'd grown so used to that he stopped paying attention to it suddenly popping out at the wrong time.

'When distance closes, evasion rate drops. But the same goes for that guy.'

The battle continued.

As Sirone dodged between the barrage of bullets, several shots hit Chaos5MinutesAgo.

Sparks flew from his body, and the durability of damaged areas appeared through augmented reality.

'Heh heh. Heh heh heh.'

Durability 482/500.

Though he'd been momentarily flustered by the abnormal situation, the difference in power shown by numbers was clear.

'His weapon has no power. If we're fighting at close range, I'm much more advantageous.'

And one more thing.

'I have this.'

When he activated the selective option that unlocked at level 20, 'Turbo', his output skyrocketed.

"Die!"

Since energy bullets were affected by output, the firepower was more than twice as strong as before.

"Grraahhh!"

As the speed of the barrage increased, Sirone scrunched his nose bridge and heightened his concentration.

Time gradually began to flow slowly...

'Specific pattern.'

The impact clusters of round flashes that looked like dandelions became clear.

'There.'

It was geometry unfolding in spacetime, and Sirone quickly found gaps and dove through them.

Chaos5MinutesAgo's heart sank with a thud.

"Waaahhhhh!"

Unable to bear his impatience, he wildly scattered bullets, but this only made things more comfortable for Sirone.

Finally, as Sirone approached right up to his nose, Chaos5MinutesAgo burst out shouting.

"Fine! Let's see who wins! You...!"

Bang!

Chaos5MinutesAgo's eyes shook, and the expressions of the party watching became blank.

Yahweh2, who they thought would engage in combat, had struck Chaos5MinutesAgo's face with his opposite fist.

"Gah!"

Chaos5MinutesAgo fell backward from the unexpected impact, and Sirone pressed down on his chest.

In Sirone's eyes as he aimed his gun barrel at the man's head, he could see the expression of a terrified man.

Silence flowed.

DestroyDemon707 muttered.

"Why, why isn't he shooting?"

"Is it because it's his first time killing someone? That guy seems sensitive about that kind of thing."

Sirone asked.

"What's your reason for attacking us?"

"What nonsense are you talking about? Gah!"

Chaos5MinutesAgo tried to raise his upper body, but Sirone pressed him down again with his foot.

"Apologize to DeathPrincess. Harming other people for no reason is a bad thing to do."

'What is this now?'

Chaos5MinutesAgo was dumbfounded.

'Is this a concept? No, I could win right now, couldn't I? My durability is much higher anyway.'

Smirking, he spread both arms as if expressing surrender and acted cheeky.

"Alright. I'll go apologize. Cut me some slack. I won't even come near you from now on."

DeathPrincess shouted.

"Don't believe him! That guy's trying to trick you!"

As Sirone didn't even budge, Chaos5MinutesAgo aimed his gun barrel upward.

"Of course, you idiot."

The moment he was about to fire an energy bullet, he saw Sirone's coldly chilled eyes.

'Huh?'

Killing intent.

In that moment, one thought flashed quickly through his mind, and Sirone's voice sounded unreal.

"Penetrate."

He was already a dead man.

"Wait, wait a minute...!"

Bang!

Sirone's shoulder jerked once, and the energy bullet shattered Chaos5MinutesAgo's head.

"Geh... Gehgeh!"

The mech that took the headshot convulsed like it was having a seizure, then stopped with mechanical sounds.

"Hey, Yahweh2."

DestroyDemon707's party, who had been running over, stopped walking.

'What's with that atmosphere?'

Looking down at the mech lost in thought, he seemed too serious for them to dare interrupt.

StrongestCodename said.

"Chaos5MinutesAgo's durability averaged 500. For Sirone's firearm to get a penetration judgment would take considerable time. He threw that question thinking that far ahead. From the beginning, whether they're human or whatever, he didn't seem to care. He has a thoroughly calculating personality."

Though they'd known each other for a short time, they could roughly guess what kind of temperament Yahweh2 had.

"Probably so. But..." DeathPrincess said.

"He looks too sad."

Who could it be?

What kind of life were they living in reality that they felt sadness even within a simulation?

Sirone smiled and turned his head.

"I won. Is everyone okay?"

As the heavy atmosphere lifted, DestroyDemon707's party finally began walking.

"That was amazing. You can even dodge energy bullets. Hey, aren't you a combat genius?"

"I was lucky. If Chaos5MinutesAgo had been clever, it would have been quite a difficult fight."

"What are you talking about? It was a perfect victory."

Sirone reviewed the battle.

"If it were me, I would have fought while retreating. Old-type joints can sprint forward at full power while watching the rear. It takes advantage of high output. I think he was in too much of a hurry to think that far. That's why I managed to take him down."

It was a difference in judgment.

"Underestimating the enemy, being careless thinking 'surely I won't lose' - these things also greatly affect combat. In the end, he just had a high level but wasn't particularly strong." DestroyDemon707's party thought of rankers.

'The AI system allows even combat novices to enjoy all content. That's its big advantage, but...'

You can't become a ranker just with that. Not those who rely on the system, but those who understand the system and thoroughly exploit it.

The ability to evade energy bullets was merely a secondary issue compared to that.

'He learns incredibly fast. Now even under the same conditions, we'd lose.'

It wasn't particularly unpleasant.

'Well, he did say he's a friend of Yolga's son.'

Then Sirone pointed at the ground and asked.

"There's something here?"

"Spoils of war!"

DeathPrincess clapped her hands and said.

"If you die while hostile behavior judgment is active, you can obtain spoils of war. Nobody can see it until you acquire it. What is it? What dropped?"

Sirone acquired the parts that had fallen on the ground.

"This? It's the right arm that guy was using. Maron company, Bolt Gun-Z204 model."

DestroyDemon707 burst into laughter.

"Bwahahaha! That guy dropped his most expensive piece. Serves him right. He must be boiling with rage right now."

"Can't it be restored? Then what about DeathPrincess's left arm?"

"Yeah. Spoils of war upon death or parts with 0 durability count as permanent loss. It's okay. My left arm is sold individually, so I can buy it from the shop."

"Hmm, then what should I do with this? Since it's a right arm, DeathPrincess can't use it either. Should I sell it and convert it to galactic currency?"

StrongestCodename said.

"That's possible too, but I don't recommend it. Shop sales have high commission fees. And trying to sell to users, it's not exactly a popular model. Mass-produced products usable at level 20 have their limits anyway."

DestroyDemon707 said.

"Don't do that, just use it yourself. That's the most profitable. Let's go to Atogram and find an engineer. We need to replenish ammunition anyway."

"Okay. But an engineer?"

"Shop items can be replaced immediately, but parts developed by users or spoils of war must be installed directly by an engineer. Large guilds even hire dedicated engineers."

"So that's what you meant by 'something I'll experience anyway.'"

"Right. Shop parts are good too, but legendary items and craftsman items are obtained through hunting or duels. Don't worry too much. Something like a right arm isn't even bizarre."

StrongestCodename added.

"Personally, eye replacement is the most annoying."

"Agreed."

The party that returned to Atogram purchased DeathPrincess's left arm and energy bullets from the Maron shop.

Next, they looked for an engineer.

"Parts shops have engineers too, but they're expensive. It's more profitable to commission users."

"Okay. Let's save money."

Even if galactic currency wasn't scarce, learning from the basics was Sirone's style.

When they entered the shop of 'Hermes', a famous engineer in Atogram, they saw a familiar face.

"Huh?"

Chaos5MinutesAgo was there with his companions, installing a newly purchased Bolt Gun.

Sirone tensed, but there wasn't the aggressive attitude like in Destroy.

DestroyDemon707 smirked.

"Did you get yourself a new part? So you ended up choosing a Bolt Gun again? Does it look good?"

"You bastard... You think this is over?"

Sirone searched for beginner tips.

Combat was impossible within cities unless special events were held.

'Hmm, so that's how it is.'

Chaos5MinutesAgo's companions gestured with their chins.

"Hey, are those the guys?"

"Yeah. Remember their faces clearly. You guys, choose East Country. We'll have a proper showdown."

Sirone checked their codenames.

'Chaos1MinuteAgo. Chaos2MinutesAgo...'

A mech with a round body and thick, long arms like a gorilla approached Sirone.

It was Chaos1MinuteAgo.

"Yahweh2, don't run into me on the battlefield. I'll smash you to pieces every time I catch you."

'Amara integrated type. Over level 70.'

While the party made tense expressions, Chaos1MinuteAgo walked toward the door.

"Let's go."

Chaos5MinutesAgo, who had finished repairs, went outside, and Sirone replaced his right arm.

The engineer said the output might not keep up, but one part should be fine.

When they came outside, it had grown dusky.

"Should we head to Freedom Plaza soon? It's annoying when those Chaos guys swarm us."

Following DestroyDemon707, they arrived at Freedom Plaza, which was packed with people.

Countless users were selling items, and there were people scouting guild members too.

"When are they coming?"

While waiting and checking the time through augmented reality, the plaza entrance became noisy.

"Wow! It's a ranker!"

Sirone's party's eyes naturally turned as well.

What was drawing the massive crowd was a petite woman about 160 centimeters tall.

Pale face, light purple hair covering half her back, bangs cut horizontally at eyebrow line.

There was no need to check her codename.

"It's Aegis."

She was a skilled player holding 8th place overall in the duel rankings that users rated most highly.

"Why did Aegis come to Atogram? Golden Ring members usually hang out in Nascasi."

"Right. Is there some event I don't know about?"

Aegis didn't even glance around and walked straight toward Sirone.

DestroyDemon707 swallowed nervously in his heart.

'Her mech is really slick. How much is all that worth? We could never afford it in our lifetime.'

Finally stopping, Aegis carefully confirmed Sirone's codename.

"Yahweh2..."

"Um, who are you?"

Aegis put both arms at her sides and bowed at the waist.

"Nice to meet you. I came under the boss's orders. Please come with me. I'll escort you."

Freedom Plaza was enveloped in tremendous silence.
