Shadow of God (3)

Ouroboros.

A concept that has long symbolized infinity, typically depicted as a snake eating its own tail as it grows.

As it continues forward, swallowing its tail, its body grows by the same amount, so there is no end.

But.

'I'll devour it all!'

Sirone's teeth gave Gyorgi no chance to recover, savagely chewing and swallowing the tail.

"Graaah!"

Gyorgi, veins bulging in his neck, desperately tried to amplify his evil power, but...

'It's impossible.'

Reversing momentum from an already broken balance was extremely difficult.

Perhaps it was the understanding of infinity.

The technical difference between Gyorgi, who was born with it, and Sirone, who experienced everything from nothing to one himself.

'Just that much.'

But that single difference collapsed the balance and created a cosmic gap.

Gyorgi stopped struggling.

Twenty thousand cycles of circulation proceeded in an instant, as light completely purified the darkness.

"Ahhh! We're falling!"

Citizens floating in the air crashed to the ground, followed by all the dust in the city pouring down.

Whoooosh.

In a landscape clothed in gray like fallen snow, Sirone twisted his body.

The Miracle Stream that had devoured the darkness circled around him briefly before slowly dissipating.

"Give up, Gyorgi. You can imitate my current state, but you cannot imitate my experience."

Gyorgi raised one corner of his mouth.

"That's right. I already know that Yahweh cannot be defeated through direct confrontation. Perhaps better than you."

"Then why?"

Extending his senses, Gyorgi realized that Miro no longer existed.

"Well... let's call it part of my tactics for now. And I wanted to clash with you at least once."

"Once?"

Sirone furrowed his brow.

"I don't understand. Do you think I'll give you a second chance?"

"Don't misunderstand, Yahweh."

Gyorgi opened the Devil's Bible.

"This Bible is unique in the underworld and is the source of all my abilities."

The pages turned by themselves.

"I don't have Hexa to begin with. The ability that allows me to face you is from the Book of Markina, Chapter 16, Verse 5: 'Thus chaos shall willingly become the shadow of God, and though trampled under God's feet, shall endlessly imitate His form.'"

Sirone noticed the Bible expanding to thousands of pages.

"Yes, as you guessed. The Devil's Bible contains countless abilities. Of course, they're inferior to yours."

Hexa contained infinite possibilities.

"What are you trying to say? So... you'll use all your techniques to face me?"

"That's one possibility. If you refuse to make a deal."

Gyorgi lifted a page.

"If you let me go as I am, I'll destroy this ability before your eyes. Additionally, the ability to imitate Hexa exists only in the Book of Markina, Chapter 16, Verse 5."

Sirone furrowed his brow.

'Destroy it? That must be the core ability that allowed him to become the leader of Catacomb.'

Sirone's demon wouldn't lie.

'And it's not a bad proposal either.'

Even if he could gain the upper hand in Taiji, having an opponent imitate Hexa was certainly troublesome.

'On the other hand, if he destroys the Book of Markina Chapter 16 Verse 5, I can respond actively no matter how he approaches.'

Sirone's eyes settled calmly.

'This guy...'

He really resembled himself.

'He calculated everything from the beginning. Testing his strength in battle, and if that failed, being able to make a deal, thinking I would accept this proposal...'

This was impossible without deeply understanding Yahweh.

That's why it was bitter.

'If he can think and judge like me...'

Couldn't he also understand his heart?

Gyorgi pressed him.

"You seem to have had enough time to think. It's about time you made a decision. The choice is yours."

Sirone didn't get drawn in.

'It's all bluffing anyway.'

Reading each other's thoughts was all too easy.

After being lost in thought for quite a while, Sirone exhaled deeply and spoke.

"This is the last time. There won't be a second."

"...Deal made."

Rip! The page of Chapter 16, Verse 5 was torn.

"Remember this, Yahweh. You may be stronger than me, but evil always triumphs over good."

Watching the departing enemy, Sirone quickly caught a paper blowing in the wind.

'The Devil's Bible.'

The verses from the Book of Markina were reflected in Sirone's sad eyes.

Having left the city, Gyorgi spotted someone waiting 20 meters ahead.

"So you survived?"

It was Gultan, a member of Catacomb's organization. Though he had changed into new clothes, he couldn't hide the burn scars on his face and hands.

"...That doesn't sound like a welcoming tone."

Gultan stood beside him, but Gyorgi didn't even glance at him as he continued forward.

"No, it's fortunate you prevented desertion. I just... didn't think you'd survive."

"Hmph, against some human girl."

Honestly, it had been close.

The limit of Gultan's movement range in quantum state was only about 100 meters.

To escape the mountain that Amy had set entirely ablaze, he had to re-quantum seven times.

The total time exposed to heat was less than a second, but it was still nearly fatal burns.

'I need treatment.'

Even as Gultan limped behind him, Gyorgi didn't slow his pace.

Though there was no camaraderie between demons anyway, Gultan was annoyed for different reasons.

"By the way, what happened with you, Gyorgi? Didn't you encounter Yahweh?"

"I did fight him. He was strong."

Gyorgi's condition seemed too intact for having fought such a fierce battle.

"Is that really all? You didn't deliberately avoid fighting, did you?"

"What do you mean?"

"Yahweh is certainly strong. But you should know methods for evil to triumph over good."

Gyorgi fell into thought.

'Do I hate Yahweh?'

If one being became two, those two would do everything in their power to kill each other.

'To become the only real one.'

But could that be called hatred?

"It's merely a retreat for perfection. Summon all Catacomb members within three days. We're revising our strategy."

"Understood."

Gultan was still suspicious but lacked the courage to press Gyorgi further.

Amy, Caden, and Maya landed in front of Sirone via spatial movement.

Amy asked.

"How did it go? What about Gyorgi?"

"For now... it ended in something like a draw. You won't need to worry for a while."

"A draw?"

Was that a possible outcome against a demon?

"Anyway, it seems things went well."

Seeing Maya and Caden standing side by side, Sirone roughly guessed the situation.

Maya approached awkwardly.

"I'm sorry for getting you involved in something dangerous because of me. I have no face to show you and Amy."

"It's okay. I'm glad you're safe."

Caden approached.

"Sirone, I..."

As soon as he entered range, Caden's right arm flew toward Sirone's face.

"Ugh!"

Sirone jerked his head back and asked.

"What's wrong?"

But the one who was startled was actually Caden, who began wrestling with his own right arm.

"Damn it! Stay still!"

Watching blankly, Sirone asked.

"What's happening?"

"Well..."

After hearing the situation from Amy, Sirone nodded.

"It's like alien hand syndrome."

As if by magic, Caden's right hand became still, and he turned with brightened eyes.

"Alien hand?"

"It's a problem in the brain's information processing stages. In the past, people mistakenly thought a god had possessed them, so they called it that. It's usually caused by trauma, as far as I know."

Caden's case was different.

'Emotions changing the body is common. But for the thinking mechanism itself to change...'

He could tell the intensity of stress Caden had experienced at that moment.

"Let's go to Bashka first and get you examined. I'll also look for treatment methods with Seriel."

"No, I like it this way. If I can protect Maya, I can give up anything."

Maya's face turned bright red.

Watching this scene warmly, Sirone straightened his expression and raised both hands.

'Miracle Stream.'

Streams of light gathered into two clusters in the air and seeped into Caden and Maya's heads.

"Hah!"

As Agape's light settled in their hearts, hot tears flowed down Maya's cheeks.

"Ah..."

It was Sirone's love.

"The emotional disease won't manifest for a while. But there's a condition. Maya and Caden, I need your help."

Maya nodded.

"I'll do anything I can. No, I'll accomplish even things I can't do."

Seeing Maya regain her vitality in front of Sirone made Caden's heart ache.

'I can't make Maya smile.'

The reason his right arm stayed still was perhaps because he couldn't even feel jealous of Sirone.

'Don't be greedy.'

Just because he found a way to protect her didn't mean he had escaped fate.

'If I become obsessed, Maya becomes endangered. Protecting her safely, thinking only of that.'

Setting aside personal emotions, Sirone's group left the city for their next mission.

"Take Maya to Bashka. I'll be waiting when you arrive at the royal castle."

After hearing about the simultaneous events, Caden gripped his sword hilt and said.

"Don't worry. Maya will be safe."

That would probably be true, but the person Sirone was actually worried about was Caden.

'It's not time to reveal it yet. This is better for now.'

The fate of the Red Cross, the true meaning contained in that law was told by Omega's history.

"Right. See you in the capital."

Caden, drawing his sword with his right hand freed from fate, activated spatial movement with Maya.

Looking up at the flash curving into the sky, Amy smiled warmly and said.

"Still, it worked out well. Caden gets to be with someone he likes."

Sirone couldn't bring himself to say that Caden should have given up on Maya instead.

Whiiiiing!

The sound of spatial movement that had been fading toward the horizon returned along the flash.

"Hm?"

An old man with an benevolent face hiding intensely shining eyes appeared with his hands clasped behind his back.

"Mr. Lampa."

It was Arnold Lampa, the world's greatest information mage.

"Five Great Stars."

With numerous matters to handle, there was only one reason he sought out Sirone and Amy's party.

"We found Uena Wizard."

As a natural awakener, the only person with the purity to stand against Havitz.

"So she was alive after all."

"Yes. She's currently in the Kingdom of Stang. The Ten Mages Council is conducting surveillance and security."

The System Inspection Department had five 1-star residents and an equal number of satellites.

These were called the Ten Mages Council, and unlike others, they were individuals trained by Freed.

Amy said.

"Finally, a real mission. What kind of child is Wizard? She's a girl, right? Is she cute?"

"Well..."

Having searched through his 112 years of life, Lampa's response was just two words.

"Yes, well."
