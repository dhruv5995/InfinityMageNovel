[686] The Incident Begins (1)

When one imagines events occurring in the most distant reaches of the universe, the definition of time becomes meaningless.

Because it is simply too far away.

And now, in that time period humanity could never reach, the most powerful explosion in the universe occurred.

A gamma-ray burst.

The explosion of a hypernova instantaneously released the energy that the sun would emit over 10 billion years, ejecting jets at near-light speed.

It was truly a powerful explosion.

Though lasting only a fleeting moment, it was enough to tear apart even the fabric of the universe itself—the very backdrop containing space-time.

And beyond that lightless veil, there was a single eye watching this universe.

Though the downpour had weakened, rain still coldly soaked Radum's ashen landscape.

In the middle of the ruins where most buildings had collapsed, Drakker glared at Rian, who lay fallen with broken limbs.

'What kind of bastard is this?'

His body buried under the debris wasn't moving even slightly, but it was obvious he would rise again.

Smile. Smile.

Hearing the endlessly resonating hallucination, Rian gripped the handle of his greatsword tightly.

'Am I not mistaken about something?'

Resurrection was familiar now.

But since it wasn't something just anyone could do, that very familiarity came rushing back as something enormously strange.

His body breaking, then recovering again.

'Maybe it was never broken or recovered from the beginning?'

Just like how dying a thousand times in a dream means nothing once you open your eyes, what if all of this had simply begun from a single misconception...

'Stop thinking about it.'

Rian, having finished recovering, slammed his greatsword into the ground and slowly rose to his feet.

'Things like the right answer don't matter.'

He just needed to do what he could do.

"I'll acknowledge that you're tenacious."

Drakker said as he strode forward, closing the distance.

"You probably would have won. If your opponent right now wasn't me, that is. That's your biggest failure."

If someone could stand up even with broken limbs, any enemy would collapse from exhaustion.

"Dragons have no limits to their stamina. If you're immortal, I'll destroy you endlessly here."

Dragons were known as life forms approaching the level of inanimate objects.

"Doesn't matter."

Rian aimed his greatsword at Drakker's forehead.

"You'll be smashed to pieces first."

As if it wasn't worth responding to, Drakker shot forward.

KWAKWAKWAKWAKWANG!

The collision between Dragon Speech and Axing devastated the area, but the balance of power was slightly in Drakker's favor.

'He's strong.'

That was Rian's honest assessment.

'But that's all he is.'

Drakker's might was based on racial strength, not skill, talent, effort, or training.

'It's not power you earned yourself.'

That's why he wasn't afraid.

Lions are born with the fate of predators, but visible force is merely something to adapt to.

What humans truly fear isn't something like that.

"I'll surpass you!"

The greatsword swung with Mach-level force distorted space, but Drakker's Dragon Speech didn't fall behind in power either.

"That's why you're weak—because you can't!"

The history of countless races trampled by Drakker proved that no one could defeat a dragon.

When Drakker's fist, moving faster than air, struck the greatsword with tremendous force, a massive bell-like sound rang out.

"Gugh!"

Pushed back by the enormous force, Rian crashed through a building's wall, flew through it, and burst through the opposite wall as well.

"I'll smash everything except your head."

Drakker, who had leaped over the entire building with tremendous jumping power, looked down at the ground with a puzzled expression.

"What?"

Rian, who should have at least had a broken arm, was taking a counterattack stance with clear eyes.

'He neutralized the impact?'

It was a perfectly new reaction, impossible without learning during combat.

'No. That's too short a time.'

It's known that human learning ability, which averages 10,000 hours to master a specific skill, is neither particularly high nor low compared to the entire biological spectrum.

The one advantage would be enlightenment through synthesis.

The probability of humans gaining enlightenment, large or small, from a specific event reaches as much as 0.000001 percent.

A figure far exceeding the average for all biological groups.

When you factor in a population of over 3 billion, you understand why humans are the species currently dominating the planet.

'No. He just got lucky blocking it once.'

Drakker shook his head.

It was merely racial statistics after all—he considered the probability of Rian adapting to dragon might through enlightenment to be extremely low.

"Can you block this too!"

Drakker launched an even more fierce offensive, but as time passed, Rian's reactions were becoming more agile.

'Is this even possible?'

And finally, the attack was blocked.

"Graaaah!"

Seeing Rian blocking the Dragon Speech without retreating even a single step, he realized the meaninglessness of probability.

'He's not an ordinary human.'

"Do you know how many times I've died so far?"

Rian, gripping his greatsword as if crushing Drakker, grimaced as he spoke.

"One thousand times."

Because it wasn't a bluff, Drakker felt creeped out.

People who experience near-death accidents live completely different lives afterward because they gained enlightenment from extreme experiences.

Having experienced actual death a thousand times, the intensity of Rian's error correction was unmatched in both the angle and depth of direction.

"Nonsense!"

Drakker, pushing Rian back, charged with burning eyes and rapidly swung his fists.

'Block it here.'

It was an endlessly repeated motion.

"A mere human!"

Drakker's pride was hurt.

Fists spread into afterimages came flying from all directions, but every attack was being blocked by Rian's sword.

'This one too, this one too, this one too.'

His body reacted before he could think.

'So this was it, Shirone. What I gained from dying a thousand times...'

Tears welled up at the enlightenment he felt for the first time in his life.

'You were constantly reborn every moment.'

He could see it.

'The position of my arms, my body's center, the rhythm of my heartbeat.'

No, it felt like he could see it.

'I may have no talent...'

Because he had experienced every failure the body could commit.

Drawing a great circle and finally returning, a self-portrait had been completed.

"UAAAAAAH!"

Rian burst out a roar of ecstasy.

He had wandered in a dark cave for a full 20 years without even thinking there might be an exit.

Maybe there was no path.

Even while thinking he might never escape, those were desperate years where he simply had to keep running.

'But there was one. There was, Shirone!'

There was an exit.

Throwing his body toward the light visible at the end of the cave, Rian finally felt the entire world rippling with the light of enlightenment.

"That still won't make you my match!"

Since insight transcends time, Drakker was also feeling Rian's transformation in his bones.

The Rian from moments ago and the current Rian were so different in temperament that they could be considered completely different people.

"No, he's human after all."

Dragon Speech.

Tyranny.

Drakker activated Dragon Speech that pushed his physical abilities to maximum and pressed Rian hard.

Though it was a technique that required enduring recoil even with a powerful dragon's durability, this wasn't a situation to consider other factors.

'Rather than die to a human, I'd rather end my own life!'

Dragon Slayer was the highest title humans could obtain, but conversely, for dragons it was a humiliation more terrible than death.

KUUUUUUNG!

When Drakker and Rian's attacks collided in the middle, the ground rippled like waves and created a massive circular shockwave.

Blood vessels bulged on Rian's face as he was struck by Tyranny's power.

"Graaaah!"

Even after gaining the greatest enlightenment of his life, having a stronger opponent was truly life's irony.

In the situation where they had been maintaining a balance of power, Drakker's upper body began gradually tilting toward Rian.

"Kekeke! You've lost. Die."

"It's not over yet."

As Rian rolled his eyes threateningly and raised his will for Divine Transcendence, Denai's phantom became even more grotesque.

"Th... this is...!"

The world spread beyond Rian's shoulder was rising up entirely and folding toward Drakker.

"It's called folding."

If the previous Single Sword bisected the world, the current Single Sword had the power to bisect a world folded in two.

As if gravity had doubled, tremendous pressure bore down on Drakker's body.

'It's cutting! It's cutting!'

From outside his field of vision, the world was being split at tremendous speed and rushing in.

Drakker felt fear for the first time in his life.

"KRAAAAH!"

Simultaneously, Rian's greatsword split the landscape.

"Grrrr..."

Feeling a cold wind at the center of his body was truly a terrible sensation.

As if it had all been an illusion, Denai disappeared and the landscape sutured together, with only Drakker's body being different from before.

"How dare... me..."

Even his voice split left and right, coming from both sides, and finally Drakker, split in two, collapsed to the ground.

"Huuuuu."

Rian, supporting his weight on the greatsword's handle while catching his breath, slowly straightened up and turned his neck.

"Am I now the strongest in Radum?"

There probably wasn't any particular need to attach meaning to it.

The race called dragon-humans was just a failed creation made from dragon experiments anyway.

'I can't become a Dragon Slayer with just this much.'

Just looking at Drakker's case, he could indirectly feel how powerful a race dragons were.

'But now I won't doubt.'

The schema gained after 20 years gave him confidence that he could overcome any obstacle that might come.

"But where's Shirone?"

Rian looked up at the dust cloud rising from Radum's center with a serious expression.

The mere fact that dust was rising through the rain was enough to guess what kind of impact had occurred there.

'Who did such an absurd thing?'

He had seen the Biotope collapse with his own eyes, but he'd been too focused on combat to analyze it mentally.

"Well, he must have had quite a fight."

Thinking was bothersome.

As Rian shouldered his greatsword and was about to head toward the new battlefield, a voice came from above.

"Did you finish him?"

Quan, embracing Venetia's waist, was looking down at the ground from the rooftop of a half-destroyed building.

After carefully examining Drakker, Rian reported.

"I'm not sure about finishing him, but I did split him in two for now."

"...Lightning must have struck from the sky."

Having worked as an investigator in Radum, Quan knew roughly what level the Three Administrators were at.

Flalino had never left the Biotope, but Drakker, whom he'd observed through intelligence operations, was definitely not an easy opponent.

"Puhu."

Rian let out a hollow laugh, shrugged his shoulders, and said.

"What a disappointing thing to say. Could lightning of that level bring down a dragon-human? It was a strike stronger than lightning."

'Why is he acting like that? Did he go crazy from fighting?'

Though he'd been stupid, he hadn't been a frivolous guy, so Quan tilted his head at his more excited appearance than usual.

"I opened it—my schema."

Finally understanding, he stared at Rian without even his gaze wavering.

"..."

That it wasn't some imaginary schema like before was proven by Drakker's corpse.

"Is that so?"

Picking up Venetia and jumping down from the building, he walked toward where Rian was.

From Kaizen Swordsmanship School through the duel with Rai to departing on his knight's journey.

Countless memories flashed by, but Quan only looked around the Biotope site and spoke briefly.

"Let's go."

Rian, savoring his words, smiled with satisfaction and nodded.

It had more impact than any other words.

"Yes."

The moment he answered, the two swordsmen kicked off the ground and soared into the air.
