The First Yora (3)

Time was approaching 9 PM.

In the basement of the cathedral that served as an engine room, storage, or hideout for rats, there was a smell of blood.

It was the scent of goblin blood, different from human blood.

"Kiiiii!"

Kido, gripping his double-bladed spear wide, rolled across the floor with his amber pupils flashing.

His spinning form looked like an antlion with dozens of blades attached.

"Divine Heaven Magic Arts."

Anchal's magic eye flashed.

"Herculean Giant."

The ceiling bricks sagged like water drops, then became a massive foot that stomped down on Kido.

Kido's eyes bulged as if they would pop out, and his body sank into the ground as if stamped into dirt.

Natasha moved.

'I blocked it.'

Her target wasn't Kido, but Woorin who was pressed tightly against the wall.

'I just need to kill that one, right?'

The moment she charged at sonic speed and thrust her hand blade toward Woorin's napeâ€”

"Kruuk!"

Kido, who had somehow pushed away the giant's foot, appeared blocking her path and grabbed Natasha's wrist.

Though he wasn't pushed back by the earthbound spirit's power, the sonic shockwave was fully transmitted.

"Wuek!"

Natasha turned her head to avoid Kido's blood splatter.

"...What a truly fascinating creature." Kido, covered in blood from head to toe, bared his sharp teeth and demonstrated his fighting spirit.

"Kruuuk!"

"You're slower than me, so how do you catch me?"

At that moment, Woorin's face turned deathly pale as she collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath.

"Haa. Haa."

She thought she was dead.

Because of the incredible speed, she had even felt the pain of Natasha's blade penetrating her throat.

'But... it was just an illusion?'

Since the battle began, she had experienced the same thing dozens of times, but she still couldn't get used to it.

The thing called death.

'I can't end like this. I must live.'

Shirone.

"Kido."

The moment words leaked through her clenched teeth, Rai slashed at Kido's side.

"Kuk!"

Though Kido's pupils wavered, Rai was displeased by the lukewarm feeling of the strike.

'I couldn't cut through.'

At the moment the blade entered, Kido had activated tremendous flexibility to deflect the sword's trajectory.

'More sensitive than me?'

No, he had blocked the giant's tremendous strength and was even tracking Natasha's speed that was hard to follow with the eyes.

'He's a monster in a different sense.'

Woorin asked.

"Kido, are you okay?"

"Yeah."

"Save me. I must live. You know that, right?"

"Yeah."

Since only Shirone lived in her heart, she felt no disappointment.

However.

'Water...'

Her throat was dry again.

'Why is this happening?'

Like when she guarded Andre's labyrinth, the feeling that she would wither away if she didn't fill something.

"Haak!"

Almost instinctively, Kido opened his mouth wide and bit the arm of Natasha he was holding.

"Slurp! Suck!"

While he tore the flesh with his fangs and sucked the flowing blood, Natasha remained motionless.

Then, as Kido raised his head with glistening lips, she slowly backed away and asked.

"...Does my blood taste good?"

"How foolish."

Rai approached, letting his sword droop.

"That creature feeds on others' memories. That guy's skills are made up of countless others' talents. To so easily hand over your avatar arts. The battle will become much more difficult now."

"Really?"

Natasha shrugged her shoulders.

"But I was curious. What it would feel like to have my body eaten by another creature."

Though they had no reason to cooperate since they were from different countries anyway, Rai was displeased.

"You're handing over your talent just out of curiosity?"

"Haha! Is that so?"

Deciding she wasn't someone he could reason with, Rai sighed and looked back at Kido.

'Did he absorb it after all?'

Even his gaze had changed, and indeed Natasha's blood was traveling through Kido's veins, transmitting memories.

'This woman.'

Kido's nose bridge wrinkled.

"Genius...

...before that."

"Just how much have you trained?"

The number of walls she had to overcome to activate the Death God's martial arts while her spine was severed was...

"Who knows."

It wasn't something Kido could dare absorb.

"I just did it until it worked." Rai's face contorted.

'Until it worked?'

Wasn't that contradictory?

'Do it until it works and it'll work? That's exactly why the world is unfair. That's why we talk about talent.'

Rai suddenly stopped his thoughts.

Talent, talent, talent.

'Ryan, that fool...'

He was a swordsman without even a fingernail's worth of talent.

Natasha said.

"What? Can't do it, I see. I was looking forward to seeing how a goblin dances. Well then, shall we start again?"

"Cough!"

Fresh blood spurted from Kido's throat again.

"Kido!"

Woorin's irritated voice pulled his consciousness back from death.

'I know, I know.'

That he couldn't even die as he pleased anymore.

"Kruuk."

As Kido gathered his scattering consciousness and was about to leap out again, Natasha stopped walking.

"Ah, I see."

Then she pointed at Woorin and asked.

"You love this woman, don't you?"

It seemed like she was saying how could a mere goblin love an empress...

"Come at me."

Kido's heart was growing ever more parched.

At that moment.

"Yes."

Anchal's voice was heard.

"Yes, it's fine. Please speak."

Though only her bell-shaped earring swayed, she seemed to be conversing with someone.

"I haven't finished dealing with them yet. But now soon... Yes, I understand. Yes, I'll do that."

It was an order to return to the Divine Heaven Sector.

'To let go of prey I'd already caught.'

Though the Empress of Kashan would have been a tremendous catch, Anchal had no complaints about this order either.

'Is it really true? To Pamagwangcheonseong...' Because there was nothing more important than rescuing Divine Heaven's princess, Jinseongeum.

"Your Majesty."

Anchal, who was about to say something to Woorin, shook her head as if it was pointless and stepped back.

'Princess, please endure just a little longer.' An ominous ghost gate was born and her body disappeared as if sucked into the spirit realm.

Breaking the silence, Natasha spoke.

"I'm done too. The time Balkan mentioned has passed. Tormia can have the empress."

Rai said nothing.

Though the Gustav 4th Knights weren't sane to begin with, he was a soldier who obeyed orders.

'The problem is...'

That he could never handle Kido with his strength alone.

"Let's go. We need to escape now."

Kido, pulling Woorin's arm, moved stealthily while watching the two people.

Natasha waved her hand.

"Cheer up. Actually, even I can see you don't have looks that women would like, but what matters is the heart."

Though she had no eyelids to express it, she seemed to be smiling with her eyes.

"Kiiiii."

Kido left a threatening sound as he disappeared into the darkness, but Natasha felt relieved.

"Shall I get going too?"

"Wait."

Rai called out.

"Hm?"

"Did you say just do it until it works?" Natasha, knowing what Rai's words meant, made a troubled expression.

'Daphne.'

After being defeated by Ryan, she too now understood defeat somewhat.

"Sorry. I didn't mean it that way. It's just... in my case, that's what I meant."

Rai was prickly.

"No need to pity me. What I want to know is fact and truth. Do you really think that way?"

"Hmm, if you're asking that seriously. Yeah, that's right. I just did it until it worked. Honestly, I think that's everything. I became more certain after fighting that person."

"That person?"

"Someone called Ogent Ryan..." Rai's eyebrow twitched.

"Right, if you're a fellow swordsman you'd know. I heard he's unrivaled in swordsmanship."

"Of course I know. He's my younger brother."

"Ooh."

Natasha pursed her lips.

"You're really Ryan's older brother? But you're completely different."

"What do you mean?"

"Exactly this. You put meaning into every single word. That guy was the complete opposite. Your hair color is different too, and I just couldn't make the connection." She pointed to herself.

"I lost to Ryan."

'Is that so.'

Having seen Natasha's power with his own eyes, he could tell how high Ryan stood.

"That was the first time I learned what defeat was. Probably the reason that person could beat me was because he aimed for a higher place than I did."

"Being the greatest swordsman is everyone's dream. But not everyone can become the greatest. I don't think my efforts fall behind that guy's. If doing it until it works is everything, then why can't everyone become strong?"

Natasha chuckled.

"You really don't know anything."

"What?"

"Sorry. I'm not looking down on you. Actually, I'm a dancer so it's a different field, but I think the meaning of 'doing it until it works' is different from working hard or doing it efficiently."

"Then what is it?"

Natasha raised her index finger.

"It means doing everything you possibly can." Rai was dazed.

"When you've learned something, it means you've carved that technique into your body. So what should you carve it with? As far as I know, there's only one thing. Pain."

Natasha continued.

"Humans are selfish, so they have the habit of repeating the same mistakes. That's why we carve it with pain. Because..."

Natasha said, recalling years of perseverance.

"Humans absolutely never repeat the same pain."

Rai frowned.

'Is she saying I'm lazy?'

Perhaps that might have been true, but since being overtaken by Ryan, he had never once pursued comfort.

"I..."

"Yeah, I know."

Natasha knew what he was trying to say.

"But you keep repeating that difficult work. If you can do again whatever you did, it means it wasn't painful enough. Of course your skills will improve, but that level won't let you overcome walls."

Walls.

Something Ryan had but he didn't.

'Is that so?'

That guy, every single moment...

"Want to overcome walls?"

Natasha said.

"Then carve your techniques into your body. With pain so terrible you could never do it again. When it hurts so much that you're certain you could never do this again..."

She moved her index and middle fingers to draw a parabola.

"That's when humans surpass their limits."

"That guy, every single moment..."

Had he been pushing himself into realms that could never be repeated?

Seeing Rai's dazed expression, Natasha turned around.

"Well then, goodbye."

"Wait."

"What now?"

Natasha turned around with an annoyed expression.

"Why are you telling me this? Tormia is Gustav's enemy nation, and at the cathedral..."

"Why make it so complicated? It's good when we tell each other things and help each other. You like swords too, don't you?"

As Rai still stood with an uncomprehending face, she sighed.

"You really are different. Even though you're brothers."

Soon a bitter smile formed on her lips.

"...Maybe because you don't seem like strangers?"

It was true that from Rai's jealousy and impatience, she was reminded of her old friend Daphne.

Though Daphne had broken Natasha's back, Rai hoped for a different outcome.

"I hope things work out for you. Then really goodbye, Mr. Sensitive."

She too disappeared into the darkness, and in the empty basement Rai muttered.

"Mr. Sensitive?"

Then suddenly he frowned and drove his sword into the hard stone floor.

"Damn it! She's looking down on me!"
