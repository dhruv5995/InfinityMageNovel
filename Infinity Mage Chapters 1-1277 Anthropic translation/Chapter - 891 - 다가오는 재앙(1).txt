The Approaching Calamity (1)

The Valkyrie 2nd Corps, which had begun marching from various locations across the central continent, assembled at the Kanian Plateau.

Tess, who had been gazing at the rocky terrain stretching to the horizon, turned her head toward Lian.

"What happened to Shirone?" Common sense dictated that he should have already finished reporting to the Ivory Tower and returned by now.

"I don't know. But he'll be fine." Shirone is strong.

However, the fact that even the Holy Temple hadn't been able to locate Yahweh's whereabouts was troubling.

'Why didn't he go to the Ivory Tower? Or was he unable to go?'

For Lian, Shirone was his top priority to protect.

Knowing this fact, Tess asked:

"Are you sure it's okay to stay here?" Lian kept his mouth shut.

Though he desperately wanted to search for Shirone, he couldn't leave knowing Havitz's abilities.

'And Natasha.'

She moved at unparalleled speed, and without Lian, it would be impossible to even keep her in check.

'She'll come looking for me.'

From the demons' perspective, the Knight of Maha was the core Valkyrie factor that needed to be dealt with first.

"We just need to hold out for one day."

When the changed orders came from the Holy Temple, the entire 2nd Corps seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.

"I'll stop Natasha. But I can't hold back Havitz as well. Be careful, Tess."

Tess swallowed hard, thinking of Vanishing.

"Don't worry. I'll keep my wits about me."

Though staying alert wouldn't be enough to stop it, there was no other option anyway.

"Will Amy be okay?"

Finding Amy in the barracks spread across several kilometers would be difficult.

"She's with the magic corps, so she'll move frequently according to strategy. Maybe we'll meet during battle."

Lian spoke with forced composure.

Once battle began, everyone would have to pour everything into their own missions.

'No one can take someone else's place.'

Saving oneself was the only way to survive this hell.

"Amy..."

Tess sent a message from her heart to her friend, who was somewhere out there steeling her resolve.

'Let's make sure we both survive.'

With the return of the dropouts and the Holy Temple's changed orders, the army's morale soared to the heavens.

And as the appointed time approached, military discipline became a cold blade pointed at the enemy lines.

"Whew."

Amy's 6th Battalion was positioned at the rear of the vanguard, tasked with providing fire support.

'I can do this.'

Iruki said she would die.

She had no objection to that, but Amy believed in what she had accomplished more than anything else.

'Fight!'

As she sprang to her feet and left the barracks, her troops were waiting for her.

"Battalion Commander, it's time." From the eyes of the troops who had overcome their fear, Amy realized no long speeches were needed.

"Let's go."

Amy's unit joined the 20,000-strong vanguard force that was split between left and right flanks.

Support would go to whichever side collapsed first, and from that point on, they couldn't expect orders from above.

"All troops, listen!"

The vanguard was led by Brigadier General Taigang, a famous swordsman from the central continent.

"The enemy we're about to face is...!" A massive dust cloud began rising from the horizon, and the ground started to shake.

"General."

There wasn't even time for farewells.

'Yes, this is war.'

Taigang, who had been calmly watching the dust cloud ahead, turned toward his troops and smiled.

"It was an honor to serve with you all."

His feelings reached the troops' hearts faster than words, and their eyes became bloodshot.

"Waaaaah!"

As if pushed by the battle cry, Taigang spurred his horse forward, drew his sword, and shouted:

"Kill them!"

It was the beginning.

On the plateau where strategy and tactics were useless, the distance between humans and demons gradually closed.

'They're coming!'

Amy's unit, charging from the center, saw shadows hidden in the dust cloud.

"Graaaah!"

An army of 200 million, too vast to take in with the eyes, was charging forward with tremendous roaring.

"Hnngh..."

A groan inevitably escaped between Amy's clenched teeth.

Fear.

But it was okay.

'That's enough. I've made it this far.' From now on, what would move the army wasn't flimsy will or resolve, but irreversible momentum.

"Begin bombardment!"

Following Amy's orders, hundreds of mages fired flames toward the front.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

And then, everything was trampled.

Valkyrie Command.

"Reporting! The 3rd Division under the 2nd Corps assembled at Kanian Plateau has been annihilated!"

The commander asked:

"What's the estimated damage?"

"Exact assessment is impossible. Based on calculations per unit area, we estimate over 30,000 casualties."

"Hmm."

As breathing that sounded like lungs with holes spread through the room, Iruki bit his nails.

"30,000."

It had only been two hours since the battle began.

'We need to hold out 22 more hours.'

The most miserable part was that they couldn't provide any assistance to the 2nd Corps.

'Don't think about what can't be done.'

Iruki stood up and walked to the other side of the table to examine the map.

"Forget the plateau battle. What we need to think about now is the counterattack. How's the deployment?"

"It's complete. The optimal location is here." Iruki's eyes, as he examined the location the commander pointed to, were colder than ever.

Six hours after the battle began.

'What?'

Amy, who had gotten up covered in dust, watched the world spinning around her.

'Where am I?'

Kanian Plateau.

'What am I doing right now?' In the middle of a war.

Though answers immediately came from the back of her mind, it felt unreal, as if blocked by a barrier.

'Am I alive?'

She knew that activating self-image memory would restore her shocked mental state.

But her instincts refused.

'Why am I here?'

She didn't want to come to her senses.

What her instincts wanted was to go completely mad and remain in a state where she couldn't comprehend anything.

"Graaaah!"

One-meter-tall demons with jagged teeth bared rushed at Amy.

Fire ignited in her red eyes, and Amy, momentarily coming to her senses, twisted her body to dodge the attack.

As the shocking reality registered, tremendous stress flooded in, threatening to tear her brain apart.

"Grrrrr!"

But she didn't go mad.

"Kihehehe! A survivor! A survivor!"

Amy, flames rising from both hands, roasted the demons that charged at her one after another.

"Battalion Commander!"

At the familiar voice, she turned to see Berik and 14 others limping toward her.

"You guys!"

It felt like meeting God in hell.

"Are you okay? You're injured!"

Berik's right wrist was gone, and in the rush to escape, it hadn't even been bandaged.

"I'm fine. Please evacuate quickly. We're already quite far from the main force."

"You'll die if you lose more blood here." Amy tore her uniform into strips, wrapped it around Berik's forearm, and tied it tightly.

"Ahhhhh!"

Extreme pain struck as nerves were compressed, but this wasn't the time to worry about such things.

"There. Are these all the survivors?"

The 1st Squad Leader said:

"We don't know. These are all the troops we encountered on our way here."

Amy nodded and activated her red eyes.

'Where are we?'

Even without knowing the starting point, her self-image memory accurately calculated their current coordinates.

Amy pointed west.

"The main force is that way. Follow me from now on. We'll avoid combat as much as possible, so take good care of the wounded."

The escape operation began.

The power of her red eyes guided them in any situation, but they couldn't completely avoid the demons filling the sky and earth.

They lost three troops in several small skirmishes, and two hours later, one more fell in battle.

"Hah! Hah!"

A distance that wouldn't be impossible if they could go straight.

'I'll never give up.'

The thought of having to circle the same spot like a tangled thread was so frustrating it felt like she might go insane.

As the sun was setting, Amy finally heard the distant rumble of battle.

"We're here! We made it. Everyone hang in there just a little longer."

Since the demons were frantically advancing, circling around to the main force shouldn't be a problem.

"Kukuku! Found you."

At the voice from the sky, Amy's face went pale and despair filled her troops' eyes.

"I missed you."

The demon with a bull's head, hanging from the legs of a strange bird, raised the corners of his mouth wickedly.

'Of all times...'

Division Commander Parkma, whom she had fought before.

'No, this isn't a coincidence.'

Parkma, gripping a massive axe with both hands, fell from the sky with a thud.

"Did you think you could escape?"

His side, where Amy had hit him, still throbbed.

"I told you, didn't I? I'd carve your face into my memory even if I had to gouge out my own retinas. You know what? I haven't killed anyone since then. Because I've been searching for you." Amy bit her lip as she surveyed the rear.

'We're almost there.'

Fighting the energetic Parkma when everyone was exhausted would be suicide.

"What you want is me, right?"

Parkma, realizing what Amy wanted to say, smiled sinisterly.

"No. What I want is to do what you hate most. For example..."

Parkma suddenly lunged forward and swung his massive axe, decapitating the wounded troops.

"Something like this?"

Amy's face contorted with rage, and the survivors launched a coordinated attack.

"Dieeeee!"

Flames and ice rained down, but Parkma didn't even try to dodge, taking the hits head-on as he approached.

"Kuku! Looks like you took quite a beating? You're much weaker than before."

The massive axe showed no mercy, and eventually everyone except Amy and Berik fell in battle.

"Now, with no one in the way, shall we get to our homework?"

As Parkma approached with thundering steps, Berik blocked Amy's path.

"Please go, Battalion Commander. I'll buy you time."

That's what Amy had wanted to say.

"You go. I'll handle this."

"I don't think that's possible. You know my skills aren't enough to make it back to the main force."

"I'm the commander. This is my responsibility."

"...Humans die anyway."

"What?"

As Parkma rested his axe on his shoulder and watched, Berik turned around.

"My father told me that when you have to make a difficult choice, remember that every life ultimately ends in death. Then you can make the truly right choice."

Berik turned back around.

"Of course I want to live. But if I can't, then I want to make the right choice."

Amy gritted her teeth.

"The right choice? Dying in my place is the right choice?"

"No."

Berik slowly stood up.

"Since I was born a man anyway, isn't it better to look cool in front of the woman I love?"

Since I'm going to die anyway.

"I was so happy when you returned to the unit. Because you chose us over your boyfriend. Honestly..."

Berik turned around with a sad smile.

"I felt like I had beaten that blessed bastard." "Go. You deserve to live. And I... I'll become an incredibly cool man."

Berik kicked off the ground and charged.

"Forever."
