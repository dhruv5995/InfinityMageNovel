[553] The Power of a Day (2)

D

63 days.

The fierce winds of competition swept over all the graduating students, and Dorothy was no exception.

At school, she always wore a dreamy expression that earned her the nickname "4D girl," but the eyes reflected in her large glasses as she disassembled her tin doll were clearer than ever before.

The name of the tin doll she was working on was Hickory.

For her, a Manipulation-type Zoner, it was as precious as life itself and the core of the magic she wielded.

'I need to evolve the algorithm.'

Though she had finished the first-half graduation schedule and risen to the upper ranks of Class Two, the threshold to Class One remained high.

Considering that several freshmen from Class Three had already advanced to Class One, it was enough to keep her awake at night.

Hickory, connected through the Spirit Zone, began clanking around the room.

Since handling algorithms meant controlling the process before the result, she could verify its operation without needing to conduct combat experiments.

Hickory, which looked like junk from every angle, lifted its heavy body into the air and lit up its round eyes.

'Dorothy Algorithm applied. Version 4.3.'

With a loud siren sound, Hickory's neck spun rapidly, but before long it crashed to the ground with vibrations.

Dorothy's expression became bland and emotionless again as she watched Hickory with its broken neck.

"......"

Too annoyed to even think about setting it upright again, she went to bed and pulled the covers over her face.

Strange groaning sounds began leaking out from under the blanket.

61 days.

"More! Faster! Too slow!"

"Uaaaah!"

As Screamer unleashed a barrage of punches with all his might, the thick iron-cored sandbag swayed heavily.

The leather filled with sand had circular target points marked on it, with numbers indicating the sequence of the combo.

"Is that all you've got! How are you going to become champion like this!"

Pyroker, who had volunteered as coach, shouted into his son's ear.

Pyroker, who held an important position in the Tormia Kingdom's heavy infantry and had even obtained a professional Colosseum license, was a fighting fanatic with a record of 21 wins and 2 losses out of 23 matches.

However, he had temporarily left the fighting world after the shock of losing to a mage in an event match hosted by the kingdom, and the story of Screamer deciding to enter magic school after pathetically watching that match was famous within the family.

"Damn it!"

Screamer's face, carrying out the Iron Fist Project created by Pyroker, clearly showed traces of pain.

Seven consecutive strikes that had to be packed into a split second continued endlessly through thousands of cycles.

"Uaaaah!"

The impact sounds of the combo rang out crisply, but Pyroker got even angrier.

"Your accuracy dropped! More precise, faster, stronger!"

It was an unreasonable demand when even moving his arms was difficult.

"Don't stop! Hit it! Install combos in your instincts that can knock down anyone once they connect!"

Repeating the same motion endlessly made specific parts of his body feel like they were tearing.

'How am I supposed to hit even faster than this!'

Even though his irritation was rising beyond the limits of pain, Pyroker remained unwavering.

"Is it hard? But what can you do? I'm not suffering at all."

'Should I really fight him!'

"Want me to tell you an amazing fact? Nobody cares about your pain. People don't even care how hard you struggled. A fighter who can't produce results is just a sandbag!"

"Uaaaaah!"

Screamer, having lost his reason, threw a powerful straight punch and stopped training, but the heavy sandbag didn't even budge.

"Huff! Huff!"

He was so out of breath it felt like it might flow backward.

"Who told you to rest? Hit it quickly!"

"...Just one minute. Let me rest for just one minute."

Pyroker's expression softened as he spoke in a gentle voice.

"You want to get stronger, right? Should I tell you how to get stronger?"

When Screamer looked up, his father's face turned demonic again.

"There's no such thing, you idiot! Looking around for methods is just making excuses! You know why? Because the method to get stronger is so simple even a three-year-old knows it! Hit! Get stronger! Hit! Get even stronger!"

'My arms won't move...'

The one-minute rest was actually causing muscle cramps.

"Can't do it? Then admit it cleanly! Just stand on the side and clap when the champion passes by!"

"This damn...!"

Seething with anger, Screamer pushed the sandbag away to create distance, then immediately rushed in and unleashed a barrage.

"Do it properly! Accuracy! Accuracy!"

59 days.

Shirone's appearance, sitting cross-legged on a rock overlooking the stream, had become gaunt and emaciated over the past few days.

Having eaten only the grass porridge Miro made, with all the nutrients consumed entirely by his brain, his already light body had lost 3 kilograms.

'I can't think of anything.'

He wanted to pull out his brain and throw it in the trash.

Excluding 3 hours of sleep, this was his only rest time.

At first, he wondered what help it could be for training, but recently he had clearly realized it was helpful.

Without even these 4 hours of meditation, he would have died from fatigue or gone insane and committed suicide.

'Nothing is trivial. We just don't try to look into it.'

Recalling Miro's words, he looked at the scenery before him, but couldn't understand what exactly he was supposed to look into.

'A leaf is hanging there. It's swaying because the wind is blowing.'

He saw a spider building its web between the branches.

'What does that spider think about while living?'

As he watched endlessly, the sunset began.

'Night is coming. I wonder if the spider ate something.'

The spider must have eaten something too.

It was an utterly obvious fact, but since he had never looked into it before, it was quite interesting.

"Shirone, let's start night training."

When Miro's voice flowed gently, his heart felt like it dropped with a thud.

Four hours outside hell were shorter than one hour in hell.

"...Yes."

Shirone let out a small sigh and followed Miro toward the training hall.

D

55 days.

The annex prepared in the Tormia royal castle was as splendid and grand as a noble's mansion.

Pony, the magic school's only royalty, threw herself into the pool of the specially modified annex.

When she emerged from the water soaking wet, the maids stamped their feet while holding towels.

"Miss, please rest for today. What if you catch a cold doing this?"

"It's fine. That's enough for today, go inside and rest."

"But..."

"That's an order."

Startled by the cold words, the maids arranged the towels and left the pool area.

"Huuuuu!"

Pony swept her blonde hair left and right according to her part, then entered the Spirit Zone.

As the propeller installed in the pool rotated, numerous whirlpools formed.

Her major was hydraulics, category: rapids.

The goal of this training was to completely go against the water flow created by the machine.

'I'll become strong.'

Royalty is noble, and therefore does not labor.

But that was only a privilege of the direct line; for Pony, who could not ascend to the throne, it did not become a life goal.

'Royalty. I don't need authority that others have named for me.'

When she cast rapids magic, the water flow changed rapidly, and as the mechanical device set higher than the limit pushed back, her eyes lost focus.

'I'll do it! I'll establish my own authority myself!'

The sight of foam rising above the water surface looked as if the water was boiling.

51 days.

Shirone's sequence finally began to surpass the trillion range.

When he broke through 1.2 trillion, the light of Shining became a brilliant radiance, and Miro carefully observed the change.

'Change is definitely being detected. But it's still far from reaching the singularity.'

When one reaches the state of unity between self and object, the individuality of Shining influences the law.

Currently, it was impossible to predict what that individuality might be, but the scope of change could be said to be quite significant.

"Kuuuuu!"

In the repetitive training, Shirone's sequence extended endlessly without knowing its limits.

Surpassing 1 trillion to reach 2 trillion, then 3 trillion - the scope of growth spoke to Shirone's talent, but the境 境 境 (境 境 境) was still far away.

"Huk!"

Screaming his death throes, Shirone fell to his knees.

It seemed like he heard a popping sound from his head, and then no thoughts came to mind at all.

"Huk..."

Without realizing it, his face turned into a crying expression.

'It's hard. Too hard.'

Though he had fought countless battles, fighting against himself was completely different in concept.

Defeating oneself probably meant killing oneself.

In a state where he could neither die nor live, he had to advance even one step further than yesterday.

He had died as many times as the number 3 trillion, and now he was at his limit.

"I don't think I can meet the deadline."

"That again? I told you there's no need to think."

"My head is dizzy. If I could just sleep a little and wake up..."

"Do it!"

When Miro shouted, Shirone raised his head with eyes full of hostility.

Miro's beautiful face now looked like a hideous witch.

"You say there's no time, then want to sleep? Continue. All other thoughts are delusions."

"I might really die."

"I told you not to act spoiled."

The corners of Shirone's mouth turned down pitifully.

"When you think it's unreasonable, remember only this. Even at this very moment, someone somewhere is striving with the resolve that they don't mind dying. There are countless people who want to become strong even if it means risking their lives or selling their souls to demons. There's no reason you must claim the glory of victory while leaving them behind. If time is insufficient, just reduce your sleep time."

Even now he was only sleeping 3 hours, but Miro's words were as firm as a blade.

"It's okay, even if I reduce it by about an hour..."

"You won't die! You won't die, Screamer!"

"Uaaaah!"

As if trying to erase Pyroker's voice, Screamer screamed while hitting the sandbag.

But the more he did so, the more intense his father's whipping became.

"Don't cling to talent! Don't take pride in the effort you've made! Fight only for yourself!"

"Uaah! Uaaaah!"

As the seven-hit combo repeated without rest, the heavy sandbag began to sway with creaking sounds.

'Get stronger! Stronger than I was one second ago!'

Tomorrow's me will be stronger than today's.

Gritting his teeth and throwing punches, all the blood vessels in Screamer's upper body were bulging.

D

48 days.

Shirone desperately suppressed his mind from flying away.

'4.3 trillion. 6.7 trillion. 11.9 trillion.'

A small thrill appeared on Miro's face, which had been watching indifferently until now.

'It's accelerating.'

It was proof that his mind and body were beginning to endure the current training.

When he surpassed 12 trillion, Shirone collapsed with a thud.

"Again. Start from the beginning."

"Uaaaaaaaah!"

As vicious emotions welled up and he screamed involuntarily, his body responded to Miro's words as if hypnotized.

"Shirone, success is the sum of failures. You pile up failures to leap over the wall of success."

'14.4 trillion! 19.8 trillion! 24.6 trillion!'

Blood dripped from Shirone's nose, but Miro paid no attention and looked somewhere higher than his head.

Where the shimmer of light rose, a golden angel was spreading its wings wide.

'The world is watching you. It's do or die. You can do it, Shirone. If I can do it, you can too.'

Ten days later, Shirone's sequence broke through the first target point of 1 quadrillion.

Days remaining until magic school reopened.
