[553] The Power of a Day (2)

D

63 days.

The harsh winds of competition had blown over all the graduating students, and Dorothy was no exception.

She always walked around school with a dazed expression, earning her the nickname "4-dimensional girl," but the look in her eyes behind her large glasses as she disassembled a tin doll was sharper than ever before.

The name of the tin doll she was working on was Hickory.

For her, a Manipulation-type Zoner, it was as precious as life itself and the core of the magic she wielded.

'I need to evolve the algorithm.'

Though she had finished the first-semester graduation schedule and risen to the upper ranks of Class Two, the threshold to Class One still remained high.

Considering that several freshmen from Class Three had already advanced to Class One, it was enough to keep her awake at night.

Hickory, connected through the Spirit Zone, began moving around the room with clanking sounds.

Since handling algorithms meant controlling the process before the results, there was no problem confirming whether it worked without conducting combat experiments.

Hickory, which looked like junk no matter how you looked at it, lifted its heavy body into the air and lit up its round eyes.

'Dorothy Algorithm applied. Version 4.3.'

Making loud siren sounds, Hickory's head spun rapidly, but before long it crashed to the ground with vibrations.

Watching Hickory with its broken neck, Dorothy's expression became blank and emotionless again, as if she had no thoughts.

"......"

Too annoyed to even think about setting it upright again, she went to bed and pulled the covers over her face.

Strange groaning sounds began leaking out from under the blanket.

61 days.

"More! Faster! Too slow!"

"Uaaaah!"

As Screamer poured all his strength into a flurry of punches, the heavy sandbag with thick iron core swayed heavily.

The leather filled with sand had circular target points marked on it, with numbers indicating the sequence of the combo attacks.

"Is that all you've got! How are you going to become champion like this!"

Pyroker, Screamer's father who had appointed himself as coach, shouted right into his son's ear.

Pyroker, who held an important position in the Tormia Kingdom's heavy infantry and was a fighting fanatic who had even obtained a Colosseum pro license, was a skilled fighter with a record of 21 wins and 2 losses out of 23 matches.

However, he was currently away from the fighting world due to the shock of losing to a mage in an event match hosted by the kingdom, and the story of how Screamer, who had watched that match pathetically, declared he would enter magic school was famous within the family.

"Damn it!"

The face of Screamer, who was carrying out the Iron Fist Project created by Pyroker, clearly showed traces of pain.

Seven consecutive strikes that had to be packed into a split second continued endlessly through thousands of cycles.

"Uaaaah!"

The impact sounds of the combo rang out crisply, but Pyroker got even angrier instead.

"Your accuracy dropped! More precise, faster, stronger!"

It was an unreasonable demand when even moving his arms was difficult.

"Don't stop! Hit it! Install combo attacks in your instincts that would knock down anyone once they connect!"

Repeating the same motion endlessly made specific parts of his body hurt as if they were tearing.

'How am I supposed to hit even faster than this!'

Even though his irritation was rising beyond the limits of pain, Pyroker remained unwavering.

"Is it painful? But what can you do? I'm not in pain at all."

'Should I really fight him!'

"Want me to tell you something amazing? Nobody cares about your pain. People don't even have interest in how hard you worked. A fighter who can't produce results is just a sandbag!"

"Uaaaaaaah!"

Screamer, who had lost his reason, threw a strong right hook and stopped training, but the heavy sandbag didn't even budge.

"Huff! Huff!"

He was so out of breath it felt like it might come back up.

"Who told you to rest? Hit it quickly!"

"...Just 1 minute. Let me rest for just 1 minute."

Pyroker's expression softened as he spoke in a gentle voice.

"You want to get stronger, right? Want me to tell you how to get stronger?"

When Screamer looked up, his father's face turned into a demon again.

"There's no such thing, you idiot! Looking around for methods is just making excuses! You know why? Because the method to get stronger is so simple even a three-year-old knows it! Hit! You get stronger! Hit! You get even stronger!"

'My arms won't move...'

The 1-minute rest was actually causing muscle cramps.

"Can't do it? Then cleanly admit it! Just stand to the side and clap when the champion passes by!"

"Damn it all!"

Screamer, whose insides were boiling, pushed the sandbag away to create distance, then immediately rushed in and unleashed a flurry of punches.

"Do it properly! Accuracy! Accuracy!"

Shirone's haggard appearance, sitting cross-legged on a rock overlooking the stream, had become gaunt and emaciated in just a few days.

Having eaten nothing but grass porridge made by Miro, with all the nutrients consumed by his brain, his already light body had lost 3 kilograms.

'I can't think at all.'

He wanted to pull out his brain and throw it in the trash.

Excluding 3 hours of sleep, this was his only rest time.

At first, he wondered what help it would be for training, but recently he realized it definitely helped.

If he hadn't been given even these 4 hours of meditation, he would have either died from fatigue or gone insane and committed suicide.

'Nothing is trivial. You just don't try to look into it.'

Recalling Miro's words, he looked at the scenery before him, but he couldn't understand what exactly he was supposed to look into.

'A leaf is hanging there. It's swaying because the wind is blowing.'

He saw a spider building a web between the tree branches.

'What does that spider think about as it lives?'

As he watched endlessly, sunset began to fall before he knew it.

'Night is coming. I wonder if the spider ate anything.'

The spider must have eaten something too.

It was an extremely obvious fact, but since he had never looked into it before, it was quite interesting.

"Shirone, let's start night training."

When Miro's voice gently echoed, his heart felt like it dropped with a thud.

Four hours outside hell were shorter than one hour in hell.

"...Yes."

Shirone let out a small sigh and followed Miro toward the training hall.

D

55 days.

The annex prepared in the Tormia royal castle was as splendid and grand as a noble's mansion.

Pony, the magic school's only royalty, threw herself into the pool in the specially modified annex.

When she emerged from the water soaking wet, the maids stomped their feet while holding towels.

"Miss, please rest for today. What if you catch a cold doing this?"

"It's fine. That's enough for today, go inside and rest."

"But..."

"That's an order."

The maids, startled by her cold words, arranged the towels and left the pool area.

"Huuuuu!"

Pony swept her blonde hair left and right according to her part, then entered the Spirit Zone.

As the propeller installed in the pool rotated, numerous whirlpools formed.

Her major was hydraulics, category: rapids.

The goal of this training was to completely go against the water flow created by the machine.

'I will become strong.'

Royalty is noble, and therefore does not labor.

But that was only the privilege of the direct line; for Pony, who could not ascend to the throne, it did not become a life goal.

'Royalty. I don't need authority that others have named for me.'

When she cast rapids magic, the water flow changed dramatically, and as the machine's power, set higher than the limit, pushed in, her focus wavered.

'I'll do it! I'll establish my own authority myself!'

The sight of foam rising above the water surface looked as if the water was boiling.

51 days.

Shirone's sequence formula finally began to surpass the trillion range.

When he passed 1 trillion 200 billion, the light of his avatar flickered with brilliant radiance, and Miro carefully observed the change.

'Change is definitely being detected. But it's still far from reaching the singularity.'

When one reaches the state of unity between self and object, the avatar's individuality affects the laws.

So far, it was impossible to predict what that individuality would be, but the scope of change could be said to be quite significant.

"Kuuuuu!"

In the repetitive training, Shirone's sequence formula extended endlessly without knowing its limits.

Surpassing 1 trillion to reach 2 trillion, then 3 trillion - the scope of growth spoke to Shirone's talent, but even so, the realm of enlightenment was still far away.

"Huk!"

Shirone let out a death rattle and fell to his knees.

It felt like he heard a popping sound from his head, and then no thoughts came to mind at all.

"Huk..."

Without realizing it, his face crumpled into tears.

'It's hard. It's too hard.'

He had fought countless battles, but fighting with himself was completely different in concept.

Defeating oneself meant killing oneself.

In a state where he could neither die nor live, he had to advance even one step further than yesterday.

He had died as many times as the number 3 trillion, and now he was at his limit.

"I don't think I can meet the deadline."

"That again? I told you there's no need to think about it."

"I'm dizzy. Let me sleep a little and then..."

"Do it!"

When Miro shouted, Shirone raised his head with eyes full of hostility.

Miro's beautiful face now looked like a hideous witch.

"You say there's no time but you want to sleep? Continue. All other thoughts are delusions."

"I might really die."

"I told you not to act spoiled."

The corners of Shirone's mouth turned down pitifully.

"When you think it's unreasonable, remember just this. Even at this very moment, someone somewhere is striving with the resolve that they don't mind dying. There are countless people who want to become strong even if they have to risk their lives or sell their souls to demons. There's no reason why you specifically should claim the glory of victory over them. If you're short on time, just reduce your sleeping time."

Even though he was already sleeping only 3 hours, Miro's words were as firm as a blade.

"It's okay, even if I reduce it by about an hour..."

"You won't die! You won't die, Screamer!"

"Uaaaah!"

As if trying to erase Pyroker's voice, Screamer, who was hitting the sandbag, screamed.

But the more he did so, the more intense his father's whipping became.

"Don't cling to talent! Don't take pride in the effort you've made! You're fighting only for yourself!"

"Uaaah! Uaaaah!"

The seven consecutive strikes repeated without rest, and the heavy sandbag began to sway with creaking sounds.

'Get stronger! Stronger than I was a second ago!'

Tomorrow's me will be stronger than today's me.

Gritting his teeth and throwing punches, all the blood vessels in Screamer's upper body were bulging.

D

48 days.

Shirone desperately suppressed his mind from flying away.

'4 trillion 300 billion. 6 trillion 700 billion. 11 trillion 900 billion.'

A small thrill appeared on Miro's face, which had been watching indifferently until now.

'It's accelerating.'

It was proof that his mind and body were beginning to endure the current training.

When he surpassed 12 trillion, Shirone collapsed with a thud.

"Again. Start from the beginning."

"Uaaaaaaah!"

Vicious emotions welled up and he screamed instinctively, but his body was responding to Miro's words as if hypnotized.

"Shirone, success is the sum of failures. You pile up failures to leap over the wall of success."

'14 trillion 400 billion! 19 trillion 800 billion! 24 trillion 600 billion!'

Blood dripped from Shirone's nose, but Miro paid no attention and looked somewhere higher than his head.

Where a haze of light rose, a golden angel was spreading its wings wide.

'The world is watching you. It's do or die. You can do it, Shirone. If I can do it, you can too.'

Ten days later, Shirone's sequence formula broke through the first target point of 1 quadrillion.

Time remaining until magic school reopened.
