**Solar War (2)**

But that's exactly why.

'How annoying.'

Sirone winning the Solar War would mean becoming the administrator of this world.

Sirone would love everyone.

'And I...'

Love Sirone.

'That's how it turned out. There's no choice.'

On this planet, Mitochondrial Eve could only love Sirone.

'I'll steal her away.'

Even if it means selling my soul.

I won't become just one of the countless things that Yahweh loves.

"Let's go. We're heading west."

A user from Ascension Guild's 2nd Division asked with confusion.

"We just took the center though? If we go west now, other users will already be swarming there."

Results from the Solar War become points, which are tallied into Solar War rankings.

That's why occupying key positions was important.

"I'm going to do this properly. This Solar War is going to be tough. I'll do my best to make the West win."

If Sirone was doing it, then she would too.

"Yes! I'll stake my life on it!"

The Ascension 2nd Division was fired up by the Little Witch's determination, the epitome of free spirit.

'Well, her words...'

She had driven countless people to death in reality, so there was no particular emotion.

"Alright, let's go! For the West!"

In any case, their morale needed to be boosted for victory.

Meanwhile, in the East, Sirone and the Golden Wheel were engaged in fierce combat.

Artillery fire exploded, and bullets with different characteristics rained from all directions.

'Forget fighting - just surviving is hard enough.'

The first battle was a firepower war.

Since death just meant respawning at the starting point, everyone poured out all their firepower.

In both East and West, lower-level users began dying one after another.

'Users in the Solar War can be classified into three categories. First, those who keep fighting without dying.'

Currently, that was Sirone and the other rankers.

'Second, the dead.'

Those who couldn't influence the battlefield until they returned from the starting point.

'Third, those joining from the starting point.'

This category was key.

'How quickly they join up, and how many of them join - that completely changes the tide of battle.'

Controlling their speed and positioning was the skill of those who kept fighting without dying - the rankers.

"Hehehehe! Die, die! All of you die!"

One user from the East was firing bullets at allies, completely unrelated to the war.

Being an Amara integrated type meant not even reaching level 100.

"Oh? Parts, parts!"

He spotted loot on the ground and went for easy money, but got blown apart by a grenade.

'...Fourth, those acting independently of the war.'

Creating one more category, Sirone could roughly picture the flow of the Solar War.

'In this war, a ranker's life carries enormous weight. If one ranker dies, a gap appears instantly. Then the second category of casualties increases...'

If troop reinforcement kept getting delayed, they would lose the Solar War.

'It's gradually calming down.'

Current casualties exceeded 2,000, with East and West at an even 5-to-5 ratio.

The most intense initial clash.

This moment, where only those who survived the total firepower remained, was truly the opening of the Solar War.

"Special forces to the eastern walls! Wild West, provide cover from the rear!"

"Guardian Guild 2nd Division spotted! Transmitting coordinates!"

As expected, communications kept coming in real-time from Golden Wheel's command center.

Users from the West over level 400 clashed, finally triggering localized battles.

'I can't die. I can't avoid death entirely, but at least until the troops return...'

That's when it hit him.

'Wait, so that means...'

Operator.

The legendary record of never losing in High Gear history included the Solar War too.

'Never... died even once?'

The moment he realized with his body just how incredible that record was, chills ran down his spine.

Sirone smiled.

The competitive spirit he had somehow started treating as someone else's business began boiling up again.

"We're taking down rankers."

The Golden Wheel's strategy change had only one expectation for Yahweh2.

"Yahweh2!"

Users with code names he'd seen on the ranking boards, though not from Ascension Guild, rushed at him.

Raphael's heavy armor deflected armor-piercing rounds.

He'd practiced dueling a few times, but the rankers he faced in actual combat were on a different level.

Something semi-transparent flickered in Donatello's omnidirectional vision.

'Stealth.'

He hastily twisted his body as a real bullet grazed past, and rankers simultaneously charged.

"Got you...!"

Sirone, who transcended code with his martial sense, activated the metal-winged Da Vinci.

Flying at Mach speed, he thrust his fist before the stealth user could react.

Raphael's metal-covered right arm pierced through his High Gear.

"Gah!"

As stealth deactivated, the ranker's machine wrapped in electricity caused a massive explosion.

'Got one.'

Killing a ranker was significant.

As the rankers whose stealth operation failed disappeared, a warning sounded.

Attack detected.

Through Donatello's omnidirectional vision, he saw an eerie flash flying toward him.

He quickly flew upward as the flash crashed where he'd been, causing a shockwave.

"Michelangelo Cannon..."

Recognizing the power's identity, Yahweh2 found an Ascension Guild member blocking his path.

User code name: Mystic.

Her upper body was that of a beautiful woman, but her lower body was a grotesque giant spider's legs.

'A skilled fighter ranked 24th overall in duel rankings.'

Mystic held her Michelangelo Cannon and said:

"I saw the footage. Yahweh2, you're famous. But the Michelangelo Cannon is originally from the West."

Light smoke swirled above her palm, then rapidly compressed into a sphere.

"Let's see who wins!"

The two users moved simultaneously, racing across the battlefield and firing flashes.

'Incredibly fast.'

Mystic's grotesque form excelled in ground combat, tracking Sirone.

"Hohoho! Is that all you've got?"

Level 307 output couldn't keep up with Mystic's speed, which exceeded level 450.

"Urgh!"

He jumped code, but the ranker's AI immediately tracked Yahweh2's position.

"Huhu."

Dozens of light spheres fired simultaneously from her Michelangelo Cannon.

'Multi-shot?'

Mystic blocked his code-jumping space and charged with a gleeful smile.

'Already analyzed through footage.'

Chain explosions occurred, but when the smoke cleared, Yahweh2 was nowhere to be seen.

'Tch! Da Vinci.'

Clicking her tongue and twisting her torso, Mystic was about to activate her Michelangelo Cannon again whenâ€”

A massive light sphere appeared that made even those absorbed in combat stop fighting.

"Wh-what is that?"

Yahweh2 held his Michelangelo Cannon toward the sky, and a 4-meter diameter light body vibrated ominously.

"More."

The moment Sirone's eyes widened, the light sphere exploded and grew even larger.

Users forgot even victory and defeat, purely wondering what kind of power that would unleash.

"Want to see what the original is?"

The Michelangelo Cannon was a weapon modeled after Sirone.

"This is the Photon Cannon."

Stepping forward and swinging his arm with all his might, a massive flash shot forth.

"Dodge...!"

The moment the spider legs bent sharply, the flash struck and exploded.

BOOOOOOM!

As if it had never existed, no users remained within a radius of dozens of meters.

"Whew."

Eastern users who witnessed that horrifying power shot bullets into the sky and shouted:

"Alright, let's go! This time we'll win for sure! We're taking the Solar Palace!"

Where two rankers had vanished became the West's weakness, and the East pushed forward endlessly.

Aegis, checking satellite footage, communicated:

"Currently sending all revived troops from the starting point eastward. Push forward as much as possible."

As Eastern users followed behind, Sirone's High Gear pulsed like a heart.

'We're winning. We're going to win.'

Little by little... his heart was becoming invested.

Meanwhile, in the administrator meeting room:

"What the hell is that?"

Ten administrators excluding Operator and Number Seven were watching the Solar War.

It was their world's biggest event, and they needed to respond to immediate errors.

The lollipop mark said:

"The Michelangelo Cannon's quantum collection function is basically equivalent to the world's total photon amount. But the difficulty increases at specific intervals, so collection time gets longer. The current power is clearly abnormal."

The black circle mark said:

"It took roughly 2.3 seconds to reach that 190,000 force just now. This means Yahweh2 has completely different adaptability, separate from having special senses."

The gear mark said:

"Yahweh2 will be this Solar War's main attraction. Well, he's been getting attention from the start."

The demon mark said:

"A new event will update after the Solar War ends. Whether Yahweh2 becomes poison or medicine..."

"Come to think of it, Number Seven didn't come?"

"He's always done whatever he wants. Still, he always watched the Solar War though. Especially when Operator was active..."

The gear mark summarized:

"Well, he's probably busy with the upcoming event. Let's focus on our respective duties. The most important thing is this Solar War ending safely."

The administrators' gazes returned to the battlefield.

Solar Palace.

'Sirone.'

Operator, still kneeling, found Yahweh2 through satellite footage.

His defeating of rankers resembled the visions people saw in their dreams.

'But she's not coming.'

The world's Yahweh entered High Gear solely for a duel with her.

If it was to save real people, nothing here would matter.

'She's fighting the Solar War.'

The moment she saw him fiercely battling countless users, defying her expectations:

Thump. Thump.

Her High Gear beat like a heart.

'She's living in the world I created.'

Her hands naturally clenched.

'I want to fight.'

Yahweh2, rapidly approaching the Solar Palace, had already defeated 7 rankers.

'Ascension's 1st Division guarding the inner castle will be different. But I want to fight. Right now, I want to feel you.'

In quiet stillness, Operator's machine gracefully straightened from its kneeling position.

Making cold footsteps, she opened the Solar Palace doors as golden sunlight poured out.

Combat noise realistically rushed in, and she turned her head east.

Operator's AI had a detection range exceeding 2 kilometers.

Yahweh2's coordinates were marked.

"I'm going."

Taking a sprint position with her torso forward, she raised her head and kicked off the ground.

High Gear output level 487.

Before even seconds passed, she arrived at her destination and turned toward Yahweh2.

When users who felt the unrealistic speed turned their heads, only sound remained.

Sirone's Donatello flashed.

'She's here.'

Before the thought finished, Operator's fist flew toward Sirone's face.

KWAAAAANG!

It was a truly terrible collision sound.

Users from both East and West simultaneously turned their heads, sensing tragedy in the sound.

Yahweh2, having activated both Raphael and Da Vinci simultaneously, was blocking the punch.

But the reason users were shocked was different.

"Wh-what?"

Operator.

A machine that shouldn't appear on the battlefield yet was before their eyes.
