[406] Final Decision (6)

Rumble. Thud thud.

The buildings of Estas stacked up layer by layer, transforming into a massive chunk-like structure. It looked like a giant had planted two thick legs firmly into the earth.

Sein, who had opened the warehouse in the giant's right leg, spoke to Alpheas.

"Please reactivate Estas once we enter."

Those who wouldn't go to heaven had no right to verify Miro's spacetime.

At least that's what Alpheas thought, and he intended to do what he could.

"Let's begin."

The playfulness had disappeared from Gaold's face.

Finally, he would meet Miro.

It was fortunate that she was absorbed in samadhi. The anger he had carefully stored for 20 years might waver otherwise.

Once everyone entered the warehouse, Alpheas reactivated Estas.

Following the pattern Sein had set, the cube-shaped buildings began repeatedly combining and separating in complex ways.

Thud. Thud thud. Thud.

The heartbeat of Estas could be heard.

With each step, Sein's amber irises moved tick-tock.

His left iris swayed left and right at a 15-degree angle while only his right iris rotated with different accelerations for each section.

Instead of maintaining walking speed, Sein varied his stride length. It was a method of controlling time by manipulating space.

"This way."

When Sein turned at a right angle from the center of the warehouse and opened a door, another warehouse rose up, connecting door to door through a passage.

The moment they crossed the boundary, the warehouse they had been in fell below, overtaken by other blocks and moving away.

This process repeated countless times.

'Incredible. Only a Servant could imitate this.'

The warehouse moved, Sein moved, time moved.

It felt like his existing concept of space was collapsing. Sirone was truly walking through four-dimensional spacetime.

When Sein's steps stopped before their final destination, a wistful emotion filled Sirone's eyes.

Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society

The nostalgic sign hung there.

The crooked sign that always returned to its place but tilted on its own as if ignoring balance.

When they opened the door, traces of the agents' ransacking remained intact.

The equations Iruki had written on the blackboard were partially erased, and the picture books Nade had so desperately wanted to keep were left torn to shreds.

Sein walked toward where the sofa was.

"The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society 12 seconds in the future. The upper level of Estas exists at those spacetime coordinates. From now on, Armin, it's your turn."

Armin stepped forward past Sein.

As a Scale magician dealing with time and space, he could guess what the upper level of Estas was without lengthy explanations.

"7 seconds. 6 seconds. 5 seconds."

When Sein began counting, an intense wind sound was heard, as if caught in a storm current.

This was a phenomenon occurring as the spacetime coordinates containing the upper level approached them.

The furnishings of the research society melted into the air density of the strong wind, becoming blurred, and a stone gate similar to the Guffin's Gate they had seen in Galliant overlapped as an afterimage on the table in front of the sofa.

Whoooooosh!

"4 seconds. 3 seconds."

As time passed, the scenery became fainter while the stone gate's colors revived more vividly.

The furnishings flickered and became transparent within the receding spacetime coordinates.

"2 seconds. 1 second."

The moment all scenery disappeared and only the stone gate's form reached 100 percent materialization.

"Now."

Armin cast his magic.

Stop.

"My goodness..."

Interest gleamed in Shiina's eyes.

Etelra and Sirone felt no different.

The upper level of Estas, hidden in a specific space and time, was caught by the Stop magic and revealing itself.

Twenty years ago, a genius girl who amazed the world appeared. And humanity imprisoned that girl at coordinates in spacetime where no one could find her.

This was the truth about the upper level of Estas that had only existed as rumors at Alpheas Magic School.

'So this is what it was.'

Sirone finally understood Sein's words.

The origin point of the cube. The place countless agents couldn't find despite searching.

Armin turned from the stone gate and said,

"As long as time is stopped, the gate will be maintained. But it would be better to hurry. If the magic is dispelled, you'll be trapped in Miro's spacetime."

Though such a situation seemed unlikely, there was no harm in being cautious when lives were at stake.

Sirone had once escaped from Miro's spacetime before, but that was only possible because he was an Unlocker.

Moreover, since Miro was currently absorbed in samadhi, they couldn't hope for her help.

Gaold didn't think about future problems.

Despite being a First-Class Grand Magician, his heart was pounding, and his face was more flushed than ever.

"Let's go, Sein."

"Mm."

Sein's irises, following behind, were also rotating in opposite directions.

A phenomenon that occurred when coldness and excitement acted simultaneously.

The reason he could rise to the ranks of the strongest anti-magic users was thanks to this perfect separation of emotion and reason.

"Sirone, was it? You should do it."

The door to the upper level was sealed to be unlocked through Immortal Function, like Guffin's Gate.

There were two Unlockers on the team anyway. However, since Armin needed to concentrate on the Stop magic, opening it was Sirone's responsibility.

When Sirone activated Immortal Function, the characters on the stone gate glowed, then decomposed into small cubes and spread in a spherical form.

As matter melted away, a massive black hole was born.

"Um... who should enter first?"

For some reason, it felt like they should decide on an order.

It didn't matter right now, but it might be interpreted as a significant historical event in the future.

"The person who broke the seal should enter. Sirone, you are the first entrant."

Armin smiled warmly and pushed Sirone forward.

Watching this, Shiina's mind became complicated. She felt like she couldn't even remember who Armin was anymore.

"Then I'll go in."

His vision darkened briefly, then a view from the center of a massive temple unfolded.

The scene of pillars reaching 2 kilometers high supporting the ceiling was undoubtedly Miro's spacetime.

'To think I'd come here again.'

People emerged from the black hole one by one.

Like when Sirone first came here, everyone seemed speechless at the temple's massive scale that transcended human common sense.

"Huh? But..."

Sirone hurriedly looked around. Everyone was looking around, apparently having the same thought.

"What? What's going on?"

Miro was nowhere to be seen.

"Sirone, is this perhaps...?"

"No. This is Miro's spacetime. It's exactly the same as when I came here a year ago."

Gaold cast Fly magic.

With a whoosh, his body rapidly flew to the ends of the temple.

It wasn't a method of maneuvering with lift, but a "jet" type magic that flew by exploding air pressure.

Gaold quickly circled the vast temple.

It was similar flight to Sirone's angel wings, but the level of movement was on a different dimension.

Gaold's face began to contort terrifyingly when he returned. It seemed like Inferno Hell would unfold at any moment.

"Those damn bastards..."

"Calm down. Nothing has happened yet. It's just that there's no Miro in Miro's spacetime."

No Miro in Miro's spacetime.

It was true since she actually wasn't there, but it was something that could never happen.

First, there was no being that could enter Miro's spacetime. Also, if she was absorbed in samadhi, it would be impossible to escape on her own.

No, if that had been possible in the first place, there would have been no reason for Gaold to wait 20 years.

"It's a hijacking."

Sein reached that conclusion.

"It seems heaven kidnapped Miro."

Gaold asked,

"Is that possible? Not even a single molecule has ever crossed over from heaven until now."

"No, there has been."

Armin bent down and picked up debris from the floor.

It was stone fragments that had fallen from the ceiling when Miro's spacetime was impacted.

Rubbing it between his fingers to check the material, he said,

"I heard that Miro's spacetime was recently cracked. A law enforcer also crossed over to the Kingdom of Tormia. I understand it was handled and reported by a mage from the Arcanes Order."

"But that was just a mental body at most. To kidnap an entire human would be impossible with just a crack."

"The Ivory Tower's opinion is the same. But that's only human thinking. If it's heaven, especially if it's the archangels, they might have found a special method."

Sein stroked his chin and pondered.

"Why did they take Miro?"

It was a seemingly puzzling question.

Heaven was planning the final war, and had consistently shown intent to infiltrate since Miro's spacetime was created until now.

Sirone asked,

"Isn't it obviously to invade this world?"

Etelra said,

"No. That's probably impossible."

Sein agreed.

"Just taking Miro has no effect. Even if they kill Miro, Miro's spacetime won't be destroyed."

Sirone asked with a puzzled expression,

"It won't be destroyed?"

"Miro's spacetime is fundamentally a dimension based on the void. It continuously creates new dimensions within dimensions. Using that infinity, it creates boundaries in spacetime. And Miro further accelerated the speed of the void through samadhi. The theory is that even if Miro dies, the inertia of samadhi will continue to strengthen Miro's spacetime. Of course, you wouldn't understand."

As one goes deeper into the mental world after deathå¢ƒ, conscious control weakens and one is influenced by the strongest inertia of their lifetime.

This was why even when the Virtual Zone was turned off, if one couldn't escape from the void, they would be buried forever in their psyche.

"No. I think I understand."

Sein didn't even snort.

"That's just an illusion. The delusion of a beginner who thinks understanding the context means grasping the true meaning."

How many people in this world truly understood Miro's spacetime?

Probably not some kid attending magic school.

Shiina said,

"Sirone has passed through the void."

Sein's eyebrow muscle twitched. It was the maximum surprise he could express.

At Alpheas Magic School, only Miro had passed through the void. Even then, there had been a commotion about a world-class genius appearing, and the memory was vivid in his mind.

'Hmm. Indeed, worthy of Gaold's recruitment.'

Gaold summarized simply.

"Anyway, they can't kill Miro. But if they took her despite that, they must have found a way. We don't have much time. We'll go to heaven as soon as the team is ready."

Sein had no objection. He had spent 20 years combing through the Black Line for this day.

'But... is this really normal?'

Something felt strange.

It was literally just a feeling.

Was today's outcome really just an unfortunate situation that could happen to anyone, caused by small coincidences piling up?

If so, what was the identity of this unpleasant sense of discord that wouldn't leave his mind?

The extremely irrational thought that if things were going to get twisted like this, they should have gotten twisted somehow during the 19 years.

'Why now? No, why is this happening? Am I normal for thinking this way? The world doesn't flow as we want anyway. Attributing transcendent meaning to coincidence is no different from superstition.'

He wanted to reach that conclusion.

But Sein ultimately couldn't shake it off.

It wasn't an illogical thought. Rather, it was a subtle irritation occurring in the realm of intuition that transcended logic.

'Definitely...'

Something was going wrong.
