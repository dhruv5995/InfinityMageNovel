Full Armed (1)

Finally realizing this was no joke, Rubymix and Yakwi hesitantly stepped back.

"H-how did you do that?"

Of course they knew.

When someone's connection suddenly cuts during combat, it means they've had an accident in reality.

But the problem was how the little witch had managed to track down Taedaecheon in the real world.

'Even the operators don't reveal users' personal information. No, there's nothing to reveal in the first place. This is the Under Code after all.'

As their minds grew complicated, a long-distance communication came through to the little witch.

Your Majesty, we've woken him. Should we kill him?

It was codename 987392.

A Kashan soldier secretly infiltrating High Gear, serving as a communication relay.

No need. Just scare him a bit. But when he reconnects, his attitude better be different.

Understood.

The communication ended.

'I didn't expect to use this method.' Uorin, who had joined the Ascension Guild, had placed surveillance on High Gear's key figures.

It wasn't so much calculated as it was simply something easy to do.

'But the situation is different now.'

To enjoy the Solar War with Sirone, she still needed to stick with the Ascension Guild for now.

Then the door opened and Taedaecheon entered.

When disconnecting within the guild, the start point was each person's Mid Gear.

As Rubymix and Yakwi quietly made way, Taedaecheon approached the little witch.

His knees slowly bent.

"I was wrong..."

"Ah, forget it."

Uorin extended her hand.

"Why did you do that anyway? We were getting along fine, so why make things awkward? I don't have any hard feelings toward you guys either."

Taedaecheon straightened his knees and asked.

"What should we do?"

"Just do what you've been doing. Just don't interfere with my work. I plan to win the Solar War too, after all."

"Understood."

"And speak casually. This is awkward, you know?"

"...Okay."

Rubymix and Yakwi just watched.

'Taedaecheon is the most aggressive in the Ascension Guild, so what the hell happened to him outside?'

The little witch pointed her finger.

The pressure was different from before, and the guild members' upper bodies flinched back.

"Phew."

She said.

"Get out."

Unable to move for a while, they slowly turned around and filed out in a line.

The little witch looked up at the ceiling.

"I have to win."

If Sirone asked for help, she would help even if it meant killing everyone in High Gear.

'That's not going to happen though.'

Having endured eons of time solely to possess Sirone, nothing could stand in her way.

'Even if it means selling my soul to the devil.'

She burst into laughter and asked herself in a self-deprecating voice.

"Do I even have a soul?"

Democracy, midnight.

High Gear charging complete.

The Mid Gear door opened.

Sirone slowly opened his eyes and looked around the now darkened charging station interior.

Though it was only a brief moment, it felt like returning from a long dream.

'Brain in a vat.'

Of course, he had no memory of it.

Turning his head, he saw the Mafia group hadn't gone anywhere and were keeping watch nearby.

Sona approached.

"Finished? Then let's get going." Emerging from the Mid Gear, Sirone turned on his Selective Options and asked.

"Where do we need to go to get Donatello?"

"Moon's Conception. Also called Moon Island. It's an island in the ocean, so you'll need to use boosters. Equipping constant cruise mode in Selective Options will help."

After skillfully switching options, Sirone left the charging station to find countless people gathered.

They were people who had come after seeing the bulletin board.

"Wow! It really is a Michelangelo Gun!" Since it was a legendary-grade item difficult to encounter even in videos, interest was at its peak.

Inevitably, a reporter appeared.

"Independent reporter from the West, HitdaHit here! From what I know, you're currently level 100, so why did you equip Michelangelo? Wasn't it a waste?"

Mafia intervened.

"Tch! Who says it isn't? Anyway, we just need to get our payment. We'll upload a verification video, so watch."

While it was meant to prevent Gumhwaryun from changing their words later, the reporter didn't care.

What mattered now was Yahweh2's position.

"Please say a few words. Currently, all High Gear users are focused on Yahweh2's moves."

"Uh..."

As Sirone began to speak, the murmuring sounds disappeared like magic.

"I just equipped it without much thought. Since I got it from hunting anyway, I was planning to use it."

The reporter was dumbfounded by the bland answer.

"But I have something I want to tell the Operator."

"Ah, of course!" The atmosphere heightened again at the following words, and the reporter double-checked the recording status.

"Users watching the news right now, Yahweh2 seems about to make a shocking declaration."

It was common knowledge that Gumhwaryun and Ascension were involved in Yahweh2's activities.

Most shocking of all was that an Eastern user had acquired Michelangelo in Western hunting grounds.

"Feel free to say anything. All High Gear users are supporting you. Is it a declaration for the Solar War? Or a personal challenge?"

"When I first entered this place, I communicated with the Operator. We had a bit of an argument. I said some harsh things too."

People murmured.

"You communicated with the Operator?" Countless stories formed in their minds, gradually taking shape.

The reporter's shoulders trembled.

'Personal grudge. That's why he joined Gumhwaryun. For revenge! Now it all makes sense.'

Today's top news was definitely his.

"But as I actually played, I came to understand the Operator to some degree. Why they were so confident, and why they were angry at me."

"Huh?"

"Of course, I still have beliefs I can't compromise on, but I want to use this opportunity to correct a misunderstanding. Operator, I'm sorry about that time."

Sirone looked straight at the reporter as if the Operator were right in front of him.

"I'm enjoying it. You really... created a wonderful world."

People's expressions went blank.

"That's all. I'm pressed for time."

As Sirone left, the Mafia group quickly followed, not wanting to lose him. The reporter, who had been standing there for a while, came to his senses and gave his closing comment.

"This is shocking in a completely different way. Yahweh2 apologizing to the Operator. What exactly happened between them? And how will the Operator receive Yahweh2's statement..."

Ascension Guild.

"And how will the Operator receive Yahweh2's statement? With relations between West and East in turmoil, the Solar War approaches."

The Operator sat on the runway.

With her wrists resting on her bent knees, her eyes sparkled as she listened to the news.

"This HitdaHit will continue tracking the situation between the two guilds and reporting to you. This concludes today's breaking news."

The light in her eyes flickered as if growing distant.

After being lost in thought for a moment, she stood up and walked to the end of the runway.

She murmured softly.

"Sirone."

The figure who was the motif for the Michelangelo Gun.

Revealing her slender neckline as she gazed at the night sky, her form vanished like evaporation.

A delicate silhouette floated up in the center of the moon.

West Sea.

Flying over the ocean with rocket engines ignited, the Mafia group was silent.

Their feelings were complicated.

'We're going, but what are the odds of Donatello appearing? At this rate, we'll just keep going in circles.' Mafia approached Sirone's side.

"Let's be clear. We'll look around for exactly one day, and if it doesn't appear, we contact Gumhwaryun. To settle payment starting with Michelangelo."

"Got it."

Sirone nodded readily.

The Mafia group looked puzzled, not expecting him to agree so easily.

"For real? This is being recorded."

"I said I got it."

If there were no mistakes, it would end in one try.

'It's not perfect randomness.'

Getting items according to the designer's intent ultimately meant patterns existed.

'I understand this world's system.'

In reality, this is called enlightenment, usually considered the realm of Buddha from this point on.

'Here, I'd become a programmer though.' In any case, unless it was randomness on Havitz's level, there was no way Sirone couldn't read it.

"Almost there."

Despite using constant cruise mode, by the time they reached Moon Island, their power had dropped to 70 percent.

"Wow."

But it was truly beautiful.

"Pretty, right? Even without hunting Maginus, users gather here for fireworks shows."

It was a ring-shaped island with a freshwater lake in the center, and a giant moon hung in the sky.

"Moon's Conception."

That's why it was Moon Island.

"The hunting ground is underground beneath that freshwater lake. If you fall below the lake, you'll be cut off from the outside like Ergos's sanctuary, so you need to set Selective Options here."

After finishing their discussion about options, they turned off their boosters and landed near the freshwater lake.

Would you like to start the Maginus event?

Rumble rumble rumble!

The ground shook, and the center of the freshwater lake split left and right, revealing a pit as deep as an abyss.

"Once we go inside?"

Sona answered.

"There's a space made of ice. Maginus moves by freezing the sea to create tunnels."

After getting the general information, Sirone was the first to fly up and enter the pit.

Event in progress.

How deep had they fallen?

Having already exceeded the island's thickness, he could guess they were deep in the ocean.

"Creation, why do you refuse eternal life!"

Suddenly the surroundings brightened, showing scenery as if trapped inside a diamond.

Marine life moved beyond the walls.

"Kiyaaaaa!"

As a giant machine resembling an eel opened its jaws, small fish-like aircraft shot out rapidly.

"Shoot! If we miss even once, it's over!" While the Mafia group caught the small fish, Maginus turned and penetrated the ice wall.

"Follow it!"

An enormous amount of seawater rushed in but froze rapidly due to the internal cold.

'Ah, so that's how it works.'

Maginus's specialty was cold spray, killing users by creating ice tunnels in the sea.

'Its only attack ability is ramming. But this...'

Rapidly diving and following the anthill-like complex tunnels was dizzying work.

"Be careful. If you deviate from the route, it's just ocean. The water pressure will burst your aircraft. You must enter the tunnel."

The effective range with Maginus, which created knot-like complex tunnels, was only 200 meters.

With seawater rushing from behind and weakened ice walls continuously breaking, power gradually decreased.

"Ah, this really isn't working!"

Sirone's power, being particularly low level, had now dropped below 30 percent.

'No time.'

After analyzing Maginus's patterns, his conclusion was one last chance.

'Here.'

Maginus, having circled the deep sea in a figure-8 pattern, charged toward the tunnel where Sirone was.

'It's trying to break through.'

It was a strategy to cut off its own tunnel to make the effective range even shorter.

"Dodge! You'll die if it hits you!"

The Mafia group shouted, but now Sirone had a weapon he could fight with.

"Michelangelo Gun."

As the lens in his palm activated, light particles began compressing at tremendous speed.

'This much isn't enough.' As Sirone recalled his real-world senses and heightened his concentration, the light sphere exploded in size.

The Mafia group was shocked.

"Th-that...!"

With a sphere of light large enough to cover a human torso, Sirone changed direction.

Simultaneously, Maginus broke through the ice wall and charged in.

"Kiyaaaaaa!"

"Come at me."

Donatello.
