The Tomb of Gods (3)

About 10 minutes later, Gaold regained consciousness.

His hair had turned completely white, but his eyes looked clearer than ever before.

Miro asked.

"How do you feel?"

"I'm fine. I've recovered 100 percent."

It was impossible for a normal person, but with Gaold as he was now, it might actually be possible.

'He's not losing his memories.' That meant he was completely focused on battle, and the fundamental cause was likely Miro.

From the team's perspective, this was a stroke of luck.

'If his mind is sound, Gaold is invincible.'

Arius looked down at the massive hole pierced through Ymir's dream and said.

"This is the 5th deep layer. From here on, we can say the real exploration begins. Shall we proceed?"

"Of course. Let's depart now."

Then Mong-ah spoke up.

"Wait. I think it would be better if I stayed here."

Sirone asked.

"Why?"

Mong-ah's ability, Nightmare, could be effective even in the deep layers.

"If Ymir truly felt displeasure from this nightmare, I should stay here."

Arius understood.

"I see. Ymir invited us into the deep layers to destroy the nightmare. Therefore, there's a high probability that Egoist won't activate."

"Because he wants it himself."

"Yes. Conversely, if we eliminate the nightmare, Egoist will instantly overwhelm us. Mong-ah is right. Someone needs to maintain this nightmare."

Lufar said to Sirone.

"Since there's no door, we'll have to use Drimo when we return as well. It seems right for Mong-ah to stay."

"Then we'll go down below. Mong-ah, I'm counting on you."

Mong-ah nodded, and following Arius, Sirone's group jumped down into the hole.

This was Ymir's psyche, the 5th deep layer. It had already been a week since Sirone had taken their respective teams and departed for countless worlds.

During that time, a bloody storm from the demon world had swept across the world.

The death toll increased day by day, and screams from those afflicted with emotional sickness never ceased in the central continent.

"Kill me! Aaaah! Just kill me instead!"

People who had nothing left to lose were now completely at the mercy of their pain.

The lucky ones who met Sirone briefly regained their peace, but it was merely a stopgap measure.

Sirone bit his lip.

'At this rate, everyone will die.'

Neither earthquakes, nor cold snaps, nor scorching sun seemed as terrible as the emotional sickness.

'I need to find a way.'

Sirone's gaze turned toward somewhere in the central continent.

World Health Organization.

Sirone looked at the patients through the glass windows installed along the long corridor.

All of them were restrained, screaming in agony, but no sound came through.

"The capacity is at its limit too." Sirone turned to look at Seriel.

Though not even two weeks had passed since the emotional sickness outbreak, her face had already aged considerably in that time.

"Actually, there's no meaning beyond restraint and experimentation. No anesthetic works on them."

That was the nature of the demon world.

"Don't think so pessimistically. There must be a way. I'm searching everywhere for one too."

At the end of the corridor stood Tenos, Seriel's superior.

"You came early."

Tenos nodded and said.

"I can't say it's a good morning. He was emergency transported at dawn. His entire family is dead."

The place Tenos pointed to wasn't a hospital room but a small room for counseling patients.

Looking through the window on the door, they saw a man with his head deeply bowed.

"Is that person Cline?"

Even the areas exposed outside his clothes showed signs of self-harm, and his face was gaunt like a corpse.

But... he somehow looked relieved.

"Yes. He's a farmer who lived on the outskirts of Bashka. According to the epidemiological investigation, he's presumed to be the first person infected with emotional sickness."

Sirone remained silent.

"Not that it particularly matters. It's already spread past the central continent to the southern continent. Countless nobles come to this facility every other day carrying bags of money."

In front of a no-smoking sign, Tenos lit a cigarette.

"They probably come with some hope, to this headquarters of medicine. Thinking that maybe they can at least reduce the pain. But we haven't found a cure yet, let alone a way to alleviate the pain."

"They're all high-ranking officials or royalty." Tenos gave a bitter smile.

"Isn't that natural? This guy's lucky. He came here wearing the nameplate of being the first infected. No, maybe I should say he's unlucky? Now he can't even commit suicide."

Since experts' words sometimes made listeners uncomfortable, Seriel quickly cut in.

"Let's go inside first."

Even as the door opened, Cline showed no movement, not even a reaction.

Unfocused pupils, a mouth hanging open blankly - he almost seemed happy somehow.

'The pain has disappeared.' He had thrown something away, and Sirone had no desire to hear what it was.

From Sirone's perspective, the reason emotional sickness was more dangerous than other demon world afflictions wasn't because of the pain.

'What's truly dangerous is the destruction of the heart.'

This was why the World Health Organization called emotional sickness the "Emotion Scale."

"For example, material things are important to emotions."

Tenos said.

"Material things are life itself. Food, clothing, a place to rest - of course, money is what encompasses all of that. Seekers like you might consider it trivial," Seriel drew a line.

"Sirone doesn't consider it trivial."

"Anyway... those who have much also have much to throw away. And they're cunning. They don't just throw away anything to suppress pain. They categorize things finely and use them one by one. But this farmer couldn't do either."

From what he'd heard, within three days of emotional sickness infection, there was nothing left.

After that, just terrible pain.

And this morning at dawn, he lost his child.

"It's not entirely this guy's fault. We thought we could at least reduce the pain."

Sirone's use of Miracle Stream to suppress emotional sickness extended even to researchers.

If there was a way to eliminate patients' pain, the World Health Organization would become a battlefield.

Understanding what Tenos wanted, Sirone firmly shook his head.

"The criteria are clear. Use it as the fastest method to stabilize the world. Getting swayed by emotions would only add to the chaos."

"I suppose so."

The royalty or ministers of nations wouldn't leave Sirone alone once they knew of his miracle.

'But...'

Tenos looked at Cline.

'If the world's Yahweh hadn't come here, that man could have been me.'

Cline opened his mouth.

"Please kill me."

Seriel walked over and patted his shoulder.

"That was an accident. After three days of pain, Cline was already in a state where he'd lost his reason."

"I should have died. Even if I was in a mad state, I should have died."

"Please calm down first." Cline raised his head.

"I have no intention of living. They say you do experiments here? Please do them. Do whatever you want. Whether you cut open my stomach or take out what's in my head, do as you please."

A cold silence flowed.

The reason Seriel and Tenos held back their words was honestly because they had such expectations.

'There are limits to experimenting on nobles. There are even high-ranking temple officials hospitalized here. When a cure emerges, they're the ones who've muscled in to be cured first.'

Seriel suddenly had this thought.

Even with the world heading toward catastrophe, seeing that they had to consider such things, 'Maybe humans are still worth living for.'

Since it was an unchangeable problem anyway, Seriel dismissed her idle thoughts and focused again.

'Cline, presumed to be the first infected.' Having already lost his family, and because it was his responsibility, he would stop at nothing.

'There are several hypotheses I want to verify. At least bioavailability experiments with prohibited drugs...'

Seriel shook her head.

'Don't lose reason. The more urgent it is, the more important rules become.'

Having regained her composure, she comforted Cline.

"I appreciate the sentiment. But the World Health Organization, according to the 13th Holy Convention..."

"Please, I beg you!"

Cline prostrated himself, shedding tears.

"I'm so angry, so angry I could go mad. I want to take revenge on this damned disease. And on myself too! Please use me!"

Seriel glanced at Sirone.

'Human experimentation.'

It was probably already being carried out in the shadows, but the World Health Organization's reputation was on a different level.

"If you won't use me, I'd rather die somewhere where no one is. I don't want to live in terrible pain anymore."

Sirone asked Tenos.

"How effective would it be?"

"It might fail. But in data collection, it would be on a different level in both quality and quantity. Anyway, this is where the world's best biologists are gathered."

"You must not let him die."

"I can't guarantee that. He might die."

"Even so, you can't proceed with experiments while knowing he might die."

Only then did Tenos turn his head.

"What are you thinking?"

Sirone approached Cline, who was on the ground, and met his eye level.

"It might be difficult. Are you truly prepared?"

"Prepared? Right now, tell me to do anything. Whatever it is, I'll do it."

Sirone nodded.

"Very well. I'll respect your will. Humanity will owe you a great debt."

Seriel shouted.

"Sirone, what are you doing now...!"

Then Sirone raised both hands and richly drew up the smoke of Miracle Stream.

As a sphere of light gathered in the sky slowly descended, Cline gaped in bewilderment.

He had never seen magic before.

"Wh-what is this..."

"I will forgive your sins." As Agape's light flowed down Cline's body, the incubation period of his emotional sickness was extended.

"You won't suffer from emotional sickness anymore. This is my heart's response to your resolve. Will you still consent to the experiments? Even if you refuse, my feelings won't change."

Fire blazed in Cline's eyes.

"I lost my wife and killed my child. I want to atone. I absolutely won't change."

Seriel's eyes grew warm, but Tenos still asked with a stern expression.

"Didn't you say you wouldn't use that ability on patients?"

"The criteria are the same. However, Cline is no longer a patient hospitalized here."

Sirone stood up and continued.

"Just like me, Seriel, and Tenos, he's someone who risks his life fighting for humanity." Tenos adjusted his glasses.

'The fastest method to stabilize the world. Is this Yahweh's standard?' It had been a long time since his blood had boiled like this.

"Please, Seriel. Make sure to create a cure. At least find a way to reduce the pain."

Seriel pressed her lips tightly together and nodded.

'I'll do it. I'll definitely succeed. That's the only qualification I have to breathe comfortably.'

That day, a team was formed at the World Health Organization that was not publicly known.
