The Definition of Love (4)

Ethella walked endlessly.

"Mama, mama."

The children of limbo who had died before being born had now become space itself.

"I'm sorry."

The fear that limbo felt would be exactly the same as the fear of the child in her belly.

"Mama is sorry."

Ethella's heart felt like it would tear apart.

Perhaps her physical body had been torn to shreds, but the schema conveyed endless pain.

Just as the Buddha had offered his body to the hungry ghosts, she too moved toward the end of the system.

'If I go there...'

She, of course, along with the child in her belly and limbo, would disappear into the eternal world of nothingness.

'Chagall.'

She was worried about him.

'You must understand me.'

Perhaps that would be the only way Chagall could atone to the world.

"Ma...ma..."

Each step was heavy.

It didn't feel like moving forward, but rather like carrying the entire weight of this space, the weight of life itself.

'I can't collapse.'

Her mission to purify limbo remained unbroken, but the truth was it was beyond her strength.

"Hnnngh!"

No matter how hard she tried, before the weight of life that wouldn't let her advance, her knees buckled.

'Is this all I amount to?'

The reason this world is cruel is probably because there are things that cannot be achieved even by sacrificing one's life.

'I have to go. I have to save these children...'

That's why responsibility is both the heaviest burden and the most beautiful belief humans can carry.

"Mama, mama."

They were saying they wanted to live.

"I have to stand up!"

At that moment, she heard a hallucination in her mind.

"Ah, testing."

'What?'

Ethella, who had been dazed for a moment, asked.

"Who... are you?"

"Ether resonance successful. Now then... Ah, Your Majesty. Everyone step back."

'What is this?'

The sound of reality heard from hell was eerie.

"Romy Ethella."

Following a cold and solemn voice, the woman from before began to interpret.

The voices of Zin Kang and An Chal were transmitted almost simultaneously.

"I am Jin Kang, Emperor of the Zin Cheon Empire. That place is probably hell. Where my daughter is."

'Jin Kang.'

Jin Seong Eum's father.

"Not telling you anything would be consideration for you who are in hell. But once again, with my selfishness, I find myself speaking cruel words."

"Your Majesty, can you hear me?"

Seeing no meaningful response, it seemed Ethella's words weren't getting through.

'Ether resonance.'

It must be a method of carrying information on spatial waves.

"Save my daughter."

Having organized her thoughts, she now remained silent and listened to Jin Kang's words.

"We've developed Pharma Gwangcheonseong that can transmit information to the space of the other world. You're an excellent monk and mage, so you probably understand the principle. The problem is coordinates. Originally, I was going to concentrate energy on my daughter to blow up hell, but..."

'What incredible obsession this person has too.'

It was responsibility.

"We made the final decision to change coordinates and send energy to you instead."

Ethella nodded.

'It's possible. I'm in the process. If an explosion occurs, not only will limbo be saved, but the purification system of the other world will be paralyzed. If that happens...'

Jin Seong Eum's karma would also disappear.

"I don't know."

Jin Kang said, finishing his miscellaneous explanations.

"What situation you're in. Of course it must be painful, but when the energy of Pharma Gwangcheonseong concentrates, even greater pain will come. Whether this is truly the right thing to do. Rather than this, even if it means killing my daughter, praying for your peace would be..."

"No! No!"

Ethella shook her head.

'We can save her! We can save Jin Seong Eum!'

Of course it's frightening.

But having seen what sacrifice Jin Seong Eum made for humanity in the Valley of Wailing.

'She must live. That person... has the right.'

"Inflicting pain on someone I can neither see nor feel is truly a terrible thing. Especially driving you, who sacrificed your body for humanity, into pain... makes me feel like I've become a demon."

"Your Majesty!"

The moment Ethella shouted, Jin Kang's voice trembled.

"Save her."

Ethella pressed her lips tightly together.

"Please save my daughter. I'll die instead, I'd rather fall into hell myself..."

Jin Kang would gladly do it.

A parent's heart wanting to save their child is something that cannot be achieved even by sacrificing one's life.

'Responsibility.'

You can't even die as you please.

"Romy Ethella, I cannot know what reaction you're showing as you hear my words now. Perhaps you might curse me, or shout that this shouldn't happen. Such imagination drives me to an even more terrible place, but..."

Jin Kang steadied his breathing.

"I will believe. I will choose to believe that Romy Ethella is the world's greatest seeker of truth and someone prepared to willingly sacrifice for humanity."

Ethella smiled and nodded.

"...I wish you good fortune."

With that, no more voices could be heard, and then hot energy surged through her entire body.

'It's beginning.'

Ethella gritted her teeth and stood up.

To maximize the efficiency of Pharma Gwangcheonseong, it would need to explode from the deepest part of the system.

"I can do it."

She could take responsibility with this life.

'Jin Seong Eum, humanity still needs you.'

Pain surged in.

"No!"

Chagall screamed.

Having become almost insane, he was running while flailing his limbs like a dog.

"Aaaaaaah!"

As Ethella's pain surged through the Taijitu chains, he fell to his knees and rolled back his eyes.

Time remaining until purification...

It was more than half reduced from when he first came here, but it was still an eternity.

"Why did you do such a stupid thing! If you leave like that, if you disappear like that..."

"I have to meet you."

As tremendous mental anguish surged in, his karma was greatly purified once again.

Chagall suddenly realized.

"Damn! Damn it!"

The fact that this pain he was receiving now, this despair, was exactly the same as what he had given to Ethella.

'I tormented her. I destroyed her like that.'

'Karma?'

Chagall wiped away tears and clutched his head.

"...What do I do?"

Did I really ruin everything?

"What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I..."

He couldn't take responsibility.

"No!"

Denying that fact, Chagall shouted.

"Why are you doing this to me! What do you want me to do! Just come back!"

There are things that cannot be achieved.

"I'll kill them!"

It seemed like if even this hatred disappeared, Ethella and he would become nothing.

"I'll kill them! I'll kill them all!"

Chagall threw his body, wounded by demons, into hell.

Dong. Dong. Dong.

The cathedral bells announcing 10 o'clock rang.

The faces of representatives and officials from various countries who had gathered in the annex theater 30 minutes earlier were grim.

The cathedral's official events would come to an end with the finale performance.

'What's going to happen?'

The political situation was turning fierce and urgent enough that it didn't feel like things were over.

'The nation that kills Maya becomes the world's leading power? What kind of prophecy is this? Can we really believe it?'

This was the conclusion reached based on analyzing the information Fermi had transmitted to each country.

Albino muttered.

"Another bloody storm will blow."

Rufist asked.

"Will it really? The source is Apocalypse, but there's a possibility it was fabricated."

"Fermi doesn't make sloppy lies. Lies beget lies and ultimately lead to self-destruction. The reason he's strong is because he's logically armed."

Albino recited the Apocalypse records.

"At the end of the cathedral service, two women sing. Maya receives thunderous applause and Iron's army kills her. Iron becomes the world's leading nation."

"Iron, not Jive."

Rufist surveyed the seats.

"Gis isn't here."

"That means Flu succeeded. Other countries don't seem greatly disturbed either. Anyway, things are going according to Fermi's information."

"But what does killing Maya have to do with becoming the world's leading nation?"

"I don't know. It feels like the Apocalypse information only records the results of key events in chronological order. Like... it feels like it was written by a machine, not a person."

Only humans require causes.

"Anyway, I have doubts too. Will Maya really die? The performers don't know?"

"No. It's classified."

"What about our side?"

"For now... we've made preparations."

If the information is true, Tormia would have to be the nation that kills Maya.

"Ozent Ly?"

"No. There's a pianist named Reina among the performers who's family. We can't entrust this to him."

"I suppose so."

"It'll be difficult to execute anyway. If Fermi knows, that means Shirone knows too."

"Come to think of it, he's not here."

Not seeing Shirone, Albino twisted his beard.

'What are these guys up to?'

The reason Fermi disclosed the information could be assumed to be because security was breached.

'Probably Iron. Otherwise, there'd be no reason to significantly diminish the value of the information.'

Next is the question of truth.

'The timeline is matching up. The one-hour gap in Habits' murder game. Gis's death...'

So will Maya die?

'Shirone isn't coming. Is this really false information? No, this is true. I'm just missing something.'

Albino's expression hardened.

"Shouldn't we think in reverse?"

"Pardon?"

"Instead of us killing Maya, wouldn't it be that we're forced into a situation where we have no choice but to kill Maya?"

Rufist blinked.

"This is a trap of information updating. Human thinking goes from cause to result. Kill Maya and become the world's leading nation. But from God's perspective, it's actually the opposite. It doesn't matter who becomes the world's leading nation. What's important is that Maya dies."

"But how is that possible? What would happen to make us kill Maya?"

"That's where it would be."

Albino glared at the annex door.

"Shirone."

The entrance to Delta headquarters was chaos with clashes between protesters, the Anti-Magic Department, and Southern warriors.

"Hmm."

Untara felt the balance of power, which had been in her favor, suddenly tip.

'Something feels familiar.'

The feeling of something moving among the warriors whose heads were being cut off for no reason.

'And it's getting closer.'

Habits, his eyes bloodshot with killing intent, headed toward Untara while killing warriors.

"Eliminated. Eliminated. Eliminated."

The wave of Compassion affected him too, but no special change occurred.

"Interesting."

His mind was chaos anyway.

"This place is finished too."

Having arrived in front of Untara, Habits stood motionless with his long sword raised.

If the South collapsed, the protesters would enter Delta headquarters and seize control of the world.

Regardless of such political developments, Habits released his Vanishing and slowly stepped back.

"Finally, I get to see."

"Hup."

Surprised Untara swallowed, but Habits' gaze was already elsewhere.

"Yahweh."

"You saved your life, Satan."

Shirone's figure, bearing the light of Elysion, pushed against the background of the battlefield.
