Underwater Operations (1)

The Ten Kingdoms of the Archipelago.

Among the ten kingdoms of 'Cartesia', Dionas was an island located at the easternmost point.

"The earthquake caused by Gamagin occurred in the fourth island, the Kingdom of Mitoa. Thanks to the other islands acting as breakwaters, Dionas suffered the least damage from the tsunami."

The captain bit his pipe after hearing Sirone's explanation.

"Hmm, will it be alright? I know this isn't the time to be picky when it comes to disaster victims, but the rumors aren't very good."

Though bound to 'Cartesia', the Kingdom of Dionas was originally an exile destination for criminals.

The water dragon Kaios spoke.

"The dynasty was established 120 years ago by pirates. And it's still such a corrupt society that maritime plunder remains the nation's main source of income."

"We have no choice. Until we eliminate the demon realm, people need a safe place to stay."

Sirone left the captain's cabin.

Looking back from the top of the large warship, a magnificent sight of countless ships lined up unfolded.

'Roughly three hundred vessels.'

These were refugee ships gathered by Kaios, with a total of 20,000 passengers aboard.

Sirone organized fleets according to the types and sizes of ships and assigned roles to each person.

Poine approached from the side.

"So far, would it be fair to say we're sailing smoothly? Of course, incidents and accidents happen every day..."

From food disputes to petty squabbles over sleeping areas, disturbances occurred without fail every single day.

"Don't you think we need to strengthen law enforcement? Cutting daily meal portions in half won't be enough to completely control people's emotions."

"If the pressure becomes too intense, they might lose their peace of mind. It's better to think of small disturbances as necessary lubrication."

"Well, that's true, but..."

Poine looked at the sailing ship flying Arachne's flag navigating on the left side.

"Flying something like that, isn't it natural that people would feel deprived?"

It was the ship carrying Arachne's minister, and even the workers were all armed soldiers.

"We have no choice. Arachne is Cartesia's representative. If they use their influence, it'll be much easier for the disaster victims to settle in Dionas."

Of course, there were other underlying reasons.

'They wouldn't have volunteered to lead just for that reason. Their purpose is the upcoming reorganization of the Holy War. They're probably trying to do some groundwork before fighting the world's major powers.'

Politics and human rights were inseparable anyway, so it would be reasonable to observe for now.

"Leave the flag alone. As long as they don't claim extraterritorial rights, there's no need to escalate things."

Poine's eyes narrowed.

"Hehe, no one would be foolish enough to do such a thing with the Messiah present. However, several fleet commanders have raised objections about their refusal to allow a complete inventory of warehouse goods. They suspect they're hoarding food supplies."

That was probably the case, but there must be another reason for not opening the warehouses.

"We have plenty of food. Make a conditional agreement that we'll conduct a complete inventory if supplies become insufficient."

"Understood."

As Poine bowed and stepped back, Kaios pointed below the ship.

"Messiah, over there..."

A small speedboat was rapidly approaching from the direction of Arachne's sailing ship.

After confirming the messenger flag, Sirone immediately jumped down to the first-floor deck with his apostles.

Armored knights ignored the ladder and leaped through the air, landing one by one.

"What's this?"

Just as the passengers who weren't favorable toward Arachne's ship frowned.

"Oops."

One woman who uniquely climbed up using the ladder drew everyone's attention.

"Who is that person?"

She was beautiful, and even to non-Arachne citizens, she was a familiar celebrity.

"Barho Rangi?"

Miss Arachne.

Even Sirone, who had formed a connection with her at the World Beauty Contest, stared at her blankly.

"Hello. Nice to see you."

With practiced ease in handling attention, she greeted the people and crossed the deck under escort.

"Sirone!"

Rangi's face lit up with color.

"You're really on the ship? When I only heard rumors, I thought it couldn't be true. Ah, what a coincidence."

"How are you here, Rangi?"

There was no reason for Miss Arachne to accompany a refugee relief mission.

"Actually..."

After hesitating briefly, Rangi stuck out her tongue.

"I volunteered when I found out you were on this ship. There might not be another chance in the future."

Her last words carried significant meaning.

---

Among the demon hordes that moved south from Tormia's capital, some groups had settled down.

The 7th Brigade under the 8th Corps was one of them.

"Well, here's today's spoils."

What they brought back from raiding villages was mostly neither food nor treasure, but humans themselves.

Humans of all ages and genders were dragged in chains to become the demons' playthings before being consumed.

In the desolate mountain range where even animals had fled due to the horrific screams heard every night.

"...Now I can finally live a little."

Gustav's Four Knights were imprisoned in special bone cages installed there.

The fatal injuries from the 'Flower Garden' had mostly healed, but the problem was the psychological trauma.

"Havitz... Havitz..."

Zetaro muttered with a vacant expression.

"To think he would betray us. Why? Why?"

Though he had heard the full account from Balkan, he still couldn't believe it.

Sumodo said.

"Stop it already. How many days has it been? And is Havitz your husband? What betrayal..."

He picked up a maggot, bit it with his front teeth, swallowed it deliciously, then continued.

"We can all just live doing whatever we want anyway. He must have found something more interesting."

This was exactly why Zetaro was annoyed.

"I'm the greatest torturer. Do you know how many humans I've killed? What could possibly be more fun?"

Sumodo shrugged.

"Who knows? Maybe he discovered some new torture method? Something we can't imagine."

It wasn't entirely wrong.

Balkan, who had been listening to the conversation from a corner of the bone cage, assessed the situation outside the prison.

'My injuries have mostly healed. It's not like there's absolutely no way to escape. But...'

What did they have left?

'Anyway, we killed plenty and had our fair share of fun. Havitz probably left because he was bored too.'

Footsteps could be heard.

"Hey! Come eat!"

Having been chewing on maggots all day, just the sound made their stomachs churn.

"Let's eat first. What's today's menu?"

Demons over three meters tall approached, leading Natasha with a chain around her neck.

"Hehe, well? How about you guess what it is?"

The food passed through the bars looked like pork trotters and smelled fishy.

Natasha asked.

"How are your wounds?"

"Much better. How about you?"

Natasha's skin, covered in rags, showed playfully carved wounds and chain marks.

She seemed to be tormented by demons day and night, but showed no signs of distress.

"I'm fine. Eat. It's not human meat."

A demon yanked the chain.

"Hey, hey! Don't say unnecessary things! Want to die?"

Twelve blades protruded from the device around Natasha's neck, piercing her skin.

Red blood flowed down her collarbone.

'Even a slight force would sever Natasha's neck. But with her speed...'

She could easily subdue them.

Ultimately, she was enduring because Balkan, Sumodo, and Zetaro were being held hostage.

Sumodo spat out the meat.

"Disgustingly tasteless. Maggots would be better. Natasha, isn't there other meat?"

"It's rotten. I'll try to find some."

The demon swung the chain like a whip.

"Hehe. Well, we did as you wanted, so follow us. Today's game will be very entertaining."

Feeling the blades penetrate, Natasha raised her head and slowly stepped back.

"Natasha, leave."

Balkan said.

"Just kill them all and go. You can easily do that, right? You don't need to endure this because of us."

As the demon's eyes widened, the bone cage heated up red-hot like molten metal.

"You guys... really want to die?"

It was Brigade Commander Magasura's ability - a prison that exploded in response to magic.

Sumodo said while tearing at the meat.

"That's right, Natasha. Do as you please. Why should you be stuck here because of us?"

The demons now looked tense too.

"Shut up. We'll really kill you. Lord Magasura won't blame us either."

The one who initially ordered Gustav's Four Knights to be kept alive was 9th Corps Commander Paimon.

But she had become the demon realm and was annihilated.

Of course, the order wasn't necessarily nullified, but its psychological binding force had weakened considerably.

"Natasha, end it."

Knowing all these facts, Zetaro agreed with Balkan and Sumodo's opinion.

"I'm bored now too. What's the point of playing more without Havitz? Let's just go back."

The demon gripping the chain gritted his teeth.

"These bastards..."

The blades penetrated deeper into Natasha's neck, and bubbles formed in the heated bone cage.

In this explosive situation where one side could be annihilated with a moment's decision...

"It's okay."

Natasha smiled at her friends.

"I'll go back for now. Rest well here. Next time I'll get fresher food."

There was no special reaction.

Only killing intent flashed in Zetaro's eyes, and the expression disappeared from Sumodo's face as he chewed the meat.

As Natasha returned to the demons, the blades withdrew from her neck and the bone cage cooled rapidly.

Balkan called out to her retreating back.

"What are you thinking?"

"Same as you. Nothing at all. I'm just living a bit longer because I can endure it."

"Is there... anything you can't endure?"

Natasha was a doll.

A doll that would still smile even if bitten, torn, burned, or had her belly cut open and stuffing pulled out.

As Natasha was dragged away by the demons without answering the question, Sumodo threw a bone.

"Ugh, damn. Disgustingly tasteless. Anyway, she's a strange one. She seems different from us."

"That's exactly it."

Zetaro dropped his meat and trembled with shocked eyes.

"I found it. I found something truly fun. This is what Havitz wanted to feel."

"What are you talking about?"

Zetaro whipped his head around.

"Havitz abandoned us, right? What a fun situation that is! It must have been completely thrilling!"

Sumodo blinked.

"Well, that's true. Even Balkan didn't expect it. He really knows how to have fun."

"This time it's our turn. We're going to kill Havitz. Capture him, cut off his limbs, mock him while... ehehehehe!"

Whether thrilled just by imagination, Zetaro knelt and spread both arms to the sides.

"At the end, we'll look into his eyes and slowly slit his throat with a scalpel. Then Havitz will... Havitz will..."

His eyelids fluttered.

"How much will he enjoy it?"

The ultimate ecstasy humans could experience.

"Imagine it. He'll want to fight back but can't because his limbs are severed. How funny would that be? This is a masterpiece. I'm sure we can make him cry and snivel."

"Hmm."

As Balkan finally showed interest, a smile spread across Sumodo's lips too.

"We can't end it like this. Havitz will tell me again. He'll say this to me."

Zetaro lowered his arms and sobbed.

"As expected... Zetaro is the best."

"Hehehe, right. Well, I'm not Havitz, but your game is definitely the best. This time it'll really be fun."

Sumodo stood up.

"So, we're staying to play more, right?"

All three simultaneously looked outside the bone cage.

"Havitz, just wait."
