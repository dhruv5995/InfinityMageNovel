Face to Face (3)

'Incredible.'

Nane paid his respects to Shirone. The realm of enlightenment wasn't particularly surprising since he himself had reached the pinnacle.

However, the path Shirone had chosen.

'The heart.'

The fact that he had climbed to the end of the world while carrying everyone's hearts—that was incredible.

'Yes, there was such a path too.'

Like the symmetry of a mirror, they had walked different paths from the beginning but ultimately arrived at the same place.

'I suppose it's right.'

Hexa, the ultimate realm that the heart could pursue—Nane had no choice but to acknowledge it.

'But this is just the beginning.'

Nane's sword flames blazed with even more brilliant light as they began to pierce the Miracle Stream.

He could imagine anything.

Nane's sword contained all the harmony this world possessed.

'Sermon, Ice.'

All cold concepts formed a nearly infinite spectrum as they stabbed at Shirone.

'It's not cold.'

Shirone's heart, denying Nane's truth, manifested as the Miracle Stream and destroyed the sermon.

Amy's face was filled with shock.

"My goodness..."

Every time particles of light collided with conceptual swords, something unbelievable appeared in the sparks.

"What is that?"

Eyes.

Though it wasn't certain if they were human, countless eyes flickered in their retinas.

"The world is being torn apart."

Miro said.

"That's as far as humans can know. Whether it's an error in the universe or something beyond that..."

Nade swallowed nervously and said,

"What if we step in? Since they're evenly matched, if we break the balance of power..."

"Are they idiots?"

Where Miro pointed with her chin, angels with serious faces could be seen waiting.

"The reason they're not moving is because Shirone and Nane aren't engaged in a battle of strength."

"Then what are they fighting with?"

"Every definition of all things in existence."

"The world is one, but somehow the perspectives viewing it have become two. That's the problem."

Lufist continued.

"When I strike with 100 tons of mass, how those 100 tons will act is decided by Nane and Shirone respectively. In the end, it's meaningless. They're the ones deciding."

Miro nodded.

"Exactly. Two systems are perfectly interlocked. Only those two know the definitions being made inside there. Even if I attack Nane with Extreme Line, Shirone might be the one to suffer damage instead."

While they conversed, the confrontation between Shirone and Nane reached its peak.

'Did you realize this too?'

It was always Nane asking the questions.

'Then how about this?'

The sword of sermon combined all concepts of the universe's ends and shot toward Shirone.

'Agape.'

The Miracle Stream emitted a terrifying light as it wrapped around and shattered Nane's sword.

Miro's eyebrows trembled.

"They're almost equal."

If it could be called a conversation, the two had discussed everything in the universe during that brief time.

'And they're identical up to this point too. If there were one, they would be god, but since there are two in the end...'

Still human.

'Who will be the one to break?'

As Miro watched seriously with her face covered, the angels' sacred bodies wavered.

Simultaneously, exclamations erupted from the allied forces.

"Huh? What?"

Though it was an imperceptible movement to the eye, the feeling was so powerful that their concentration screamed.

"Shi-Shirone is..."

Gradually pushing back Nane's forehead.

'We're not alike.'

As the mirror's symmetry vanished and Yahweh and Buddha separated, Nane's face contorted.

"Graaah!"

The sword flames exploded upward, and all of Bashka shook with powerful vibrations.

'The perspective is breaking.'

Though it felt like the world might split in two, Shirone had no intention of stopping.

'I absolutely won't back down.'

Just as he was about to take a step forward with fierce eyes, he saw Nane's smile.

"Huh?"

The moment Shirone's step touched the ground, Nane retreated the same distance.

"What, what?"

Not only the allied forces but Heaven's army also narrowed their eyes.

'He retreated on his own?'

Since they were nearly equal, even Shirone couldn't understand the action from moments before.

'I wouldn't have done that.'

If he were the type to retreat out of fear of defeat, he wouldn't have become the Buddha of the age in the first place.

"It was a beneficial conversation."

That was why Nane's words were unpleasant.

"A conversation? We collided with the world at stake. There are no variables. No, we examined all variables. Whatever you scheme, the result won't change."

"I know. I lost."

Though no one spoke it aloud, the atmosphere of Heaven's army stirred.

'Lord Buddha...'

Shura was the most shocked.

'I know. You're not one to retreat so easily. Even against Yahweh... Could it be?'

A thought suddenly occurred to him.

'Are you in that much difficulty?'

Nane continued as he retreated.

"Though our directions differ, our essence is the same. We think about what humans need. I could understand your universal love. No, I truly understand you."

For the first time, Nane's gaze left Shirone and turned toward someone behind him.

'Amy.'

If he closed the world, Amy would disappear, and his own heart that loved her would disappear too.

'Would that be right?'

Since Nane was right in everything except one thing, he could simply believe this was right too.

'That must not happen.'

If it wasn't 100 percent, Buddha's sermon would become not truth but violent words.

"I'll be watching."

As Nane ascended to the sky, Heaven's army looked up with bewildered expressions.

"He left?"

When they turned their eyes back to the ground, the allied forces were positioned behind Shirone.

Third-ranked Mara Ashur asked Ichael.

"What shall we do?"

Since Buddha had withdrawn from the front lines, final command had essentially passed to the Archangel.

Rayel said.

"Please permit us to advance. As you saw just now, Nane is not Ankera. We have a mission to carry on God's will and rule over them. I will do so."

No words came from Ichael's mouth as he made eye contact with Shirone.

Satiel was on high alert.

'If she has regained her memories, she would never permit war with humans.'

"Archangel."

Just as Ashur was about to ask again, Ymir kicked off the ground and shot forward.

"That's enough."

Closing the distance instantly, he brought his fist down toward Shirone's face.

"I'll handle this."

As the Miracle Stream wrapped around Ymir's arm, an unfamiliar resistance surged through.

"Kekeke!"

A resistance he could never forget.

"Hyaaaah!"

Light smoke exploded with a pop, and the wind pressure from his fist pushed Shirone backward.

"Whew!"

Though he had experienced it through Omega, the feeling of taking it directly without going through Garfin was worlds apart.

"That was a jab."

Raising both arms and charging forward while pounding the ground, Ymir was intercepted by Ryan.

"I'm your opponent."

As the great straight sword swung wide and flew forth, splitting the world, Ymir's eyes lit up.

'This is...?'

As animalistic impulses surged through him, Ymir's body, which had been heading toward Shirone, twisted sharply.

"Kahahahaha!"

Covering his face with one arm as he charged in, the great straight sword struck his forearm.

The moment the sensation called impact was transmitted, it was thrilling enough to make his hair stand on end.

'Yes, this is it!'

Ymir, having lost his reason to battle excitement, twisted his waist and threw a punch.

"Come at me, Ozen..."

Simultaneously, the massive incarnation of Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara appeared and struck Ymir thousands of times from left and right.

"Burst."

With the final blow delivered, Ymir's body was pushed about 4 meters to the side.

'4 meters?'

Miro was bitter.

'I hit him thinking I'd send him flying 4 kilometers.'

As Ymir opened the floodgates of attack, the giants charged forward, shaking the ground as if they had been waiting.

"Damn those things!"

Ashur lost his temper, but they were beings who lived and died by Ymir's commands anyway.

Miro formed hand seals and said,

"We fight. Get ready."

As the allied forces charged toward Heaven's army, the angels had no choice but to begin moving as well.

Only Shirone was monitoring the situation.

'This is disadvantageous as it is.'

Unlike the allied forces who depended on a few individuals, Heaven's army consisted entirely of divine beings.

If not for Miro's defensive capabilities, it wouldn't have been strange if Bashka had already been blown away.

'I have no choice.'

It was something only Hexa could accomplish.

"Whew."

Taking a deep breath, Shirone gathered the Miracle Stream fully between his hands.

'It's still woefully insufficient.'

But the longer the chaotic battle continued in Bashka, the more damage the human side would suffer.

"Hand of God."

As a signal shot up above Shirone's head, the clouds parted and a massive hole appeared.

"What's that?"

The angels' faces turned pale.

"Block it!"

As a massive mass of light in the shape of a hand descended through the sky, the archangels charged forward.

Rayel was the fastest.

'Accelerator!'

The moment Rayel, charging at light speed, applied brakes to his lightspeed momentum and threw his fist.

'Huh?'

A blonde boy moving at the same speed clearly burst in from the side.

'That's...?'

In his eyes gleaming with madness, two magic circles could be seen assembling at light speed.

'Light Dragon...'

At the point he thought that far, the boy's fist struck Rayel's face hard.

'Phaeton?'

*BANG*

The archangel's body, buried in the ground, carved a groove in the floor as it was pushed endlessly away.

"Kahaha! It's been a while!"

Before the momentum had even dissipated, Phaeton caught up to Rayel and unleashed a flurry of strikes with his small fists.

"Did you miss me! Huh? Did you miss me?"

Rayel's legs, with his upper body buried in the ground, were flapping like a fish.

When the angels, who had been watching in a daze, came to their senses and hurriedly turned around.

"No!"

The Hand of God pressed down on all of Bashka and bent its fingers as if scooping up dirt.

'Scooping up Heaven's army.'

Like a filter, all of Heaven's army was caught in the fist of light rising to the sky.

"Hyaaaah!"

The moment Shirone swung his arm, the Hand of God hurled them all away.

Countless angels activated their Judicial Halos, but it was a nature that couldn't be blocked by law.

"Waaaaah!"

The allied forces' eyes widened at the sight of angels and maras, fairies and giants flying away like sand.

"...What the hell is that?"

When they turned their heads to get an explanation, Shirone was breathing heavily.

"Hah. Hah."

He wasn't satisfied with the current result.

'The Ultima System is too weak. Withdrawing from the front lines is all. It's not like I sent them to space either.'

*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Judging by the sounds of air bursting, it seemed several key figures had already broken through Hexa's power and escaped.

'I need more ideas.'

As Shirone fell into thought, the Hand of God took the pose of a hand supporting a chin.

While everyone watched in bewilderment, Phaeton walked over, brushing off his pants.

"Really, how slow..."

Thunderous sounds burst consecutively from the air, and 11 figures landed around Shirone.

After glaring at Phaeton as if they would devour him, they immediately knelt on one knee and showed respect.

"Messiah."
