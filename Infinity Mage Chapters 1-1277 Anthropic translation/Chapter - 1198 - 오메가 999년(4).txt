Omega 999 Years (4)

"Sister, you're truly amazing."

As the Fire Tribe applauded, Yorahan was stunned watching Armang's new technique of micro-world creation.

"You can do something like that?"

"Sister Armang handles metal the best among the Fire Tribe. That's called precision adjustment."

Armang drew her sword and examined the blade.

It trembled while making a buzzing sound as if the sword were alive.

"Let's go."

Just as Yorahan awkwardly stood up to follow behind Armang, a Fire Tribe member spoke.

"Be careful. There are carnivorous animals living where Sister Armang is going."

For a species to survive, an ecosystem was essential.

"But nothing serious will happen. Sister Armang is really strong. So make sure to stick close to her."

Yorahan showed his forearm.

"What are you talking about? I'm pretty strong too."

As he threw some pathetic punches and chased after Armang, the Fire Tribe members laughed.

"He's really a kind person. Could he possibly be Fire Tribe?"

They liked Yorahan.

"Hey, how far are we going? Let's rest a bit."

One hour after leaving the village and climbing the mountain, Yorahan was already exhausted.

"How weak. You wandered the world with that kind of stamina?"

Of course he was confident in mountain climbing, but Armang's pace was really fast.

"If you travel like that, no one can follow you."

"Hmph."

Unlike her cold turn away, Armang sat on a rock and handed him a water bottle.

"Drink."

"Ah, thanks."

While drinking water, Yorahan glanced sideways at Armang.

Unlike her usual fierce appearance, she wore a pretty smile as she admired the scenery.

"Cough! Cough!"

When she heard him choking, Armang's expression disappeared.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing, just... I thought you could smile too. I've never seen you laugh before."

Since he'd always been around her, he could say that with confidence.

"That's how dangerous you are to the village. If you've realized that, then leave now."

"Why do you hate me? I swear, I have no intention of hurting the Fire Tribe."

"Because you're human."

Armang said.

"The humans I've met so far weren't evil from the beginning either. Most of them approached with good intentions like you. But they change over time. As if they got tired of pretending to be good."

Yorahan couldn't deny it.

"Why do I hate humans? It's precisely because I resemble humans. Except for carnivorous species, the Fire Tribe gets energy from the sun. An infinite resource that no one needs to take more of or share. But you and I are different. When we eat something, some other living creature has to starve."

Armang added.

"I don't hate you. I just don't trust the vicious ego of carnivorous species. Whatever you're thinking, in the end you'll want to possess us too."

"Sorry."

Yorahan said.

"Yeah, you're right. Humans are that kind of species. To be honest, I felt my heart race when I looked at you earlier too."

Armang didn't respond.

"But I'll never hurt you. I'll know what's right and act accordingly. I think that's where humanity's hope lies."

Good and evil don't matter.

What matters is that we can choose.

"So couldn't you read my heart, my sincerity, just once? I want to show it to you."

"No."

"Why? To know what kind of bad guy I am, you first need to know about me."

"That's not the problem..."

Looking somewhat embarrassed, Armang pursed her lips.

"I've never synchronized with a human."

"Huh?"

"At first I tried it with animals. It was horrible. The feeling of having to resonate with what I had to eat."

"Ah..."

"You keep telling me to read your mind, but micro-world creation isn't like that. You really become one. Fire Tribe with passive nature are actually fine. They willingly accept whatever feelings come in. But I'm different. If a human's ego penetrates into me..."

Her body trembled.

"It's disgusting. Having to accept someone's desires into my heart when I don't even like them."

He thought he understood how that would feel.

"Don't misunderstand. I don't mean I dislike you. But honestly, I don't want to connect."

Though he felt hurt thinking he'd been rejected, he fully understood Armang's feelings.

"I thought about it too easily. For you, micro-world creation would require courage beyond what it means for a human to give everything to someone. I'm sorry."

Emotion appeared in Armang's eyes for the first time, but she soon fixed her expression and stood up.

"Let's go. We need to finish hunting before sunset."

Just then, the bushes rustled.

As Armang and Yorahan turned simultaneously, a pack of wolves was closing in around them.

"Tch."

Armang drew her longsword.

'The Fire Tribe's scent doesn't attract beasts. It's because of Yorahan.'

Since she had brought him, she couldn't blame him.

"Back away slowly. I'll block them."

The chief's condition was that they shouldn't kill what they don't eat, but the situation was different now.

'The Fire Tribe helps humans.'

Just as those two beliefs collided, the wolf pack stuck out their tongues and charged.

"Run!"

To buy time for Yorahan to escape, she dove into the wolf pack.

'Are these really beasts?'

Even though Armang was a carnivorous species, she was ultimately plant-based, and she was taken aback by the wolves' aggressiveness.

'I can't go easy.'

After steeling her resolve, every time she spun and swung her sword, lives were cut short.

"Huff. Huff."

Looking at the forest scene scattered with wolf carcasses, Armang's heart was devastated.

"Damn it! Because of that guy...!"

"Ahhh!"

Yorahan's scream was heard.

Through micro-world creation, his footsteps running toward the cliff were transmitted to her.

"Oh no!"

When she arrived, Yorahan was cornered at the edge of the cliff, surrounded by wolves.

"Graaawr!"

The moment he fell below due to the wolves' threat, Armang threw her body forward.

'Below the cliff is a rapid current.'

More problematic than that were the rocks jutting out in the middle.

'Micro-world creation.'

Armang grabbed the tree vine that flew like a whip and reached out her hand while falling.

"Grab it!"

Yorahan reached out his hand, but the distance was too far.

'He'll die like this.'

If he hit the rock wall, it would be instant death.

'A human...'

With an almost unconscious manifestation, Armang used micro-world creation on Yorahan.

"Ugh!"

Her face flushed red.

'That bad guy!'

When did he say he was confident?

The thoughts he'd been thinking about her without knowing flooded in like waves.

'This is why I hate it. Why do I have to suffer this humiliation? And yet he so boldly...'

At that moment, she began to see something at the center of Yorahan's desires.

'Patience, conviction, consideration.'

All the effort he'd had to endure until now to protect others' feelings.

"Ah."

She felt it for the first time.

'So this is what it feels like.'

To be loved.

When you think of the other person first, desire breaks through its murky shell and reveals its beautiful essence.

'I won't get hurt.'

As long as he does his best to protect Armang.

'Yorahan.'

She conveyed her heart.

'Accept me.'

Yorahan couldn't describe in words the feeling of becoming one with Armang.

'So this is what it is.'

It was an integration that transcended dominance and submission, something never felt among humans.

'Complete oneness.'

Yorahan's body moved on its own to avoid the rocks, but there was nothing he could do about the rapid current.

"Ugh!"

The moment they fell into the water and the micro-world creation broke, Armang let go of the vine and jumped down.

"Yorahan!"

Her body pierced into the water without even creating bubbles.

While Sirone's legend dream progressed, dozens of years had passed in Gaold's world.

In the world that had reached compromise, daily life was monotonous and there was extremely little data to process.

"Congratulations, Gaold."

Except for today.

"Getting such a young bride. Well, this is also a skill. Eat lots of good food. Heh heh!"

Receiving people's congratulations, Gaold entered the waiting room and stood in front of the mirror.

A gaunt man in his 60s stood there.

"Are you okay? Why do you look like that?"

Gangnan approached and adjusted his clothes.

"Relax. This is the day your dream comes true."

"My dream."

"I know. It might feel a bit strange. But in reality, you sacrificed everything for Miro. There's no terrible pain or war here. Isn't that enough?"

"Terrible pain."

Ah, that's right.

He had suffered every moment in pain that he couldn't avoid or die from.

"Come on, let's go see the bride. Smile a bit! No one's going to say anything to you."

When the groom arrived at the bride's waiting room, the people inside made way for him.

"Go in."

As if there were no walls, Gaold approached the door closely and knocked softly.

"Yes, please come in."

What kind of future was waiting?

When he opened the door and entered, in the waiting room was...

"Uncle."

Everything that was Gaold's was waiting.

Miro in her wedding dress was so beautiful that he wished time would just stop right now.

"What? Why are you looking at me like that? Do I look strange?"

He had waited dozens of years for her to become an adult, but on the other hand, it felt like it was just yesterday.

"You..."

Gaold smiled bitterly.

"You seem to get younger and younger."

"Weren't we classmates in magic school in reality?"

"Haha."

Understanding the meaning in his words, Miro approached Gaold.

"What's wrong? You look cool even now. And the bride is the star of the wedding. I just need to be pretty."

She really was pretty.

"Hoho! Your eyes are full of desire. But I'll let it slide today."

"...Won't you regret it?"

Miro asked back with an affectionate smile.

"Why? Do you think you'll regret it, Uncle?"

"No."

Facing this moment, regret is impossible for a person.

"Then I won't regret it either. Because I love you."

It was true.

In the case where Miro of ultimate good had no more reality left to protect.

"The ceremony is soon. See you later."

When Gaold nodded and left the waiting room, Arius, now an old dog, greeted him.

Seeing Gaold's expression, Sein asked.

"What are you thinking?"

Even here they weren't close, but his sharp eyes couldn't be fooled.

"About what? I'm not thinking about anything."

"You, by any chance..."

Gaold shook his head and stood up.

"Don't worry."

Sein watched Gaold for a long time as he patted his shoulder a couple times and walked away.

With all the guests gathered except Sirone, a Tormia-style wedding ceremony was held.

"Groom's entrance."

Applause and whistling didn't stop until Gaold walked up to the platform.

"Now for today's main event, let's call the bride."

When Miro appeared holding Sein's hand, wearing a veil, the guests stirred.

"The perfect bride."

'Uncle.'

Miro slowly raised her gaze and saw Gaold grinning broadly.

The guests burst into laughter.

"Hahaha! The groom is so happy he could die!"

But soon tears welled up in Gaold's eyes and his face contorted into a crying expression.

"Graaah!"

The ceremony hall shook violently, and countless eyes began pouring in through the ceiling.

Gaold gritted his teeth and faced forward.

"Miro."

He had dreamed.

A brilliant and beautiful dream.

"Let's go back."

Miro removed her veil.

"We have to protect the world. I won't make any compromises, I can endure as much as needed..."

Gaold's hair turned white.

"Let's go back."

To our lives where every moment is pain.

When the will to care for someone transcends desire, the heart loses its limits.

"Gaold."

Miro called his name for the first time.
