[737] Towards the Stars (1)

Nane spoke.

"Shirone, as long as you deny me, I cannot become a god, but the same goes for you."

It meant that neither Shirone nor Nane could liberate this world from suffering.

"From now on, the world will face terrible suffering. I will end this fight as quickly as possible."

Shirone intended to bear it all.

"Even if the end of life is emptiness, as long as we love something, I will never give up."

Nane's fingertip pointed at Shirone.

"Then the one who will suffer most is you."

Perhaps.

"The Great Purification. The sins we created will become reality and engulf you. Too overwhelming a burden to bear alone."

Nane's body dissolved like smoke.

"I hope the nightmare won't be too long."

Where Nane had disappeared, a desert sandstorm blew in and erased all traces of where he had been.

"A nightmare?"

Though they had balanced each other at the extremes of the law, Nane was still the freer one.

'No matter what I do, this is a losing battle.'

While Nane, who defined the world as zero, could commit any atrocity, Shirone had to protect them all.

"You're not alone, Shirone."

Lian approached and placed his hand on Shirone's shoulder.

"Even if the whole world turns away from you, I will follow you."

No matter how endless this battle might be, Lian would be by his side at the very end.

"I agree."

As Seong-eum approached Shirone and extended her arm, Lian's Great Straight Sword leaped through space into her hand.

Throwing it to Lian, she said.

"From now on, humanity must fight against a great enemy. As a princess of the Jincheon Empire, I cannot stand by and watch. I'll return home and relay this message to my father."

Though the Emperor of Jincheon Empire was someone even Seong-eum couldn't move, Mungyeong silently stood guard behind her.

"Go to the Ivory Tower. Since you've granted our lives a reprieve, I think you're fully qualified."

"The Ivory Tower."

None of the candidates had originally been obsessed with becoming a star of the Ivory Tower, but now the situation was different.

'We can't win unless we all fight together.'

Even Shirone, who had reached the unprecedented realm of infinite magician, couldn't perfectly stop Nane's great work.

Unless one side achieved victory, countless sacrifices would inevitably follow.

"I'll go to the Ivory Tower."

Seong-eum nodded.

"Good thinking. I'll take you there."

With ether waves, they could travel directly to the Ivory Tower regardless of distance.

Kido spoke.

"I won't go to the Ivory Tower."

Shirone had already expected this, seeing Kido's expression.

"You're planning to leave, aren't you, Kido."

"I want to explore what I've realized. Right now I'm too confused. You can understand that, can't you, Shirone?"

The journey from mere knowledge to heart, and from heart back to knowledge, required time.

"Of course. It's your life."

Listening to Kido's words, Lian, who had been lost in thought, sheathed his Great Straight Sword on his back and spoke.

"Shirone, I won't go to the Ivory Tower either."

Again, Shirone nodded.

"I expected that from you."

"First, I want to go home and organize my thoughts. I need to do what I can."

Though he had defeated Ymir, that was merely a molar; to protect Shirone in the final war, he needed to become even stronger.

"Shirone, you will become a star of the Ivory Tower."

Perhaps because Shirone was the only one in this world who had opened super-sense, Lian could leave his side for a while.

"Then I too must become a knight worthy of you. It always seems like I'm just chasing behind, but give me time once more."

Mungyeong looked at Lian's back and thought.

'Does he see that there are still higher levels to reach?'

Lian's martial prowess, which had shattered Ymir's torso, was beyond what even he, a swordsman of Jincheon, could catch up to.

"Alright. I'll be waiting."

Though Lian and Kido were reliable companions, to stop Nane's great work, he had to endure the longing.

'The world will change faster than ever before.'

Seong-eum said.

"If we're done talking, let's depart. I need to return to the Jincheon Empire as quickly as possible too."

Kido stepped away from Seong-eum's side and said.

"Shirone, we're friends, right?"

Kido would travel the world and reach some conclusion, and perhaps it might be one that denied Shirone's conclusion.

"Of course. You're my most precious friend. No matter what situation we meet in, that will never change."

Only then did Kido feel relieved, turn around, and quickly leap toward the desert where the horizon stretched out.

"Good luck, Shirone!"

Shirone watched Kido's retreating figure, his worn cloak fluttering, for a long time.

"Have a good journey."

Then he turned to Lian and asked.

"Will you be okay alone? How about I go with you at least to where there's a village? It'll be hard to find food here."

Lian shifted the Great Straight Sword on his back.

"With this, I can survive even in hell. Don't worry about me and come back as a star."

Having felt like he'd traveled a lifetime during this Ivory Tower test, Shirone also missed home.

'Amy...'

His heart raced at the thought of seeing her soon.

"I'm departing now."

Mungyeong bowed to Lian with respect and stood three steps behind Seong-eum as ether waves spread out.

As Seong-eum pulled space all the way to the North Pole and cast spatial folding, the three figures vanished without a trace.

Lian watched the spot where Shirone had disappeared with satisfaction, but suddenly his eyes blazed with fierce fire.

"Ymir."

The giant's phantom flickered above the desert horizon.

Corona Kingdom.

Located at the northern limit where humans could live, Corona Kingdom was the Arctic's only nation.

Befitting a country built on perpetual snow, ice crafting was well-developed, and it was virtually the Ivory Tower's only market.

People living in a country where blizzards struck daily felt death closer than life.

Even the torches hanging on walls seemed precarious, and people in the cityscape wore expressions as cold as ice.

"Where is this?"

It didn't seem to be the Ivory Tower, so when Shirone turned his head, Seong-eum was biting her lip with a troubled expression.

"Probably Corona Kingdom."

To Seong-eum, who could leap across vast spaces, Corona felt as small as something she'd passed by, but anyway, the only places where people lived in the Arctic were either the Ivory Tower or Corona.

"I couldn't approach the Ivory Tower."

The moment she cast spatial folding, the feeling of the Ivory Tower disappeared and she lost the coordinates.

It felt like some kind of emergency escape, arriving at the only place her senses could grasp.

'Is there someone who manipulates space?'

She wouldn't have believed it before, but having faced Shirone, Nane, and Ymir, her thinking was different now.

'It's entirely possible.'

It also meant Seong-eum's experience had broadened.

"I could try again, but the result would be the same. The Ivory Tower wouldn't hang up its sign without at least this level of preparation."

Shirone thought the same.

"Yeah. Still, we made it to the Arctic, so we saved time. I'll find my way from here. Thank you."

When Shirone, having regained his composure, smiled, a faint blush rose on Seong-eum's cheeks.

'He's such a kind person.'

What Anchal had said wasn't a lie.

'I don't want to fight this person.'

Having so much she wanted to say, the current time constraints felt unwelcome.

"How much time can you give me?"

"Hahaha."

Shirone burst into laughter at words that seemed like Seong-eum's obsession with measuring opponents by distance had changed to time.

"I can give you as much as you want. Without you, it would have taken over 10 days just to reach the Arctic."

"Ten days, you say."

Seong-eum smiled shyly and stepped back.

"When you become a star, be sure to visit Jincheon. I'll use those 10 days you gave me then."

"No, you don't have to do that necessarily. If you want..."

"It's a promise. Ten days."

Now understanding Seong-eum's personality, Shirone didn't elaborate and accepted.

"Alright. I'll give you my 10 days."

It was a satisfying answer.

"I'll also give you my zero treasure."

"Huh?"

Though Shirone asked back, Seong-eum gave a meaningful smile and disappeared with Mungyeong.

"...Zero treasure probably means..."

Let's be close friends without formality.

"Shall I get going?"

Having reached that conclusion, Shirone walked through Corona Kingdom's streets with a lighter heart.

It was already late at night, and no lights were on except in taverns. The aftereffects of fighting for days without rest hit him belatedly.

'Something's a bit strange.'

At some point, he'd noticed that Armand wasn't restoring his fatigue, but he couldn't focus on such things now.

"I want to sleep. I want to sleep."

Fighting his drooping eyelids, he found his way to an inn with warm steam rising from it.

'This won't do. I need to sleep first.'

Even having reached the Arctic, he didn't know where the Ivory Tower was, and there were no competitors left anyway.

Opening the door, a middle-aged woman greeted him.

"Welcome. This is the White Inn."

Looking around, he saw a team playing cards at a corner table.

Passing this common scene, Shirone's gaze fixed on a table in front of the counter.

A red-haired girl who appeared to be about ten years old was drinking strong liquor alone.

'Do kids drink alcohol here too?'

Being a cold region, that might be possible, but thinking again, it was illogical reasoning.

"Are you here for lodging?"

At the middle-aged woman's question, Shirone hurriedly answered.

"Ah, yes. If possible, I'd like food too. I haven't had dinner yet..."

"Oh my. There should be some bread and soup left. But what should we do? There are no empty rooms right now."

"No rooms?"

His knowledge of Corona Kingdom was fragmentary, but it wasn't a country tourists or travelers would frequently visit.

"Yes. Since yesterday, Ivory Tower residents have been staying here as a group, so we're fully booked."

'Ivory Tower residents? But how are they here?'

Shirone narrowed his eyes suspiciously and looked back at the four people playing cards.

There was no conversation at all; they mechanically drew and played cards like machines, collecting the pot.

'It looks like four Irukis sitting there.'

The middle-aged woman said.

"Tonight's blizzard is severe. If you don't mind sharing a room, I can ask the guests who are awake."

"Ah, if you could do that..."

"You can share a room with me."

The girl who had downed the strong liquor in one gulp turned to Shirone with a raised corner of her mouth, making the middle-aged woman rest her chin on her hand and mutter.

"Hmm, but mixed-gender room sharing is a bit..."

"What's wrong with it? It's fine if the parties involved agree. I was just missing male company anyway. I won't charge for the room."

Shirone frowned.

"Little one, you shouldn't say such things. And drinking alcohol so young isn't good for your health."

"Well, since your opponent was Nane, you must be tired too."

"Huh? What did you just say?"

As Shirone blinked, the girl who had been staring at her glass with unfocused eyes turned her head.

"Even an infinite magician goes down if hit properly?"

Shirone immediately opened his senses.

'She's not a child.'

As the Ultima System combined with super-cognition, the false information surrounding her vanished instantly.

She was a woman with attractive features that seemed made-up even without makeup, a sleek figure, and refreshingly long limbs.

"Ah, right!"

The middle-aged woman clapped her hands together.

"She would appear as a young girl to ordinary people. This is Saint Miracle Minerva."

"Saint?"

"She's an Ivory Tower resident. Let me see, what star level did you say you were?"

Minerva held up five fingers.

"Ah, 5-star. Anyway, what do you think, Minerva? Are you really willing to share a room?"

"I said I was fine with it. What matters is the other party's opinion."

Shirone couldn't hear anything.

'5-star means one of the Five Great Stars, right? Wait... Minerva? Could it be the one I saw in books...'

Miracle Minerva.

One of the world's 100 most dangerous individuals, and the name of the great witch who had plunged the world into despair 700 years ago.
