12 O'Clock, 12 Nations (4)

"The starting point..."

Sirone muttered while Iruki and Nade remained tense, scanning the forest.

"Mika."

Still no response came.

"Is only the entrance materialized in reality? Then we've already left the phase space..."

Eden said, "I don't see those we saw in the smoke. It seems everyone has different starting points."

A woman's voice asked:

Are you accomplices?

"Accomplices?"

If you don't choose between solo and accomplice, the Crime Dice won't activate.

Nade clasped his hands behind his head and asked, "How about you recommend something? I mean... there must be pros and cons to each, right?"

Solo has many advantages. Above all, no one wants to entrust their life to others.

Silence followed.

"So we'll be doing dangerous things either way."

Iruki, who said this, stepped forward.

"But if solo is advantageous, wouldn't everyone choose solo? What are the advantages of being accomplices?"

There aren't any in particular. However, if you choose accomplice, missions to kill each other won't be activated.

There seemed to be no choice.

"We'll go with accomplice."

As Sirone made the decision, two dice appeared before the group, glowing brightly.

They were six-sided dice numbered 1 through 6.

The Crime Dice will determine your fate. Judgment begins the moment the Crime Dice touch the land. Accomplices cannot roll dice consecutively. However, if doubles are rolled, one more chance is given.

Nade snatched up the dice.

Let your left hand not know what murder your right hand commits. May you find peace in Melkidu.

As the voice concluded definitively, Nade shouted, "Hey! You have to tell us what this is! Hey!"

Iruki said, "It's useless. It's just a system message. While it has enough cognitive ability for conversation, it doesn't seem able to predict responses or understand psychological states."

Eden asked, "What will you do? The Crime Dice, it said it determines our fate."

Nade shook the dice in his hand.

"We have no choice, do we? No one's chasing us exactly, but we need to save Sena."

Iruki said, "It said one person can't roll consecutively. So who wants to go first?"

Nade held out the dice.

"Here, roll it, Sirone."

"...Why me?"

"It said no one wants to entrust their life to others. But I want to entrust my life to you."

Eden raised his hand.

"I agree."

Sirone, receiving the Crimson Dice, turned his head.

"It said judgment begins when it touches the land. But what exactly is the definition of land?"

Iruki said, "Probably natural terrain? It means artificial terrain - special boards that could manipulate the dice numbers or mud with strong friction - wouldn't work."

That made sense.

"Hmm. I see. Alright. I'll try."

When he threw the dice, the six-sided cube bounced off numerous objects on the ground.

"It stopped."

As the group watched tensely, the dice glowed and displayed numbers.

A + symbol appeared between the numbers 2 and 4, then combined into the number 6.

Nade said, "6... Now, what happensssssss..."

The end of his voice stretched like noise, and the surrounding scenery changed at tremendous speed.

"...sssss next?"

When his voice returned to normal, they were already inside a village entrance.

It was about 100 households in size, with people walking between the buildings.

This is Dorian Village.

The woman's voice was heard.

C-rank mission. Kill 3 village residents. Successfully completing the mission will award Crime Points.

"What?"

Collect Crime Points to enhance your dice. Points are also used when stealing items from shops.

"Hmm. I see."

Nade, who muttered this, shrugged his shoulders.

"I don't understand any of this. What exactly are Crime Points? Like money?"

Crime Points support your desires. You currently have 100P.

Sirone said, "This is just like the other world's system. It tells you purification time there too."

Iruki nodded.

"Well, this place is related to Satan after all. But what does supporting desires mean?"

No answer came.

"Here's what I think."

Eden raised his index finger.

"In reality, criminals are always running. When their desire not to be caught becomes too desperate, Melkidu appears before them at specific times."

"In addition to that..."

When Iruki walked to the entrance and reached out, a transparent barrier appeared, blocking their exit.

"The interior is an isolated space. All locations in Melkidu might be constructed in blocks."

"The dice!"

Nade clapped his hands.

"We jump over spaces according to the dice numbers. Each space has a village."

Iruki nodded.

"So it's a murderer's sanctuary. If a criminal entered while being chased, naturally the security forces would enter too. But unless they roll the exact same dice number, they can never catch the criminal."

Eden said, "What's left now are the points. Enhancing dice is also questionable. It must be related to survival somehow."

Nade said, "It told us to kill 3 village residents. So are the residents human? Or illusions created by the system?"

Remembering Singh, Sirone said, "Anyway, we've only advanced 6 spaces. No matter how big Melkidu is, this should be considered the beginning. Let's meet people and gather information. We'll decide after that."

Entering the village, six shop buildings on either side filled the blocks.

"There's a tavern. Should we go in?"

Just then, a man came out of the weapon shop holding a 20-centimeter knife.

As the group instinctively stopped walking, he flipped the knife and examined the blade.

"Hmm..."

Then he yawned languidly and approached a passerby before even closing his mouth.

"Huh!"

The passerby's eyes widened as he was stabbed unexpectedly, and the man repeatedly stabbed his abdomen.

"Aaaah! Help me, someone help!"

Though the victim fell to the ground spurting blood and screaming, no one showed interest.

"Save... save me..."

In just 10 seconds the person died, and the man wiped the blood on the corpse before standing up.

"Early missions aren't cost-effective."

As Sirone's group watched in bewilderment, Iruki said, "Strange. Why don't they care? They could be the next victim."

Even seeing the corpse on the ground, passersby just walked calmly down the street.

The man who wiped his knife walked steadily toward a woman selling candles in a basket.

"Hello. Please buy some candles..."

The 20-centimeter blade penetrated the woman's neck completely, then withdrew.

Even as a fountain of blood erupted, the man made several more cuts to completely end her life.

"One more left."

The man who turned around made eye contact with Sirone's group, who had been watching.

Just showing interest in murder was enough to identify them as players.

"Tsk."

With an expression that wasn't fearful but somehow uncomfortable, the man passed by Sirone.

"Wait a moment."

Nade called out to the man's back.

"What?"

"You performed a mission, right?"

"So what?"

After checking his friends' expressions and getting their apparent agreement, Nade asked, "Why don't people pay attention to you? The victims clearly felt fear."

The man blinked for a moment, then seemed to realize something and shrugged his shoulders.

"Heh. Hehehe."

Sirone's group waited.

"You guys are rookie players. Newbies who haven't even completed one cycle."

'Cycle.'

An orbital method?

"Yeah, well. Anyway, I'm curious. Will you tell us why passersby ignore murder cases?"

The reason for asking despite risking exposure was efficiency.

'Asking people is fastest. Besides, what could happen?'

Sirone was there, after all.

"I don't want to."

The man said, "Figure it out yourselves. You've lost your survival instincts. Consider yourselves lucky. If you didn't have such pitifully few points, I would have devoured you."

"What does that mean?"

Though he asked while he was at it, the man turned away as if annoyed.

"Get lost. Pray you don't meet me next time. It'll be quite miserable then."

As Nade watched the departing man blankly, he smiled and said, "Can't be helped. If that's how it is... I'll have to hear it by force."

"Lightning of Truth and Falsehood."

It was a technique from the Thunder God Transformation that had immobilized believers in the heavenly village.

Insufficient Crime Points for crime execution. Current Crime Points: 100P.

"Huh?"

When the avatar technique didn't activate, the group finally realized the seriousness and each checked their magic.

The same woman's voice was heard.

"Magic is impossible. No, according to the system voice, points seem to be required."

The man said, "Idiots."

Without even looking back, he raised his hand and gave them the middle finger, causing Nade to charge forward.

"That bastard really...!"

Though they couldn't use magic, they were those who had fought on the front lines of the World War.

'Some petty criminal who just stabs passersby.'

With that thought, just as he was about to strike the man's back of the head, someone shouted from the side.

"Stop!"

When Nade turned his head, a man with deep wrinkles as if weathered by hardship stood there.

"Who are you?"

Even facing the Thunder God's cold gaze, the man didn't avert his eyes.

"I'm telling you not to do something you'll regret. If you attack that guy, you'll be the ones who suffer."

The word 'you'll' snapped Nade back to awareness.

The murderer clicked his tongue.

"Tsk."

Then he glanced at the middle-aged man and left the scene faster than before.

Without dropping his guard, Sirone asked, "What would have happened if my friend had attacked that man?"

"Points would be deducted. You're accomplices, right? If this is your first village, you'd have 100P."

The middle-aged man pointed at the murderer.

"How many points does that guy have? Unknown. But even if he only had 200P, you'd be finished. When Crime Attack judgment activates, points are deducted until one side reaches 0."

"So we'd have 0, and he'd have 100P remaining."

"Right. And 100P is enough Crime Points to stab your bodies 20 times."

Nade's complexion turned pale.

"Don't be too nervous. Even with 0 points, it doesn't restrict general actions. You're mages, right? In reality, this friend would have easily defeated him, but this is Melkidu. Points are everything."

The man pointed to the tavern behind him.

"How about it? I think I can help you. Though I'll have to get at least a beer out of it."

Sirone said, "That's fine. We need information too. But... being in Melkidu means you're also a criminal, doesn't it?"

Could they really trust this man?

"It's natural to be suspicious, but I'm a detective. I'm tracking the Edrina case."

Sirone's eyes widened.

"The Edrina case?"

It was the unsolved case that had once stirred up the Iron Kingdom - the disappearance of four women of the same age.
