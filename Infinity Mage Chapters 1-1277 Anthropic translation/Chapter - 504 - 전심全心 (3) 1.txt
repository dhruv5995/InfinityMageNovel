[504] Whole Heart (3)

Maclean Guffin.

The fact that throughout the history of heaven, it was a human who came closest to the annihilation of the Akashic Records left a deep wound on the angels.

Though oblivion does not exist in an angel's astral body, that being from so long ago had become fossilized under the weight of memory, yet now it surfaced vividly in Piel's astral body.

'It was the same back then.'

As the doubt preserved in cold memory thawed, confusion came once again.

Are humans strong or weak?

Why do they sometimes reach the supreme spiritual state that transcends even while being swayed by mere animal desires?

Humans are creatures that have been defined tens of thousands of times by countless beings, but words that can perfectly describe them have yet to be created.

Is it because they are such complex creatures?

'No.'

Piel thought.

'They are not fixed.'

Humans are endlessly moving toward something even at this very moment.

'That is why they must be annihilated.'

Piel's astral body exploded outward.

The light ring that had been expanding fast enough to swallow heaven contracted at an even faster speed, becoming a single point before disappearing.

"No!"

Ikael, who had been rapidly cutting through the sky approaching them, realized the situation and cried out.

Apatheia.

The Closed Eyes of Annihilation.

Piel's signature technique, the Closed Eyes of Annihilation, was an ability that consolidated the source concept of extinction, and once activated, it was the worst and strongest technique that even archangels avoided.

"I execute the will of the archangel."

The light-drawn pupils embedded in Piel's hood transformed into perfect circles like halos.

Deep, clear dots were marked at the center of those two circles.

Though it was a ridiculous face, if one looked closely, it was inhumanly cold and merciless to the point of being chilling, and thus inspiring awe.

'This is strange.'

Sirone couldn't muster the courage to counterattack.

Through Straight, the Piel he observed was merely a shell, and currently the source concept of extinction was evenly spread throughout the entire world.

That was precisely why the astral body had disappeared.

Closing the world.

As Piel's eyes slowly closed, the colors of the landscape containing Sirone began to gradually fade.

"Keuuuuk!"

Feeling the sense of extinction of his avatar, Sirone trembled violently.

Ego.

If I disappear, the universe disappears too.

That was precisely the Closed Eyes of Annihilation, the ultimate extinction technique of closing the world by closing oneself.

"Uaaaah!"

Though the Closed Eyes of Annihilation hadn't even closed halfway yet, Sirone writhed in despair.

If he hadn't equipped Armand's avatar through the principle of All Things Are One Mind, he would have already dissolved into the void of nothingness.

'I must endure! If I don't endure...'

He will ultimately be annihilated.

But all Sirone could do was maintain his avatar even slightly.

The Closed Eyes of Annihilation was bringing an end to Sirone's world at the precise time and precise speed.

Pop! Blood vessels burst in Sirone's eyes, and blood flowed from his nose as well.

Though he tried his utmost to maintain his avatar, whether to close his eyes or not was Piel's choice alone.

And this was the powerful force possessed by an archangel's source concept.

'How frustrating...!'

As his presence faded, even the Spirit Zone couldn't exert its influence.

And finally, as he entered a stage below matter, Sirone's body became translucent.

"Not bad for a Nephilim."

Piel's voice was heard directly.

"But now your world will be closed."

Piel's eyes drooped as if sleepy.

It was the moment just before Sirone would become completely transparent, as if he had never existed in the world from the beginning.

"Huk!"

At that moment, Sirone's avatar blazed with intense light.

The Closed Eyes of Annihilation snapped open, and Sirone's form appeared vividly as if carved into the landscape.

Only Archangel Ikael could instantly amplify an avatar that had been nearly extinguished.

"Sirone!"

"Where do you think you're running!"

Satiel, who had chased after Ikael, grabbed her neck and slammed her into the ground.

"Kuk!"

Then, placing Ikael between her legs, she bent her upper body and pressed down on her neck oppressively.

As her astral body spread into a light ring and decomposition ability was applied, Ikael's wings of light lost their strength and died.

Having used her power to regain her memories and just revived Sirone's avatar, Ikael had no means to resist.

"Ikael! Kuk!"

Sirone tried to run to her, but the Closed Eyes of Annihilation closed again, binding Sirone.

"Piel! Kill him! I'll annihilate Ikael!"

Though the Closed Eyes of Annihilation showed optimal efficiency in annihilating a single entity, it had the disadvantage of leaving Piel defenseless as his mind scattered into the world.

But with Satiel blocking Ikael, all disadvantages were offset.

"Disappear! Shame of angels!"

Satiel's eyes contained the resentment of eons that humans could not physically store.

'Because of you, if only you hadn't existed...!'

"Keuuuu!"

Watching Ikael being decomposed, Sirone cast magic with all his might.

"Ikaeeeeel!"

Shining Chain wrapped around Satiel's body.

Having seen with her own eyes how much Piel had suffered, she flinched.

But the chains of light couldn't give her any binding force and simply passed through her body.

"Keuuuuk!"

Sirone ground his teeth in frustration.

With the Closed Eyes of Annihilation more than half closed, magic wasn't being properly implemented.

Satiel, who had briefly shown a relieved expression, pressed down on Ikael again with venomous eyes.

A face she couldn't bear to look at.

This face that was so beautiful she hated it!

"I'll destroy you before annihilating you!"

Judicial Halo.

Nostalgia.

Pop pop pop pop pop!

Fragments of light burst from Ikael's face.

Destroy it.

Her authority, her beauty, her hateful memories—decompose them all!

"Uaaaah!"

Thud!

A dull impact struck Satiel's temple.

'Huh?'

Belatedly realizing her body was being pushed back, Satiel dragged along the ground to regain her balance.

As she turned her head, puzzlement filled her eyes.

Though she had been caught off guard, there weren't many beings in heaven who could generate enough force to push back an archangel's body.

"Kariel? Why are you...?"

Kariel stood with an agitated expression.

As far as Satiel knew, his hatred was not much different from her own.

'But why?'

Even Ikael, who had received help, seemed speechless as she looked at Kariel.

Kariel understood their feelings.

Honestly speaking, he himself didn't know why he had attacked Satiel.

'What did I just do?'

He had come flying here saying he would annihilate Ikael.

That he would finish with his own hands the one who had thrown her heart to a mere human.

Perhaps it was because his mental strength had weakened?

The moment he saw Satiel's Nostalgia, his astral body shook violently, and he couldn't remember anything after that.

Kariel slowly turned his gaze to meet Ikael's eyes.

Though it wasn't his complete will, he had ultimately saved her.

Ikael, whom he hated.

But what Kariel was feeling now was... definite anticipation.

"The heart is contradictory, is that it?"

Uorin nodded.

"Yes. In fact, altruism is a serious error from the perspective of survival of the fittest, the great principle of the universe. Then what is altruism? It's nothing more than another form of selfishness—loving the altruistic self. Like mistakenly thinking you've earned the right to hate because you love that person so much."

Kando thought.

Am I... hating Uorin?

"Uaaaaah!"

At Sirone's scream, all the angels' gazes focused there.

It wasn't just that they were paying attention to one human's cry.

Sirone's mind, which had been spread out carelessly, was collapsing as if swept away by a giant wave, losing its specific form.

"Sirone!"

Ikael passed by Kariel and ran to Sirone.

The end of explosion, the extreme form of amplification.

If he couldn't stop here, Sirone's mind would be torn to shreds and never return to its original state.

"Keuuuuu!"

Sirone clutched his head and writhed in pain.

His thoughts were being torn as if his brain was being ripped apart.

It was a violence of a different dimension from the exhilaration when opening the Immortal Function.

'No! Not yet!'

He tried somehow to maintain concentration, but his mind had already swollen beyond control.

Ikael squeezed out her last strength and activated Ataraxia.

She had no choice but to amplify the avatar's power once more to postpone the explosion.

It was like pouring water into a pot with a hole in the bottom, but she didn't hesitate.

If she could save Sirone even for 5 minutes, even just a little bit, she could abandon everything.

'Why...'

Kariel stood in dismay, following with only his gaze Ikael who had passed by him.

Did she not see him?

"Piel! Kill Sirone!"

Satiel charged viciously, shouting.

The more Ikael cared for Sirone, the greater Satiel's anger became.

'It should have been mine! All of that should have been mine!'

Kariel snapped to attention seeing Satiel targeting Ikael's back.

Judicial Halo.

Simulacre.

Like cheese seeping from a compressed leather pouch, countless machine parts squeezed through space and began assembling simultaneously.

Chararararararak!

The object that appeared after completing 36,000 processes in an instant was a weapon the size of a human bronze shield with eight blade-like projections like throwing stars.

Simulacre—something that rotates without stopping, grows stronger as it rotates, becomes harder as it grows stronger, and rotates faster as it becomes harder.

It was an object with a crude name for something created by the Archangel of Creation, but the situation was that urgent.

Nostalgia.

Physics Collapse.

Realizing the mechanism that transcended human intelligence, Satiel widened her eyes and activated her ability.

The weapon shook with a clatter, then rapidly decomposed from finished product to mechanism, from mechanism to components, from components to parts.

The speed was so fast it looked like an explosion without flames or explosive sound.

The weapon that passed Satiel at the level of detailed parts spread from alloy to mineral, from mineral to molecule, from molecule to atom, and disappeared.

"Hmph! Do you think you can beat me?"

Though she had never fought Kariel before, she had no doubt she wouldn't lose to the lowest combat-ranked among the archangels.

"......"

When Ikael blocked Sirone, Piel finally gave up maintaining the Closed Eyes of Annihilation.

"What a mess this is, Archangel."

He didn't like the current situation where everything had become chaotic with the archangels entangled with each other.

The same thing as back then was happening again.

Sirone. And Guffin.

Whenever the variable called human intervened, everything became a complete mess.

"I must end this."

Thud!

Piel's body, having kicked off the ground, flew into the sky.

Kuuuuung!

And he landed on the ground, trampling Kariel who was fighting with Satiel.

"Ka, Kariel?"

With his waist broken and buried in the ground, even Satiel, who had been fighting fiercely until now, had to soften her expression and step back.

Actually, he had no personal feelings toward him.

No, in one way, she had even felt camaraderie with him as they opposed Ikael together.

"An angel who has lost authority has no value in existing."

Leaving those words, Piel departed, and only then did Kariel's condition with his chest shattered come into view.

"Kariel... are you okay?"

As Satiel approached to check his condition, puzzlement filled her eyes.

Perhaps it was because it had been so long.

Kariel, looking up at the sky, wore a peaceful smile she had never seen before.

Just like back when everything was happy...
