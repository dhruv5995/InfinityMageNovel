East Country and West Country (2)

The famous female operator in High Gear is known among operators as "The Lady."

The first reason was that she never lost her elegance even in battlefields filled with raging firepower...

"The Lady seems upset again."

Number Seven's tone carried a hint of mockery.

"Don't misunderstand. You're the only oddball among the operators who actually plays High Gear, so I'm asking you. Will you be okay? I mean about Yahweh2. If we leave things as they are, he might eventually topple the Operator's reign. Maybe we should expel him nowâ€”" "So what? The reason the Operator is rank 1 has nothing to do with me being an administrator."

Number Seven chuckled.

"Well, I thought you might be getting anxious. How about it? If you want, I could tweak some events for you."

"Number Seven."

Her voice was cold.

"Don't get ahead of yourself. While 12 operators built High Gear, I was the original designer. I won't tolerate event expansions that go against the initial concept."

"That's rather annoying to hear."

Number Seven immediately shot back.

"I'll acknowledge that you're a genius, but we gathered here for an experiment about a perfect world. Not to create some lonely girl's playground."

SCREEEEEECH!

An ear-splitting high-frequency noise struck the operator meeting room's video feed.

The Operator screamed.

"Do you want to die? What do you know about me? Should I blow up your brain right now?"

"Go ahead if you can."

"Number Seven! You...!"

At that moment, the lollipop mark shouted.

"Stop! Please stop!"

Whether the words would work or not, their skill in immediately blocking the Operator's noise attack was excellent.

"We can't even go to school because you do this every meeting. Can't we just focus on the agenda?"

"That bastard keeps pissing me off!" Number Seven wasn't backing down either.

"What about you then? What's the point of an operator getting attached to users? Do you know how many bug tests I run every time I prepare one event? It's nauseating." "Look at it technically, technically. You could just log in occasionally to check if things are running smoothly, right? You're a god. You don't need to hunt all day. Just max out your status and sweep everything away. I'm starting to not understand what you mean by the perfect world you want. What do you want to do in High Gear?"

The transmission fell silent.

"...I don't know."

The Operator said.

"Can a created world truly become perfect? In the end, if users turn away from it, it's all fake, isn't it?"

Thoughts flowed through the silence.

"Yes, I ran away because I hated reality. So I have no choice. What I want to do in High Gear is... probably just living itself. My heart is here. So this place is real to me."

Number Seven asked.

"Are you satisfied with that? You created all of it yourself. What if a serious bug occurs? Could you keep living there even if High Gear becomes a complete mess?"

A delayed answer came.

"...I only said I want to live. We're done talking. I'm leaving first. Regarding the agenda, personally I see no wrongdoing. Keep that in mind when voting." The High Gear mark disappeared.

"Hmph! She keeps raid times like clockwork though. Hey, I'm leaving too. I abstain from the agenda."

As Number Seven also cut his connection, the smile mark quickly proceeded with the meeting.

"Let's vote right away. Those who think Yahweh2 should be sanctioned, press 1. No wrongdoing, press 2."

Numbers appeared on 10 screens.

"Good. Then I'll save today's meeting content and lock it up. See you at the next meeting."

Yahweh2, no wrongdoing.

Electronic Wasteland.

Shirone's group set High Gear's output to maximum and hunted Metal Wolves.

"Hey! It's running away! Shoot! Shoot!"

The moment the rifle spewed fire, the Metal Wolf sharply twisted direction.

Seeing only fragments flying from the innocent ground, Destruction Demon 707 frowned.

"Ugh, so annoying! This is weird? Didn't we used to catch these really easily before?"

Indeed, Metal Wolves had an average level of 6 to 7, making them weak creatures.

Death Princess said.

"It's because our levels are too low. Usually people reach level 7 in Iron Hometown before coming out here."

Shirone suggested a method.

"We can't win in a power contest. Since it's open terrain, we can't use the landscape. Let's create our own."

"Dig a trap?"

"No. One person shoots to extend the Metal Wolf's movement path. Then two people run in a straight line to offset the speed difference. After herding it into a single path like that, the last person finishes it off."

Strongest Codename nodded.

"Good method. If we rotate roles, we can level up evenly too. Once we pass level 5, we should be able to easily catch Metal Wolves."

The hunt resumed according to Shirone's strategy.

Kiiing! Kiiing!

Making sharp mechanical sounds, the Metal Wolf collapsed to the ground and levels immediately went up.

"This is insane! Since our levels are so low, the experience gauge shoots up just from catching one."

"Yeah. This'll be quick."

After hunting in turns like this, Shirone's entire group reached level 5.

Shirone's eyes sparkled.

"A new function appeared. Search radius 200 meters."

Death Princess said.

"Yeah. That's the AI function that activates at level 5. Now information about users or creatures within 200 meters will appear. Same goes for codenames."

"It doubled. It was 100 meters at first."

"Oh my, how did you know? That's not even in the manual. We found out by measuring it ourselves."

"Just... you know..."

A mage's intuitive feeling?

"Search radius is really important. First, since AI doesn't work outside the search range, auto-aim and everything else won't function. The only thing you can see is codenames, and only within visual range. At 500 meters or 1 kilometer away, you can't even confirm who hit you."

"That's advantageous for snipers. That's why Colonoscopy shot from the full 200 meters."

"That's basic. When levels get higher, combat range exceeds at least 1 kilometer. Users fly around and even shoot anti-personnel missiles."

Shirone nodded.

"I get it roughly. The higher the level, the more AI functions increase and performance improves. Since output gets stronger too, a 1-level difference is huge."

"Right. There are five main types of AI functions. What you've currently activated are auto-aim, recoil compensation, and search radius, right? One more will activate each at levels 7 and 9. Then from level 10, you enter the world of selective options."

"Ah, that's why it didn't open."

Shirone had to admit it.

'Honestly, it is fun. The system is designed so you learn step by step as you level up.'

In that regard, Tenman's existence was precarious.

'Well, that's the operators' domain.'

For now, Shirone wanted to enjoy High Gear as a user and resumed hunting.

When they caught level 10 Metal Scorpions and Metal Worms, experience shot up rapidly. The scorpions' acid spray from their tails and the wyrms' ability to hide underground were annoying.

At level 7, the penetration compensation function activated.

"That's good."

Death Princess explained.

"It's not a core function, but countless variables arise from this penetration compensation. The most important thing is that it's not about probability. Once you hit, you can definitely pierce armor. Meaning even against the strongest enemy, there's a chance for a headshot."

"Really? Then couldn't we beat the Operator?"

"To conclude, it's possible. But I think that probability is less than 0.001 percent. Let me explain from now on. Try aiming at me with the rifle."

When he aimed at Death Princess's forehead, the aim appeared.

100% appeared inside the aim circle, and a red line drew a ring around it.

When that red line formed a perfect circle, the 100% symbol glowed golden.

"Ah..."

"Get it? What's important in penetration judgment is the AI's calculation time. Since it's just an old iron helmet now, calculation finished in about 2 seconds, but if I had parts equipped, the time would be much longer depending on the armor's durability. Of course, if you equip better firearms, the time would naturally decrease."

"I understand. Then what happens if I aim at the Operator now? With maximum durability, wouldn't penetration judgment take hours?"

"No. In that case, 'Critical' judgment would appear instead of 100 percent. Because the rifle's power limit can't exceed the armor's durability."

"But you said 0.001 percent."

"That's when you equip better firearms. The Gold Ring will provide support anyway, right? Want to fight with a rifle? And do you think the Operator will wait patiently until you activate penetration compensation?"

"Well..."

"Still, it's a really good function. You and the Operator are extreme cases - normally, success lets you pierce armor 10 times stronger than your weapon's power."

"But it's that much harder."

"Hehe, right. So actually, this is more important for boss creature strategies. We call this raids - at high difficulty, creatures have tremendously high durability. In those cases, 'Critical' judgment is like rain in a drought. Some creatures are physically impossible to clear if even one critical fails."

"Yeah. I think I understand."

Hunting resumed.

From now on, leveling required much more experience, so they had to hunt for a full 3 hours.

Destruction Demon 707 said.

"Let's stop for today. It's dark so hunting efficiency drops. We need to conserve High Gear power too."

"Power is running low?"

"It's not something to worry about at this level, but just in case. Of course, at high levels it drains battery like crazy." Strongest Codename broke branches from the very rare withered trees occasionally seen in the wasteland.

"Let's make a fire. We don't need night watches, but prey might come."

Using flint brought from Iron Hometown to light a campfire, Shirone sat by the fire.

'The heat feels real too.'

Probably like a dream.

"Yahweh2."

Looking up, Death Princess was hesitating with a slightly flushed face.

"Yeah. What's up?"

"Well... we're going to have some fun, and if you don't mind, would you like to join us?"

Understanding what she meant, Shirone looked at Destruction Demon 707 and Strongest Codename.

And from their nonchalant attitudes, he realized.

'Right. This place is...'

A virtual world.

'Those kids' appearances are all fake too. Yeah, I'm probably the only one here concerned about hearts.'

Shirone politely declined.

"Sorry. I feel a bit awkward about it."

"Okay then."

Returning to her spot with a smile, Death Princess began silent play with her friends.

Crackle. Crackle.

As the campfire's sparks flew wildly, Shirone fell deep into thought.

'What is real?'

Three people across from him were kissing, and beyond them lay endless darkness.

'The heart...'

Shirone reached his hand close enough to get burned.

'Where does it exist?'

"Mmm..."

The campfire was hot, and also too cold.
