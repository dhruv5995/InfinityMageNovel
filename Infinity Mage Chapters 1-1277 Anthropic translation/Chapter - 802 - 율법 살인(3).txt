Law Kill (3)

Just from Havitz's reaction alone, it was clear that what this woman called Abella had said was true.

The head maid skipped all other procedures and called her directly to the Grand Hall.

Since this was the flower garden story that Havitz had once constantly talked about, even the Gustav 4 Knights looked on with curious eyes.

"Uncle Havitz."

Abella approached with a smile.

"Abella!"

As if returning to that day 14 years ago, Havitz grabbed Abella's hands.

"You came. Do you know how worried I was? I wonder what happened to the flower garden? The shop..."

"I'm sorry, Uncle."

When Abella interrupted Havitz's words, all the maids in the Grand Hall flinched.

'She's insane. To interrupt His Majesty's words.'

Among the maids who directly served the Emperor in the Grand Hall, something called the 'Havitz Manual' circulated.

'She's going to die.'

There could be no standard for dealing with chaos.

Therefore, it was merely a coincidence created by probability's trick that 'if you perform a rain ritual, it will rain'...

'Rule 283: When Havitz is excitedly talking, show no reaction whatsoever.'

For the maids, such jinxes were their only lifeline.

"Hm? What are you sorry for?"

That's why they could only be shocked at Havitz asking back instead.

'The jinx is broken?'

Abella smiled bitterly.

"I did open a flower shop, but the flowers you bought me aren't there. I raised them wrong and they died."

"So that's why you couldn't come."

"No. I didn't want to meet you. I was too young back then. I just lived thinking it was just that kind of connection."

"I see..."

Havitz seemed a little disappointed.

"But you still opened a flower shop. I can buy you as many flowers as you want, so don't be too upset."

Shock swept through the head maid's eyes.

'His Majesty is saying considerate words to another person.'

Even she, who had spent her entire life in the imperial palace, was seeing such a situation for the first time.

'Perhaps... we've been thinking wrong about the person called Havitz.'

Interrupting his words hadn't mattered from the beginning.

'He's killed countless maids, but maybe the reason was completely different from what we expected?'

Since the head maid couldn't get her bearings, the confusion of the other maids was beyond words.

'Why isn't he getting angry? Why isn't he killing her?'

Countless jinxes like 'don't make eye contact' and 'don't use negative words' were being broken.

'How pathetic.'

Balkan squinted one eye as he read the maids' discipline.

'They do things worthy of death and then fear arises because they don't know why they're dying. His Majesty is also human. He enjoys playing with friends and knows what love is.'

Havitz was also human.

'He's just someone who wants to have fun. Well, since they only think about using others, they judge according to their own tastes.'

Chaos isn't befriended with the head.

'Empathy. Don't calculate, just honestly reveal your emotions as they are. That's all there is to how His Majesty treats people.' Of course, adults would find it impossible.

'But Abella can do it.'

Because she was a friend who had empathized with Havitz, that chaos, in the deepest part of emotions.

"Anyway, you came, so that's good. You kept your promise."

Havitz, who had cast aside all trivial reasons, sat down where the map was spread and tapped the floor.

"Come here. We're going to conquer the world from now on, so play with us too. My friends are fun too."

While it was touching that the Empire's Emperor treated her without formality, Abella's eyes were filled with sadness.

"You really haven't changed at all."

"I've gotten a lot older, haven't I? You've grown taller and prettier. If you don't like world conquest, shall we play something else?"

Tears glistened in Abella's eyes.

"Uncle, you're a bad person."

Everyone's hearts sank, and even Balkan couldn't guarantee Abella's future this time.

'Empathy and hostility are clearly different. Will His Majesty not get angry this time as well?'

Havitz blinked.

"People say that, that Uncle is bad. But honestly, I don't really know. To me, even this current appearance..."

Abella said tearfully.

"You're just like the mustached uncle from before, so I like you so much."

"Hahaha! Right, as long as you like it, that's all that matters, isn't it?"

As relief settled into Havitz's laughter, Balkan's eyebrows twitched.

'Oh? This is...'

Abella felt helpless.

'If only you were scary, if only I could hate and despise you freely like others...'

The ultimate evil trying to plunge the world into hell.

'But to me...'

He was the kindest and warmest uncle in the world, who would grant anything she wanted.

'It's not like I'm the one dying, right?'

In Havitz's embrace, Abella could be happy for life, but she had to kill him for humanity's sake.

'That is Alphafish.'

Pulling herself together, she wiped her tears and said.

"I can't play house with Uncle like before. I'm an adult now."

"Really? Then what should we do?"

"Adult games."

Abella walked toward Havitz, who was sitting on the floor.

"Uncle, will you marry me?"

The 4 Knights' gazes shifted to Havitz, and sounds of gulping escaped from all the maids' throats at once.

'She's insane. Marrying that psycho?'

Havitz immediately nodded.

"Good."

Balkan was foreseeing emotions that had sprouted in Havitz's chaos for the first time in 14 years.

'We met as friends, but... the empathy with Abella seems to have been a little different.'

'The witch's fate. Perhaps it's natural law to be united with the person who freed her from that curse.'

Those who reach some ultimate truth must be strong, and therefore Havitz could also be called strong.

'So you've been very lonely.' It would be fair to say he was bored.

Anyway, those who could share empathy with Havitz could be counted on one hand throughout the world.

'In one way, they're a match made in heaven.'

Abella puffed her cheeks.

"What? Even so, to accept so easily. Do you know what marriage is?"

"Of course I know. I like you too."

Havitz stood up and grabbed Abella's shoulders, speaking seriously.

"I want to marry you."

Thus, the childhood friends who had met at the seaside as children promised to become husband and wife after 14 years.

The heat wave that had dominated summer gradually receded, and autumn with colored leaves arrived.

The war was still fierce, but within the Gustav Empire, preparations for the Emperor's wedding were in full swing.

"Long live His Imperial Majesty! Long long live!"

Flower gardens that Abella loved were laid out on every street, and nationwide celebratory procession events were held.

About 20 days before the wedding, while the imperial palace Marsac was being decorated with flowers, Crouch made his move.

In his hand as he moved freely through the complex ceiling passages like his own home was the Law Kill.

'Target change.'

Minerva said.

"The reason Alphafish is important is because she's the person who can get closest to Havitz. But she can't enter while carrying Law Kill."

If it were another object, it could be hidden inside the body, but she couldn't carry a sword around for several months.

"That's why we need a carrier." El Crouch.

"Before sending Alphafish, an expert will establish position inside the imperial palace first. And on Havitz and Abella's wedding night, they'll hand over Law Kill."

Sirone asked.

"The carrier can't approach Havitz. Contact would be impossible, so how do you hand it over?"

"We use target change." Minerva took out Law Kill.

"The dagger absorbs the wielder's killing intent to twist the law. But what if the target is changed midway?"

Sirone was also curious.

"For example, if Law Kill is activated to kill you, Sirone, but then stabs Uorin?"

"What happens?"

"The killing intent contained in the dagger doesn't change. However, the wielder's killing intent is reset. Of course, this alone doesn't have much meaning. But if the dagger is destroyed, the story changes."

"You said annihilation was impossible."

"Right. Even if destroyed, Law Kill appears again in a completely random location."

Iruki said.

"But if you reset it, you can artificially manipulate where Law Kill appears."

"Exactly. Law Kill destroyed in a reset state appears to the person who best matches the killing intent contained in the dagger. Therefore, we can deliver Law Kill to Alphafish through the law."

This was 'target change.'

'Execution time is 20 days later, on the wedding night. Until then, Law Kill must be reset.'

Currently, Law Kill's killing intent was directed at Havitz, but there was no particular change in the law.

'That shows how difficult an enemy he is.' It meant he couldn't be killed by any method.

But to Crouch, it felt as if Law Kill was waiting for the right moment.

'My target to kill is Catenia.'

Having already killed the maid Orphera and lived her life, Crouch planned another transformation.

'Becoming Catenia would be best. That way, I can get even closer to Havitz.'

Since Abella became engaged to Havitz, Catenia had become her maid and was living a prosperous life.

'Here.'

Arriving at Abella's room, Crouch landed in the corridor through the ceiling ventilation shaft.

Only torches hung on the walls provided light.

'Alphafish probably doesn't know. Well, it might be better not to tell her.'

The law was so sensitive and delicate that even a small change could be irreversible.

"A cat burglar has snuck in this far?"

Crouch had no heart, but pretended to shrug his shoulders at superhuman speed.

'Damn, when did she...'

Turning around, he saw Natasha, one of the Gustav 4 Knights and a battle doll, standing with her head tilted.

"Oh my, Lady Natasha. Hello."

Anyway, since Crouch was the maid Orphera, he politely bowed and greeted her.

"You're really amazing."

Orphera looked puzzled and asked back.

"Yes? What do you mean..."

"Wow, that's incredible! I don't feel any awkward energy at all! That's really amazing acting."

He was none other than the shadow of Teraze, Emperor of Kashan, but he didn't even entertain such thoughts.

'How did she know?' As if reading Crouch's thoughts, Natasha said with a pitying expression.

"You got caught by Balkan's discipline. He hires assassins once a month to try to kill His Majesty."

It meant that to compensate for the weakness of crowd reading that couldn't distinguish individuals, they risked assassination once a month.

'When assassins are added, my killing intent also becomes crowd reading.'

Since this was also expected, Crouch didn't panic and revealed his true nature.

"So you came to kill me?"

His appearance, attitude, and voice were all the same, but Natasha felt like she was looking at a completely different person.

"Really fascinating. I just got goosebumps. Anyway, that's right. But he told me to find out who sent the assassin. And to determine whether the assassination target is His Majesty or Abella."

'Her honest personality makes things convenient.'

She rambled on with unnecessary details, but on the other hand, he felt ignored.

"I'll tell you."

Crouch drew Law Kill from inside his maid uniform.

"After I cut your throat."

"Hehehe! That's good too."

As expected, Natasha wasn't tense, but for an assassin who used situations to his advantage, it was an opportunity.

'Interesting. So Natasha...'

Anyway, target change could be done with anyone, but if he could disguise himself as Natasha, the assassination success rate would increase dramatically.

'If that works, breaking one doll wouldn't be a waste.'

Since everyone has only one life, Crouch, who had two lives, could perfectly strike his opponent's blind spot.

"Shall we begin then?"

As Natasha bent her knock-knees and lowered her center of gravity, both arms slowly rose above her shoulders.

"Dance of Death."
