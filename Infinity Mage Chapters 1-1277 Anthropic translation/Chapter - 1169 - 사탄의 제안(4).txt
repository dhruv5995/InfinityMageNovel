Satan's Proposal (4)

After leaving the plaza, Fermi and Seriel entered a tavern near the market.

Opening the door, Fermi asked.

"Will you be alright?"

"What, you think I can't handle alcohol? Hurry up and get inside. I'm hungry."

It was early for dinner, but having skipped lunch, her hunger was severe.

"Let's just grab a quick bite."

Seriel, taking her seat, placed an order.

After about an hour, the faces of both people drinking on empty stomachs had turned slightly red.

Though they weren't particularly close friends, being in the same graduating class kept the conversation flowing.

"It's always tough."

Seriel, gazing at the evening street through the window, propped her chin on the table as she spoke.

"The really hard thing is that once you adapt to the routine of the graduating class curriculum, you don't even know what's difficult anymore. You need to find weaknesses to grow, but progress doesn't come easily."

"You're steadily improving. One day when you look back, you'll see you've grown. Trust the words of the longest-serving student in the graduating class."

Seriel smiled, encouraged by the veteran's words, but her mood soon cooled.

'Graduation exam broker.'

What reason could there be for someone with the skill to graduate at any time to still remain at school?

'Should I ask?'

Fermi smiled with her eyes.

"You look like you have something to say. Go ahead with whatever it is."

Honestly, it wasn't a bad time, and talking about the graduating class was enjoyable too.

"Ah!"

Conflicted about breaking the mood, Seriel downed the drink in front of her in one gulp.

After about 3 hours had passed, Seriel's eyes began to lose focus.

"Hey, Fermi. You can't do that. Don't live like that, you bastard."

Though it was already the fourth time hearing this, Fermi listened with a gentle smile.

"You know, honestly, you're an amazing guy. But... I know that! But you can't live like that. Do you know how hard other friends work to become mages..."

"How can you take money and sell graduation certificates?"

"That's right, you bastard. Money... huh?"

As Seriel, half-sobered, opened her eyes wide, Fermi lit a cigarette.

"I've taken graduation exams for many years. I've made many people pass and caused even more to fail."

A long stream of smoke was exhaled.

"Who did I take money from? No. I've never received requests or taken money."

"Then why...?"

"Because that's my belief. Controlling the system. For someone else, winning through fighting might be everything, but I can't do that. Just as you all compete to confirm your own abilities, I'm just fighting in my own way."

Was it a lie?

'Not a broker? Maybe he wants me to side with him at school? No...'

Fermi was certainly someone she couldn't trust, but what she felt during this half day was—

'This guy doesn't lie.' He'd rather stay silent.

"Cigarettes. I haven't seen you smoke at school."

"I don't particularly like them. I just don't want to apply the concept of taboos to my life. If necessary, I'll do anything, and if unnecessary, I won't do anything."

That was his way of controlling the system.

'What kind of life has he lived?'

The more she learned about Fermi, the more confusing it became, which only fueled her curiosity further.

"Fine, I'll believe you. But having done this much, you've proven your ability. Why do you remain at school?"

Fermi recalled.

'Mother.'

The image of Yolga, who would still be wandering as a specter of a particular incident inIstas's upper levels.

"Well. Why would that be?"

Seriel was suddenly afraid.

Fermi's expression was infinitely transparent, but it seemed like tears might burst forth at any moment.

"You..."

She could think of nothing but wanting to embrace him.

"Let's go. It's late."

After settling the bill, the two found themselves thrust onto streets where darkness had deeply settled.

Should they part ways like this?

In a situation ambiguous in time, mood, and everything else, Fermi asked.

"Perhaps...?"

Seriel nodded slightly.

"Yes."

Seriel opened her eyes in an unnamed inn room at past 4 AM.

Outside was quiet, and beside her, the sound of Fermi's sleeping breath could be heard softly.

'Ah...?'

Just a few hours ago, the events of yesterday flashed by like a panorama.

'Have I gone crazy, really?'

It wasn't as bad a feeling as expected.

No, honestly speaking, it was quite good, but the sober world wasn't all about emotions.

A competitor in the graduating class, the leader of what could be considered an enemy faction by factional standards—she had spent a day with him.

Seriel carefully turned her body and slithered down from the bed like a snake to gather her clothes.

'Careful, careful.'

While dressing on her knees and checking her bag's contents, no sound was heard.

She slowly opened the door and stepped out, then gently closed it as if not allowing even one decibel.

Then, checking the situation inside and running down the corridor as if fleeing, she left the inn.

'This is a lifelong secret. I can't even tell Amy.'

Just one minute after Seriel left the room, Fermi lifted his eyelids.

As if already awake, he stared into the darkness, then covered his eyes with his arm.

"Whew."

In Delta's corridor, Seriel thought.

In that year's graduation exam, Amy was eliminated early after being ganged up on by the Golden Ring.

'I passed.'

Of course, unlike Amy who was the top graduation candidate, Seriel wasn't a target for the Golden Ring's interference.

But connected to that day's events, it remained an unsolvable homework assignment for Seriel.

'Why did Fermi eliminate Amy? Simply for tactical reasons? Or was it for me...'

It was the reason she couldn't readily speak up even when facing him with that vulnerable expression.

"Fermi, is something wrong by any chance..."

"Sorry."

Fermi cut her off and turned away.

"I have urgent business. I'll deliver the Angel manufacturing method soon. It won't take long."

Watching his retreating figure, Seriel felt relieved, but at the same time, her heart ached.

'What is this?'

That expression just now—having heard from Shirone what it meant, she now knew.

'Has he lost another precious person?'

At 8 AM, the Holy War opened.

Leaders and officials from various countries attended, but the atmosphere was different from yesterday.

Countries that had been hit showed anger, while those that had avoided attack sent wary glances.

Albino stroked his beard.

'The atmosphere is murderous. We should assume they already know. Today's Holy War will be difficult.'

The leaders of the Moon Kingdom, Tormia, Jincheon, Corona, Paras, and Gustaf could not attend.

Shirone thought.

'Even the Moon Kingdom's Moon Dragon was hit. In the end, among the countries that were attacked, is the Tribal Alliance the only one without damage?'

One thing bothered him.

'It doesn't make sense that Kitra was hit. He's an Oparts. Even if hit by Sal, there should be no shock.'

Was information being strategically concealed?

While Uorin had the same thought, Corona's think tank Ivory Tower spoke up.

"Ivory Tower 2-star resident, Byeolya Tsuoi."

True to her nickname of Black Mars, her voice resonated thunderously throughout the hall.

"Last night there was an assassination attempt on the Corona Kingdom. According to our investigation, at least 4 or more countries suffered the same attack, and the likely suspect is..."

Tsuoi's gaze shifted sideways.

"The Moon Kingdom."

The Moon Kingdom's prime minister shot up.

"This is slander! Frankly speaking! We too suffered damage from this incident..."

"That's enough."

Tsuoi raised her hand to stop him.

Whoever the culprit was, if Moon Dragon who held voting rights had withdrawn, there was no need to pay attention.

"The full story can be gradually revealed. What Corona wants to ask about is the method used to attack other countries. According to investigation, it was something called Sal, impossible without help from the other world."

The Moon Kingdom's prime minister quietly sat down.

"Not simply using ghosts, but the mastermind who amplified the ghosts' emotions. That is, Satan is involved. And as we know, Satan is..."

Tsuoi's gaze turned to the opposite side.

"In the Kashan Empire, isn't he?"

As everyone's attention focused, Uorin smiled and stood up.

"First, I express condolences to the countries that suffered great ordeals. The Kashan Empire did its best to prevent this situation, and clearly states that it still has no intention of breaking any peace treaties."

Even lies sounded plausible when spoken confidently.

"Then what about Satan?"

"While it's true that Kashan and Moon made a Code One agreement, what Moon wanted wasn't me but Satan. Let me be clear—Kashan is completely unrelated to this incident."

Albino smirked.

'Cutting off the tail.'

Then the Holy War's doors opened and Havitz entered.

"I'll tell you."

The presence of Satan freed from his shackles was tremendous enough that half the officials jumped to their feet.

"What are you doing! Quickly call the guards!"

Havitz raised his hand.

"Now, now."

Vanishing activated, and only after 30 seconds did the officials recognize him on the platform.

'Damn it!'

Terrified by the fear that their own necks might have been severed, the officials shot at Uorin.

"Kashan! Didn't you promise! If you can't control Havitz... I mean... Havitz! Huh? That's..."

As he repeatedly turned Vanishing on and off, the officials seemed to have holes punched in their thoughts.

"Listen."

It became quiet in an instant.

"The Moon Kingdom broke the rules first. Until then, I never harmed anyone who participated in the Holy War."

According to confirmed facts, this was true.

"The Moon Kingdom tried to send Sal to all 11 countries. What Uorin chose in Code One was merely to halve the target countries in exchange for handing me over. To minimize damage to other countries and, above all, to protect Kashan."

International law recognizes defensive attack postures when a nation's security is threatened.

"Therefore, Kashan is also a victim country. I too wanted to actively follow the Holy War's rules. But the Moon Kingdom threatened, and they stripped away my control."

And so...

'Uorin wants me to relay this.'

Havitz was listening to her thoughts in real-time and reciting them as directed.

"This is the full account of the situation as I know it. And now I too have regained my freedom."

The Moon Kingdom's prime minister gritted his teeth.

'So this was really what they were after. Making the Moon Kingdom a war criminal nation gives them justification to utilize Havitz. They know we can't refute it.'

Even if the case went to international tribunal, the Moon Kingdom's chances of winning were slim.

Uorin's lips curved up.

'Because sending Sal is a fact. I added a little seasoning, but that much should be acceptable.'

This was the power of the true culprit.

"That's enough now."

While the officials were confused, Havitz, having cut off Uorin's voice, spoke.

"Anyway, it's become a mess, right? Killing each other, dying, and even if you live, you won't live much longer."

"So I'm going to make a proposal. Of course, it'll be a very good proposal for you all too."

"What on earth are you talking about? By what right do you try to move the 12 countries?"

Even without hearing the details, fear came first.

"You don't have to follow it. But you'll have no choice. This isn't a right—it's power."

For the first time in perhaps eons, Satan's eyes held Yahweh.

"Kill Shirone. Until Yahweh dies, I will kill one person every hour at random. Everyone here in the Holy War, including all of you, is a target."
