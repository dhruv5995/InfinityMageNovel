At the Edge of the Cliff (1)

The laser that passed through Ataraxia pierced the atmosphere and transmitted information to a point 6,000 kilometers above ground.

The power generated when a mass exceeding 10 tons crashes to the ground is enough to completely devastate a city.

Even Shirone, the developer of this magic, had only cast it once before—and that was in Heaven—making it an extremely dangerous spell.

'What is he trying to do?'

Watching Shirone fire the laser upward, Minerva tilted her head in confusion.

The impact force generated when God's Punishment falls would not be something a human could withstand.

'Then it's the same thing in the end, isn't it?'

Shirone focused all his nerves on the sky.

'What cannot be controlled is not magic.'

It would just be another disaster.

Despite its unprecedented destructive power, this was why Shirone had never used it until now.

'But now it's different.'

A single spear tilted toward the ground, guided by information gathered from space. The difference from before was that a triangular seeker device was attached to the middle of the spear.

Three laser beams shot out from the seeker.

"That's it!"

Flying above the clouds on Jet, Minerva confirmed the laser piercing through the atmosphere.

'Laser guidance system.'

Looking down, she saw a red dot marking the top of Argentis, which was completely immobilized by Ting's Law.

'The mental drain must be enormous.'

Firing it up was just a trigger, so that wasn't a problem.

But to attach a seeker to God's Punishment, the Spirit Zone had to operate 6,000 kilometers above ground.

Literally a final strike with everything on the line.

'But this makes precision strikes possible. If it hits properly, damage can be minimized.'

Now the remaining problem was time.

By her calculations, it would take at least 10 minutes for God's Punishment to reach the ground.

If Argentis broke free within that time, precision strikes would be impossible and the capital would be destroyed.

'Can Ting manage it?'

Ting had said roughly 5 minutes.

But she too was one of the Five Great Stars—if she abandoned all dignity and fought desperately, she could buy a few more minutes.

'Still, it's cutting it close.'

Minerva turned Jet's nose and dove straight down.

'Shirone is completely defenseless.'

When she reached the ground, Shirone was staring up at the sky with his eyes rolled back.

Each time he precisely controlled the seeker's laser, his half-visible pupils shook left and right.

The world's smallest strategic weapon.

A bitter smile crossed Minerva's lips.

'...At least he's a good kid.'

In the end, he was still human.

Until he successfully completed the magic, no stimulus should reach him.

"Capture Yahweh!"

Corps Commander Amon had become a disaster, but the division commanders and other demons were still going strong.

Whether they knew about God's Punishment or not, rushing toward their most hated enemy Yahweh was only natural.

"Come."

Demon beasts averaging over 4 meters in height blocked his view like a wall as they pressed forward.

"You bastards."

Minerva's eyes widened, and her body transformed into that of a young naked girl.

Her white skin was marked with all kinds of wounds, bruises, and rope marks vivid enough to show scraped flesh.

"Kraaaang!"

Just as the demons raised their claws, the girl's phantom disappeared and she released a witch's pheromones.

"Kuu..."

As the demon beasts stiffened, recalling their pre-demon fears, fire erupted from Jet.

Propelled by the thrust, Jet swung in a full arc, and the demon beasts' faces all snapped in the same direction.

"Did you enjoy playing with me?"

Minerva deeply inhaled her pipe and blew smoke forward.

Disaster Magic: Walking Dead.

The demons who lost their reason began tearing at each other, reversing the flow of attack outward.

"Kyahahaha! Die! Die!"

Her true nature was revealed as she brought Jet crashing down, smashing the demons' heads.

Freed, running across rooftops, clicked his tongue.

"She's always been a fighter."

At least now he understood Shirone's method.

"This feels wrong."

Raising his head, Freed looked up at Argentis, grotesquely twisting its body while bound by the Law.

"A mere tree..."

Just as he created blue lightning in his right hand and kicked off the roof to leap up—

"Please save us!"

Screams came from below the building.

A family surrounded by demons was hugging each other and crying.

'Hmph, mere humans.'

If they die, they die.

'Everyone's life is hard. Do you know how much shit I went through to get this far? No? Then just die.'

He heard a demon's voice.

"Kahahaha! The woman is mine!"

"Mommy! Mommy!"

He heard the daughter's voice too.

"Honey! Aaaaah! You bastards!"

Listening to the gradually fading sounds, Freed flew toward the sky.

Many thoughts crossed his mind.

"Damn it."

Freed's face turned into a grimace.

"This is really driving me crazy!"

Just before a spear pierced the chest of the husband protecting his wife, sword strikes faster than sound erupted.

"Huh? What?"

The demons whose throats were instantly cut collapsed, and the family looked up in surprise.

Freed stood there with an irritated expression.

"...This is why I didn't want to come down."

Because humans—no, they weren't just humans anymore.

"Kahahaha! There's still an apostle of justice? But you'll regret this!"

At the brigade commander's order, countless demons pointed their spears at Freed.

"Please save us! Please, our family..."

Freed looked bitterly at their daughter.

"Apostle of justice, my ass. Life and death are everyone's own responsibility. You think I'm doing this to save someone?"

Coldly rejecting the man, he stepped toward the demons and spat out:

"Still, don't touch families. How would you feel if I grabbed your daughter and beat her up?"

"Huh? Daughter?"

When the brigade commander looked around, his subordinates shook their heads and shrugged.

"We don't have anything like that."

But Freed did.

A son who insisted that swords were the best for men, arguing with his mage father every day.

"That's why you don't understand, you bastards."

Freed gripped his sword handle tightly.

"Just how far humans can go."

"Kill him."

As the demons leaped forward, Freed swung his sword, creating a fierce wind.

Like something originally whole being thrown into the air in pieces, demons were split apart wherever the flash passed.

"Pathetic creatures."

After quickly resolving the situation, Freed shook the blood off his sword as the family bowed their heads.

"Thank you! Thank you so much!"

He couldn't leave these people behind.

But then what about the lives of other families dying at this very moment?

'It's truly difficult. That's why I dislike you, Shirone.'

Why do you live so complicatedly?

'But...'

The emotion that flashed through his mind when Shirone looked straight at him and declared his beliefs was—

'I wished my son would grow up like you.'

He would have been proud.

"Ah, shit."

Wiping his eyes, he looked at Argentis again.

Still caught by the Law, but more active than before.

"...He's struggling like hell over there too."

Ting exhaled deeply, then gritted her teeth again and glared at Argentis.

'That thing is an illusion!'

Not real.

'Only I am real. The thinking me. The existing me. All laws other than me are...'

Her bracelet, the Law Artifact 'True Existence,' vibrated and crushed the demon's will.

"Kneel before me!"

Kraaaaaoooooo!

As Argentis screamed and writhed in frustration, blood vessels rose on Ting's face.

'I can't let it go yet!'

The 5 minutes she had promised Shirone had already passed.

"Ting."

Amanta's voice was heard.

As the World Wheel, now 20 meters in diameter, spun rapidly, the surrounding humans began disappearing one by one.

Without turning her head, Ting asked:

"How many did you save?"

"At least as many as the death count. I don't know how spacious Teraforce's shelter is, though."

It would be enough.

"What's Shirone's situation? At this rate, even my Law will be twisted."

"He's casting the magic that destroyed Arabot. It takes quite a while. He's also groggy from the laser guidance."

"So that's what it was?"

Ting's face became serious.

"I'm releasing the Law in 30 seconds. The shockwave will be tremendous. Start evacuating people near the World Tree."

"What are you planning?"

"We can't make it in time anyway. The point is just to hit the World Tree directly."

Amanta immediately nodded.

"Right."

From the moment the World Wheel moved away, Ting began counting.

And when the count reached 30, she released the Law that had been suppressing Argentis.

Whooooooo!

As if venting all its pent-up frustration, the black branches swayed like seaweed.

The air tore as if whipped, and all the buildings in the area were swept away.

'I don't need to block everything!'

Ting rapidly formed hand seals.

As her hands moved, creating afterimages, thousands of rings formed from Argentis's roots.

'I just need to hold the main body!'

The strongest Demon-Binding Technique: Demon-Slaying Three Thousand Worlds.

Rings endlessly coiling around the trunk finally spread to the thick branches.

It was like grasping a human's arms from both sides.

'Now I can hold on!'

However, the smaller branches that Demon-Slaying Three Thousand Worlds couldn't catch were raining attacks on the ground with fury.

"Damn it!"

Freed blocked the family, cutting down branches.

"Give it a rest!"

Though incomparably smaller than the main body, each stem was enough to pierce through a house.

"Waaah! Mister! Mister!"

Just as Freed cut down dozens of branches, the ground began to shake.

"What now?"

Woooooooooo!

Argentis, unable to absorb nutrients for so long, couldn't support its massive body.

"I want to eat!"

Sounds leaked from tens of thousands of mouths.

"I want to eat! Give me! Food... Kueeeeek!"

Strong acidic vomit poured out from the mouths hanging below the World Tree.

Toxic gas rose the moment it touched the ground.

"Oh, for crying out loud...!"

It was regurgitating.

Like a water bottle with holes, green liquid kept spewing along the trunk.

'If it goes up like this...'

The moment the regurgitating liquid reached the top, acid rain equivalent to a volcanic eruption would fall.

"Aaaaah!"

The family suffered as toxic gas carried by the wind reached them, covering their faces.

"Get inside!"

Just as he blocked the wind and turned his back to the family, roots that had climbed the building twisted together like braids and charged.

"Mister!"

When he looked back, razor-sharp roots were already right in front of him.

KWAAAANG!

The family squeezed their eyes shut at the thunderous sound, then slowly opened them as silence returned.

"Hah, these things really..."

Freed, who had blocked the attack with his sword, frowned and sliced through the roots with a wet sound.

Amanta's voice came from the air.

"The situation has gotten worse."

Glancing up, Freed began dismantling his Five Divine Generals armor piece by piece.

"I'll handle it. Take this family too."

"How?"

"It's spewing diarrhea, so I need to plug its asshole. I'll go up while burning it with lightning."

"Can you do it? It's quite high."

Freed looked back as if to say 'what are you talking about?'

"Don't you see I took off my armor?"

With his perfectly trained body revealed, Amanta spun the World Wheel and said:

"Hurry. Something huge is falling."

"I know that."

Gripping his sword, Freed charged at Argentis at a speed rivaling flight.

"I already switched modes."

The mode called 'When someone I really want to beat up appears.'
