Karma Chain (2)

Is this what it feels like to become a bomb?

As energy that wasn't his own surged exponentially within him, Rian gritted his teeth.

"Graaah!"

Only when hot steam began shooting out between his teeth did he realize he couldn't endure it any longer.

Regardless of the pressure, demonic energy was rising through Gehenna's chains.

"Aaaah!" Rian threw his torso wide open and released the irritating pressure outward.

Grrrrrrrr!

Hot steam swirled in reverse currents around him, spreading across the ground.

"Hah! Hah!"

Though he breathed roughly, he didn't particularly feel exhausted.

Sirone's voice reached him.

"Gehenna."

As Rian slowly raised his head, Sirone was walking toward him from beyond the horizon.

"Sirone, what is this?"

"A fire that never goes out. Also known as hellfire. Actually, it's a phenomenon that can't happen to the living."

Sirone said, looking around.

"Usually, you'd burn in hellfire and become a source of demons. But you endlessly regenerated your body even in reality. That's why you became living hellfire - Gehenna."

"Do I have to carry this around forever?"

"Even though you've fallen to hell, your heart is still bound to reality. Because you're still living. That's called karma, and the chains bound to your heart represent lingering attachments to reality. If you purify that karma, the chains will disappear, but..."

"I'll die."

Sirone nodded.

"Yeah. Complete annihilation. Your body has already disappeared, but your soul will evaporate too."

"I see. But how do you purify it?"

"Hmm, from what I remember..."

Sirone recalled Omega's records.

"The inner world is a realm of emotions, so I don't know exactly either. I've only experienced it indirectly through atomic movements - the records of the living. When Gaffin met Lucifer, a voice came from the sky."

"The sky?"

Rian looked up at the sky filled with flames and shouted loudly.

"Hey! Say something!"

Kuuuuuu!

The sky only spewed angry flames.

As the red light turned on the signal device, the Informer twisted restlessly.

"What do I do! What do I do!"

Basically, every purification subject is assigned at least one Informer.

It was a world overflowing with labor, and most had nothing to do anyway.

"He broke the Karma Chain by himself."

As far as she knew, this was impossible, especially for Gehenna's hellfire.

Beep! Beep!

Every time Rian shouted, the buzzer sounded, but she couldn't muster the courage to respond.

"I need to tell him the purification time..."

Time in the photon world is used as a measure of emotional magnitude in the inner world.

In other words, the greater the pain, the faster time flows, and the weaker the pain, the slower it flows.

"But why?"

Why couldn't it be measured?

The signal rising from the blood in the hemispherical bowl displayed "Unmeasurable."

It was a first in her lifetime, and she didn't even know such a signal could appear.

"Boss!"

Finally ignoring the red light on the signal device, the Informer immediately went to find Lethe.

"What did you say?" Lethe raised one eyebrow.

"Unmeasurable? What are you talking about? No being can receive such a signal."

"I'm telling you that signal really appeared."

At the Informer's aggrieved expression, Lethe buried her elbow on the desk and rubbed her head.

"Gehenna's chains..."

The Infernal Purification Management Corporation receives salaries from hell but is strictly an independent organization.

A group faithful to the original purpose of the inner world, where demon purification was the top priority.

"An unusual guy?"

It was a bland reaction, but there was really no other way to explain it.

"Even Satan can't go against Gehenna. That guy was born from hellfire too. In other words, it's a system malfunction."

"What should we do? I can't honestly guide him that it's unmeasurable. The signal device keeps ringing..."

"Don't make a fuss. It's just a simple error. Karma chains serve to bind purification subjects to hell in some way. It just got disconnected temporarily. It'll reconnect."

"What if he breaks it again? It's dangerous for the living to roam freely. He could even come to the Corporation."

Lethe, with darkened eyes, called toward the door.

"Monorath, come in."

She waited 10 seconds, but not even footsteps could be heard from the corridor.

"Sigh."

She bowed her head deeply, hesitated for a moment, then opened her lips and made an excited sound.

"Ah, ahh..."

Bang! The door opened.

"Boss! What's the matter...!"

Monorath, who entered with wide eyes, saw a completely different scene than expected.

The Informer was looking back, and Lethe sat at her desk with cold eyes.

A long silence passed.

"Hmm."

Monorath smacked his lips, then turned toward the door without saying anything.

"Hey!"

Lethe stood up, hitting her desk.

"I called you! Please do some work! Every time I see you, I age thousands of years!"

Monorath asked indifferently.

"What's the matter?"

She had known since the early days of the inner world's birth that it wasn't worth arguing.

"Go on a business trip. There's a problem with the purification system now, so we need to call an expert. The city of magical engineering, Labiet. Tell the Grand Duke to come here."

As Monorath tried to leave the room without even saying he understood, Lethe spoke quickly.

"Don't take bribes. Got it?"

"Yes."

"Don't accept entertainment either. Don't hit demons, don't bother residents, and don't abuse your power. No, no."

Lethe waved her hands.

"Just do it all. You can do it all, so please just do your job properly. Don't wander off somewhere else. Okay?"

"Don't worry. Who do you think I am?"

Who are you?

Monorath turned at the door, flashed a charming smile, and winked.

"Executive Secretary of the Infernal Corporation, Monorath."

Lethe, who had been staring with her mouth agape, slumped into her chair.

"...I'm really going crazy."

Well past noon, Sirone and Amy arrived in the southern part of the Tormia Kingdom.

The damage from demons wasn't too severe, but the aftermath of emotional disease had spread even here.

With screams echoing from house to house, Amy pointed toward the noble district.

"That building should be it, from what I remember."

It was massive enough to rival the Carmis family mansion.

Sirone confirmed the surname 'Cross' engraved on the nameplate.

"Cayden."

Amy nodded.

"He should be at the main house. I checked the Valkyrie unit roster just in case, but he didn't enlist."

"Does he still like Maya?"

"That's why he's holed up. If he likes her that much, he should at least confess. It's frustrating."

"But Cayden is..."

"Right, he was born with the fate of the Red Cross. The ability to never achieve what he truly wants, but to demonstrate 100 percent potential in everything else. I thought it was nonsense at the time, but..."

Now that he had approached the world's truth, Sirone fully understood Cayden's feelings.

"A fate of reaching the extremes of law in exchange for giving up the heart. That's probably the mechanism of the Red Cross."

"That's why I asked you. Miracle Stream might have some method. If Cayden joins us, it would be a great help to humanity's forces."

Sirone had no disagreement with that.

"Alright, let's go in."

They knocked on the door from outside, but neither guards nor butlers came to greet them.

As one of the kingdom's top families, they should be controlling the emotional disease well, but it seemed they were having difficulties too.

"Who's there?"

Just as they were thinking of climbing over the wall, a man in fencing attire walked from the garden.

It was Cayden's father.

"Hello. I'm Amy. Amy Carmis."

Cayden's father, who had been observing her, instead looked at Sirone with bright eyes.

"Yahweh?"

"Hello. I'd like to meet Cayden."

The door opened, and Cayden's father walked toward the mansion with his hands behind his back.

"I knew someone would come. If my son isn't a complete fool, that is. Come in."

The mansion was desolate and even the air felt cold.

The reason it couldn't be blamed on emotional disease was that a very old chill could be felt.

"It's been a long time since we talked. Fisho, was it? He hasn't come out of the basement since returning from the funeral."

The father knocked on the iron door.

"Cayden, your friends are here."

There was no answer, and he sighed as he climbed the stairs.

"Handle it yourselves from now on. Maybe he's dead. What a pity. The family genius..."

The sense of loss at being unable to do anything until the world's destruction was evident in his voice.

After the father left, Sirone met Amy's eyes and knocked on the door again.

"Cayden, it's me, Sirone. Amy's here too. Can we talk for a moment?"

"Go away."

It was barely audible without pressing an ear to the door, but it was definitely Cayden's voice.

Amy spoke.

"We'll leave soon. We have something to tell you about Maya."

She threw out the bait, but there was no response for the next five minutes.

"Sirone, let's open it."

Amy pointed to the doorknob.

"You can open it, right? Open it."

"Forceful methods don't help with persuasion. If Cayden doesn't want it..."

"He didn't react even when he heard Maya's name. If he's trapped inside himself, it doesn't matter either way. Someone needs to go in and drag him out."

It made sense, so Sirone cast Miracle Stream on the doorknob.

The lock quietly opened and as the door swung open, the sound of pen scratching paper could be heard rapidly.

"No, this isn't it!"

At a dim desk, Cayden was drawing by a single lamp.

"...Good heavens."

Seeing the room completely covered with drawings of Maya, Amy got goosebumps.

"This isn't it either!"

Cayden threw the paper he was drawing on the floor and grabbed a new sheet.

At first it seemed like a failure, but when Sirone entered to check, it was a perfect face of Maya.

'The technique is quite remarkable. How did he draw...'

Sirone stopped thinking as he looked back at Cayden.

"Heh. Heeh."

Could that even be called drawing?

Cayden was merely moving his pen from left to right at tremendous speed.

'Just straight lines.'

But as those lines continued to accumulate into surfaces, a perfect engraved drawing was born.

"No! This isn't it!"

Cayden threw away the paper again and this time gripped a pen in each hand.

Both hands moved simultaneously, creating a symphony of lines that drew yet another Maya.

"Damn it! Why! Why!"

Cayden threw the completed drawing on the floor, grabbed his hair, and shed tears.

"Why can't I draw Maya?"

Sirone watched him with sad eyes.

'Technically, there's no problem at all. No, he's already transcended human limits. But...'

To Cayden's eyes, it wouldn't be Maya.

'Because he loves her.'

No drawing could capture the essence of the woman named Maya.

"Cayden."

Sirone placed his hand on Cayden's shoulder.

"Go to Maya. She's in a dangerous place right now. She might die."

"...I can't."

Cayden spoke with a desperate expression.

"I can't draw Maya. If I can't draw her, I can't protect her either. I won't be able to."

Amy finally realized why Cayden had been frantically drawing.

"Maya is now..."

Though Sirone kept quiet about simultaneous events, this time he shared the information.

"She's in as bad a state as you are."

For the first time, Cayden's gaze turned toward Sirone.
