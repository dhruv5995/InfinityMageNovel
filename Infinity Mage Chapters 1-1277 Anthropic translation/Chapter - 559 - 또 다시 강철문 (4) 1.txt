[559] The Steel Gate Once More (4)

"Shirone...?"

The sound of sniffling spread through the room.

Amy couldn't say a word at the sight of Shirone shedding tears so sorrowfully.

"Amy."

Shirone spoke with a trembling jaw.

"Peope is dead."

It was heart-sinking news for Amy as well.

She remembered the small, adorable fairy who had helped Shirone, Rian, and Tess in heaven.

And the fact that she was dead also meant that Shirone had been to heaven.

"She died because of me. She gave up her lifespan to save me..."

The reason he couldn't tell Miro, Iruki, or Nade was because he couldn't bear even thinking about it.

But Amy knew Peope.

"I went to find Ikael, but she was in my hands..."

As he recalled Peope's horribly withered appearance, his hands began to tremble.

Even now, he could vividly feel her frail weight.

"She said she loved me... but she was so small... I..."

Amy slowly closed her eyes.

'This is why I didn't want to hear it.'

Because she knew Shirone wouldn't just leave behind a suicide note and disappear without any reason.

"I was so angry I used Valhalla Action... but after that, I can't remember..."

"I understand, Shirone. You don't need to dig up painful memories."

Tears dripped from Shirone's bowed face as his sobbing voice leaked out.

"Peope..."

Amy felt a mixture of sadness and anger.

'You idiot, I'm the one who wants to cry.'

As Amy, sitting on the bed, pulled Shirone's shoulder toward her, his face fell and buried into her chest.

Shirone burst into tears.

As his voice pounded against Amy's chest, the locked steel latch began to open little by little.

"Hah, really..."

Patting Shirone's back, Amy looked up at the ceiling.

'Just this once. If you do this again next time, I won't be swayed anymore.'

And so Amy buried Shirone's sorrow in her chest.

The next morning.

Shirone headed to Estas as soon as he woke up.

His eyes were swollen from crying too much the night before, but there was something else more embarrassing.

"Ahh! Why did I do that?"

The moment he heard Amy's firm words, his heart had fluttered, and from then on, he had just felt sorry for himself.

'But thanks to that, we made up.'

He didn't feel bad about it.

Though his heart still broke when he thought of Peope, it was fortunate to have someone nearby to share his grief with.

Sometimes crying, that's how one continues to live.

'I'm getting nervous for no reason.'

Arriving at Estas, Shirone frowned as he recalled the supernatural sensation he had felt yesterday.

Estas.

A multipurpose complex structure consisting of 89 warehouses.

It was a facility that any prestigious school would have, but Estas at Alpheas Magic School was special both historically and functionally.

'Guffin's gate is here.'

While Sein had made the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society the starting point, they hadn't created the gate.

'It's probably related to some incident that happened back then.'

While lost in thought, he arrived at the warehouse where Estas's entrance was installed.

'I should investigate until before lunch.'

Until now, he had activated Shining Epiphany in the research room, but this time he planned to go directly to where the sound had been heard.

"The sound came from the ceiling..."

Calculating coordinates through the master equation, Shirone turned toward the stairs.

'Hmm, so it should be here.'

Though he was scared to try it alone, doing some investigation was the least he could do for the friends helping him.

'Shining Epiphany.'

As the Archangel's avatar surged explosively then was absorbed back into his body, he inevitably heard the phantom voices.

"Captain! We can't hold them off!"

"We're going to die anyway! Target the child!"

Running toward where the sound came from, Shirone stopped with a frown at the scene unfolding before the corner.

"What is this?"

Bodies with shattered limbs were scattered along the stairs, most armed with weapons and armor, with some mages among them.

Shirone carefully examined the corpses, which were in such terrible condition he could barely look at them.

"This is..."

The weapons bore the insignia of the Tormia Kingdom.

'Why are kingdom soldiers here?'

"Surround them! Block the passages!"

At the sound from upstairs, Shirone looked up and quickly climbed the stairs.

As if time and space had changed, the line of corpses ended abruptly at the warehouse boundary.

Confirming his current coordinates by the ceiling markings, Shirone stopped and stared at the back of a woman standing tall in the center of the crossroads.

"Miss Miro?"

Though he didn't know what year this incident had occurred, there was no difficulty recognizing Miro, who hadn't aged nearly 20 years.

Miro, who had been confronting the soldiers controlling the front, slowly turned her head.

"Who are you?"

'She can hear my voice?'

This wasn't just some phantom sound.

He thought he might actually be at the scene of some real incident.

"Really... Miss Miro?"

Miro turned back toward the soldiers.

"You seem to be a student, go back. This isn't a place for you."

Shortly after, she muttered self-deprecatingly.

"Well, it's already the time to be caught."

"What? What do you mean..."

Just as Shirone was about to follow Miro charging toward the soldiers, a group of soldiers poured in from the right corridor.

"What's that guy?"

"Looks like a student! What should we do?"

"A student? How did a student get in here?"

The captain, after pondering, raised his eyes with murderous intent.

"Kill him! There's no way out anyway!"

"Take him down!"

The soldiers' movements suddenly accelerated. They were clearly elite troops, masters of Schema at first glance.

As they charged while using eye techniques, Shirone's body curled up as if caught in lassos thrown from all directions.

"Ugh!"

His first thought was whether those swords would actually cut him.

Given that he had been able to converse with Miro, it didn't seem impossible, but he still couldn't believe this was reality.

'How stupid!'

Regardless of possibility, wasn't this a situation where he absolutely had to dodge?

Overcoming the eye technique with Diamond Buddha's mental strength and casting teleportation, countless spears and swords slashed through where Shirone had been.

"Tch! So he is a magic school student after all?"

"He's just a kid anyway! Finish him quickly!"

Blades flew from all directions toward where the teleportation flash had arrived.

'This is...'

Just as the Tormia standard longsword was about to strike his neck, Shirone's eyes flashed.

'Shining Epiphany!'

Suddenly Shirone's head tilted back as the blade grazed past his throat.

"Wh-what?"

If time were expressed as space, Shirone's range of activity was wider compared to someone perfectly trapped in a mold.

But because it was time, it was bizarre, and even the trained elite soldiers couldn't help but panic.

"It's just magic! Kill him!"

At the captain's shout, the soldiers' bloodlust surged like blades.

"Kuk!"

Cornered, Shirone leaned his back against the wall and glared at the soldiers closing in with their semicircular formation.

The captain, breaking through the encirclement, charged while swinging his sword at lightning speed.

"Let's see you dodge this too!"

The moment he witnessed the sword light slashing in all directions, the smell of death struck his mind through his nostrils.

'I can't dodge it!'

"Die!"

As Shirone gritted his teeth and deactivated Shining Epiphany, the blade that had rushed right up to his eyes suddenly disappeared.

"Haaaah!"

But from the receiving end, he felt as if he had been pierced by the sword, and his breath naturally stopped.

"..."

The corridor was simply quiet.

"Hah! Hah!"

Breathing roughly with wide eyes, Shirone's body slid down along the wall.

'I almost died.'

Honestly, he couldn't be certain, but the feeling was all too clear.

'What did I see?'

In any case, what was certain was that he absolutely shouldn't use avatar techniques here.

Meanwhile, 70 meters away from where Shirone was resting, someone's voices were quietly exchanging words.

"What's wrong with him? Why is he acting like that? He's having a fit all by himself."

"Isn't he crazy?"

"He must be training. He was teleporting and stuff."

Only their voices leaked out quietly while their figures remained invisible.

In the meantime, Shirone, having regained his composure, turned toward the research society.

'I'll wait for lunch time and ask the kids...'

For a fleeting moment, Shirone's eyes lit up.

'...I should.'

The presence of intruders felt through synesthesia as it passed by.

He had been able to detect it thanks to his heightened senses after just fighting, but even so, their skill level wasn't particularly high.

'What kind of guys are they?'

Pretending not to notice and continuing to walk, when there was no sign of the opponents appearing, Shirone changed direction to somewhere other than the research society.

'They keep following me. I'm definitely the target. In that case...'

Shirone's steps stopped in the center of a corridor connecting warehouses in a straight line.

"Come out."

There was no answer.

"I know you're there. If you don't come out, I'll attack."

Counting three seconds in his mind, Shirone suddenly expanded his Spirit Zone to identify the enemies' positions.

But it seemed the enemies were the same, as three transparent cloaks peeled off from the wall like wallpaper and revealed themselves.

"Damn! We're caught! Run!"

Having prepared a powerful Photon Cannon as much as he had been cautious, Shirone made a dumbfounded expression watching the fleeing figures.

They all had familiar faces.

"Aren't those advanced class kids?"

Even while the underclassmen were rapidly leaving the corridor, Shirone regained his composure and canceled his magic.

Instead, he carefully noted the ceiling markings, door colors, and number of intersections while working his brain.

"Let's see, the coordinates here are..."

"Ugh, annoying! Who made the mistake!"

As the girl complained irritably, the two boys running alongside her pointed fingers at each other.

"You must have been caught!"

"No, it was you. My hide-and-seek ability is nothing like yours..."

"Kyaah!"

As the girl screamed as if she had seen a ghost, the two boys stopped abruptly.

"H-how?"

Shirone was already blocking their path.

"How did you catch up so quickly?"

Shirone sighed and approached.

"How did I catch up? You guys barely moved 10 meters by coordinates."

When there was no answer like honey-muted mutes, Shirone asked.

"So, Shuamin, Alt, Gerein. What business do you have here?"

They were Class Five underclassmen who had recently taken integrated advanced class lessons with Shirone.

Particularly Shuamin was the child who had demonstrated the trick of counting coins with Spirit Zone when Shirone had climbed over Alpheas Magic School's fence at age twelve.

She had been a little kid younger than Shirone then, but now she was a girl who shrugged her shoulders slyly.

"What business? Of course we came to find teaching materials on the teacher's errand."

At the innocent lie, Shirone chuckled.

"Really? Then I guess I should ask the teacher."

Alt raised his trembling lips.

"Heh, hehe, are graduating students so free these days? Would you really go to the advanced class to confirm?"

"Yeah, it's fine. I'm a graduation evaluation refuser. I have plenty of time."

Watching the underclassmen's faces turn sour, Shirone approached.

"Tell me honestly. Why did you come here?"

Shuamin's group looked at each other, then as if determined, simultaneously extended their hands toward Shirone.

"Huh?"

"Wind Cutter!"

Suddenly casting attack magic was absurd, but Shirone's body was already responding reflexively.

'Photon Burst.'

As the sphere of light flashed, the wind blades were miserably crushed and mixed into the atmosphere.

Of course, Wind Cutter was a fine magic.

But breaking through Shirone's defensive magic at advanced class level was impossible from the start.
