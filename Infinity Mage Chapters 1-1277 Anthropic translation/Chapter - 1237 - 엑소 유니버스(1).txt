EXO Universe (1)

While waiting for the official event at the Delta annex, the temple operations team entered first.

"We apologize."

The operations manager's face was flushed.

"The event will be delayed by about 10 minutes. The annex has currently been converted to a Level 2 Alert zone and..."

The heads of state who heard up to that point obtained information faster through their direct channels.

From Tormia's side as well, Dante's subordinate approached.

"Association President."

"What is it?"

"Fighting has broken out at the main gate of Delta headquarters. The parties involved are the Southern Warriors and the Anti-Demon Division of the Rami Order."

Rufist questioned back.

"The South and the Rami Order?"

"Yes. The thing is..."

Albino cut him off.

"People from the pyramid side. So they've finally entered the temple? Since when?"

"The fighting began at 9:45. Also, Yahweh and Satan have joined the battlefield."

'Were they there?'

It was certainly the hottest spot in the temple right now, but there was still something unexplained.

"It would be best to evacuate." The informant lowered his voice.

"According to intelligence, something seems strange. The moment people make contact with those who swarmed from the pyramid side, they lose their will as if hypnotized and join the crowd."

Rufist said.

"Human waves. If they're all OOPArts, it means the magnetic field's sphere of influence can move as well."

"Yes. The annex is currently designated as a Level 2 Alert zone with entry and exit prohibited. The temple secretariat has arranged for up to two people, including the heads of state, to leave."

No one moved.

'If the future information is true, the world leadership could be decided right here. Even if not, there's voting tomorrow morning. If a king flees, they lose legitimacy.'

Only the secretaries of each nation were busily moving their mouths, while the annex was eerily quiet.

Rufist asked.

"How dangerous is it? What's the probability that the pyramid crowd will break through headquarters and reach the annex?"

Dante would have analyzed it.

"50 percent. It depends on what judgment Yahweh and Havitz make."

'50 percent.'

The most human and meaningless number.

"No, it's 100 percent."

Albino said.

"Now it's all coming together. Why Fermi provided future information to each nation. What that guy feared wasn't the Iron Kingdom becoming the world leader. He was afraid of a future where Maya might not die."

The informant asked.

"What does that mean? So Kesia also wants Maya to die?"

"No, more precisely..."

Albino looked back at the empty seat of Kesia's king.

"It's what God wants."

Rufist's eyes sparkled.

"Human waves. If the reason they're swarming into the temple is to kill Maya..."

"Right. Sirone won't be able to stop it. And we too will be swept up in the human waves and end up killing Maya. Most of the people here will lose their minds."

"But I don't understand well. Why would Fermi follow God's will? We've never received intelligence that Kesia made contact with the Paras Kingdom."

"Hehe. Hehehe."

Albino laughed like someone with itchy lungs.

"I know what he's trying to do."

The laughter stopped abruptly.

"Fermi doesn't want to change the future. Information entropy must always remain at zero."

"What meaning does that have in this situation?"

"Because he knows the future."

Albino raised his index finger.

"The trap of information updates. Living without knowing the future, versus knowing the future but making no changes. They seem the same at first glance, but the quality of information is completely different."

"Because you can choose."

"Right. That's the power information has. For example, there's a trap on the road. I didn't know about it and fell into the trap. Then again, this time let's assume I know about the trap. But I fall into the trap again anyway."

"The result is the same. But is it really the same? No one would think so. Because in the latter case, it was a choice. Fermi doesn't want to change the future. If I had known about the trap and taken a different path..."

"It would be an unknown world again."

"Right. There might be other traps. No, leaving that aside, choice is taken away. As entropy increases, the range you can control narrows."

Albino twisted his beard.

"The core of this design would be Sirone. Since he's the agent changing the world, information must be blocked from him. This must be the identity of the unease felt from Sirone and Fermi's actions."

Rufist faced forward.

"What could he be waiting for? To preserve a future where the world becomes like this..."

Because it means something far more terrible will happen ahead.

"How bold."

Rufist nodded.

"Yes. But it will be impossible."

"That remains to be seen. A liar who only tells the truth. I wondered what kind of guy he was..."

Looking up at the ceiling, Albino split his lips into a grin.

"Trying to deceive God?"

King Fermi of Kesia didn't go to the annex but sought out Seriel's room.

Seriel was also happy to be together, but she was worried as expected.

"Are you really okay not going? It's an important occasion."

"It would be boring."

Seriel, who had been leaning on Fermi's shoulder, straightened up.

"You're plotting something strange again, aren't you? I can tell from your expression."

At Fermi's subtle gaze, Seriel hesitated.

"What, what is it?"

"Should we... get married?"

"You can say such things even in this situation? You seem smart but sometimes you're strange."

She coldly rejected the proposal, but actually it was because she suddenly felt afraid.

Seriel asked again gently.

"Why are you acting like this? Is something bad going to happen to you? Huh? Is that why you're asking to marry me..."

"Haha, this is why capable people are tiresome. There's no other meaning. It's just a thought that came to me looking at you."

"No. You're absolutely not that kind of person."

Fermi was genuinely hurt.

"Tell me clearly. Then I won't ask about anything else. You're, you're going to be okay, right? Right?"

"How would I know such things? I might bump my toe on the desk corner right now."

"Don't deflect."

"I'm not deflecting, this is a battlefield. Doing this and that, how things will turn out... Ugh!"

Seriel, who had knocked Fermi onto the bed, straddled his waist.

"Ow! That hurts..."

Tears welled up in her eyes.

"Tell me."

After hesitating, he opened his mouth.

"...The apocalypse information doesn't record anything about me specifically going wrong."

"Again! Don't try to deceive me with facts! Say 'I won't go wrong, I'll be by Seriel's side even after this war ends!'"

Since Fermi doesn't lie.

"See! As expected, you..."

"I."

The words continued clearly.

"Won't go wrong. I'll definitely be by your side even after this war ends."

Seriel sniffled and added.

"...Alive."

"Haha, right. Alive."

Only then did she relax and collapse onto Fermi's chest.

"You keep saying unnecessary things. If you say such things one more time, I'll kill you."

Did she hate it that much?

"Sorry."

Fermi looked out the window.

"...It's raining."

"What are you talking about? Why would it suddenly rain—"

The moment Seriel asked back with a puzzled expression, the sound of rain like a monsoon began.

'Mother, knowing the future is difficult.'

Fermi thought.

He wished even this sound of rain he was hearing now was a lie.

The violent noise from Delta's main gate seemed to be buried underground by the suddenly falling rain.

Sirone and Havitz, instantly soaked, didn't take their eyes off each other.

Sirone asked.

"Why didn't you run away?"

According to the law of early creation, Satan could eternally flee from Yahweh.

"What about you?"

Havitz's gaze was also cold.

"Why didn't you kill me?"

If he had only intended to break through Vanishing, Satan would have simply slashed Euntara.

"Shall I guess?"

Havitz said, closing one eye.

"Because it's the only chance given to you once per hour. If I dodge your attack, then it's over."

"You can dodge?"

"Don't spout nonsense. I know why a coward like you is desperately holding on."

Truth and lies—only 2 hours remained until their final confrontation ended.

'I need to prove one fact during that time.'

The proposition Havitz presented was to kill Uorin or kill Sirone by midnight.

'If I kill Sirone here, I'll gain the advantage.'

Of course, the Wizard's proposition was the kind that could be cleared easily depending on one's mindset.

'Love me, or hate me.'

Depending on one's mindset.

'If you love me, there's no need to win. If you hate me, then from that point I can also...'

Do whatever I want.

"A coward?"

As Havitz's temperament changed, purple killing intent began seeping out.

"Shiok."

Twelve fanatics rose from the ground.

"Satan."

"Capture him."

The moment Satan's order fell, the twelve surrounded Sirone.

'And I...'

Vanishing.

As Havitz, freed from the law, aimed at Sirone's back, Shiok whispered.

"Yahweh."

The twelve hidden codes were power that mocked the world.

"Take it."

Whatever you desire.

Ecstasy and yearning, conquest and domination—all wishes a human born could want are yours.

Sirone still had a cold expression.

'It won't work.'

Observing that from behind, Havitz tightened his grip on his sword.

'But I win.'

The reason Vanishing had been broken until now was because Havitz had followed the rules.

'That's no fun.'

Right, Vulcan?

Havitz charged through a tunnel outside Sirone's perception, sword aimed.

Today especially, Yahweh's back looked broader.

'I can do it.'

Above all, God's frequency.

Though he felt tremendous unease, the name Havitz couldn't be heard from anywhere.

'Still, among all humans worldwide, I'm closest. Definitely an annoying bastard.'

Finally, Havitz, who had broken through Shiok, focused his eyes and thrust his sword forward.

'It's over.'

At that moment, tremendous trembling ran up his spine.

"Huh?"

The moment the blade touched Sirone's back, Havitz's elbow bent at exactly the same speed it was advancing.

"Gaaah!"

As if that wasn't enough, he hastily passed by Sirone and rolled around on the ground.

"S-Satan..."

Though Vanishing was released, Sirone just stood there.

'So that's how it is?'

To realize this only at the world's end.

"Are you alright?"

As if he couldn't even hear Shiok's voice, Havitz sat with a blank expression.

'Why couldn't I kill him?'

The feeling he had at that moment was singular.

Run away.

Havitz watched his fingers trembling regardless of his will.

Since he defined nothing, he couldn't even think of the concept of fear, but...

"Why is this happening?"

It definitely wasn't a good feeling.

As he steadily struck the back of his left hand with the sword's hilt, crack, crack, bones broke.

"What, why is this happening? Huh? Huh? Why?"

"Havitz."

Havitz, who had been moving his arm mindlessly like breaking stones, stopped at Sirone's voice.

"You can't kill me."

As Havitz's nostrils stuck together while inhaling sharply, Sirone said.

"That's why you run away."
