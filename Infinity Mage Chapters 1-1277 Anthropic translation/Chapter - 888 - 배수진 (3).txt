Burning Bridges (3)

Valkyrie Headquarters.

As the mining in the Arca Mountains neared completion, Dorothy came to find Iruki with approval documents.

"93 percent of the projected mining yield. I'd say this is more than enough to consider the mission accomplished, wouldn't you?"

Iruki nodded as he signed the papers.

"Good work."

Dorothy's lips jutted out in a pout.

"What? That's all you have to say? 'Good work'?"

"You know my personality."

In Dorothy's mind, Iruki was blunt but never cold-hearted.

"You have a tendency to lie to yourself. Honestly, you wanted to say something else, didn't you? Something like 'I love—'"

"Let's go eat. What do you want?"

Dorothy finally realized.

"You... something's wrong, isn't it?"

No matter how difficult the situation, he never showed it, but today he seemed unusually restless.

When Iruki turned around without a word, Dorothy followed, persistently questioning him.

"What's going on? You can tell me, can't you? Is it because of the war?"

"No. Don't worry about—"

The moment Iruki grabbed the door handle and opened it, a woman's voice could be heard.

"I'm here to see the Supreme Commander!"

When Dorothy peeked her head out, she saw a group arguing at the end of the corridor.

"You! Do you know where you are right now? Do you think a mere battalion commander can just meet with the Valkyrie Supreme Commander whenever they want?"

"You could at least tell him I'm here! That bastard— I mean, the Supreme Commander will definitely agree to see me."

"Amy?"

Dorothy's eyes widened.

"What's going on? Why is Amy here?"

"I called her."

Iruki answered briefly and gestured to Aromi.

"Let her in."

Though Aromi knew Iruki and Amy were friends, she had her duties to uphold.

"But Supreme Commander, this is Valkyrie Headquarters. A low-ranking officer meeting privately with the Supreme Commander without proper procedures violates military protocol."

"Then what proper procedures would be required for a lieutenant colonel to meet with me privately?"

Aromi's eyes sharpened with resolve.

"No such protocol exists."

Understanding what she meant, Iruki nodded and entered the room.

"Let her in."

It was ten minutes before Amy finally knocked and opened the door.

"Amy."

Dorothy greeted her warmly, but seeing Amy's expression, she quietly lowered her hand.

After an uncomfortably long silence, Amy straightened her posture and saluted.

"Loyalty. Lieutenant Colonel Carmis Amy. I request an audience with the Valkyrie Supreme Commander."

Iruki didn't return the salute.

"Cut it out, it's embarrassing."

Then he said to Dorothy.

"Step out for a moment."

Though he judged there would be nothing good to witness, Dorothy couldn't leave for that very reason.

"No. This isn't about military matters anyway, is it? Then I have the right to listen too."

Amy spoke up.

"It doesn't matter. I won't talk long."

Iruki let out a small sigh.

"Fine, what do you want to say?"

"You already know, don't you?"

Amy stepped forward.

"As of noon yesterday, my assignment was changed. To education officer at the Capital Defense Command."

"I know."

Amy's eyebrows twitched.

"Did you order it?"

"Yes."

Her fists clenched tight.

"Why? What's the reason?"

"Rear education is as important as frontline combat. Your unit training capabilities are among the best of the officers—"

"Iruki."

Amy asked again in a low voice.

"What's the reason?"

As the atmosphere grew tense and Dorothy fidgeted nervously, Iruki spoke dismissively.

"You look like you want to hit me."

"I just want to know the truth. Why did you send me to the rear? Because I'm your friend?"

"I'll promise you. If you tell me honestly, I absolutely won't get angry. The reason you pulled me from the death zone—is that really the only reason?"

Iruki's mouth opened slowly.

"Yes."

The moment the words left his lips, Amy punched Iruki in the face.

With a crash, Iruki tumbled to the floor as Dorothy hurriedly supported him.

"Iruki! Are you okay?"

When she turned her head, Amy was approaching with blazing eyes, fist raised.

"I'm not done yet."

Dorothy held out her hand.

"Not the head! Without that, he's just a corpse!"

Thinking this made sense, Amy raised her foot to aim at Iruki's abdomen.

Dorothy stretched out her hand again.

"Not there either! That's mine."

Amy's eyes welled up with tears.

"...What do you know?"

Iruki still had a calm expression.

"How much training I've done to reach this position, how many life-and-death situations I've overcome—do you know?"

"No."

Iruki sat up.

"I don't need to know all that to save you. I made the decision, and I'll take responsibility. A low-ranking officer should stay quietly in the rear."

Dorothy finally understood the situation.

'So that's what happened.'

She understood both the humiliation Amy must have felt and the anguish Iruki must have experienced making such a decision.

Amy lowered her foot.

"I can't accept this. Even knowing it was a waste of time, this is why I came here. Send me back to the front lines. That's what you can do."

"No. I'm the Supreme Commander. If you want to disobey orders, I can send you to the brig instead of the Capital Defense Command."

"...Is that what you want? For me to cowardly survive alone while my subordinates, my comrades, all die?"

"Yes."

"You—!"

Just as Amy was about to curse, Iruki contorted his face and screamed.

"Just live, damn it!"

From their magic school days until now, this was the first time seeing Iruki lose his temper.

Iruki shot to his feet.

"I'm already stressed enough, and you're making me more irritated! Do you know what orders I gave? You want to know the truth so badly? Should I tell you? Everyone who goes there dies! 99 percent mortality rate! Do you understand what that means? If you go there, you will definitely die, you idiot!"

Once his emotions exploded, he couldn't control them.

"So what if you're a coward? I took full responsibility just to save you! Because you have the Supreme Commander as a friend? So what if that's true? Even if it's shameful, endure it! If you just keep your mouth shut, I'll take care of everything!"

"I understand your feelings. But Iruki—"

"Shut up! How do you understand my feelings? Do I look like I have a brain that only fantasizes? Send you when death is clearly calculated? Don't you think about Shirone? If you die, if you die horribly there, do you think I'll be able to look Shirone in the face properly? Just live, damn it!"

Amy discovered another face hidden behind Iruki's furious expression.

'He's not angry.'

Tears streamed down Amy's cheeks.

'That Iruki...'

He seemed terrified.

It was the first time seeing him angry, but also the first time seeing him so afraid...

'It's not a lie then.'

If Iruki says someone will die, they really will die.

"I understand what you mean. And your feelings, your desire to save me—I understand that completely too."

Amy couldn't say with certainty that she wouldn't do the same as Iruki if their positions were reversed.

"But before being Shirone's lover or your friend, I'm a soldier. That's something that belongs only to me, not defined by others. And a soldier... shouldn't do this."

Iruki leaned against the desk and hung his head.

"Didn't you hear me? If you go, you'll die. If you're crazy enough to want to die, then do as you wish."

Amy shook her head.

"I don't want to die. Of course I want to live. I'd like to live happily with Shirone and my friends. But you know, don't you? As much as I want to live..."

She struggled to hold back tears.

"Other people want to live too. But they're still fighting to protect humanity."

Iruki spoke in a hoarse voice.

"...Every time I give an order, at least thousands die. The reports keep coming. Ten thousand died here, a hundred thousand died there. Like hallucinations, endlessly circling."

It wouldn't be a position any sane person could endure.

"It's terrible. What it means for a hundred thousand to die—even when I don't want to imagine it, it appears in my dreams. But no matter what I imagine..."

Iruki clutched his head.

"It doesn't compare to you dying. Every time I think of your face that I know, your expressions that I know, your pain that I know, I feel like I'm going insane."

"Iruki."

Amy approached with a sad smile and gently stroked both his cheeks.

Iruki looked up with tears in his eyes.

"Once you go there, I can't help you in any situation. That terrifies me."

Amy spoke with pitying eyes.

"Iruki..."

My precious friend.

Trapped in the perfectly lonely gray matter of his mind, how much had he thought and worried?

'Because he's colder than anyone.'

The current situation was unbearably frightening to him.

Dorothy wiped away tears.

'Amy, can't you just stay here? Since it's come to this, can't you just live?'

The words rose to her throat, but before Amy's convictions, they were nothing but childish pleading.

Amy spoke firmly.

"Don't worry. No matter what situation comes, I can overcome it. I'm a soldier. There's nothing in the world to fear."

She didn't say she would live.

"Send me back to the battlefield. Just as I'm precious to you, my subordinates are precious to me. I don't want to send them into danger while I alone stay safe. Do you understand?"

"You're really stubborn."

"Haha."

Taking that as her answer, Amy slowly stepped back and saluted.

"I'll return to my unit."

Even though she was going to a death zone, her eyes were more alive than when she first entered, making Iruki sigh.

"...Approved."

Finally showing a satisfied smile, Amy opened the door and waved to the two of them.

"Sorry for barging in suddenly. I'm too busy, so I'll go first. Have a good time."

From now on, she had to hurry to catch up with her unit's rapid march.

"Amy..."

Dorothy tried to say something, but Amy had already closed the door and left.

"She doesn't want to leave room for sentiment."

Iruki walked around the table, sat in his chair, and buried his face in his hands.

"Iruki, are you okay?"

"How could I be okay? Well, you have to acknowledge that she's had a violent personality since school."

The reason Dorothy couldn't approach was because Iruki's shoulders were shaking.

"Damn it..."

He thought he could do anything.

'I'm sorry, Shirone. I couldn't stop her. Even if it meant getting beaten to death, I should have stopped her...'

That had been his initial plan.

No matter what criticism he received, even if it meant never seeing Amy again for the rest of his life, he had intended to see it through.

"I couldn't stop her!"

He couldn't break her convictions too.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Shirone!"

Dorothy gently embraced Iruki's shoulders as he sobbed.

"Move aside! Move!"

Having received authorization from Valkyrie Headquarters, Amy rushed toward the spatial movement magic circle.

Though time was tight, if she hurried to catch up, it wasn't an impossible distance to rejoin them.

'Wait for me, you guys. I'm coming.'

She could picture the faces of her unit members who would welcome her back, and their morale would soar.

Amy's eyes sparkled with vitality.

"I absolutely won't lose."

Even if what awaited her was death, she would never kneel before fear.
