[552] The Power of a Day (1)

As Shirone tried to mentally grasp 10 to the 64th power, words suddenly burst from his mouth.

"Is that a number humans can count?"

"It's not a number. It's a realm."

Miro pointed to her head.

"The sequence formula is just one method for expanding the mind. If you can accurately feel the rush of numbers, there's no need to read through them in your thoughts."

Shirone could understand this since his own sequence formula already far exceeded the speed of ordinary people.

But interpreting Miro's words in reverse, unless you could feel it accurately, you had no choice but to read through it.

'Feeling numbers in the kyung units.'

Thinking about it calmly, it wasn't entirely impossible.

If he ran steadily at a pace that wouldn't shock his mind, he would eventually reach it.

Speed could be considered later.

"There are 73 days left until school starts. The goal is to elevate Avatar to the realm of unity between self and object within that time. What you'll be able to do with it can be thought about then, but it will definitely help with magic too."

Shirone was certain of that much.

It would be difficult, but if successful, the enhancement of mental power would be tremendous.

"Yes, I'll try. What should I start with?"

Above all, the great Miro herself was providing guidance.

The thought that she wouldn't assign an impossible task gradually built his confidence.

"What you need to do from now on to reach the realm of unity between self and object is..."

As Shirone swallowed nervously, Miro opened her mouth.

"Work like crazy."

The response came quite some time later.

"Huh?"

"Huh? Was that just your answer?"

"No, that's not it, I mean what method... I mean, there are only 73 days left..."

Miro chuckled.

"Right. I won't tell you to think there are as many as 73 days left. But Shirone, this isn't something that can be handled by human strength alone. There's no need to think about what can't be changed. If you're given 73 days, you have to solve it within that time."

It was a breathtaking statement.

"I understand your feelings. But that's the wall of reality given to everyone. If you overcome it, you win; if you can't, you lose. You want to find a way to somehow pull it off? There's no such thing in the world. It's always been that way, hasn't it?"

Shirone nodded heavily.

"You can do it. Believe in the power of a day, Shirone. If you accomplish 1 today, after 73 days you'll have built up 73 times that."

That too was a clear reality.

"People in the world like to focus on talent, but in truth, I too reached where I am by building up each day."

That was at least comforting.

"The body is governed by the brain, and the brain is governed by the heart. The heart moves while looking only at results."

Miro pointed to Shirone's chest.

"When you reach unity between self and object, your Avatar will also manifest its singularity and become far stronger than now. Just think about that."

'I'll succeed. I'll definitely make it happen!'

Confirming that Shirone's eyes had changed from before, Miro stood up.

"Good, you seem to understand, so let's move on. Follow me."

The place Shirone arrived at was a stream not far from the cabin.

Miro tapped a flat rock under the shade.

"Come sit here."

Though he did as instructed, Shirone was puzzled, having expected some grand training.

"What do we do here?"

"Don't do anything."

"Huh?"

"You can't do sequence formulas all day. When you want to cool your head, sit here and look at the scenery across the way. No sequence formulas, and no entering Spirit Zone either."

Shirone looked across the stream.

It was an ordinary mountain scene with nothing distinctive except for one curved tree planted prominently in front.

Though it felt nice, anxiety crept in that even his newly ignited resolve might fade away.

"Can't I just practice sequence formulas?"

"No. And you can't rest in other places either. Rest must be at least 4 hours."

The sound of mountain wind brushed past his ears.

Could looking at nature for 4 hours without doing anything be called rest?

'It seems like there's no time for this.'

Spotting his expression of distrust, Miro's lips curved slightly upward.

"You think it's meaningless?"

"Ah, yes. Actually..."

Miro placed her hand on Shirone's shoulder and looked across the stream.

"Shirone, nothing is trivial. We just don't try to look into it."

We just don't try to look into it.

"Even the leaves rolling in the wind, even the pile of trash swept outside the street - they all contain stories equal to the time they've existed. Humans are the same. Just as the years you've lived are enormous to you, everyone in the world is living while creating enormous stories within the same time. But most people don't know this. Because they don't try to look into it."

"...I see."

Miro's words made some sense.

"From now on, you must look into every part of the world. Only thinking as flexible as water can transcend limits. Look at nature here every day. Cool your head while listening to their stories. It probably won't be boring."

'Let's try it. Let's believe in the power of a day.'

Imagining his Avatar transformed after 73 days, Shirone clenched both fists.

At the Karmis main house training ground, explosive sounds erupted without a single day's rest.

The 1,000-pyeong grand training ground was usually only opened when accommodating forces attending clan meetings, but currently only Amy remained there, conducting training close to a death struggle.

'This won't do!'

A 2-kilometer-long Sniper Mode Spirit Zone was rotating like a compass, changing directions.

Unlike the cross formation with the mage at the center, Sniper Mode had the mage standing at the end of a straight line, making the rotation intensity mentally paralyzing.

Targets flying beyond visual range conveyed explosion sounds, but the success rate was only about 60%.

'What kind of sniper is this!'

To hit fast-moving targets, you had to add time coordinates to spatial coordinates.

If the success rate was only 60% even with targets following set patterns like now, sniping living beings with free will from 2 kilometers away would be nearly impossible.

'Maximize my specialty!'

Amy didn't give up.

The key was shortening the rotation speed of Sniper Mode and the time for Fire Strike to reach targets.

'Ildo!'

When she concentrated again at the needle-sharp center of focus, her mental power was enhanced with squared force.

"Heuuuu!"

The 2-kilometer straight line made one large sweep.

The number of targets caught in the process was 32.

Predicting all target patterns and casting Fire Strike in all directions, sixteen explosion sounds rolled in shortly after.

Faced with a 50% accuracy rate, worse than before, Amy withdrew her Spirit Zone and fell to her knees.

"Haa! Haa!"

Though she wanted to think it was due to reaching her mental power limit, fire boiled up inside her.

There was no such thing as being good at everything.

If she couldn't achieve it with Sniper Mode, even after graduation she'd remain just an ordinary mage.

"One failure is the foundation of success. Two failures are the family's shame."

Recalling the family motto as she stood up, Amy's eyes blazed red.

The failure from moments ago was precisely backed up in her red-eye self-image memory.

This was why the Karmis family had no teachers.

69 days.

300 meters underground from the grand mansion in the capital Mercadine, there was a bunker prepared for ancient weapons classified as map weapons and city-destruction-level magic equivalent to them.

In this place storing supplies for over 100 people to survive for 3 years, the person boldly attempting detonation magic was none other than the family head's son, Iruki.

'Now!'

As Iruki, sitting in his room with eyes closed, lifted his eyelids, electricity sparked from his pupils.

Simultaneously, the air in the center of the underground bunker began to stir as if something was about to happen.

"Detonate!"

He shouted while jumping up, but the expected earthquake didn't occur, and Iruki collapsed powerlessly onto his bed.

"It's not easy when you actually try it."

The magic he was currently attempting was a finishing move not yet even named - nuclear fusion detonation magic possible only because he had two Spirit Zones.

"Are you here again today?"

Family head Albino entered through the door, but Iruki didn't even look up, absorbed only in thought.

"Right, how's the plan to blow up the Mercadine mansion where our ancestors' breath lingers going?"

"No results yet. That's why I'm getting irritated."

"..."

After looking at his son for a moment, Albino chuckled.

"Don't overdo Overdrive too much. Your brain's durability can't handle your head's circuit speed. Your lifespan will shorten."

"I don't care. As long as I can make this succeed."

"That's what I'm saying. Looking at you, it seems your lifespan will run out before you succeed. That seems a bit stupid."

Iruki jumped up.

"Why did you come? Aren't you busy?"

Albino grinned.

"No matter how busy I am, I have time to see my son."

"I don't have time to see dad. Get out. I need to reestablish the theory from the beginning."

Waving his hand dismissively, Iruki walked to the blackboard that already showed traces of being erased and rewritten hundreds of times.

Watching him frantically write formulas with chalk, Albino said:

"The human brain is an incredibly well-made organ."

The chalk's movement stopped.

"Huh? What did you say?"

"It's so well-made that the circuits are too excellent - it can't distinguish between direct experience and imagination. Whether you eat rice or imagine eating rice, the brain's electrical patterns come out the same."

Only then did Iruki turn around.

"Interesting phenomenon, right? But this is science. So there's also this saying: If you want to succeed, imagine the moment of success. Then your brain will automatically adjust to match it."

Iruki's eyes blinked rapidly.

"Well... that's just what they say."

As Albino waved and left the room, Iruki turned toward the blackboard.

And began frantically erasing the formulas.

'It's not too late yet. Starting over from today.'

---

65 days.

Numbers raced madly through Shirone's mind.

'No good! Too big!'

The key wasn't reading thoughts but making thought itself race quickly, but even that caused brain convulsion-like sensations once surpassing 100 billion.

"Take it slow. There's still plenty of time."

Miro's words didn't resonate with him.

Several days had already passed, yet he'd only reached 100 billion.

Entering the jo unit beyond jo to reach the kyung unit this way seemed impossible.

"Kugh!"

Around 120 billion, Shirone's mind snapped back.

'I've been counting numbers for 8 hours straight...'

Miro comforted him.

"Still, you went further than yesterday. Let's try again."

"I can't do it today. My head feels like it'll explode..."

"Do it."

At times like this, Miro's voice invariably turned cold.

"You're still far off. A day is 24 hours, and only 15 hours have passed. Minus 4 hours of rest, that's 11 hours."

Though Shirone had been through all kinds of hardships, breaking through his limits in real-time was unbearable pain.

"But... I have something called fatigue too."

"That's not my concern."

Strength entered Shirone's eyes, but Miro remained cold.

"Don't be mistaken, Shirone. This is training for you to become stronger. No one is forcing you to get stronger. If you want to give up, just pack your bags and go home right now."

"I have no intention of going back."

"Then do it. That's reality. Is it unreasonable? Do you think there's no need to live this hard? Shall I tell you the reason?"

Miro opened her mouth with a firm voice.

"Because someone else is doing it."

The venom disappeared from Shirone's eyes.

"What you don't want to endure, someone else is enduring right now. That's competition. I did it, and so did Gaold. Sein, Zulu, Flu - they're all people who endured that pain and climbed up."

Shirone ground his teeth.

"Don't think those above you got something by chance. They were all as painful as you. So don't whine about limits or whatever. If you don't want to do it, just quit."

With his eyes coming back to life, Shirone expelled all the resentment in his stomach.

"Puuuuuu!"

It was deadly difficult, but since he didn't want to give up either, he had no choice but to do it.

'Endure! Just endure a little more!'

And so another day was being built up.
