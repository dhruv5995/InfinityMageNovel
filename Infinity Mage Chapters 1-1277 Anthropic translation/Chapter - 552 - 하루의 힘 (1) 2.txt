[552] The Power of a Day (1)

As Shirone tried to fathom 10 to the 64th power in his mind, words suddenly burst from his mouth.

"Is that even a number humans can count?"

"It's not a number. It's a realm."

Miro pointed to her head.

"Number sequences are just one method for expanding the mind. If you can accurately feel the rush of numbers, there's no need to read through them in your thoughts."

Shirone could understand this since his own number sequences far exceeded the speed of ordinary people.

But interpreting Miro's words in reverse, unless you could feel it accurately, you had no choice but to read through it.

'Feeling numbers in the kyung units.'

Thinking about it quietly, it wasn't entirely impossible.

If he ran calmly at a speed that wouldn't shock his mind, he would eventually reach it.

Speed could be considered later.

"There are 73 days left until school starts. The goal is to elevate your avatar to the realm of unity between self and object within that time. What you'll be able to do with it is something to think about then, but it will definitely help with magic."

Shirone was certain of that much.

It was difficult, but if he succeeded, the enhancement of his mental power would be tremendous.

"Yes, I'll try. What should I start with?"

Above all, the great Miro herself was guiding him.

The thought that she wouldn't assign him something impossible gradually built his confidence.

"What you need to do from now on to reach the realm of unity between self and object is..."

As Shirone gulped nervously, Miro opened her mouth.

"Work like crazy."

The response came quite some time later.

"Huh?"

"Huh? Was that just your answer?"

"No, that's not it. I mean what method... I mean, there are only 73 days left..."

Miro chuckled.

"Right. I won't tell you to think there are 73 whole days left. But Shirone, this isn't something that can be handled by human strength alone. There's no need to think about what can't be changed. If you're given 73 days, you have to solve it within that time."

It was a breathtaking statement.

"I understand your feelings. But that's the wall of reality given to everyone. If you overcome it, you win. If you can't, you lose. Wanting to find some way to manage it somehow - there's no such thing in the world. It's always been that way, hasn't it?"

Shirone nodded heavily.

"You can do it. Believe in the power of a day, Shirone. If you accomplish 1 today, after 73 days you'll have built up 73 times more than that."

That too was a clear reality.

"People like to focus on talent, but the truth is, I too reached where I am by building up each day."

It was at least a comforting statement.

"The body is ruled by the brain, and the brain is ruled by the heart. The heart moves while looking only at results."

Miro pointed to Shirone's chest.

"When you reach unity between self and object, your avatar will also manifest its singularity and become far stronger than now. Just think about that."

'I'll succeed. I'll definitely accomplish it!'

Confirming that Shirone's eyes had changed from before, Miro stood up.

"Good, you seem to understand, so let's move on. Follow me."

The place Shirone arrived at was a stream not far from the cabin.

Miro tapped a flat rock under the shade and said,

"Come sit here."

Though he did as instructed, Shirone was bewildered, having expected some grand training.

"What do we do here?"

"Do nothing."

"Huh?"

"You can't do number sequences all day. When you want to cool your head, sit here and look at the scenery across the way. No number sequences, and no entering the Spirit Zone either."

Shirone looked across the stream.

It was an ordinary mountain scene with no distinguishing features except for a single curved tree planted prominently in front.

He felt good, but anxiety crept in that even his newly ignited resolve might disappear.

"Can't I just practice number sequences?"

"No. And resting in other places is also forbidden. Rest must be at least 4 hours."

The sound of mountain wind brushed past his ears.

Could looking at nature for 4 hours without doing anything be called rest?

'It seems like I don't have time for this.'

Spotting his expression of distrust, Miro's lips curved slightly upward.

"Do you think it's meaningless?"

"Ah, yes. Actually..."

Miro placed her hand on Shirone's shoulder and looked across the stream.

"Shirone, nothing is trivial. We just don't try to look into it."

We just don't try to look into it.

"Even in leaves rolling in the wind, even in piles of trash swept outside the streets, there are stories contained equal to the time they've existed. Humans are the same. Just as the years you've lived are enormous to you, everyone in the world is living while creating enormous stories in the same time. But most people don't know this. Because they don't try to look into it."

"...I see."

He understood Miro's words a little.

"From now on, you must look into every part of the world. Only thinking as flexible as water can transcend limits. Look at nature from this place every day. Cool your head while listening to their stories. It probably won't be boring."

'Let's try it. Let's believe in the power of a day.'

Imagining his avatar transformed after 73 days, Shirone clenched both fists.

In the training ground of the Karmis main house, explosive sounds erupted without a single day's rest.

The 1,000-pyeong grand training ground was a place usually opened only to station troops attending clan meetings, but currently only Amy remained here, engaged in training close to a life-and-death struggle.

'This won't do!'

A 2-kilometer-long Spirit Zone in sniper mode was rotating like a compass, changing direction.

Unlike the cross formation with the mage at the center, sniper mode had the mage standing at the end of a straight line, making the intensity of rotation mind-numbing.

Targets flying around beyond the line of sight conveyed explosive sounds, but it was only about a 60% hit rate at most.

'What kind of sniper is this!'

To hit targets moving at high speed, you had to add time coordinates to spatial coordinates.

If it was only a 60% hit rate even with targets following set patterns like now, sniping living beings with free will from 2 kilometers away would be nearly impossible.

'Maximize my specialty!'

Amy didn't give up.

The key was shortening the rotation speed of sniper mode and the time for Fire Strike to reach targets.

'Unity of Path!'

When she concentrated again on the needle-sharp, refined center of focus, her mental power was enhanced with squared force.

"Huuuuh!"

The 2-kilometer straight line made one large sweep.

The number of targets caught in the process was 32.

Predicting all the targets' patterns and casting Fire Strike in all directions, sixteen explosive sounds rolled in shortly after.

Faced with a 50% accuracy rate, worse than before, Amy dismissed her Spirit Zone and fell to her knees.

"Hah! Hah!"

Though she wanted to think it was because she'd reached the limit of her mental power, fire boiled inside her.

There was no such thing as being good at everything.

If she couldn't accomplish it with sniper mode, even after graduating she'd remain just an ordinary mage.

"One failure is the foundation of success. Two failures are the family's shame."

Recalling the family motto and rising to her feet, Amy's pupils blazed red.

The failure from moments ago was precisely backed up in her red-eyed self-image memory.

This was why the Karmis family had no teachers.

69 days.

300 meters underground from the grand mansion in the capital Mercoda, there was a bunker prepared for ancient weapons classified as map weapons and city-destruction-level magic equivalent to them.

The person boldly attempting explosive magic in this place, which stored supplies for over 100 people to survive for 3 years, was none other than Iruki, the head of house's son.

'Now!'

Iruki, who had been sitting in his room with his eyes closed, lifted his eyelids, and electricity sparked from his pupils.

At the same time, air began to stir in the center of the underground bunker as if something was about to happen.

"Detonate!"

He shouted and jumped up, but the expected earthquake didn't occur, and Iruki slumped powerlessly onto his bed.

"It's not easy when you actually try it."

The magic he was currently attempting was a finishing move that didn't even have a name yet - fusion detonation magic possible only because he had two Spirit Zones.

"Are you here again today?"

Head of house Albino entered through the door, but Iruki didn't even look up, absorbed only in his thoughts.

"Yes, how's your plan to blow up the Mercoda mansion where our ancestors' breath lingers going?"

"No results yet. That's why I'm getting irritated."

"..."

After looking at his son for a moment, Albino chuckled.

"Don't overuse Overdrive too much. Your brain's durability can't handle your head circuits' speed. Your lifespan will shorten."

"I don't care. If I can just succeed at this."

"That's what I'm saying. Looking at you, it seems like your lifespan will run out before you succeed. That seems a bit stupid."

Iruki jumped up.

"Why did you come? Aren't you busy?"

Albino grinned.

"No matter how busy I am, I have time to see my son."

"I don't have time to see Dad. Get out. I need to reestablish the theory from the beginning."

Waving his hand dismissively, Iruki walked to the blackboard that already showed traces of being erased and rewritten hundreds of times.

Watching him frantically write down formulas with chalk, Albino said,

"The human brain is such a well-made organ."

The chalk's movement stopped.

"Huh? What did you say?"

"It's so well-made that the circuits are too excellent, so it can't distinguish between what you've directly experienced and what you've imagined. Whether you eat rice or imagine eating rice, the brain's electrical patterns come out the same."

Only then did Iruki turn around.

"Interesting phenomenon, right? But this is science. So there's also this saying: if you want to succeed, imagine the moment of success. Then your brain will automatically adjust to match it."

Iruki's eyes blinked rapidly.

"Well... that's just what they say."

As Albino waved and left the room, Iruki turned toward the blackboard.

And began frantically erasing the formulas.

'It's not too late yet. Starting over from today.'

---

65 days.

Numbers raced madly through Shirone's mind.

'No good! Too big!'

The key wasn't reading thoughts but making thought itself race quickly, but even that caused brain spasms once he surpassed 100 billion.

"Take it slow. There's still plenty of time."

Miro's words didn't resonate in his heart.

Several days had already passed and it was only 100 billion.

Entering the kyung units beyond jo at this rate was impossible.

"Grr!"

Around 120 billion, Shirone's mind snapped back.

'I've been counting numbers for 8 hours straight...'

Miro comforted him.

"Still, you went much further than yesterday. Let's try again."

"I can't do it today. My head feels like it's going to explode..."

"Do it."

At times like this, Miro's voice invariably turned cold.

"You're still far off. A day is 24 hours, and only 15 hours have passed. Subtract 4 hours of rest and it's 11 hours."

Though Shirone had been through all kinds of hardships, breaking through his limits in real time was unbearable pain.

"But... I have something called fatigue too."

"That's not my concern."

Strength entered Shirone's eyes, but Miro remained cold.

"Don't be mistaken, Shirone. This is training you're doing to become strong. No one is forcing you to become strong. If you want to give up, just pack your things and go home right now."

"I have no intention of going back."

"Then do it. That's reality. Is it unreasonable? Do you think there's no need to live this hard? Shall I tell you the reason?"

Miro opened her mouth with a resolute voice.

"Because someone is doing it."

The venom disappeared from Shirone's eyes.

"What you don't want to endure, someone is enduring right now. That's competition. I did it, and so did Gaold. Seine, Zulu, Flu - they're all people who endured that pain and climbed up."

Shirone ground his teeth.

"Don't think that those above you got something by chance. They were all as painful as you are. So don't whine about limits or whatever. If you don't want to do it, just quit."

His eyes coming back to life, Shirone expelled all the resentment in his stomach through his mouth.

"Puuuuuh!"

It was deadly difficult, but since he didn't want to give up either, he had no choice but to do it.

'Endure! Just endure a little more!'

And so another day was being built up.
