The Final 5 Hours (3)

The guard captain collapsed into his chair with a thud.

"...Not bad."

Then he burst into laughter.

"Haha! Really not bad at all. To think you'd persuade me. Fine, I'll release this Curtis fellow."

His attitude immediately changed to one of goodwill.

"Thank you. And one more thing. We want to go to Melkidu's core. Do you know how?"

"Hmm, only His Majesty the King can issue core access passes. This works out well actually. I was going to introduce you to him anyway."

So that was the process.

"It would be an honor. When would it be possible?"

"The procedures are a bit complex. But I'll pull some strings. You should receive word tomorrow morning."

'Tomorrow morning...'

Though time in Melkidu differed from reality, there wasn't much time left in reality either.

Iruki said, "It's probably a data processing phase. If this itself is an event, it can't be changed arbitrarily."

Sirone nodded and asked again, "What about Curtis?"

"That's easy. Just need to approve the paperwork. Wait outside the prison and I'll have him sent out."

Having received this promise, Sirone's group left through the guard barracks.

"Finally escaped the middle layer."

The gorgeous and beautiful scenery of Parme, Melkidu's capital, came into their view.

"This is the play zone, right? Maybe it's because we've only been using back doors, but this feels more awkward now?"

Just as they were agreeing with Nade's words, the iron gate opened and Curtis appeared.

Pena shouted, "Curtis!"

He was limping, and judging by how beaten up he looked, his face was covered in bruises.

"Are you okay? What happened to you?"

Ignoring Pena as he passed by, he asked Sirone with a tense expression, "Did you find a way?"

"Yes. We're scheduled to meet the king tomorrow. This is probably the final gateway to the core."

"...I see."

Curtis's expression relaxed, but it felt more like relief than joy.

"Let's go for now. You need to rest."

"Yes. Please, let's go. I don't want to stay here another second."

While moving into the city, Pena asked, "Come on, tell me quickly. I'm dying of curiosity. What do you do in prison? Do they feed you? What was it like?"

"If you're that curious, go see for yourself."

Pena was horrified.

"Are you crazy? Me go there? What? Don't tell me you... really lost your virginity or something?"

"Just my virginity?" Curtis said no more, and Pena didn't want to know any more either.

Sirone consoled him, "You've been through a lot."

"Forget it. I was prepared for it anyway, and it's meaningless. As long as we can get to the core..."

Even Sirone's group became solemn before his obsession with catching his daughter's killer.

"Now you tell me. You're meeting the king tomorrow? What happened while I was gone?"

Sirone recounted everything that had happened.

"I see. You must have had quite a hard time too. But if that's the case... how many points are left?"

"Almost none. We used up our points persuading the guard captain, so we have about 1 million left. But considering we might need to persuade the king too, it's basically nothing."

"Hmm, I see."

As Curtis was stroking his chin and pondering solutions, Pena cleared her throat and said, "Um... I'll pay."

"Huh?"

Pena looked away as she spoke, "Well, Curtis just got out of prison, so he should eat well and rest properly for at least a day. I'll cover room and board, so don't worry and go wherever you want."

Curtis laughed.

"Getting a meal from the miser Pena? The biggest incident in Melkidu just happened."

"What? I spend when I need to spend. And I've received a lot of help too... Anyway! Just know that!"

"Well, fine. We'll let Pena provide room and board for now. But even so, the problem is that Sirone's team has no points. Only Sirone can guarantee 100% persuasion success. We don't know what kind of challenge the king might propose either."

Even the guard captain had been quite difficult.

"So I have an idea."

"Yes?"

The group paid attention to Curtis's proposal.

"Come here! Miguel's luxury shop. We have all the latest items that came out just a week ago!"

"The cheapest place in Parme! We sell 10% below average market price! Urgent sales welcome!"

On the west side of the plaza with a clear view of the royal castle, countless crowds were bustling about.

"Wow, are those all merchants?"

Curtis said, "Parme has the highest floating population in Melkidu. Because point trading is possible here. People also stay long to recoup their investment in royal capital entry items."

"So that's how the market becomes so active."

"Right. You guys have some items, don't you? If you sell those, you can get the points needed for persuasion. But since there's no time, sell everything as urgent sales. I know you care about efficiency, but with merchandise like ours, we're VIPs. If transactions drag on, flies start swarming. You wouldn't want that either."

The group understood.

"There are no charity workers among merchants. It's safer to entrust things to big players at least. Let's go to that guy."

It was a well-dressed man in his 30s.

"Welcome. This is Osman's luxury shop. If you see anything you want in the catalog..."

"No, we're not buying. We want to sell something."

Osman immediately nodded.

"Of course, you're welcome. No one pays higher market rates than us. Shall we go to the office?"

"No, let's do it here. Most of them are card items anyway."

Though the port had expensive weapons too, they didn't have the capacity to carry such things.

"Yes. Then please show me the items. Would this person be handling it? I'll initiate the trade."

Osman pulled out a card.

"Activate. Shop."

As the card glowed, a system message appeared.

Trading between Sirone's team and Osman's team begins. You can exchange points for 1 hour. The effect automatically disappears when both parties approve the transaction.

'An anti-fraud system. And... this person has accomplices too.'

There would be some in the office, and several positioned around here right now.

"If you open a shop with an item, do you keep using points every time you trade?"

"Yes. You have to make that concession to do business. It's not particularly expensive, but it adds up."

Of course, it would be included in the commission.

"The problem is people who come to trade without points or items. Half are joking around and half are interference from competing businesses. That's why there's a 1-hour restriction. If the person who used the item doesn't approve the trade, that person can't trade for 1 hour."

"Ah."

"You can rest assured. As long as the shop is active, merchandise is protected by the system."

After confirming Curtis nodded, Sirone handed over the items.

"Yes. We'd like to sell these."

"Hmm, let me see..."

As Osman calmly flipped through the cards one by one, his eyes began to waver more and more.

"Ho."

After stroking his chin and falling into thought, he handed the cards back and said, "I've seen Curtis and Pena a few times, but this is my first time meeting Sirone. Did you collect all these cards without ever stopping by Parme?"

Through system messages, merchants remembered users' names.

"Yes, somehow."

Osman realized.

'A back door user.'

Of course, there were only rumors without substance, but occasionally there were customers who felt different.

"I understand. Then let me quote a price. Including the highest-grade cards, thirty-seven cards total..."

Osman looked up.

"120 million points. How about it?"

It was a larger sum than expected.

'So originally they're worth even more. Well, I haven't been to the high-end shops on the inner tracks.'

Osman continued, "You didn't come here to haggle, right? Knowing that, I've quoted the highest possible price. Some of these cards are crafted items. That means we'll handle the aftermath too."

"How?"

The conversation continued while avoiding the core issue.

"I don't know that either. When problems arise, there are specialists who handle them separately. We commission them."

'A gang.'

"However, what I can promise is that no one but me will know the source of these items. That alone should spare you considerable trouble."

Though they'd enter the core tomorrow anyway, thinking about being harassed all day was giving him a headache.

"Yes, let's do that."

"Thank you. Shall we begin then?"

Sirone's team has received 120 million points.

Sirone also handed over the card.

"Thirty-seven cards total. Confirmed. Activate, approve transaction. Just say the same thing I did."

"Activate, approve transaction."

Transaction completed.

The shop card disappeared.

"Thank you. I'll come again if I get the chance."

Osman handed over a card and said, "It's a discount coupon for a premium restaurant. Using this item will reduce charges by 20%."

"Haha! Yes."

Pena, who received the discount coupon, was overcome with emotion.

"And..."

Osman advised, "As I said earlier, you won't have the concerns I mentioned, but it will be quite bothersome in other ways. Leave Parme as quickly as possible."

"We will."

Having been through all sorts of experiences, Sirone didn't need to hear the detailed inside story.

After leaving the merchant district, Sirone's group headed toward a restaurant, clutching their empty stomachs.

"What restaurant is the discount for? Do they have steak?"

A group of people blocked their path.

"If you wanted meat, you should have said so. We could buy you plenty."

Curtis's expression soured.

"Crooked merchants."

"Those people are merchants?"

Their faces looked vicious, and above all, the weapons they carried were all top-grade.

"Parme allows point trading between users. That's why scum like them run wild."

"Haha! Exactly. Choose. Will you fight us and get your ass kicked, or hand over your points?"

Attacks between users worked by deducting points until one person reached 0.

"It's better to give it to us to use rather than waste it in the air, right? If you hand it over quietly, we'll only take half."

Sirone said, "What makes you so confident? If our points are higher, you're the ones who'll get your asses kicked."

"Hehe, really? Then go ahead and try."

Sirone intuited, 'Point tycoons.'

They stockpiled enough points to beat anyone and extorted through threats.

"Oh, isn't that Pena? Did you latch onto these weaklings this time? Then you must have some points."

Pena shouted, "Stop talking nonsense! What do you take me for?"

"What do I take you for? That's your specialty, isn't it? Clinging to people with money and hiding like a maggot when it gets dangerous."

As Pena's face flushed, Sirone stepped forward.

"Don't talk carelessly."

"Ooooh."

The crooked merchants made exaggerated expressions.

"Wow, how cool. So what are you going to do? If you traded with Osman, you must have at least 50 million, right? Let's end it at that amount. Or get completely cleaned out and go to prison."

'These bastards are annoying.'

Even though he wanted to fight back, the moment attack judgment kicked in, his points would drop to 0.

"Sirone, let me handle this."

"What are you going to do?"

Nade, who had been walking toward the crooked merchants, turned around and winked while lowering his collar.

"Leave it to me."

A guard officer's badge was hidden there.
