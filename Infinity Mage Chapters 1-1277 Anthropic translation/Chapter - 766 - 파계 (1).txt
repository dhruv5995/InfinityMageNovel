[766] Apostasy (1)

"Execute Yahweh!"

He realized that the 8 million demons in the capital city of Pasia were merely the tip of the iceberg.

Truly hell.

In the blazing inferno, an endless procession of demons stretched beyond sight.

"What about Working Dead?"

Minerva knew what Sirone was thinking.

"Whether you can annihilate all the demons?"

Since the psychic realm was merely a passage between reality and the other world, if an infection started here, it would spread throughout all of hell.

"Didn't you say before not to use forbidden magic?"

"That's because I didn't know what it was. If the opponent is demons..."

"If I could do it, I would have done it already."

When no answer came, Minerva honestly confessed.

"Actually, I already tried it."

"How did it go?"

Minerva shook her head.

"The legion commanders aren't fools either. They quarantined the entire area in 2 minutes and 32 seconds after infection spread."

"Is it an ability?"

"Yeah. It's probably Paimon, the 9th Legion Commander. He holds the position of strategist in hell's army. Unless it's an all-out war, he's not a demon we can meet right away, but..."

Minerva turned toward an area where animal bones were piled high like mountains.

"The army of several million infected in Pasia doesn't even meet Paimon's criteria for activating quarantine. Rather, the capital itself became a good isolation zone."

Hell's army numbered 2 billion and was endlessly produced.

"With your current strength, you could probably handle two legion commanders, but you should be careful of those in the top 10 rankings. Their demonic concentration is different."

Sirone took note.

"We're almost there."

Below the blazing clouds of flame, dozens of structures jutted up high like spears.

It was Marduk's castle, which had lost its master.

"Is this your first time sealing a legion commander's domain?"

The only way to seal an altar was to destroy all demons in that region.

"Yes."

Since the other world itself was made of demonic energy, the key was to block the tributaries of demonic energy called "fire plates."

"We're still searching for where the source is."

Currently, armies from various countries and the Valkyries of the Holy War were risking their lives exploring the other world.

"Anyway, hell fire starting from the source of the fire plates spreads like blood vessels throughout the other world, supplying demonic energy."

After passing through mountain ranges made of animal bones, Marduk's castle finally came clearly into view.

"My goodness..."

Even Sirone, who had sealed several altars, couldn't close his mouth at the scene that unfolded.

A lava river over 10 kilometers wide flowed in winding curves, burning so blindingly red it hurt the eyes.

"This is the upper stream of hell fire."

Just as civilization in the real world was based on water, rivers of fire flowed in the other world.

"Save me! Please, someone save me!"

Thousands of humans were flailing their arms, melted into the lava.

"They're the dead."

"More precisely, the spirits of the dead condensed into demonic energy. For ordinary humans, the fear of death is too powerful."

"The human heart is hell."

Zulu's insight was correct.

Eventually, the dead who couldn't overcome the pain of hell fire would be reborn as demons according to Satan's will.

'Mr. Gaold.'

He had not succumbed to the pain.

'That's why even now...'

Not knowing that Gaold had regained consciousness, Sirone prayed that he would return as soon as possible.

"Let's go down."

As Jet descended rapidly to the ground, Sirone also folded his light wings and followed.

The sound of burning lava was deafening, and at the edge of his vision, residents of the other world were positioned in a circle.

Minerva paid no attention and pointed at the lava.

"How about it? Can you annihilate it?"

The hell fire river, viewed from up close, was so massive it was indistinguishable from an ocean.

"I can't guarantee it. Hell fire is much more persistent than demons. I had trouble eliminating even one stream."

Minerva nodded.

"It's the essence of demonic energy. With this scale, we should consider that the emotions of about 500 million humans from the real world are flowing through it. The problem is that as long as hell fire flows, demons can also withstand Yahweh's light."

This was why sealing a legion commander's domain was much more difficult than other altars' psychic realms.

"There's one way."

Minerva pointed at Marduk's castle.

"There's a 'fire plate' in the legion commander's castle. It controls the concentration of hell fire to create powerful demons. We need to take control of the device that controls the flow of hell fire."

Once the conclusion was reached, action was swift, and the two immediately flew toward Marduk's castle.

The residents who had lost their legion commander couldn't approach Sirone, but hell's army stationed at the castle burned with fighting spirit.

"It's Yahweh! We must stop them!"

They were none other than those who had come to cut their lifeline.

Countless armies led by division commanders gathered at the entrance.

"Open it."

Though Yahweh's light couldn't serve as medicine in the place where demonic energy was strongest, Sirone immediately took the lead.

'Angel's Punishment.'

The incarnation of the Archangel rose magnificently, grasping a spear of light while looking down at the earth.

"This is my entirety."

Fullness.

As quantum information unified through resonance, 100,000 Sirones were no longer needed.

"Repent."

And finally, the moment the spear of light stretched long as a flash and struck down to earth.

"...!"

Light exploded first, followed by shockwaves that turned hell's army to ash.

"Wh-what?"

Demons watching from afar were horrified by the massive dust cloud rolling in on the wind.

"Kraaaah!"

As the roar overtook the wind and shook heaven and earth, the terrified demons all turned around.

"R-run away!"

Just as they thought they could never set foot here again, the dust cloud engulfed them.

Covering her face with her hands, Minerva frowned against the flesh-cutting strong wind.

"Whoooosh!"

Shortly after, the wind direction reversed.

The spot where the shockwave hit became a vacuum, drawing in the surrounding atmosphere.

"Let's see..."

What Minerva saw as she checked ahead was a crater that could only be formed by a meteorite impact.

"Undoubtedly the realm of apostasy."

With a human body, he had finally reached it.

'What will happen now?'

Apart from the thrilling exhilaration, Minerva's face showed serious emotion.

"Heeeeeek!"

Acet Meirei, the person corresponding to the hearing of the Great Purifier, rolled her eyes back in a private room of the Tormia Magic Association.

"What's wrong?"

A mage guarding her room like an iron fortress on Rufist's orders roughly opened the door.

"Huh?"

Meirei blinked and turned around.

"No, I just heard some sound..."

"Sound? Nothing happened though?"

The mage looked around the room, and it was indeed a neat scene far from any disturbance.

'A physiological phenomenon?'

It might be embarrassing if she were a woman.

"I understand. Call me if you need anything."

"Yes. Thank you for your concern."

The mage failed to detect that human emotion had disappeared from Meirei's calm eyes.

"Then..."

As the door closed, her face, which had retained some humanity, transformed into the perfect face of a doll.

"Your Honor."

With one ear covered, Meirei answered, and the Chief Justice of Terraforce delivered an oracle.

A power transcending the biological realm had been detected just moments ago.

"I see. Who is it?"

Humanity's representative, Hexa.

"..."

She understood why the Chief Justice was hesitating.

"What is the assembly's judgment?"

The reason Terraforce is called an evil god in human scriptures is because they actually destroyed numerous civilizations.

But they are not invaders.

Rather, they were beings who protected the order of the universe, which is why Taesung once proposed this hypothesis.

User protection system.

This could also be inferred through the absolute three principles recorded in Terraforce's great legal code.

One, we promote humanity's advancement and directly intervene in human history when necessary.

One, we destroy civilizations when evil achieves complete victory in the battle between good and evil.

One, we actively prevent any sentient being from invading higher systems.

Terraforce's reason for existence seemed not for their species but to maintain the balance of the universe.

Moreover, the standard for that balance focused on existence itself, beyond human happiness and unhappiness.

'So that balance isn't broken by any single variable, so that no cheating occurs in the fierce life of beings.'

Judges of law.

Having come to understand Terraforce through numerous oracles, Meirei calmly waited for the next words.

Hexa's apostasy violates the last clause of the absolute three principles, but some judges focus on the second clause.

The absolute three principles have no priority order, which is why they aren't numbered and all hold the position of number one.

Ultimately, if evil wins, we destroy. Now that the opposition between good and evil has reached its end, there's room for clemency if Hexa represents humanity.

"That makes sense. If evil triumphs, everything ends, but Hexa's apostasy is just active prevention."

You're better than the assembly.

It was obviously a joke, and through these words, she could guess what opinion Terraforce's Chief Justice held.

'But that means the opposition isn't insignificant.'

Terraforce could collect all sounds in the universe, and Meirei's heart was no exception.

Right. The day of judgment might be moved up. Of course, the final decision is mine to make.

"What should I do?"

Go to Zion. To stand against the confrontation of evil, your ears will be needed. If there's even the slightest chance for good to reverse the situation, the assembly might think differently.

"Understood."

Realizing the communication hadn't ended yet, Meirei hurriedly asked.

"I'm curious about something. If Terraforce guided humanity, who created the absolute three principles that guide Terraforce?"

A natural curiosity arising from being human.

As you suspect.

The communication ended.

"Ankera..."

And now it was her turn.

Meirei, who had been fiercely staring ahead, suddenly stood up and opened the door.

"Please let me meet the Association President!"

Sirone and Minerva, having occupied Marduk's castle, found the "fire plate" on the 8th basement floor.

Inside a furnace hundreds of meters in diameter, lava blazed while the dead struggled.

"How horrible."

If Yahweh's light hadn't blocked the heat, his body would have burned while standing.

"As horrible as it is, powerful demons would be born. They probably draw hell fire from there."

Lava flowed endlessly from dozens of drainage channels installed on the walls.

"If we block the fire streams from upstream, the demons in Marduk's domain won't be able to use their power. They'll probably be reassigned to other legion commanders' domains."

"What if they come back and reopen the furnace?"

"We have to prevent that. North Aymond is already in anarchy, so let's give orders to South Aymond's commander. The Holy War could send a separate garrison."

"Nothing's ever easy."

"That's life. Now you know why stars are busy? No matter how many times you circle a planet, there's no end."

Sirone approached the fire plate's control device.

"It's quite old-fashioned."

"You know, right? Demons live by recycling things humans have discarded."

"..."

Just as he was about to pull the switch interlocked with hundreds of gears, a sound came from the fire plate.

"S-save me..."

One demon climbed up to the floor, breaking through the furnace flames.

"Please save me. It's too painful."

While the demon in horrible condition crawled across the floor, Sirone didn't remove his hand from the switch.

"Ah, Yahweh..."

The demon suddenly sprang up, baring its teeth.

"What makes you so great!"

The demon hit by the photon cannon flew in a straight line and splashed into the middle of the furnace.

"Don't act pure! You're just like us! I hate you! Arrogant Yahweh...!"

The demon melted into essence.

"..."

Sirone's hand slowly pulled the switch as he watched the scene with sad eyes.

Clank. Clank. Clank.

The sound of turning gears was mournful.
