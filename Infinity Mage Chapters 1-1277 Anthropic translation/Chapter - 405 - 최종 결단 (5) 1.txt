[405] Final Decision (5)

"Get out of the way. You're still hopeless with machines."

Sein pushed Gaold's chest aside and examined the control panel directly.

For Shirone, seeing the former president of the Magic Association being pushed around by someone was an extremely unfamiliar sight.

But Shirone's eyes soon became distant with nostalgia.

'Ah, I see.'

Nade and Iruki.

If Shirone were to find himself in the same situation as Miro, would those two look like this decades later?

Gaold, Miro, and Sein—the founding members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society who had been caught up in the center of the world's most terrible incident.

Even though 20 years had passed and their paths had completely diverged, their time remained frozen.

Gaold raised his middle finger behind Sein's head.

It seemed that even world-renowned archmages couldn't help but become childish when meeting old classmates.

Unable to let go of his attachment, he kept glancing at the control panel over Sein's shoulder.

But to him, machines were nothing more than mysterious objects that worked when you attached metal pieces randomly and chanted spells.

Then, as if a fun thought had occurred to him, he smiled wickedly.

"Hehe, you know what? Using mental magic on a national intelligence agent is punishable by death. If you want to live long, you'd better desperately hope for my reinstatement."

Sein said while rapidly operating the control panel.

"What do I care about Red Line laws, you idiot. Since he's under mental domination, he won't remember what happened here. You seem quite anxious—should I just bury you alive instead?"

Ethella frowned.

As a bishop of the Karsis Order, it was natural that she couldn't tolerate Black Line mages who made the world turbid.

But she took no action. Because she trusted Alpheas.

Even if it was due to the earnest request of a cherished disciple, he wasn't someone who would ask for a mission that went against the Karsis Order's beliefs.

'He must have some intention.'

When she heard about heaven, the first thought that came to her mind was that she shouldn't judge anything.

This wasn't a light matter that could be evaluated by personal beliefs.

The only thing driving her was a sense of mission to witness with her own eyes the full story of the massive flow that must have begun 20 years ago, or perhaps much earlier.

Sein entered Estas's master mode.

As green letters flashed on the panel, he quickly input information by combining several symbols.

Shiina, who had been waiting patiently, couldn't suppress her curiosity and asked.

"But does the upper level of Estas really exist? I understand that even the National Intelligence Service agents returned without finding anything."

"The upper level exists. It's just that there's no way to enter it. It was designed that way from the beginning. I made it so that even I, who analyzed all of Estas's patterns, couldn't access it."

Shirone looked around at the warehouses spread in all directions.

With all the warehouses already individually dismantled, he wondered if there could really be a room that was inaccessible.

"How is that possible? Right now we can actually enter all the warehouses. That's why you created Estas's master key too."

Sein observed Shirone carefully for the first time since arriving here.

He had known since Gaold's special introduction that he belonged to the project, but no matter how he looked at him, he seemed like nothing more than a soft rookie.

"How do you know about the master key?"

"I'm a member of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society. One of my friends is a Servant, and he said that no matter who touched Estas's master equation, they couldn't make it more beautiful than this."

Sein didn't smile. But his explanation became more detailed.

"That's probably true. It's an equation that equates a complex 4-dimensional schema to 3 dimensions."

Mathematically eliminating one dimension could be compared to the difficulty of making an ant understand human language. That's why anyone with just the master equation could find the research society.

A map that takes the form of 3 dimensions but actually leads to 4-dimensional coordinates.

"So the upper level isn't limited to space."

Sein nodded.

Shirone's insight was quite good, but if he couldn't accomplish even this much, he wouldn't be qualified to participate in Gaold's project in the first place.

"Right. When viewed in 3 dimensions, Estas is just a warehouse made up of 89 buildings. But the upper level exists in a higher dimension. That's why the agents couldn't find it."

"So in addition to a specific space, a specific time must also align?"

"Exactly. Using a 333 cube as an example, when you move the cube at coordinates 1.1.1 to coordinates 3.1.3, what changes is time in addition to space. No matter how fast you turn it, it takes 0.1 seconds. This is called spacetime. I got the idea from this and found a way to make it impossible for anyone to approach Miro. By hiding Miro's spacetime at the cube's origin point."

Before they knew it, everyone was listening intently to Sein's words.

Even Alpheas, who had once been Sein's teacher, was now in the position of a student after 20 years.

"No matter how you turn the cube—that is, no matter how you change Estas's pattern—the cube's origin point in spacetime never moves, and therefore the upper level can be perfectly concealed. The Estas master equation you're currently using was created to calculate this."

Shirone's throat gulped audibly.

He hadn't expected such a serious reason behind the master equation, which he had thought was just a prank by the underground research society.

Shiina said.

"But didn't we gather today to go to the upper level? If no one can enter, what are we waiting for here?"

"Another master key."

As if those words were a keyword, a crackling sound of electricity erupted in the clearing. It was the distinctive noise of flicker magic that had become familiar to Shirone.

What appeared through the scale mage's specialty technique was a pair of man and woman.

The woman was small and petite with permed short hair and a cute impression, while the man was tall with blonde hair flowing down to his waist.

The important thing was that both of them were acquainted with Shirone. Probably.

If the same person couldn't exist twice in the world, then the blonde man with bandages over his eyes couldn't be anyone else.

The Eternal Contemplator, Armin of Bright Insight, was walking toward them.

"Oh, brother?"

Shiina couldn't believe what she was seeing.

Why was Armin, who should be wandering the world capturing landscapes on canvas, at the center of humanity's worst crisis?

"Is it really you, brother Armin?"

Shiina approached, but Armin coldly turned away from her and continued walking.

His wife Caira also didn't even glance at her as she headed toward Estas.

Shiina stopped in place, looking shocked. Her mind was tangled and no thoughts came to her.

"You arrived at the exact time. Though I suppose that was rude to say to the world's greatest time mage?"

The world's greatest time mage.

Since he was a mage who had conquered the speed of light, Shirone didn't find that title awkward at all. But for Shiina, who knew nothing, her bewilderment only deepened.

"A time mage? What on earth are you talking about, brother?"

Armin remained silent to the end.

Judging that confusion before the great undertaking wasn't good, Sein introduced Armin. It was ironic for Shiina, who thought she knew Armin best.

"To reach Estas's upper level, we absolutely need the help of a powerful time mage. There's no one more suitable than Armin of Bright Insight."

Shiina shook her head.

The more she heard the explanation, the more confused she became.

"Caira, what on earth is going on! Are you playing some kind of joke?"

Caira, who always smiled brightly and occasionally made annoying remarks, wasn't smiling this time.

She looked down coldly, almost unrecognizably, and spoke in an authoritative voice.

"Watch your words, Shiina Olifer. We are White Line affiliated mages from the Ivory Tower's Human Safety Executive Department—Armin and Caira."

"White Line..."

Even Shirone, who knew Armin's identity, couldn't help but be surprised this time.

If the Red Line had associations and the Black Line had factions, the White Line was a perfectly independent organization that led only to the Ivory Tower.

Magic that isn't misused in the world.

Purity that isn't swayed by rulers' beliefs.

The mages of the Ivory Tower, whose motto consisted of these two principles, pursued only the pure extremes of magic.

Their military power, known to match that of a nation's archmage even among general staff, was not something a mere kingdom could covet.

They were the absolute monarchs of the magical world, before whom even royalty trembled when presented with Ivory Tower credentials.

And Armin was here as an Ivory Tower affiliate.

Moreover, as a mage of the Human Safety Executive Department.

While Ivory Tower mages didn't discriminate between departments, from the Red Line's perspective, they were most wary of the Human Safety Executive Department, which had the most connection to society.

In fact, 32 years ago when Igor, the dictator of the Con Kingdom, reached for necromancy, it was famous how a Human Safety Executive Department mage entered alone and brought him to his knees, making him crawl on the ground.

Caira approached Gaold and thrust her face close to his.

She had no choice but to come because Armin was being stubborn, but since they were already involved, shouldn't they secure some benefits?

Armin was someone far removed from practical gains.

"I brought Armin, so you keep your promise too. First, the Ivory Tower has recording and dissemination rights regarding information obtained from Miro's spacetime. Second, prohibit Shiina Olifer from going to heaven. You know Armin came here because of the second clause, right?"

"Of course. But let's be clear about one thing—only if Shiina is convinced. I really hate persuading people. Especially women."

"Well, that's fine. Armin knows that too. But you'll have to tell Armin later that I definitely impressed the second point upon you."

"Hehehe, you really live a difficult life too."

Caira frowned as if asking what was the point of saying anything.

Stubborn Armin.

In fact, the Ivory Tower still hadn't made any definitive judgment about heaven. They still viewed it as a problem that human society could sufficiently resolve.

But Armin had fallen for Gaold's scheme.

To open Estas's upper level, a supreme time mage was needed, and Gaold, who wanted to reclaim Miro, couldn't be unaware of his existence.

The result of investigating Armin's activities was the same reason the Ivory Tower could hold onto Armin.

Shiina Olifer.

A woman precious enough for Armin to exchange his life for.

That's why Caira disliked Shiina even more.

'Tch, does he like that woman so much? A woman with no charm who can't even be found cute.'

When Sein released the mental domination, the ten agents collapsed to the ground like puppets with cut strings. This was to eliminate any variables in their thinking before the great undertaking.

"Let's finish before the agents regain consciousness. We're going in now."

Sein pressed a button on the control panel as he spoke.

The 89 warehouses began to interlock in a specific formation.

At this moment, even Shirone set aside his thoughts about Armin and looked at Estas.

A White Line Ivory Tower time mage, a Red Line first-class archmage, and the Black Line's greatest mental-type mage.

In a gathering of three archmages who had reached the pinnacle in their respective fields, Estas's upper level was about to be opened for the first time in 20 years.
