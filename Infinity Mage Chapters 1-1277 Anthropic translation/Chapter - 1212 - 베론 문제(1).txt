The Veron Problem (1)

King Basak of the Iron Kingdom returned to his bedchamber after finishing the banquet.

"Phew, I'm exhausted."

His stamina was completely drained from indulging in hedonistic parties day after day.

"I'm getting old too. There was a time when I could go ten rounds without breaking a sweat, but now I feel like my very soul is being wrung out..."

"Don't worry. A man's equipment never dies until he does."

When a woman's voice echoed in the bedroom that was supposedly impenetrably guarded by his personal guard, Basak bolted upright.

"Wh-who..."

Upon confirming the pale, serpent-like face of the woman, he let out a sigh of relief.

"So it was you."

It was Shura, ranked 7th in the Council of Ten Elders.

Even after Buddha left this world, she was still searching for the world's secrets.

The reason she bothered to stay in Iron was because of Veron's Iron Pole, wielded by the head of the Council of Ten Elders.

'The Veron Problem.'

Can humans truly change the future?

This would be the hottest topic at the terminus of Omega Year 999, as defined by God.

Basak collapsed back onto his bed.

"You startled me. What's the sudden occasion? You haven't shown your face around here lately."

"How do you attend banquets with such a weak heart? You really are a strange man."

"Heh heh, if I didn't like meeting women, I'd have to stop living. More importantly, the Holy War has been ominous lately."

People were dying randomly every hour.

"So, where have you been?"

If Shura had been around when each nation was tracking Wuorin, the situation would have been quite different.

"...I went to meet a friend."

'A friend.'

Basak's mind raced quickly despite his seemingly vacant, thoughtless expression.

'What is she plotting now?'

He'd heard the Council of Ten Elders had dissolved, but information about who was alive or dead was severely lacking.

"Mind your own business."

When Basak came to his senses, Shura was looking at him with cold eyes.

"Who said anything? Of course I trust you."

"Hehe, the God of Lies?"

"I'm someone who worships lies. Only when buried in falsehoods can truth shine bright."

Shura leaned against Basak's body.

"Then what truth is hidden in my lies?"

"That you can kill me."

"But the fact that you haven't killed me means you still need me. In that case, we can be good friends. That's the truth I've discovered."

"Excellent."

"Heh heh! In that spirit, may I ask a favor? You've always made my dreams come true."

Shura was strong.

But if you expanded the scope to the entire world, there weren't zero people who could break her.

Still, the reason Basak trusted her was because of her exceptional skills beyond mere force.

'Also... she is Buddha's direct disciple, after all.'

Shura said:

"Let me hear it first. What do you want?"

"The world."

His body, which hadn't responded even to Shura's touch, burned with desire.

"Gis is good at politics too, I'll give him that. But didn't I set up the entire game board?"

Basak turned his head and widened his eyes.

"Head of the World Leadership Nation. With your abilities, couldn't you bring me that position?"

Shura's eyes narrowed.

'He truly has no limits.'

There was no way she didn't know that Jaive was the most likely candidate for the World Leadership Nation.

'If Jaive devours the world, Iron will receive corresponding treatment. Yet even that isn't enough - he wants to climb higher once again.'

Basak spoke again:

"Give me the world. Then I'll hand over what you truly desire as well."

Truth shining within lies.

"...I'll do my best."

As if rewinding time, she withdrew from the bed and turned toward the door.

'It's a difficult task. But...'

It didn't seem like there was absolutely no way.

In the royal bedchamber of the Tormia Sector, Shirone watched over the moaning Pony.

'She regained consciousness. Is this a sign of recovery, or...'

A final surge before death.

After the doctor finished his examination and left the room, Shirone touched Pony's forehead.

Pony blinked her eyes, recognized him, and smiled like in their school days.

"Shirone."

"Are you okay? How do you feel?"

"Well, I don't know. How do I look?"

Pony was dying.

"Just hold on a little longer. I'll figure something out. I'll definitely save you, so until then..."

At that moment, Pony's eyes widened and she spat out blood.

The poison of emotion.

The resentment lodged in her heart was endlessly reversing her metabolism.

Shirone cast Miracle Stream.

'Damn it.'

Who could soothe it?

The emotions of a woman who had to die in terrible agony, surrounded by vicious men.

'Even that would be unbearable. Any words of comfort would make her cough up blood.'

It was even amplified to the extreme through hell's system - the strongest killing intent in history.

'The only way is...'

To initialize the system of the inner world and remove Pony's demonic energy.

"Just hold on a little longer."

Pony smiled bitterly.

"I don't deserve that."

"What qualifications do you need to live?"

"It's all because of my greed. If I hadn't tried to become queen, none of this would have happened."

"You were just trying to survive. In a situation where royalty was being purged, it was your only choice."

Pony shook her head.

"In my school days, I hated my bloodline. Others would say I was well-fed, but that's how it was. Royalty who couldn't become queen. Like a magician who couldn't use magic."

"Why did I despise being royalty? I gave countless reasons, but now I think I understand. The truth is, I wanted it more desperately than anyone. The title of queen."

"That's not a bad thing."

"Did I dream of the image of a queen from fairy tales? I thought I'd be different from others, thought I could change things..."

Pony wailed.

"I really wanted to do well! But Shirone, it doesn't work out well! That's so frustrating!"

Watching her cry while spitting blood, Shirone bit his lips.

'Contradiction.'

Everyone accepts it as natural, but there's a truth that becomes chilling when you think about it carefully.

'This world is strange.'

How could it make sense for this to be a world designed so people can't achieve what they want from the start?

'It didn't have to be made this way. A world where everyone is happy - that was perfectly possible.'

Is God a pervert with bad taste?

'No.'

Perhaps God created a perfect world, and only humans are under a massive delusion.

'Therefore, the heart is an error.'

What's correct is emptiness.

But Jet knew this fact yet still wanted to pass his error on to the future.

'Tachyon's incantation. If that's the key to connecting with the outer world, at least I alone...'

Can fight God.

As he steeled his resolve, the door opened and Albino, Rufist, and Dante entered.

"You've arrived."

Albino approached with a smile.

"I heard you called for us. You know Tormia's situation. Since you took time from your busy schedule, I hope..."

"I'll do it."

Albino closed his mouth.

"I want to cooperate in making Tormia the World Leadership Nation. What should I do?"

'Hmm, this is...'

Albino stroked his beard.

'Better than expected?'

His combative nature flared up again, but he didn't show it and looked back at Pony.

"How is her condition?"

Perhaps due to her earlier excitement, she was unconscious.

That might be better.

"Let's sit first."

Moving to the table, Rufist asked:

"What exactly do you mean by helping Tormia? Does that include war?"

"I won't break Yahweh's will. But if war is advantageous, there's nothing stopping us from waging it."

That much for now.

"I understand. But why did you change your mind?"

"We need a focal point. I want to unite humanity around Tormia. More than anything... I can't let someone like Gis take the position of world leader."

Through this demonstration, Shirone seemed to have learned a lot as well.

Albino said:

"Since mining Ymir's Ultima is still distant, political capability is essential. But you know this, right? Even if we gather all of humanity together, it won't be true integration."

"Forget about Ultima."

Everyone blinked at the radical statement.

"Of course, I won't give up on integration. But now it's time to find the next best option."

"So you found one?"

He didn't reveal anything about the sphere surrounding the sun.

"I think I've conveyed my opinion sufficiently. Please choose what you'll do."

Albino said:

"Hmm. Currently, Tormia's candidate ranking is 6th. The probability of getting enough votes to become the leadership nation is 16.4 percent."

And he looked at Dante.

"I'm curious too. If Shirone gives us his full support, what would the probability be?"

After finishing his calculations, Dante opened his mouth.

"..."

Albino wasn't surprised.

"It dropped even further. Is joining hands with Yahweh like embracing a bomb?"

"The initial variable is because Yahweh's name appeared in Arachne's scandal article. It wouldn't matter if it had concluded, but Gis fanned the flames and made the incident bigger."

Dante considers all information.

"Originally, Yahweh was a symbolic image. But when the name appears on the political front, enemies multiply. Since the demonstrators split in half, half of Jaive's citizens will hate Yahweh."

"But in the Holy War, citizens only have voting rights delegated to Gis. It shouldn't be related to other nations' public sentiment, right?"

"Of course. However..."

Dante's expression became serious.

"The problem is that the Pope's power grows. If Yahweh is criticized at the Holy War venue, Lami religion, the world's largest religion, will spread this across the entire world. Moreover, even if it's just a hollow procedure, the World Leadership Nation officially receives the Pope's approval. The variables Shirone will create are certainly significant, but politics is different. Probably, getting votes will be difficult."

A situation where the probability actually drops.

"I see."

Albino understood.

"I agree with the intelligence chief's words too. It's embarrassing to say this in front of the person involved, but what should we do now? Should we reject Shirone's proposal?"

"Of course..."

Dante said:

"We should accept it. We need to stake everything our nation has to hold onto Shirone."

Albino raised the corner of his mouth.

"Why?"

"Because it feels good."

As the room fell silent, the explanation continued.

"Just because you have an ace in hand doesn't mean you'll win at cards. It needs to form a hand with the cards on the table. But once you have the ace..."

"It feels good."

"Yes. Even if the cards on the table are a difficult combination to make a hand with, if you consider the possibility that your opponent also doesn't have a hand yet, your momentum goes up significantly."

"You don't know until you open the ballot box."

Dante nodded.

"Of course, judging by the current political climate, the ace is a bad card. But if we can't close the gap with probability anyway, I think Tormia should also take the gamble."

Rufist, resting his chin on his hand, blinked.

"Sorry. For an intelligence agent to talk about momentum. This is just my personal opinion..."

"No."

Albino smiled.

"You're the best intelligence agent. Didn't you move that 16.4 percent? Let's go with this. Let's try it."

With that conclusion reached, Shirone spoke up:

"Then what should I do?"

"Unanimous decision. To suppress Lami religion's global public opinion, all 11 nations must vote for Tormia."

Rufist said:

"Whether through threats or bluffs, use any means necessary and steal votes from the kings. All of them."
