[578] The Probability of R (1)

Alpheas Magic School maintenance factory.

This place, which maintains simple magical teaching materials, forbids entry to both students and staff once night falls.

This is due to the risk of theft, loss, and fire.

And now, damage was beginning to occur there due to Sabina's Air Cut.

As sparks flew with a thud and the wire mesh split apart, Frings, who had launched his body away, shook his head.

"No good, no good."

Frings was strong.

Even his ranking of 3rd in the graduating class was merely a composite of numerous magical ability scores.

In actual combat, a battle mage was a truly ferocious position, and with his ice attribute and ability to instinctively evade most Spirit Zones, even Sabina, who was also a battle mage, couldn't help but feel powerless before him.

"Hyup!"

Frings grabbed Sabina's neck and slammed her against the iron bars.

"This is...!"

"Release your Spirit Zone."

His voice was cold, piercing straight to the heart.

"Otherwise your neck flies off."

Feeling her esophagus freezing as it penetrated her throat, Sabina released her Spirit Zone.

"Even so, I'll never give up the Master Card..."

"Shut up. I'm the one asking questions."

The moment she saw Frings' eyes, her heart sank with a thud.

'So cold.'

Every time the frigid air rising from his hands seeped into her nose, it felt like her organs were being frozen.

"You won't last long. Ten minutes at most? If you keep breathing like this, your insides will become blocks of ice."

Sabina didn't understand why he was deliberately inflicting pain while ignoring the victory conditions of Scramble Royale.

"What do you want?"

Frings brought his face close to Sabina's and took a loud, audible breath.

"Haaaaah!"

Watching his trembling eyelids, murderous intent naturally surged up, but it was such an abnormality that she didn't dare reveal it.

"What a nauseating smell, Sabina. It's like falling into a sewer."

As Sabina felt nauseous, the cold intensified and she felt pain as if her blood vessels were tearing.

"Hyuk!"

"What are you thinking? Are you waiting for Ned? Do you think he'll come after seeing that rescue signal from earlier?"

Sabina kept her mouth firmly shut.

"Answer me. Otherwise I'll kill you."

Frings would definitely do it.

In his unmasked expression, there was no law, no morality, no dignity befitting a magic school student to be found.

"Yes..."

"Good, what a good girl. Now I'm going to ask you questions. If I think you're lying, I'll kill you. If you stall for time, you'll freeze to death. Now, stage one."

Sabina's lips trembled.

"Let's start with something easy. What did you eat this morning?"

"I ate bread."

"Be specific! What kind of bread did you eat? How did it taste? Did you eat it with milk? Or juice?"

As the cold intensified, Sabina grimaced and shouted.

"I ate cream bread with milk! It was so delicious I thought I'd die! Why!"

"Oh, is that so? Cream bread with milk..."

Frings' eyes rolled back.

"...you ate it. So deliciously... It must have been sweet, hmm? It must have melted smoothly in your mouth?"

'I want to kill him!'

Frings' pupils returned to their proper place.

"Good. Second question. When was your first kiss? Who was it with? What were you thinking, how did you feel? Where? What position were you in?"

Sabina gritted her teeth.

"Like I'd tell someone like you?"

"Oho, you're going to try to endure? Was it such a secret kiss? A precious memory?"

Even colder air seeped into her nose.

"That's a fine choice. How does it feel to weigh a precious memory against your life? Are you scared? Do you wish this situation were a lie?"

'Save me! Save me, Ned!'

Blocking out Frings' words in her head, Sabina cried out inwardly.

'I'm not scared. He'll come to rescue me.'

The reason she could endure even Frings' abnormal madness was because Ned was there.

'It's nothing. Back then, it was much more frightening than this.'

Sabina's pupils began to dilate.

"The effects are gradually showing. How about giving up? Would it really be worth dying over something like this?"

Frost began to form on the wire mesh of the maintenance factory.

'Hurry! Hurry!'

Ned cast teleportation with all his might.

As far as he knew, none of his teammates were the type to ask for help over just anything.

'It seems to be Sabina's area.'

Just as he was accelerating the tempo of his teleportation, horned monsters attacked from all directions.

Divine Heaven Magic Arts

Red Goblin.

Reflexively spreading plasma and delivering an electric attack, blue electricity tangled around the goblin's body and it exploded.

'It's Anchal! I need to call Kong...'

Currently, Ned's hand was ○●○ (Democracy), while Anchal's hand was ○ⓡ.

'She chose black for her last card. Then the random card has a high probability of being white.'

If they had the same hand, it would be advantageous to call Kong.

"Anchal, Kong."

Anchal replied.

"Kong."

As expected, it was the same Democracy, which made Anchal's ambush all the more puzzling.

'My hand is already revealed, right? Why would she ambush me knowing we have the same hand?'

This wasn't even a place where there was a Scramble.

"Did you come to prevent a rescue? Yesterday you proposed secret negotiations. What a bat-like personality."

Anchal bowed her head politely.

"Thank you."

'What, really? This woman...'

Anchal continued.

"But I'm fighting my own battle. I don't care about Scramble Royale or whatever."

"Then get out of the way. I'm busy as it is."

"Ned, who are you?"

Ned kept his mouth shut.

"I was raised from birth receiving training to analyze humans. It's a mechanically cold analysis."

"So what? Are you curious about how to become last in the graduating class?"

"Those stronger than me and those weaker are clear. Of course, most are weaker. But you..."

Before making her assertion, Anchal lifted her single eye one last time to examine Ned.

"I truly don't know. Therefore, facing this great undertaking, I felt the need to confirm."

Ned opened his mouth, recalling Sabina's words.

"I am me. I don't know what you want to find out, but nothing will change from now."

"Will that really be the case?"

Anchal waved her hand.

Divine Heaven Magic Arts

Mental Image Manifestation (Self-Portrait).

"Now, your true form...!"

Anchal's single eye widened as she stopped speaking.

'What is that?'

"Kuuuuh!"

Electricity rippled from Ned's body and then spread out explosively.

"Uaaaaah!"

The scenery flickered as if night and day were repeating, and when the reality was finally revealed, Anchal's body shot up in a flash of light.

'I can't read it.'

Though it was an ability to manifest an opponent's mental image, even Anchal, a master of illusions, found analysis impossible.

"Could it be...?"

Boooooom!

Real electricity, not an illusion, spread out and devastated the entire radius where Ned had been.

Landing precisely on a tree branch 200 meters away, Anchal watched Ned flee into the forest with his self-portrait.

"How did he become such a mess..."

What was revealed through the mental image manifestation was an incomprehensible mystery.

"How can you not go insane?"

"Haaaaah..."

Cold breath leaked between Sabina's lips.

Gradually her mind became hazy and her whole body felt frozen, losing sensation.

"The end approaches. How does it feel, dying?"

'I have to tell him.'

It's better than dying.

'I can't tell him.'

I'd rather die.

That ambiguous boundary where Sabina wavered was precisely the point where Frings felt pleasure.

"Now, last chance. Choose. Will you answer, or will you die?"

"I am..."

Just as Sabina's mouth opened, Frings' expression hardened.

'Spirit Zone?'

At the same time he launched his body, a flash of light passed through where he had been.

"Heok!"

Sabina, who had exhaled deeply and fallen to her knees, turned her head with a pained expression.

"Ned?"

Contrary to her expectation, Shirone was standing there, but before she could feel disappointed, she limped toward him.

"Sorry. It was too much for my strength."

Shirone, who had faced Frings directly, knew his abilities best.

"It's okay. Are you hurt anywhere?"

"I'm not in good condition. I don't know exactly, but I probably won't die."

Shirone glared at Frings with a grimace.

"What are you doing right now?"

"I don't know what you mean. What are you doing?"

"No matter how heated emotions get, this is a match based on rules and agreements. I can't tolerate tormenting an opponent like this."

Frings mimicked Shirone's words in a childish voice.

"I can't tolerate tormenting an opponent."

Then he approached the red-faced Shirone and said.

"What will you do if you can't tolerate it? Will you hit me? Then I'll run away like crazy."

Frings' index finger pointed hurriedly at Shirone.

"Did you think about why I just said I'd run away? Are you perhaps afraid of me? Not at all, not at all."

His index finger shook left and right.

"That's true victory. You getting so angry you go crazy and collapsing from rage disease. Honestly, isn't it frustrating for you too? Just liberate yourself completely."

Frings stretched both arms toward the sky and shouted.

"Strength is true freedom! Breaking free from moral law, legal law, and school rules to gain infinite freedom!"

"So... are you infinite right now?"

"Huh?"

"The you I'm looking at is a pitiful creature who can only suffer endlessly because you can't quench your thirst."

"Oho, such refined expression. For a commoner."

Frings seemed desperate to make Shirone angry.

"No matter what nonsense you spout, I'll maintain the line I've drawn."

"Really?"

Frings' figure disappeared.

"Then die of frustration."

Just as Frings, who had cast teleportation, was about to leap over the wall, Shirone's flash collided head-on.

"What!"

As Frings, who had canceled his photonization, stepped back without being able to cross the wall, Shirone revealed the incarnation of the Archangel of Light and charged.

'Is that it? The ability to manipulate time.'

The reason he chose a head-on collision prepared for fatal injury was because he could reverse it.

'This works out well.'

If he hadn't planned to clash anyway, it was up to Frings to handle it.

Ice Flower Transformation.

As ice blades fluttered like petals, Shirone made a wide detour around the perimeter and cast Photon Cannon.

"Hehehe, are you angry?"

Detecting the Spirit Zone, Frings swayed his upper body like dancing and avoided the flash.

"I'll never get hit. A defensive omnidirectional type like that... huh?"

Frings narrowed his eyes as if he couldn't believe it.

'There's no Spirit Zone?'

No, that wasn't it.

'There are Spirit Zones everywhere. What the hell is this...?'

At the Photon Cannon bursting out right next to him, Frings' upper body bent back almost vertically.

'Departure type? It's different from that too. Why is magic activating?'

As the focal point disappeared through Elysion, Photon Cannons were born from all directions and covered him like a net.

"Good heavens..."

Sabina, who had been watching, gaped.

The reason a mage's position is important is because it's the focal point of the mind.

Therefore, she couldn't understand the principle by which magic activated with the focal point gone.

"Now I understand."

Frings, like a true battle mage, drew only conclusions closely related to victory and defeat.

'There is a radius. Only the boundary has disappeared. Then...'

Frings' eyes curved like seagulls and his lips split wide enough to create deep laugh lines.

"I'll run much further away."

Time Reverse!

As Shirone widened her eyes and destroyed the mold of time, dozens of Photon Cannons rushed toward Frings' back as he launched his body.

"Damn it...!"

Kwakwakwakwakwang!

Frings, directly exposed to the flashes pouring down like hail, disappeared covered in dust.

"Kuuuuh!"

A groan was heard first, then wind pushed away the dust.

Frings, with chunks of ice attached to the ends of his limbs, was trembling with both arms covering his face.
