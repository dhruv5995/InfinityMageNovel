[568] War Declaration (4)

The six people gathered in the hallway remained silent, caught between lingering anger and briefly released tension.

Sabina, who was the most objective about this matter, asked.

"What do you think? About the alliance team's proposal?"

"The graduation exam pass card came from calculating that our team includes an outsider. Just lowering the rankings was already participating in the scramble. They thought the condition of graduation exam success would definitely work."

At Iruki's words, Dorothy asked.

"Is this a situation where I should apologize? I was the one who suggested accepting the initial proposal."

"No. You made a reasonable demand. A team where one person has to be sacrificed has no value in existing. It's a match where teamwork is important."

'So cold.'

As Dorothy felt this way, Shirone spoke.

"I have no complaints about Dorothy's judgment either. Personally, it's an unpleasant proposal, but everyone has their purposes. If we blame Dorothy, then we who brought in an outsider would be worse."

Nade drew his friends' attention.

"Alright, let's become trash from now on. If we act on emotions, there'll be no end. We'll only consider efficiency."

Everyone agreed, but it was still difficult to speak up, so Nade stepped forward first as class president.

"Honestly, I think it's a good proposal."

Shirone nodded.

"I think the same. Though I don't like using human emotions as conditions."

In truth, he wanted to cancel the Scramble Royale right now and declare war on Cayden.

But thinking rationally, the fact that Amy wasn't involved in Cayden's demands was already half a success.

'Sorry, Amy. But if Cayden tries to do something to you, I absolutely won't be able to fight.'

Even if it meant accepting a forfeit.

Iruki glanced at Amy and said.

"As Shirone said, if we exclude emotions, it might not be a serious problem to worry about. Anyway, even if Shirone confessed in this situation, Maya wouldn't accept it. I can talk to her in advance."

"Ugh!"

Amy couldn't hold back and showed her emotions.

Seeing her face with tears welling up and biting her lips, everyone's mood became solemn.

'Yes, Iruki's words are right.'

However, she was too frustrated and hurt in her pride to easily change her mind.

Sabina, understanding her feelings, said.

"Amy, if you really hate it..."

"Two people."

Amy cut her off.

"Get two people to pass. If not, I won't do it either."

In an exam where 10 people graduate, the difference between 1 and 2 people was significant, but no one opposed.

"Alright. Let's go with two people. Don't worry too much. You know, right? We'll definitely win."

Instead of answering, Amy glared toward Cayden who would be in the research society.

'I'll never forgive you.'

After finishing their discussion coordination, Nade led the girls inside, and Iruki, remaining in the hallway, asked Shirone.

"Will you really be okay?"

"Yeah. Honestly, it's a relief. If Amy had been included in the rewards and costs, I would have..."

"No, not that."

Shirone corrected his expression and looked at Iruki.

"About graduating two people. Amy hasn't lost her reason either. She probably judged that if two cards could be fairly distributed to Dorothy and Sabina, they'd have motivation to fight with their lives on the line too. But you know, right? In the graduation exam, you and I are also competitors in the end. If those two receive Fermi's protection, the difficulty of passing will inevitably increase."

Shirone, finally realizing this, smiled.

"Yeah. I don't mind."

And the next moment, as if nothing had happened, Shirone's face turned cold as ice.

"I'm just waiting for that day to come as soon as possible."

Iruki felt a chilling coldness as he watched Shirone's back returning to the research society.

'Fermi, everything may have gone your way until now, but...'

Iruki, the last to enter, closed the door.

'Shirone really won't be easy.'

10 hours had passed since entering negotiations.

The faces of all 12 people were full of fatigue, and dark circles were gradually forming under their eyes.

Hersy, who had recorded all decided matters without omission, moved to the final agenda.

"Now only detailed adjustments remain. Any opinions?"

Nade spoke as if he had been waiting.

"Even if there are deaths, no responsibility will be questioned."

Though his voice wasn't loud, hostility toward the opposing team had reached its peak.

"Fine. We feel the same way, so let's agree on this immediately."

Hersy, recording on paper, recalled what Fermi had hinted at before coming to Eastas.

"Armand? What's that?"

Fermi frowned and said.

"It's Shirone's object. If possible, it would be good to make it unusable in this Scramble Royale. No, it's essential."

"Essential? Is it that powerful an object?"

"It is at a dangerous level."

When Fermi said something was dangerous, it really meant it was dangerous.

"If it's such an amazing weapon, the other side will never give it up, right? Can we lead the negotiations?"

Fermi smiled and pointed at Hersy.

"In times like this, suggest this."

Having finished thinking, Hersy said.

"This time we'll make a proposal from our side. Shirone's Armand cannot be used in the Scramble Royale."

'They know about Armand.'

It was the moment it was confirmed that Fermi was behind this.

"That's unacceptable."

Shirone firmly shook his head.

Though he didn't want to show dependence on a weapon, his desire to immediately smash the enemies was stronger.

"It's an activity unrelated to school. I will use Armand, and if you want to use weapons too, feel free to do so."

"If you insist on being stubborn, there's nothing we can do. But then we'll have no choice but to use our trump card too."

Nade snorted.

"What card do you have to propose? You seem to have heard something from Fermi, but nothing is worth exchanging for Armand."

"Is that so? If I heard from Fermi, then you must have heard from Shirone too, right?"

"What are you talking about?"

Hersy raised his index finger and said.

"If Shirone doesn't use Armand, we won't use Fermi's chips either."

Shirone bit his lips.

'Ah, there was that method.'

"You probably already know, so you'll understand quickly. Currently, Fermi possesses magic worth approximately 10 billion gold. For reference, the magic Fermi has used so far has been worth at most a few million gold. If you use Armand, Fermi is prepared to empty his coffers and give all his chips to the alliance team."

Shirone went strong.

"Hmph! Even so..."

"Right, I hear it's an incredible weapon. But even so, you can't lead the match alone. On the other hand, all six of us will be strengthened."

'Hersy's words also make sense. Force is necessary, but it's not a match more important than teamwork.'

This was because there were rules that fundamentally blocked force if you lost in Kang.

Also, if he brought out Armand, he'd have to fight an alliance team wielding magic worth 10 billion gold.

"I'll start opinion coordination. Everyone come out."

Shirone took his team members and held the 11th secret meeting.

"As you heard, we need to modify our initial strategy. I didn't expect Fermi to be this interested in Eastas..."

Nade touched his chin and said.

"Originally, we expected the alliance team to ban Iruki's Cancellation as taboo. Since it's a natural enemy of Eden's defensive magic. But Armand..."

"If it's worth 10 billion gold, it'll definitely be a match where we're dragged along. Which would be more efficient?"

The only person who could judge was Shirone, who knew Armand's functions perfectly.

"Let's accept it. 10 billion gold worth of magic definitely doesn't taste good. But not under these conditions."

Iruki made sure to clarify.

"Then do you see Armand as more efficient? If it's for our safety, there's no need to worry."

"No. As Hersy said, the balance seems right. What I mean is let's probe more. I don't remember, but if Fermi saw Armand's ability in Under Coder..."

Shirone perceived an unknown probability.

"Even if it means taking a slightly bigger loss, he'd choose to ban Armand. Given Fermi's personality."

Nade said.

"You mean the maximum potential is higher. I understand. Then how about banning Eden's nude state?"

Sabina said.

"But that's just one way of implementing magic, right? It's like banning Dorothy's hickory. If they challenge the legitimacy, we could be attacked too."

"There's something more important."

Amy said.

"Anyway, if Iruki's Cancellation isn't taboo, we have means to check Eden's defensive magic. Rather, what would help us in this situation is sealing Anchal's Demon Eye."

Sabina asked.

"But didn't Anchal not remove her blindfold even during the graduation exam? Would she really release the seal in Scramble Royale?"

"It's not a matter of probability. If there's even a 1% chance, it'll cause confusion in judgment at crucial moments. So it's better to seal it now. Especially since Anchal has many secrets."

Anchal's origin was the Jincheon Empire across the sea, with completely different culture from where Shirone's group lived.

If Kashan occupied the western and central continents, and Gustav was in the eastern continent, then Jincheon was in the east, and the emperors of these three empires were the current Three Imperial System ruling the world.

"Anchal's major is mental magic, specialty is illusion. But unlike Arin, it incorporates eastern techniques, so it's unfamiliar."

If Arin fundamentally invaded the opponent's mind, Anchal applied external shock through realistic illusions.

According to the scout's words during the graduation exam, it had intensity comparable to the 4th stage of the survival test, the 'death's door', meaning if she created an illusion blade and stabbed, it would impact the mind with the intensity of the 4th stage 'severance' that Shirone had passed.

"Anchal's illusion magic is closer to omnipotence than omniscience. If the Demon Eye's seal is released, the intensity won't be just at the 4th stage level."

They'd have to face such illusions for seven days.

Considering how many graduation class students had passed the 4th stage 'severance' during the survival test, it was better to block it.

"Good. We'll seal Anchal's Demon Eye."

Having unified their opinions, Shirone returned to the research society and proposed to Hersy.

"I'll accept it. However, I'll also bet on Anchal's seal release. If you accept that, I'll also ban using Armand."

Anchal, who had shown no change in expression until now, frowned.

'They were planning to release the seal.'

As Iruki became certain, Hersy looked at Anchal and asked her intention.

"What will you do?"

Anchal, quickly correcting her expression, nodded.

"Fine. I wasn't planning to release the seal anyway."

She thought it worked out well.

'Scramble Royale isn't everything. Even if we win here, we still have to fight the Gold Ring again.'

Then the bell announcing midnight rang.

"This concludes the negotiations. If there's anything more to add, say it now. I'll input it into the judge now."

Hersy took out paper and pen and asked.

"Nothing. Now only the fighting remains."

Having negotiated fiercely for 12 hours, there couldn't be anything left to say.

Though there were regrettable parts, there were also beneficial parts, so most were satisfied with this negotiation.

As Hersy recorded the matters on the judge's paper, a full forty-eight memo sheets piled up.

"Then let's begin."

Hersy, who had put the papers into the judge in order, input the final record and pressed a buzzer-like lens.

With a click sound, blue light flashed from the lens, and Lulu's voice converted into electrical signals and pierced everyone's minds in an instant.

Scramble Royale war declaration.

Waiting time: 10 hours 58 minutes 32 seconds.
