[576] The Omnipotent Monster (3)

Even after Shirone was summoned by Siena, the black and white match continued to unfold intensely.

Amy and Anchal's teams, who encountered each other at the training ground behind the graduating class, drew with ●● (heresy). With the same hand revealed, a collision occurred to claim the scramble.

Mystical Arts of the Profound Heaven
Death's Path.

A giant serpent coiled around Amy's body, climbing up to bite her torso.

"Ugh!"

Though only an illusion, the intensity of the mental shock was at the level of death's boundary.

Most troublesome of all was that it was impossible to avoid.

'Crimson Eyes!'

As Amy's eyes blazed red and reset her mind, Anchal's expression crumpled.

'Self-image memory. This is difficult.'

At most, only Vice Principal Olivia could pressure him at school, but the Crimson Eyes that made illusions completely ineffective were the worst possible matchup.

Mystical Arts of the Profound Heaven
Sword Struggle.

Thousands of blades sprouted from the ground, swaying like grass, making Amy feel as if her flesh was being butchered.

But once the Crimson Eyes activated, any illusion would be reset.

As Amy burst through the Sword Struggle and threw a punch, Anchal caught her fist between his elbow and knee.

"Kuk!"

Though not Schema, it was the martial arts of a trained expert.

'Eastern combat techniques. Just what is his identity?'

As Amy created distance and regained her composure, Anchal extended his hand.

"I'll yield the scramble."

"Nonsense!"

"If you want, I'll forfeit the match."

"What?"

Only then did Amy's movements stop.

"Further fighting is meaningless. I only want to investigate Estas. I have no intention of getting involved in school life."

Amy couldn't grasp Anchal's intentions.

'Come to think of it, in the negotiations he also wagered a private meeting with Shirone if he won.'

The price for losing was not unsealing the Demon Eye even during graduation exams.

'It wouldn't be balanced without a clear purpose. Does he really not care about graduation?'

Amy asked point-blank.

"Just who are you? Why is someone with your skills at school?"

"I collect dolls..."

"Shut up! Who would believe that nonsense now?"

Anchal sighed.

"I can't reveal my purpose. However, I want to make a deal. As I said earlier, I don't mind forfeiting. You can discuss it with your teammates. But if you win..."

"No."

Amy cut him off.

"Everyone is fighting fiercely, even giving up their graduation evaluations. I don't know what scheme you're plotting, but I won't tolerate such secret negotiations. So you fight with your best effort too."

"Is that so?"

Lost in thought, Anchal muttered in his native language.

"I cannot understand Western ways of thinking."

"What are you muttering about?"

As Amy flashed her Crimson Eyes and charged, Anchal waved his hand.

Mystical Arts of the Profound Heaven
Mental Manifestation (Self-Portrait).

'Oh no!'

Flames erupted from Amy's body, taking shape as a giant female form.

It was a troublesome ability that manifested the target's psyche as an image to attack its owner.

'This is my self-portrait?'

Amy looked up at the woman blazing with giant flames.

It was a fire woman with explosively intense heat and generously full breasts.

"...Mental images can be distorted by complexes."

Amy's face turned red.

"How ridiculous! I'm perfectly fine as I am!"

Then the fire self-portrait swung its fist and attacked Amy.

'Crimson Eyes!'

Amy was probably the only one who could manifest and simultaneously eliminate a self-portrait, but Anchal had already moved away.

"What the hell..."

The fact that he disappeared without even taking the scramble lent credibility to Anchal's words.

'I don't know what he's thinking.'

"...I believe in Your existence. I believe Your love will change the world."

In the deep forest where no one came, Eden offered prayers.

The contract condition with the alliance team was to combine and defend Infinity until the end of the 7th day.

In exchange for receiving a free roll, she was raising her devotion to the extreme for the decisive moment.

"God is omniscient and omnipotent, transcendent, and unique."

Therefore, her body inhabited by Yorath was invincible.

"O God! Use me according to Your will."

Incomprehensible prayers poured from her mouth in succession, and sacred light blazed brilliantly from her body.

Bang!

Siena slammed her desk and shouted.

"Do you have any sense or not! Fighting at school!"

"It wasn't fighting, it was scramble..."

"Shut up! I was lenient with you, and now you're causing mayhem without thinking?"

Siena had a rational personality, but this time she left no room for argument.

"You're a walking strategic weapon! Don't you know countries worldwide are monitoring your activities? Did you return from heaven just to play such games with your friends?"

Siena was also a member of the task force that participated in the Heaven Project, which made Shirone feel hurt.

"This is a trap Frings set up. When they're charging to kill me, what am I supposed to do?"

"You should die anyway."

Siena said coldly.

"You should be grateful that your incident against the entire world had some humanity to it. If there had been even a bit more humanity in your incident, you'd already be dead. Whether kingdoms, organizations, or whatever lurks beneath the surface, you would have been assassinated already."

As Shirone hung his head dejectedly, Siena's tone softened slightly.

"You know, don't you? You're not alive because there's something protecting you. Rather, because everyone is an enemy, they can't make a move right now. You're standing in the center of a typhoon with an incredibly narrow eye. If you deviate even slightly in this state, you'll be swept away instantly."

The time spent with friends after returning to school felt too much like a dream.

Was that why he thought this time could continue forever?

"I'm sorry. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again."

Only then did Siena calm her anger and turn her chair while crossing her arms.

"End it quietly."

"Pardon?"

When Shirone asked back, Siena frowned as if displeased.

"The principal also knows about Scramble Royale. Though Olivia has great influence in the faculty meeting, it's impossible to block even the student channels. If it's at an acceptable level, the school will tolerate it, so handle it quietly without causing talk elsewhere."

Shirone blinked and grasped her true meaning before answering.

"Yes, I understand."

"Now get out. Let me be clear - what happened today must never happen again. You understand what I mean?"

Shirone bowed his head at the door and quietly left the room.

When Shirone returned to the battlefield, Iruki summoned everyone to the hideout.

At the point where the 4th day Scramble Royale was half over, several peculiarities had been discovered.

"Anchal proposed a secret meeting. It felt fishy so I refused for now, but I thought I should report it."

"As expected, Cayden withdrew from the battlefield. I didn't see him once today."

"He must be receiving healing magic. He'll return within the 7th day."

"One peculiar thing is that there's no activity from Eden. She didn't collect any scrambles either."

"She got smashed by Shirone yesterday. Maybe she gave up?"

Iruki shook his head.

"Optimism isn't good. The enemies aren't fools either. We should assume they're targeting something."

Sabina said.

"Two alliance team members stopped activity, but Fisho began scramble collection in earnest. By releasing insects to quickly claim them, the difference in card collection speed compared to personnel isn't that large."

"Since we confirmed that scrambles can be transferred to other factors, they'll actively utilize that. Then we have Dorothy. From now that the second half has begun, we need to consider the total amount of cards we can collect. We'll keep stockpiling scrambles using Hickory. Can you do it?"

"...Yes."

Dorothy answered in a small voice.

At her unmotivated attitude like yesterday, Iruki glanced back but dismissed it for now and asked Shirone.

"By the way, how did it go? You were summoned by Teacher Siena?"

Shirone shook his head bitterly.

"I don't think I can enter places where classes are in session anymore."

Nade gritted his teeth.

"Damn, that's too much. Those bastards definitely targeted that."

"No, I was wrong. I can't cause harm to the underclassmen."

Since the person involved said so, his friends had no choice but to accept it.

"There will be restrictions on movement from now on. Knowing that scramble transfer is possible, the alliance team will persistently target us. Should we redesign our movement routes?"

"It's fine."

Shirone smiled and said.

"I just need to finish before entering the training grounds."

That night, Ethella visited Siena late.

"How is Shirone doing? You must have been quite startled during the day."

"I reasoned with him well and sent him off."

Siena pressed her fevered forehead.

"Sigh, I'm the worst teacher. Encouraging fights."

"It couldn't be helped. It's not just a school problem."

Though he had returned from heaven, it was only a ceasefire.

That's why world leaders were also watching Shirone's movements.

"It's frustrating. I don't know what's going on, so I can't find a solution either."

"Teacher Siena just needs to do what she can. Experts are already moving."

Do what you want. Become an excellent teacher.

Armin's voice echoed in her ears.

'After saying that...'

There had been complete radio silence since.

No, honestly speaking, the person burning her inside wasn't Armin but Quan.

'How can this be? I sent so many letters.'

While there wasn't a single reply, a letter came from Kaizen Sword School.

Though the language was polite, the content was that Quan had quit school, so she should stop stalking.

'Mr. Quan said it was okay to send letters! They're making me look like a strange woman!'

Though Siena frowned from stress, her eyes soon calmed.

'Where did that person disappear to?'

She couldn't know, but one thing was certain.

Where he stood would be right in the middle of the world's most fierce battlefield.

"Ah."

Realizing she had been lost in other thoughts with someone in front of her, Siena corrected her expression and said.

"I'm sorry. But what brings you here? Is it about Shirone?"

"That too, and there's something I need to tell you."

"What?"

Ethella's expression became serious.

"I heard from Teacher Collie that Fermi didn't attend evaluation today."

"Fermi? That's really unexpected."

In Siena's memory, it was the first time the leader of the Gold Ring, who commanded powerful comrades, had moved personally.

"Is it related to Scramble Royale?"

"It can't be said to be unrelated, but it's probably a bigger problem - an Estas problem. The Gold Ring members participating in Scramble Royale are Hersy and Cayden. And Fermi disappeared before the most heated period, the 5th day. I'm thinking this might be Fermi's personal problem, not the Gold Ring's."

"Something secretive enough to divert the members' attention to Scramble Royale."

"Yes. I have a strong feeling about that."

"Hmm."

Siena sat on the desk, lost in thought, then turned her head again.

"What could possibly be at Estas to cause this? Wasn't it over when the Labyrinth's space-time disappeared?"

When Ethella seemed to hesitate with her answer, Siena pressed.

"Please tell me. I've withdrawn from the task force and have no intention of interfering, but I need to know something to protect Shirone."

Ethella opened her mouth as if resolved.

"Alright. But don't think of getting too deeply involved."

Siena asked about what she was most curious about first.

"The upper level rumors. Are they true?"

Everything that cannot exist in this world exists.

"To get to the point, it's probably not entirely wrong."

Siena's expression went blank.

"There really is... such a thing? What exactly is it?"

Ethella recalled what she had heard after returning from heaven.

"According to what I heard from Mr. Miro..."

A long story that would last through the night began.
