[585] In the Name of God (4)

After passing through the deep underground tunnel, a fist-sized orb crackling with blue electricity floated in mid-air.

Fermi gazed at the orb.

It was an electric encryption device extremely rare even in Radum, a device that even the Magic Association only applied to security levels of Grade 2 or higher.

"Money just keeps pouring out."

Irregular Formula.

Depreciation Trade.

A chip containing the 1.7 billion gold information magic, Indicator, popped up onto his palm.

After swallowing it and casting the magic, the orb's electricity spread into a curtain, revealing the internal circuits.

From here on it was purely a matter of brains, but compared to the security level, the encryption system wasn't too complex.

'I guess they don't have any information magic experts.'

Of course, that didn't mean it was easy, and Fermi only managed to successfully decode the encryption after fumbling around for about 30 minutes.

The orb glowed red, revealing a completely different scene than before.

Inside the massive cave, skulls were attached to the walls as if the entire space had been carved and sculpted, and at the end of the snake-like winding cave, several figures were holding wine glasses and conversing.

Though they couldn't be unaware that Fermi had arrived, they didn't seem to care.

'This is quite chilling.'

Even without security devices blocking access, the air in the cave was sharp as if blades were floating in it.

Having been through all sorts of trials, Fermi could tell that no matter who you pointed to in this place, they were all individuals looking toward the pinnacle of their respective fields.

'Well...'

Come to think of it, it wasn't particularly surprising.

The one waiting for Fermi was none other than the man who had reached the pinnacle of time magic.

"You finally came. I'll acknowledge your resourcefulness."

"No matter how much of a fugitive you are, I didn't expect you to be holed up in a place like this."

Fermi smiled as he walked toward the man with bandages wrapped around his eyes.

"Contemplator of Eternity, Mr. Armin."

Armin, who had withdrawn from the Ivory Tower, had joined hands with Miro and was currently carrying out some mission with several other figures.

"How did you find me?"

Fermi was the son of Yolga, a heroine who matched Miro, and a genius to boot, but this situation was still puzzling.

"To be honest, I heard it. From Mr. Sein."

'Sein.'

He too, operating under the name Snake in the Black Line, was helping Miro.

'Does letting Fermi go willingly mean he gave his consent?'

"First, about the negotiation I mentioned before..."

Fermi, who had been walking toward the table where Armin was sitting, suddenly stopped in his tracks.

If he had taken even one more centimeter forward, he would have died.

'Whoa.'

The one emitting a type of killing intent he had never experienced before was a one-armed swordsman leaning against the wall behind Armin.

Parka Quan, once an instructor at the Kaizen Swordsmanship School, was currently working with Armin preparing for the coming war.

"Sit down."

Only after Armin gave permission did the curtain of killing intent retreat.

"...Yes."

Fermi answered honestly and pulled out a chair.

'Phew, these are adults.'

Though Fermi feared nothing in the world, at this moment it would be best to behave like an obedient magic school student.

'And these are also aunt's friends.'

The so-called Miro lineup.

Like Sein, and including even the former Magic Association President Gaold who was currently in hiding, it was truly a formidable squad.

'Mother had them too.'

Fermi also had colleagues of Yolga whom he followed, calling them uncle.

'If only that day's incident hadn't happened...'

Sensing Fermi's eyes growing cold, Armin asked.

"You came here because of a deal, right?"

"The promised funds are ready. Only the signature remains."

Fermi pulled out the Depreciation Trade contract.

"Deadline is one week. Deal amount 100 billion gold. I'll do it in three-year installments."

Armin looked down at the trade contract.

Just making it this far proved Fermi's talent was exactly as Miro had described.

'But...'

He couldn't determine whether it was the right thing to do.

Most of all, he couldn't understand why Miro had allowed Fermi to investigate Estas.

"You must keep your promise."

The anxiety bleeding through Fermi's voice, so unlike him, meant this was a situation he couldn't control.

"Miro knows about this."

Though the promise between Fermi and Armin was from long ago, Miro had now been told about it.

"Are you confident you can take responsibility? You could die. No, even if you come out alive, there's nothing good about making Miro your enemy."

The smile disappeared from Fermi's face.

"I wonder if you could have said the same thing 19 years ago?"

"..."

"I just want to know for certain. Who originally owned what my aunt has."

When Armin, lost in thought, picked up his pen and signed, Fermi's eyes sparkled.

"As promised, I've signed."

The deal that seemed absolutely impossible when a much younger Fermi had first come to him had now been completed.

"Thank you."

When he cast the Irregular Formula, a golden chip was summoned.

Time Stop magic, Stop.

As the fourth Scramble was summoned and Iruki and Hersy's hands decreased, the random card probabilities began to fluctuate wildly.

'Why are they dispersing their hands?'

The question Hersy felt was clarified by opening the next random card.

'Black again.'

It should have been white with a 78% probability.

'Of course, 22% probability can't be ignored either. But for this to happen repeatedly...'

It was clear probability manipulation.

"I see. You're not taking kang."

"Dorothy, kang."

One second after Iruki called kang, Dorothy's hand ○○○(Religion) was revealed.

"When you don't choose kang or pao, the revealed cards aren't mixed into the random cards."

Hearing Hersy's words, Fisho checked the Master Card status.

"Sabina is destroying Scrambles. Our speed is far superior, but at this rate we won't gain much advantage."

"We should consider it roughly even. Now there are about 40 Scrambles left, including the ones we've collected."

The match would be decided only at the very final moment.

"No. If that's the case, we win. Eventually the probabilities will become fixed at some point."

It was the principle that as chess pieces decreased, variables also decreased.

"The winner of this game is Cayden."

A smile spread across Hersy's lips.

Though the fifth Scramble had been summoned long ago, it was no longer an important matter for Amy and Cayden.

"Uwooooo!"

Each time the Cross Sword spun like a windmill, cold waves swept in all directions.

Amy surrounded herself with Fire Mist, but this time a blade wind similar to Air Cut sliced through the fire barrier.

A master who could incorporate all attributes into swordsmanship.

'Even with such talent...'

Was it the fate of the Red Cross to have no choice but despair?

"Don't talk nonsense!"

Amy's red eyes shined as her firepower explosively increased.

'Ildo!'

Focusing once more within a state of concentration, she entered a temporary state of samadhi as her body blazed like a torch.

"What is this?"

No mage could withstand being surrounded by flames over 1,000 degrees Celsius.

'Vacuum.'

Magic combining air and fire attributes.

It was Amy's secret technique 'Hwain' that created a vacuum inside the flames to block heat convection.

"But you can't block radiant heat, can you?"

Amy could only maintain the Hwain state for at most 10 minutes.

"That's enough to take down an idiot like you."

"Idiot?"

"Don't you think you're being selfish? Everyone has at least one burden in life. But that doesn't mean you give up and try to ruin other people's lives too."

"That might be true."

Cayden raised his Cross Sword and placed his palm against it, causing cold frost to rise.

"But do you know? The weight of my fate is heavier than the weight of all humans."

'That's what makes you an idiot!'

Amy's charge looked like a massive fireball rolling forward.

"Foolish. Attempting close combat against a swordsman."

This was the first time in all their battles that Amy had closed the distance first.

"Is that so?"

Amy's flames surged recklessly as she became a fire giant and struck down at Cayden.

'It's not magic?'

Though the Cross Sword cut the giant, the freezing energy couldn't even resist and disappeared.

'Ifrit.'

Another battery equipped to Amy.

The ancient spirit Jack O'Lantern had evolved into a flame demon god, riding on the energy of Ildo.

"Flame Fist!"

Ifrit's fist made of flame smoke split into dozens and swung.

Boooooom!

With the explosion of flames, the final black and white, the 6th Scramble was summoned.

'Done.'

Shirone calmly opened his eyes.

As time approached midnight, the time field of Shibulsang Pokbae was distorting the scenery to the point where objects couldn't be distinguished.

'100 quadrillion.'

This was the destination point of the sequence formula that Shirone had finally reached.

Though he had expected it in one sense, as anticipated, nothing earth-shattering occurred.

The number 100 quadrillion was only great on a human scale, but this too was merely an extremely narrow section of natural numbers.

But it was sufficient time field to suppress Eden.

When he stood up, the scenery returned to normal and the Archangel's avatar rose to the height of the treetops.

"Eden is..."

After checking the Master Card, Shirone set out to find Eden, focusing on areas without Scrambles.

Making full use of the Spirit Zone, he narrowed the radius like herding prey, and finally Eden was caught in his synesthesia.

She probably felt it too, but she neither ran nor hid.

"...You've come."

Shirone checked Eden's condition.

'No Master Card.'

Likewise, Eden also looked up at Shirone's avatar.

"Is this the true nature of your time manipulation ability?"

"I thought countless thoughts."

Shirone approached Eden.

"And I reached a conclusion. Eden, your omnipotence isn't absolute. It's just strong."

"Humans tend to belittle realms they haven't reached. Because they fear what they don't know. It's also why people deny the existence of God."

"If God truly exists, why are you trying to prove it?"

"Is revealing what simply exists considered proof?"

"You deny Gaold."

"Because he denied God first."

"That's why you're not perfect."

"I don't know what you're talking about. If you have some other scheme..."

"You could die."

Shirone cut him off.

"The reason I'm bringing this up is simply because I don't want to kill you. Give up even now. Your omnipotence isn't absolute. If you take my attack in that state..."

Shirone was sincere.

"You really could die."

Eden shook his head with a pitying expression.

"Is this the method you came up with after all that thinking? Shaking my mind?"

"Listen well, Eden."

"No, fine. Yes, let's say you're right."

Eden's barrier emitted a sacred light.

"Let's say my omnipotence isn't absolute. Even so, God is watching over me. There's no arrogance. Even if I'm not perfect, there's no problem in defeating you."

Eden spread both arms as he spoke.

"If I'm not perfect, I'll avoid it. That would be another solution God has given me."

"I'm saying this because you can't avoid it."

Shirone said through gritted teeth.

"Once I start doing something, I guarantee you absolutely cannot avoid it. This is my final warning. Give up even now."

"How arrogant humans are."

Even after hearing the earnest words, Eden's eyes only grew calmer.

"Do you think you're God just because you can manipulate time? Not a chance."

Eden's barrier blazed with unprecedented brightness.

"I have an invincible space that God has granted me."

"...I understand."

The moment his words ended, the Archangel merged into Shirone's body and the time field began to spread.

"Please don't resent me."

In the name of God.

Time and space were about to collide.
