Demon Realm Hell ⑵

Though the moon had risen, heat still lingered at the place where the four archangels had fought.

The most prominent traces were massive grooves extending over 10 kilometers in three different directions.

And from those three directions, Satiel, Uriel, and Rayel walked back almost simultaneously.

The three archangels who met in the center maintained a long silence.

Uriel was the first to speak.

"...She's gone."

Satiel's fist flew out, and Rayel quickly grabbed her wrist.

"Calm down."

"Let go."

Satiel said while keeping her gaze fixed on Uriel.

"I'm serious. You'd better let go. Otherwise, you'll be the first one I annihilate."

Uriel spoke to the empty air.

"There's nothing more pathetic than blaming others for defeat."

"Blaming others?"

Shaking off Rayel's hand, Satiel approached.

"You're the one who didn't give your all! Did you think I wouldn't notice? Are you planning to betray Heaven too?"

Uriel remained silent.

As Satiel extended her hand, the Judicial Halo Nostalgia began spinning at a terrifying speed.

"I'll disintegrate you."

Just as she was about to attack, Uriel spoke.

"Ikael is..."

Her fingers twitched, and Uriel looked straight into Satiel's eyes.

"Why did she leave us?"

Rayel said, "She must have chosen blood over Heaven."

Only after saying it aloud did he realize how bizarre this situation truly was.

'That's right. This is really strange. An angel—no, an archangel—having a human child.'

Uriel said, "I'm not being sentimental. The fact that Ikael chose Hexa means she willingly abandoned Heaven."

Satiel felt her patience reach its limit.

"So what? That's exactly why you're angry right now. What are you trying to say?"

"Rather than what I want to say, I just never thought it was possible. That an angel could betray Heaven."

Rayel asked, "So you just let her go? Simply because... you couldn't understand?"

"I will fight Ikael."

Uriel turned around.

"But from now on, it won't be Heaven's battle—it will be mine. I will define this war solely by my own will."

While Satiel didn't understand, Rayel thought it was perhaps a natural outcome.

'Uriel is... though slow to act and poor at expressing opinions, she always seemed to do whatever Ikael wanted.'

'The one feeling the greatest sense of loss might not be Satiel, but Uriel.'

No, perhaps himself as well.

'Uriel has left. Now only Satiel and I remain as archangels. Then I am...'

Honestly, from the moment Ikael left, Rayel didn't want to choose anything either.

'That's what Ikael was.' The only direction in a directionless world, the only meaning for angels who didn't know the meaning of existence.

"You get lost too."

Satiel spat out.

"I don't need conflicted archangels. And you don't want to stay with me anyway, right?"

Rayel, who had been quietly watching Satiel, turned around without saying a word.

Watching Rayel disappear into the darkness, Satiel gritted her teeth.

"Those things call themselves angels?"

Her holy body began turning red again.

"What archangels! What most noble beings in the universe! In the end, they just envy humans!"

Her 2nd-rank Mara Galio extended a hand.

"Lady Satiel! You must preserve your holy body..."

"Ikael! Ikael! Ikael!"

Red tears welled up in Satiel's eyes.

"Why is it always Ikael? What's different between her and me! You forgive whatever Ikael does, but why not me!"

Looking back, she wondered if there had ever been another being in the world who received as much cosmic love as Ikael.

"From now on, I am the archangel."

Wiping her tears with her arm, she declared:

"All armies, listen! I will execute Ikael who betrayed Heaven! I am the most noble angel, the only being who will uphold Ankera's will!"

Though her voice rang out powerfully, only hollow echoes returned.

"I will massacre all humans that Ikael loves! I will restore the law!"

Watching his master burst into cries nearly resembling screams, Galio felt miserable too.

'No matter how much she shouts...'

Her voice couldn't shake the world like Ikael's could.

After washing up at the lodging, Sirone walked down the corridor where Amy's room was located.

Though it was past midnight, judging by the presence felt from within the rooms, others seemed unable to fall asleep easily either.

"Amy."

Amy, who came out after hearing the knock, guided him into her room with a smile tinged with warmth.

"Come in."

Sirone could sense the deep sadness remaining at the edge of her smile.

"I came because I was worried."

"I'm fine."

To her, Garcia was both a teacher and a benefactor who had made up the largest part of her life.

"I'm sad, but I won't cry. I've resolved not to. Because I don't want anyone to cry when I die."

She too seemed to be acutely aware that the war wasn't over yet.

"I met my mother."

While the other side of the planet was in broad daylight and incidents were erupting all over the world, this was the only story Sirone could share happily.

"Really? You mean your birth mother? Then perhaps..."

"Yes, it's Ikael. It's a bit awkward now, but it'll get better with time. I'll introduce you to her too."

Amy was as happy as if it were her own affair.

"Of course! How did it happen?"

Sitting side by side on the bed, the two shared everything they had experienced so far without omission.

When talking about Nane, Amy was careful too, but Sirone understood.

"I think that's probably how it was. I also reached this point by going through Nane's philosophy."

"Still, I feel bad about it. Honestly, I was shaken. Not by Nane, but by what Nane proposed. The reason I'm bringing this up is also because I feel like I'm committing a sin against you..."

"Yeah. I did that too. I left you and our friends for humanity's sake. That's how it is, Amy."

Sirone placed his hand on Amy's shoulder.

"What's difficult for me is also difficult for you. That's what the heart is, and now we know that."

Amy suddenly thought that Ultima might not be so far away after all.

"Sirone."

As moisture seeped into Amy's voice, Sirone turned to face her.

Though her hair burned by Hwama was short, that couldn't change who Amy was.

The silence lengthened, and that extended time seemed to push their faces from behind.

Just before their lips touched, the door burst open.

"Amy, what are you... Oh?"

At Tess's voice, the two who had startled apart turned red to their ears.

Tess grinned broadly.

"Sirone's here too. Did I interrupt?"

"Haha, no."

While Sirone waved his hands dismissively, Amy glared at Tess with half-closed eyes.

"You knew, so why ask?"

She couldn't be so oblivious as not to know Sirone was there.

Watching Amy's reaction fondly, Tess pointed outside the door with a hearty smile.

"Come out. Let's drink."

"At this hour? Aren't you tired?"

"All forces except the wounded, assemble in the dining hall—that's what Nade told me to tell you. We rarely get together like this, so we should at least give a welcome greeting. Ryan doesn't know the magic school friends well. Neither do I."

"Ah, that's right."

While Sirone was close to everyone, there were people among his friends who hadn't interacted much.

"Alright, let's go."

Heading to the dining hall, noisy sounds echoed in the corridor even before they arrived.

"Oh? It's Sirone, Sirone!"

Nade, who had already emptied two glasses of beer, stood up while chewing meat and puffed out his cheeks with laughter.

"Oh ho, you two came together after all? See, I told you so? I said they'd definitely be together."

As Amy's eyes filled with force upon finding the instigator, Nade clutched his stomach and laughed.

Dorothy brought over drinks and food.

"Thanks."

If Sirone hadn't come, Iruki might not exist in reality right now.

"No need for thanks. We fought together."

In the cheerful atmosphere, drinks continued flowing and everyone's faces flushed red.

However, even while everyone was sharing their war stories, Ryan just smiled alone while sipping his drink quietly.

"Nice to meet you."

Iruki spoke to Ryan in the seat next to him.

"I've heard a lot about you from Sirone. Of course, I also knew through hundreds of reports. Let's get along well."

Just as Ryan's beer glass was empty, Iruki picked up a bottle and extended it forward.

While everyone watched warmly, Ryan politely held out his glass with both hands.

A moment of awkward silence followed, and Iruki, not having expected this, stared at Ryan blankly.

Tess squinted and shook his head.

'Ugh, that frustrating guy.'

Sirone's friend.

Ryan thought that since they were his lord's friends, he couldn't treat them carelessly.

"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ryan, Sirone's knight. Please treat me well from now on."

Amy said, "Listen, Ryan. You don't need to go that far. We're all friends and similar in age."

"I'm sorry if I ruined the mood. But I can't be the first to commit a breach of etiquette."

Sirone smiled warmly.

'He's still tense.'

The reason for sharing war stories while borrowing liquid courage was to blow away combat stress.

But Ryan was different.

In a situation where he was protecting Sirone, he would absolutely never let his guard down.

While such a friend was reliable and trustworthy, Sirone was also of the mind that when it's time to play, you should play.

"Alright, Ryan. I'd like you to be comfortable. After all, we'll be fighting as one team."

Only then did Ryan accept the glass with one hand.

"Good, good! Let's drink until our noses are crooked today. Come on, let's toast. Cheers!"

After several more rounds, the table's topic shifted to the Ultima System.

Iruki asked, "What will you do? Honestly, the only breakthrough is the Ultima System, but is it really possible?"

Integrating humanity's consciousness.

"I have a few alternatives in mind. I plan to discuss them together when Miss Miro comes tomorrow."

Amy was shocked.

"You have alternatives?"

Apart from solutions, the very fact that alternatives existed was shocking.

"Yeah. Of course, they're not perfect."

"For instance?"

When Tess, who had been blowing a horn, asked, Sirone thought for a moment then stood up.

"Then I'll try it here once."

With everyone stopping their chatter to watch, Sirone brought his hands together and closed his eyes.

Light spread between his palms, eventually becoming a transparent radiance that blazed.

"Miracle Stream? What are you suddenly...?"

Sirone spread both arms, looked around at everyone, then said with mischievous eyes:

"Your sins..."

Light bursting from both palms filled the dining hall.

"I forgive."

"Ah..."

A moment of deep emotion arrived, and about 10 minutes later in the dining hall:

"Waaahhh!"

Nade was pouring out tears.

"I'm sorry. To think such love exists in this world. Not knowing that, I... I'll live virtuously. Waahhh!"

Iruki shouted in disgust.

"Ah, stop crying already! What sins did you commit in your life that the tears won't stop?"

Though it was Lightning God Reincarnation's doing:

"You bastard! You cried too! And who was it that looked at me and bawled in the temple? You're the crybaby!"

"...So much for living virtuously."

Sirone agreed.

"Haha, it's not that easy. But Agape's light purifies the human heart. Why this is important—I'll explain in tomorrow's official meeting, but it should help construct an integrated mental system."

Dorothy asked, "But isn't your opinion too technical? I was being moved and satisfied by the emotion."

Sirone smiled with his eyes.

"Given the situation. It's not about 'I hope this works out.' We absolutely must succeed. After tomorrow's meeting ends, I plan to make a pilgrimage around the world to spread this light."

"A pilgrimage?"

Nade and Iruki's eyes lit up simultaneously.
