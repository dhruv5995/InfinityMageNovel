The Age of History (4)

'Park Ji-kyung.'

After finishing his deal with Karatorsa, Guffin entered the reverse world through Choeuni Bardo.

The demon world was as vast as the real universe, but its internal terrain was completely different.

"This will be a treacherous journey."

The route Guffin chose to return to the planet with the maze was to cross the 72 hells.

It was the only path to meet him.

"Demon God Behemoth."

A being born when the demons of fallen angels, unlike human demons, flowed into the reverse world.

He was distinguished from other demons born from clear concepts by the fact that all kinds of emotions were mixed together within him.

"He is not subordinate."

Without even the horns that were the symbol of demons, he had wandered for long ages before settling on the planet of mazes.

Of course, this was by the standards of the reverse world.

"It's been a while. King of Beasts, Behemoth."

Before Guffin's eyes stood Behemoth, with a mountain-like massive body and seven symmetrically embedded eyes.

"Guffin, you came to see me?"

"I crossed the 72 hells. No matter how much I called, you wouldn't invite me. Did you avoid me on purpose?"

"...Hmph."

Behemoth turned his head coyly and raised his spear-long claws to point to the side.

"You look terrible. Sit down. Shall we have a drink after so long? I got some good liquor."

"I came because I have a favor to ask."

As Guffin sat in the bone chair and crossed his legs, Behemoth opened a bottle of liquor he had procured from reality.

"I know. I'm retired, but my influence still carries weight in the reverse world."

Behemoth had lived too long and had retired by blocking the demons that flowed into him.

Now he was just killing time doing the petty tasks that lower demons in the human world would do.

Even so, the demon race still recognized Behemoth as an elder second only to Lucifer.

"Try it. It's pretty good."

As Behemoth tilted the bottle with the tip of his claw, Guffin didn't refuse and lifted his glass.

"I had a child."

Behemoth paused for a moment, then filled the glass and poured liquor into his own glass as well.

"When? As far as I know..."

"Yes, she died. But she didn't die. Ikael and I are still connected."

Behemoth downed the liquor that was not even a drop compared to his massive size and said:

"Agape or whatever it's called? The ability to create life through signals of the heart?"

It was a word demons despised terribly, but the already retired Behemoth had no qualms about it.

"That's right. The child is already dead, but in Agape's ability, the physical body isn't important. However, there's one problem."

"What problem?"

"It won't be human."

Behemoth thought as he poured the liquor. According to the common knowledge he possessed, combining Hexar and Agape could manifest a human body.

"Is it a mental problem?"

Guffin nodded.

"That's right. Considering myself and Ikael, we're beings who have reached high levels by the standards of this world."

"Hmph, acting all noble."

Behemoth snorted, but didn't dig any deeper.

"You've watched countless human lives from the reverse world, so you know. Humans are beings who possess all tendencies of good, evil, emptiness, and love. They cry and then laugh, hurt and then feel happy. All these experiences blend together to help them find their own perspective called Idea. But my child who will be born..."

Behemoth muttered in a serious voice.

"Has no demon energy."

"Exactly that. I'm already a Gaian who has achieved an integrated mental system, and the child's mother is Ikael, the first concept of this world. There's no room for demon energy to interfere. So..."

Guffin brought up the main point.

"Become the demon energy for my child."

Behemoth turned his gaze from the liquor glass and fell into thought while looking at the landscape of the reverse world.

"But you know."

And he pointed at Guffin again.

"Isn't that too perfectionist? It would be fine to have one human without demon energy. That would be fitting for a child of you and Ikael. There's no need to obsess over the standard model."

"No, it's actually the opposite. What's perfect is Agape, not me. The integrated mental system of Gaians is completed through the experience of countless failures that current humanity is committing. Without that, one can never realize Ultima."

"The standard disappears."

"Exactly. True good isn't simply being kind, but the will to suppress the evil within. True love isn't foolishly giving everything away, but the resolve to throw everything away while knowing it's emptiness. If any of good, evil, emptiness, or love is lacking, humans cannot reach Idea."

"Those who don't understand evil cannot realize good either?"

"Something like that. Only within the circulation of good, evil, emptiness, and love can we finally approach humanity. And at the center of that humanity is Idea. Philosophy is merely a means. Ultimately, there is neither good nor evil, neither emptiness nor love."

Guffin smiled and shrugged his shoulders.

"Look even now. Because I've realized everything in this world, I'm even drinking with you, the greatest villain."

Behemoth turned his head and smacked his lips.

"I don't repent."

"That's why I'm asking you. And... such thoughts are childish now, aren't they?"

"Hmm."

Behemoth swept up all the liquor bottles beside him, put them in his mouth, and crunched them.

"So you're telling me to die. You sent Lucifer away, and now you want to bury me too?"

"The time has come. You know it."

Behemoth fell silent.

From the moment he blocked the demon energy himself, he had no attachment to living in this world.

"Will it be okay? Your child, I mean. For whatever reason, if you drag me out, I might tear the kid apart."

"If possible..."

Guffin grinned wickedly.

"Do it as hard as you can."

"Kekekekek."

Behemoth, shaking his massive body, poured liquor into both his and Guffin's glasses and said:

"When the time comes, call me. For the first and last time, I'll come out to greet you."

The glasses clinked together.

The place Guffin headed to after returning to heaven was where he had dreamed honeymoon dreams with Ikael.

It was a devastating scene.

Memories of that time came flooding back, making his heart feel like it was tearing apart, but it was probably because he had been that happy.

"That's why I chose this place."

The place where Ikael had held their newborn child and shown the happiest smile in the world.

A hexagon of Hexar rose above Guffin's palm and dissolved into smoke of light.

Ikael's tears, which he had preserved for a long time, floated before his eyes, emitting a clear light.

"The probability is fifty-fifty."

It wasn't a technical problem.

Agape, a type of Hexar, was a miraculous ability that combined hearts to give birth to life.

If Ikael didn't love Guffin, the two signals would never merge.

"It's okay even if you don't remember me."

They were connected by heart.

"So, Ikael."

As Guffin spread his arms, Ikael's tears contained in the Miracle Stream flew up into the sky.

"I love you."

The greatest love in the universe, Agape.

The Miracle Stream exploded in the form of a cross, connecting the ends of the universe.

Sirone endlessly savored the miracle that occurred in that instant through Guffin's perspective.

"Ah..."

The light literally filled the universe and condensed at a speed incomprehensible to living beings.

Guffin's heart as he looked up at the white light floating in the sky was transmitted directly.

"Ikael."

The success of Agape was clear proof that she still loved him.

"Thank you."

He had thrown his everything and received her everything.

"Our child."

The moment Guffin, with tears welling up, saw the special shadow forming within the white light.

'This is Hexar.'

Omega's transmission ended.

While Sirone was savoring his birth process, Karatorsa's voice was heard.

"The information you've received so far represents all the events that occurred in the first universe. And now..."

New Omega flooded in.

"What's this?"

It was a log that restarted as many times as the universe had been reset.

'Amazing.'

While it was vast information by human standards, compared to the entire universe, the changed events were less than 0.1 percent.

'Even in Guffin's erased state, the original history is being preserved almost perfectly.'

After the reset, Ankera had used any means necessary to eliminate his error.

The battle between the angels following his will and the apostles protecting time was transmitted through the 11th sense.

"Phew."

With the Mudeungryong's sigh, all of Omega's records were finally transferred to Sirone.

Karatorsa, seemingly without the strength to raise her head, lowered her posture and placed her chin on the ground.

Sirone waited for her.

And only after a long while did Karatorsa raise her head again and speak.

"While receiving the logs of the Akashic Records, I couldn't do anything. Not only because it's actually impossible, but because if it were to fall into the hands of another being, the balance of the universe would tilt drastically."

Sirone understood.

How tremendous the responsibility was.

And also the sense of liberation Karatorsa must be feeling at this moment.

"Whatever being will govern this world from now on, the age of gods will meet its end. It will either close or continue. That is exactly what Guffin defined as Omega Year 999."

It was the end of an era.

"And the logs I can transmit end here. Because history consists of events that have passed."

Sirone, or rather Hexar, did not appear in Omega.

"If you learn the logs after your birth, it will no longer be your life. You won't be able to remain as you are now."

Sirone had reached Ultima by gaining enlightenment through countless anguishes.

'But if I learn the logs, the basis for judgment will collapse. In other words, my level of enlightenment will be broken.'

If Sirone were to know all the events and hearts of the countless people and friends he had met throughout his life.

'I won't be able to view the world from my current perspective.'

This was enough.

The library of knowledge prepared in the depths had transformed into a perfect 5-dimensional cube.

'Everything in the universe is contained within.'

Since he had absorbed the workings of particles in their entirety, the formulas and definitions that academic disciplines spoke of were unnecessary.

Sirone spread his palm in front of his eyes.

'When I think of something.'

The 5-dimensional cube, a spacetime integrated entity, rotated to find what was needed from infinite capacity.

'The time it takes is...'

None.

Within the 5-dimensional cube, time was a manipulable physical quantity.

'Combine that omniscience with Hexar.'

A hexagonal light rose from Sirone's palm and shattered with a clear sound.

"When I throw my whole heart."

The smoke of light rotated and became a flower that didn't exist on the planet, beginning to grow on his palm.

As Karatorsa stared intently, Sirone slowly raised his hand.

The flower that flew into the air scattered into tens of thousands of lights and poured down like a fountain.

Colorful flowers bloomed on the hard ground, and soon the cave was filled with floral fragrance.

Sirone smiled and said:

"A miracle occurs."

The brain of God.

This was the principle behind the activation of Miracle Stream.
