The Age of Struggle (3)

Caden's sword was vibrating at a terrifying speed in front of Shirone's nape.

There was an endless feeling of something being compressed, but it never reached Shirone.

'A hair's breadth difference.'

The moment Caden's switch truly turned, the law would break his will.

"Hexa's ability, Agape, can't completely cure emotional disease either. You might feel better right now, but if you don't solve the problem, an even more terrible disaster will just occur."

They couldn't fight against the demon race and heaven's army while depending on someone else's ability.

"Is that the reason? Was Maya only that much to you? If you had seen her directly with your own two eyes..."

"My conclusion would be the same."

Amy gulped at his cold answer.

"Save them because they're friends. Then how do you set that standard? People who spent more than a certain amount of time with me? People who helped me? Or should I line them up in order of who I like?" 

Caden understood Shirone's words, but his heart was still rebelling.

'Maya.'

When he heard Shirone's name, her terrified expression flickered before his eyes.

"So you can't help Maya?"

"I have one standard for emotional disease. I only help as part of a strategy that can stabilize this world the fastest."

"Maya is a strong person."

Caden truly thought so.

"Fighting isn't the only strategy. Her songs can move people. She has enough recognition too. You can't say she's not included in your plan, can you?"

"Last night, Iruki almost died."

Amy looked back at Shirone with a surprised expression.

"But thanks to that, we eliminated a powerful evil. Amazing results. Ned also fought risking his life. My friend Ryan is wandering through hell in the agony of burning flames."

"...What are you trying to say? You think Maya can't do that?"

"No."

Shirone lowered Caden's sword.

"If I asked for help, Maya would do it no matter what. Is that really what you want?"

"When Iruki cast Overdrive, I knew but didn't stop him. Rather, I developed the fight with even that in mind. That's exactly it. What I need are comrades who can plot death together with me, not people I have to take responsibility for every time there's danger. And for such comrades, emotional disease must naturally be suppressed to have the strongest training ability."

"Maya is..."

Shirone cut him off.

"Caden, you don't have the right either. Do you even know what war is? Do you know what happens to women captured by demons? Maya is a precious friend. That's why I didn't send her to the battlefield."

Caden couldn't argue back.

"A holy war will open soon. Not only Tormia, but the still-standing kingdoms will compete for supremacy. There are already rumors of countries that have joined hands with demons or colluded with heaven's army. Listen well, Caden. The world is moving too fast and frantically beyond any prediction."

Only Shirone was drawing the whole picture.

"I'm not forcing you. If you don't want to care, just stay locked up in your room. Fight your emotional disease and wait quietly until others produce results."

"What should I do?"

The Shirone that Caden knew wasn't the type to ramble on without a solution.

"You said there was a reason you brought me. If Maya can be happy, I can do anything."

"Protect Maya."

It was the one thing Caden couldn't do.

"By any means necessary, even if it means cutting her out of your heart, protect her."

"And then?"

"I'll suppress Maya's emotional disease. She'll probably be able to sing again. Soon the holy war will become a battlefield that condenses all the world's situations. There will be times when Maya is needed. But I can't protect her."

Caden had to protect her.

"I just need to give up on Maya. Truly, so I can never love her forever."

"I don't think your heart is trivial. No, it's actually really important. But the end of an era is coming. If you want to take responsibility for someone, you need to be prepared to take responsibility for the world."

"Yeah, I understand."

If only Maya could sing again, what did his own emotions matter?

"Go bring Maya."

Caden's eyes, as he sheathed his sword and went down to the basement, had less life than before.

Amy sent him a pitying look, but in reality, she wouldn't be any different.

Shirone had suppressed her emotional disease too.

'Comrades.'

For humanity's victory, both Amy and Shirone would willingly choose death.

'It's okay. At least I can fight together. Shirone is by my side now.'

That must be what it meant - if you want to take responsibility for someone, you must take responsibility for the world.

Shirone said:

"Caden will do well."

If his feelings for Maya weren't obsession, love had the power to sacrifice oneself.

"Let's wait until Maya comes."

Because Shirone's smile was sad, Amy nodded more cheerfully than usual.

Caden, who returned to the bar, heard from the owner that Maya had left work.

"If you're lying to me..."

"It's true! What more would I gain by lying here? Please believe me!"

The owner, grabbed by the collar by Caden, was struggling.

'Damn! What rotten luck.'

He had known this day would come ever since that big shot Maya came for an audition.

Nevertheless, the reason he hired her was because personal feelings were involved beyond business strategy.

Because there was no more entertaining amusement than watching a world-class singer fall.

Caden threw the owner to the floor and went up on stage to exit through the back door.

'She should be at home.'

Since he got directions, he planned to visit the inn where she was staying.

The owner got up abruptly and spat.

"Ptooey! Some damn beggar comes in and..."

He had made a tidy profit using Maya, but now money wasn't the issue.

Like an addiction, the time when he had Maya as an employee stimulated his mind.

"Tch! If I knew this would happen, I should have at least tried touching her."

Crunch, crunch.

The sound of chewing hard peanuts came from a corner of the shop.

"What? Who's there?"

The owner squinted and looked, seeing a man still sitting at a table.

"The shop's ruined. We're closed. Get out quickly."

"...Not Yahweh."

"What?"

At the inhuman, raspy voice, the owner frowned and approached.

"What are you? If you're drunk... Gack!"

A fork flying from the darkness struck the owner's forehead, and his body flew to the stage.

In the silence, the being in the darkness spoke.

"This will disrupt the plan."

He pushed back his chair and stood, walking toward the wall with his hands in his pockets.

The moment he touched the wall, black smoke rose from his body and instantly penetrated the material.

Pulling his hood deep down and mixing into the crowd, he headed for the city square.

In a place where even the fountain was broken and muddy water flowed, dozens of people had gathered.

"Everyone, repent."

At the center, a man with a short goatee wearing priest's robes was preaching.

"God loves you all. The pain you're experiencing now is also a test God has given. So..."

"Stop spouting nonsense!"

A shabbily dressed man holding a bottle shouted.

"Just how many gods are there? Do you know what happened to the guys who came here spouting that crap? They all got pelted with stones and ran! God? I'm in pain every day, so what's changed? I lost my child, my wife, my house - I'm all alone! What can God possibly do for someone like me?"

People didn't have the energy or motivation to cheer along, but their eyes held coldness.

The priest watched the man for a moment, then smiled thinly and nodded.

"Anything. If you believe in God, He can do anything for you. A good house, a more wonderful wife, even take away your pain."

Only then did people start to stir.

"Really? This damn disease will really be cured?"

Countless religious people had preached in this place, but this was the first time they'd heard such blatant doctrine.

The priest nodded contentedly.

"Of course."

A gauntly thin woman asked:

"Who is this god? What kind of god?"

"The name isn't important. You've probably heard many gods' names. But in fact, God has no name. All the gods you know are actually the identity of the God I want to tell you about."

It was absurd, but plausible.

"Then prove it! If it's God, you should be able to restore everything I've lost!"

"Very well. Come to me."

When he immediately agreed, the atmosphere heated up and life returned to people's eyes.

As the man approached with a half-believing expression, the priest put his hand on his shoulder and said:

"Are you ready to follow God's doctrine?"

"Of course. As long as you cure my disease. Ah, no, it's not just because of that..."

"Haha, it's fine. God is merciful. Of course He should make your wishes come true. A god who only gives pain while demanding obedience is fake."

"Then, then I'll believe. What should I do?"

Hearing the man's words, which had changed to respectful speech, the priest met his gaze and said:

"Do what you want."

"What?"

"Listen to your heart's voice. What do you want? Do you want to have a house? Hold a wonderful woman, have countless treasures?"

The man answered as if bewitched by something.

"...Yes."

"Do it."

The priest pointed around.

"If there's a house you want, that's your house. If there's a woman you like, take her. If she ignores you, hit her. You don't need to worry about anything. Under God's existence, you are perfectly safe."

"Even so..."

Honestly, it wasn't unpleasant to hear.

After losing everything to emotional disease, who had ever given him such comfort?

"Watch carefully. This is God."

The priest took out an inverted cross pendant from around his neck and held it before his eyes.

"Were you tormented in the pain given by false gods? That is sin. The true God doesn't make you hurt. Repent. Seek forgiveness."

The man shed tears.

"I was foolish. God, please hear my prayer."

The priest turned the man around.

"Now, take from those who believe in false gods. Don't worry. God has remembered your face, so now you can enjoy everything. You have become a king."

"I, I'm a king."

As the man started walking, frightened people began to slowly back away.

"Ah, ahh..."

Seeing faces full of terror, a terrible impulse rose in his chest.

"It's all mine!"

Among the fleeing people, one woman was grabbed by the hair by the man.

"Give it up! This too, this too!"

He seized a shabby cloak that helped endure the dawn cold and a leftover piece of bread.

For those who had given up many things according to behavioral guidelines, these were more precious than anything.

"No! I have nothing else to eat!"

"Shut up!"

As the man raised his fist, the woman made a shrieking sound and covered her face with both arms.

"Ha, haah."

The man breathing roughly finally realized what he had gained.

"Bread. Plus the cloak - now it's my cloak."

To think he could obtain something so easily.

"Oh, God."

As the man put the bread in his mouth and chewed, saliva dripped out.

"It's delicious, God. It's delicious."

Realizing something, the man made a shocked expression and looked back at the priest.

"It doesn't hurt. The emotional disease..."

According to behavioral guidelines, one should categorize food types and give them up one by one.

However, for survival, one last food item should be kept.

For the woman, it was bread; for the man, it was alcohol.

"I ate bread but it doesn't hurt. This can't be! The disease is really cured!"

The moment they heard those words, the fleeing people turned around with shocked expressions.
