The Meaning of the Incident (4)

Yufra, who had collapsed against the wall, glared at Shirone with fierce eyes.

"Grrrrrr!"

Growling like a beast, he raised his sword again and charged.

Shirone fell into thought.

'Is the human heart free from the laws?'

The Veron problem.

Looking at gold fallen on the ground, having a beautiful person of the opposite sex before your eyes, holding tremendous power in your hands...

'How many would remain unshaken?'

A world controlled by laws.

And now the cold god was directly intervening in causes, manipulating humans.

'Oupaths.'

A human who has lost their heart is nothing but an object.

"Yahweh, you are an error."

Therefore, even the words being spoken now were transmitted by the god manipulating Yufra's cause.

Cold sweat broke out.

'Within the overlap of incidents, Yufra would have endlessly chosen life. But in the end, he couldn't produce results beyond becoming a tool of god and became an Oupath.'

There was only one reason.

'Because he's an animal of desire.'

Because he cannot choose displeasure, because he cannot die, because he doesn't want to yield.

'His own desires clash with others' desires, and that process eventually becomes predictable laws...

Calculated by god.'

'You can manipulate the human heart? We're nothing but tools of the laws?'

The moment the blade touched Shirone's neck, abundant light pushed Yufra aside.

As he crashed into the wall with a thud, the light's smoke gradually transformed into the shape of a hand and pressed him down.

"Don't talk nonsense. I'm not an error. As long as I exist, the Veron problem remains valid."

Because he could never be wrong.

Yufra said nothing.

Though god manipulated him through laws, it didn't possess the ability to interpret essence.

"Yahweh."

The light went out of Yufra's eyes.

"You are an error."

Like a machine stopping its operation, his head completely dropped down.

'Death.'

No, was it disconnection?

As he dispelled the Hand of God, Yufra's body collapsed while standing.

Having confirmed the result of Oupath with his own eyes, Shirone turned his gaze to the fallen Glen.

"Please save Glen. Please..."

'He's not an Oupath.'

He came close to it, but with Lucia's appearance, he hadn't completely lost his heart.

"Let me take a look first."

His joints were twisted by the devil's left hand, but because he pulled his hand away quickly, nothing was broken.

Shirone restored his vitality with Miracle Stream and infused the light of Agape.

"Krrrrr! I'll kill you, Lucia. I'll kill you."

Shirone shook his head.

"Even Yahweh cannot change Glen's cause. He experienced countless incidents, and through that process, he reached this state by his own will."

Shirone, who still believed in the power of the heart, didn't want to say he was controlled by god.

"It's difficult to completely deny the life you've lived. But in the end, only you yourself can change your heart. We have no choice but to trust Glen."

Lucia shed tears.

"I saw it too. Glen's past, what emotions High Priest Maximus treated me with."

Shirone told her the news that Maximus had died in the village of heaven.

"I see. I don't know anymore. I trusted Glen. Love... it doesn't seem to be only beautiful."

"It is beautiful."

Shirone said while supporting Glen.

"What that emotion is called isn't important. What matters is the heart that carries it through."

"The heart that carries it through..."

"If you truly love Glen, don't give up. Then whatever it is, it will be beautiful."

Lucia, who seemed to realize something, stood up.

"Now I understand why I didn't become like Glen or Yufra. I had to come here."

'Come to think of it...'

Though incident overlap occurred inside the pyramid, Lucia's cause didn't change.

"I see."

There was only one reason.

"To god, you're already a completed result, Lucia. Meeting Ares, Glen bringing you here - none of it was coincidence. But... why?"

Why did god need Lucia?

"The devil's left hand."

It was a sudden change that came to her who had performed miracles with god's right hand.

Lucia shouted.

"I think I know how to meet god! Please find the people!"

This must be why god called Shirone here.

'You intend to use me as a tool too. But things won't go according to your calculations.'

He seemed to hear a hallucination.

Save yourself from the terrible truth.

"Alright, let's go."

Following behind Shirone, Lucia looked at Glen's unconscious face.

'No one can help. You have to do it, Glen. I won't waver either.'

Green Ocean.

The elves' weapon against the fairy invasion was nature's great flood itself.

Giant trees swung their branches like whips and rock golems trampled small bodies.

Kuuuuuung!

The fairy forces hesitated at the terrible sound.

"Tch! The resistance isn't easy."

"We expected this much. More importantly, we need to focus on capturing test subjects."

Crown wanted elves.

"That's only if we break through this strange forest. Cowardly bastards. Hiding behind nature."

"The fire tribe or whatever, they have tremendous abilities. They're controlling the entire flood."

Then a majestic vibration was heard.

"Not yet?"

When the fairies looked back, Uriel the Archangel of Destruction was approaching with large strides.

"Ah, Archangel."

He said while spinning his Gokrakgon.

"Stand back."

Before even hearing an answer, Uriel charged into the forest and struck the ground with his Gokrakgon.

'Cheonboryun.'

Hundreds of meters of forest radius exploded.

"Hrrrrgh!"

Fire tribe chief Protea crouched down at the same time the seismic wave arrived.

Elf chief Enox approached.

"What happened?"

"The small world creation was temporarily cut off. The archangel's power is too fierce."

Most fire tribe members died in the demon war, with only a dozen maintaining their lineage.

Flarino, who was controlling the river to extinguish the forest fire, spoke in despair.

"We'll be pushed back at this rate. Why doesn't Yahweh come? Are we truly... unable to enter human life?"

"That's not true, Flarino."

Enox said.

"We must save ourselves. The heart that fights and struggles like humans - without that heart, even if Yahweh comes, nothing will change. We'll just become livestock."

"But..."

"Humans were afraid too. Humans suffered too. Without overcoming that, we can't reach it."

The center of the world.

"Come! Let's go, elves! How long will we bear the disgrace of being called cowards by fairies!"

Three hundred elves agreed with their eyes.

"All troops advance...!"

Before Enox could finish speaking, a tremendous shockwave pushed to within 100 meters.

"Krgh!"

When he blew away the dust with wind magic, the massive Uriel was approaching.

'Tremendous power...'

Among those with will, probably one of the few greatest forces in the universe.

"Why do you interfere in a battle between species?"

Like Yahweh, archangels had no reason to interfere in the conflict between elves and fairies.

"Well."

Uriel lowered his stance.

"Because I too am a species?"

Just lowering his posture gave the feeling of watching an explosion.

As the elves' faces turned pale, Enox also felt dizzy.

"End the war."

The fairies shouted.

"Lord Uriel! The elves must be kept alive..."

Before the words finished, Uriel was already charging, swinging his Gokrakgon.

'Is this the end...'

As Enox fell into despair, a man struck Uriel's side directly.

With a bang, Uriel flew away as elves and fairies looked stunned.

"...Who are you?"

A handsome man in a gray coat, with curly hair and peculiar steel-like eyes.

"Gold Dragon Metira."

Then a sonic boom was heard as the remaining 12 apostles landed simultaneously.

"Ah."

Enox's eyes reddened.

'Yes, Yahweh hasn't abandoned us.'

Poison Dragon Poine smiled with her eyes.

"It's against the rules for another species to interfere where species fight for their fate. Isn't that right, Uriel?"

He walked, shaking the ground with each step.

"Uninvited guests."

The blonde boy sitting in the center of the 12 apostles, Light Dragon Phaeton, split his lips in a grin.

"Why? Suddenly scared? Don't worry. Someone like you is enough for me alone."

"One-twelfth."

Uriel raised his right arm.

"Fighting with one arm would balance things. I can even put away the Gokrakgon if you want."

"Hehehe! Hehehehe!"

Half of Phaeton's face, frozen in a laughing expression, transformed into dragon form.

"You, come here, brat."

When Uriel beckoned with his hand, light burst from the boy's eyes.

"This damn..."

Before Phaeton could launch himself, Fire Dragon Infercus rushed at Uriel.

"Take some hits."

Her body in leather tights caught fire, turning the area into a sea of flames.

Enox, casting water magic, gritted his teeth.

'Now it begins.'

The war between elves and fairies.

Whichever side won this war would be absorbed into humanity and change the world's future.

'Who will carry it through?'

The results of the species war were still accumulating at information's destination through the filter of laws.

Apocalypse.

When the earth suddenly shook, Shirone's excavation team looked around.

"What's that?"

The vibration wasn't strong, but it felt like the entire world was changing.

"Shirone! This!"

The artifact in Marsha's hands began to rust and rapidly deteriorate.

"A new future is accumulating. At tremendous speed."

Shirone bit his lip.

'That means the change in laws is rapid. What major variable was applied?'

Time's sedimentation process.

With current events all being pushed into the past, the excavation team tensed up.

"Is it, is it over?"

A completely different Apocalypse world from before the earthquake awaited them.

"...It's clean."

Instead of the messy landscape with building debris, a state-of-the-art mechanical city stood.

Marsha asked.

"So who won? Elves? Fairies? Who built this city?"

Seven androids emerged from between buildings.

"Huh?"

They had egg-shaped heads with black LCD screens on the front, and silver metallic bodies.

'Like High Gears.'

They all wore identical monk robes with electronic prayer beads around their necks and hands.

"Sentient beings detected."

The androids turned simultaneously.

"Tch! We've been spotted."

As the Parrot Mercenary Group grew wary, Sanskrit characters raced vertically across the androids' LCD screens.

"Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form."

Shirone was more surprised by the depth of enlightenment written on their screens than their cold mechanical voices.

'Buddha?'

Marsha asked like someone who really needed to go to the bathroom.

"Shirone, these are enemies, right? Right? Please tell me they're enemies. So I can run away without looking back."

"Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form."

Humanity's final evolutionary stage.

Final Type Jet (Z).
