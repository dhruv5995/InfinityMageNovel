[593] That Day's Incident (4)

"Huh!"

Lukang's eyes widened at the incomprehensible situation.

Meanwhile, his colleagues' faces returned to calm composure.

'Yolga...'

Yolga is a good person.

"If you want..."

Yolga guided Lukang's hand to her chest, but his hand couldn't bring itself to grope her body.

"Wh-what are you doing? Don't you feel sorry for your husband?"

Lukang hastily pulled away from the kiss and stared at Yolga's face with a dazed expression.

Seeing her cry with a face that held all the world's sorrow, his mind went blank.

"I'm truly sorry."

Yolga is such a good person.

'Benevolence incarnate.'

Edgar looked down at Yolga's back with a sense of wonder.

If Miro possessed inhuman determination to achieve her goals, then Yolga possessed eerily abnormal kindness.

'That's also why we devoted our lives to Yolga.'

That's why they could willingly enter Istas's upper echelons together.

Lukang's face, which had been staring blankly at Yolga, turned tearful.

"I'm sor..."

A voice that had reached death's door leaked out.

"I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry."

Yolga doesn't calculate emotions.

"It's okay. Everything is my fault. Please resent me."

That's why she can embrace all ugliness.

'Absolute sincerity. Can a human without an ounce of pretense truly exist?'

That was exactly what the woman named Yolga was.

Lukang kept uttering apologies as he breathed his last.

Though it appeared to be a beautiful scene, his colleagues knew the taste of his tears.

They weren't tears of repentance, nor regret for spitting at Yolga.

'If evil brings fear by surpassing human courage, then extreme good is also terrifying.'

Lukang had been overwhelmed by the fear that pure goodness clearly conveyed.

"Yolga, here."

Mustang, her friend and colleague, handed her a handkerchief sprayed with perfume.

"Thank you."

After wiping the spit from her face, Yolga pulled her hood halfway down and stood up.

"Let's go. We need to find Miro."

Inspector Nine said.

"We just failed to persuade Miro earlier. If we meet again, we'll have no choice but to fight."

"...It can't be helped."

Determination etched itself on Yolga's face.

"But I'll persuade her to the end. Miro is my sister."

"..."

The reason his colleagues remained silent was that Miro, like Yolga, was a person with a clear identity.

"Let's hurry. Before the time loop closes completely."

Just then, the warehouse door burst open and his colleagues simultaneously took combat positions.

But their expressions soon became blank, and among them, Mustang placed her hand on her slender waist and asked.

"What, who are you?"

Sirone, who had been rushing toward the research society, also stopped when he discovered Yolga's group.

"You are..."

If they were Mars, he would have to prepare for battle.

"We're not enemies."

Fortunately, Yolga approached first, showing no hostility.

She was a woman beautiful enough to make his heart race, but there was an eerie feeling from somewhere in the back of his mind.

'She looks kind, but something's strange.'

He had met countless good people so far, but this was the first time he felt this way.

"Nice to meet you. I'm called Yolga."

She was Fermi's mother.

'So this person is Yolga.'

Sirone recalled Anchal's words.

The person who opposed Guffin's preparation of a successor and departure, dispatched to stop Miro.

'Except for height, she really resembles Fermi.'

Could people of the same nature be divided to such extremes?

Even her chillingly kind smile reminded him of Fermi.

"Who are you?"

"Ah."

Sirone realized he had delayed too long and clasped Yolga's hand.

"I'm called Sirone."

Yolga tilted her head curiously at the unfamiliar name.

Looking only at their current physical ages, there wasn't much difference between Sirone and her, so feeling excited was unavoidable.

'What am I thinking.'

Though not a friend, wasn't she Fermi's mother?

"I see, Sirone. How did you get in here?"

Only then did Sirone realize that Yolga was still looking at the core issue.

He had been so innocent that he had forgotten even the current situation.

'Let me focus.'

In any case, from now on it was a delicate matter.

Now that he realized Hexa was himself, Yolga's group was also an enemy targeting his life.

"You're hiding something. It's okay. Won't you tell me?"

'What's with this person?'

She had a similar scent to Miro.

"You know me. But I don't know you. Perhaps you're someone from the future. If the time loop has opened again."

Even though he hadn't said a word yet, Yolga kept drilling toward the core.

It felt like her voice had become a drill, eating into his mind as it entered.

"It's okay. I'm not asking to harm you. However, if you really came from the future, there's one thing I want to ask."

When Sirone made eye contact with Yolga for the first time, along with a thrill piercing his heart, he realized one fact.

'I see. This person has also transcended human boundaries.'

Yolga asked.

"Do I die here?"

Sirone didn't know how long he kept his mouth shut, yet faced the fact that he couldn't hide it forever.

"Yes."

That much was true.

"Though nothing is known about the death of a person named Yolga, certainly in the future where I live, you don't exist."

"I see. Conversely, that means Miro ultimately succeeds."

Contrary to expectation, Yolga wasn't disappointed.

Though it was puzzling how she could be so composed even knowing her own death, Sirone had more important matters remaining.

"Can you stop here?"

Yolga emerged from her thoughts.

"Stop meaning?"

"Ms. Miro will save this world in the future. Though not a perfect victory, her judgment was correct."

Regardless of Hexa's death, Sirone conveyed the facts as they were.

Unlike Yolga who nodded as if convinced, Mustang's face reddened.

"Hmph, that's just Miro's future. If it were Yolga, she might be able to end the war with Heaven."

The same emotion was contained in Edgar and Nine's eyes.

'Guffin is absolutely necessary, but even if he leaves, Yolga should become the savior.'

If it were Yolga, she could surely achieve human unification and fight Heaven with full strength.

She was the material with the qualities to become an unprecedented king of the world in human history.

"Alright, Sirone."

Because Yolga was a good person, she didn't hate Sirone.

"Even so, the fact that you came here must have a special reason. Is this world in danger again?"

Though not an exact answer, Yolga's insight was indeed extraordinary.

"I can't answer about that."

If Yolga, having realized the future, actively stepped forward, the upper echelon incident would become uncontrollably tangled.

"Don't worry. I've already prepared for death. Instead, I'll ask one favor. Please take me to Miro."

"To Ms. Miro?"

"Yes. And you will compare me and Miro. Who should remain for this world."

"But I'm not qualified for that."

"No. You came from the future. Also, if you think Miro is more necessary than me..."

Yolga always speaks only sincerely.

"I will take my own life."

"Yolga! What are you saying!"

His colleagues all shouted at once, but she was firm.

"I didn't come here without preparation either. Guffin is still necessary to us. And Miro is my beloved sister. If Miro becomes the successor, everyone she loves will suffer."

The fact that all clan members except Miro were secretly eliminated was no longer a secret 19 years later.

"How about it? Can you make a difficult decision for this world?"

"I..."

Sirone hesitated.

Since Hexa's life was in danger, he should refuse, but conversing with Yolga made him feel like even life didn't matter.

'Yolga is sincere.'

Not 99.99 percent, but 100 percent sincerity had the power to move human hearts.

"Alright. I'll make the judgment."

Perhaps having the choice might be much better for Hexa's future too.

"Where is Miro?"

"I know."

She would be at the Supernatural Psychic Research Society.

Though no one could know how the incident would twist, it was certain that Miro would definitely come there.

<Incident Coordinates>

Time: 0:32 AM.
Space: Istas Warehouse 71.

"Search thoroughly! Everyone scatter!"

Following Mars Captain Nickel's orders, forces from teams 1 through 4 split like parting water.

"Damn! We're in the most danger!"

Team 1's leader was dissatisfied with this.

Though they were praised as elite, the fact that Team 1 was the shield was known to everyone.

"Regroup on the 2nd floor!"

The seven members scattered in all directions, and Lukang also turned toward the west area he was assigned to cover.

"What?"

The moment he separated from his colleagues to move to the next warehouse, a lycanthrope with a black mask covering his face suddenly appeared.

'An enemy?'

When Lukang reflexively swung his main weapon, a chain sickle, the lycanthrope instantly moved to the side with a crackling sound.

'A mage. Electric type. Who is it?'

His skills were considerable.

Lukang immediately took a ready stance, whirling his chain and holding the sickle diagonally.

"Reveal your identity."

'Damn, what the hell is going on?'

Lycanthrope was irritated.

He needed to put <The Jaeger Family's Final Scream> in the safe of the warehouse Fermi had designated, but at some point, Istas's structure had started changing.

'Fighting these guys isn't profitable.'

Though he had never heard of a unit called Mars, from what Fermi had told him, they were clearly skilled fighters from the kingdom.

'Then...'

Lycanthrope drew the dagger from his waist.

Seeing the silver blade charged with electricity, Lukang's eyes flashed.

'An assassin.'

An assassin who uses magic at that.

"Insolent bastard."

Though Lukang wasn't very old either, he was a skilled fighter who had never fallen behind others in talent since childhood.

As two people with distinct specialties clashed head-on, spine-chilling attacks continued.

The chain sickle changed trajectory following natural law, and the warehouse flashed with Lycanthrope's lightning.

In an energy saturation state that seemed ready to explode, Lycanthrope's dagger flew and embedded in the wall.

Lukang, who had activated his schema's sensory function to the maximum, caught Lycanthrope's rear with exquisite movement.

'It's over.'

A perfectly measured cut with no margin of error flew toward Lycanthrope's nape.

'Certainly tremendous skill. But...'

The corner of Lycanthrope's mouth under his mask curled up.

'Too old-fashioned.'

Though it was normally a strike impossible to react to, if it was the standard for assassins from 19 years ago, it was something Lycanthrope had learned since childhood.

Without even looking back, he ducked his head and Lukang's sickle grazed past his head.

'Take this.'

All the daggers that responded to Lycanthrope's current were drawn out and rushed toward Lukang.

The warehouse shook from the exploding lightning, and in the rising smoke, Lukang wrinkled his nose.

"Petty tricks..."

Lycanthrope's figure had already disappeared.

"Damn! I'm late for assembly time!"

The other colleagues had probably already searched their assigned areas and arrived on the 2nd floor.

But Lukang didn't yet know that these 15 minutes delayed by the battle with Lycanthrope had ultimately saved his life.
