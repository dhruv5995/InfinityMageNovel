Age of Struggle (1)

"Kiiiiiiii!"

The hallucination that only Seina could hear before was now audible to everyone.

The black droplets forcibly expelled from Seina's heart coalesced into an evil form and swirled through the air.

"Wh-what is that thing?"

It was massive enough to cover the sky, and Seina's subordinates had never seen anything like it in their lives.

"Evil, you say?"

The reason they felt such particular terror was that the object in the sky was human emotion—the feelings of living flesh and blood.

Something everyone carries deep within themselves.

'I'm not afraid.'

Only Seina gazed at the form of evil with an utterly calm mind.

'It seems like something unrelated to me. I don't even doubt that it could harm me.'

Since it wasn't in her heart, there was no fear.

Of course, doubt would sprout again as she lived on, but for her, this was a miraculous phenomenon.

The emotion of prejudice swirled like a whirlwind before finally scattering into the concept of chaos.

'The Yahweh of this age.'

Seina turned to look at Shirone.

Seeing eyes that contained no trace of hatred made her heart waver, but she soon shook her head.

'I cannot accept it!'

Accepting Shirone would be tantamount to denying the existence of the one true god, Crea.

'I was simply weak! All humans exist beneath God. A human cannot become a god.'

She snapped back.

"Don't think you've won with this. Our doctrine is more devout and sacred than you can imagine."

Shirone, who didn't want to get more entangled with the Lamie religion than necessary, thought this was enough.

"Tell your subordinates to stop the suicide. Meaningless sacrifice must be prevented."

"It's not suicide, it's martyrdom. And this can't be helped. Though not coercive, we've been taught from birth not to submit to evil."

"Then..."

As Shirone stepped toward the holy knights, the Prejudice of 5 o'clock raised her voice even louder.

"Kill Yahweh! Yahweh will kill your families and steal your beloved lovers. That Yahweh is the absolute evil that should not exist in this world."

Doubt rose again in Seina's heart, but the energy of baptism still remained.

However, the other holy knights couldn't contain their anger and raised their heads almost simultaneously.

"Oh God! I offer this body to you!"

"There's no need to die."

Shirone, who had reached the center of the formation, spoke.

"What that woman said is true. So it's fine if you attack me."

"Shirone! What are you doing!"

Nade shouted, but no answer came back.

'This is the only way.'

When the evil in Seina's heart was expelled, Shirone felt it with his 11th sense.

Evil comparable to Satan.

'Even Eden felt fear from that emotion. At least Seina's level of faith is required.'

"Hyaaaah!"

As prejudice was confirmed as fact, the holy knights all drew their swords and charged at once.

"How foolish! Stop immediately...!"

Seina, who had been rushing toward her subordinates, widened her eyes with a blank expression.

Each time the divine-powered blades swung, Shirone's upper body created multiple afterimages.

"Evil demon! Die!"

The martial prowess of holy knights trained through battles with demons was not low even compared to world-class standards.

But no matter how fast they swung their swords, Shirone's neck was never there.

Iruki muttered.

"Quantum superposition. That's dangerous."

Because it was a matter of probability.

While it had the advantage of being able to avoid any attack, if unlucky, he could be hit even by a child's sword strike.

Nade said.

"Don't tell me... that's why he's not moving?"

"No, there's no need to move. If dice rolling is the entirety of the result, then action has no meaning."

He would either avoid attacks with very high probability, or get hit by a sword with very low probability.

"Anyway, let's solve this while Shirone buys us time. Attack the Prejudice of 5 o'clock."

Then Seina approached.

"Wait! If we act rashly and fall to evil temptation again..."

"I won't fall."

Nade said, glaring ahead.

"No matter what lies that woman tells, I will not attack Shirone."

"How can you guarantee that?"

Seina, having experienced the hidden code firsthand, knew how terrifying the workings of the mind could be.

"Because I've already been there—trying to kill Shirone."

"Shirone said it—if I don't struggle, I'll sink. I thought for the first time that I might be able to live a life for myself."

It was the first time he'd shared this story.

"And that's exactly what happened. I achieved my dream and found someone to love. So..."

Blue electricity rose from Nade's body.

"Shirone can do whatever he wants to me. I'll never resent him."

Craaaaaaang!

The electricity gathered in the sky became Thunder God Transcendence and rushed toward the Prejudice of 5 o'clock.

She spread both arms.

"Huhu, bring it on."

Thunder God Transcendence poured out fierce attacks, but the movement of electric charges swerved past her.

'Hidden code.'

He intuited it, but couldn't think of a way to counter it.

"I'll have to step in."

As Iruki walked toward the Prejudice of 5 o'clock, Seina followed and asked.

"What are you planning? That's evil's deception technique."

She seemed to fully understand the nature of evil, if not Sheol itself.

"That's what makes it interesting. Logic that defies the logic of reality. In that case..."

Fire lit in Iruki's eyes as Atomic Bomb streaked through the air in succession.

"I just need to learn it."

Pop pop pop pop pop BANG!

The trajectory of chain explosions passed everywhere except where the Prejudice of 5 o'clock stood.

'This is really absurd.'

The corner of Iruki's smiling mouth trembled.

'Something absolutely impossible by my reasoning is happening. It's like dreaming...'

As he split his mouth wide and concentrated, electricity began sparking from his eyes.

'Over Drive.'

Performance equal to Ex Machina.

The neurons in his brain burst with sparks, analyzing the logic of the hidden code.

'It's not logic trapped in a single dimension.'

Multidimensional equations.

Moreover, this was the transcendent logical system that constituted human dreams.

"Krrrrgh!"

The difficulty was equivalent to completely collapsing all mathematics in reality and creating new mathematics.

'No, it's different from even that.'

There were no immutable truths in multiple dimensions.

'Just a little more...'

Iruki explored at light speed through a massive maze with nearly infinite doors installed.

'Open this door here...'

As the red door opened, sparks flew from a specific part of his cerebral network.

'Turn this way and open this door.'

Amid the feeling of his brain burning, Iruki returned to the beginning for the first time.

'Aha.'

Feelings of injustice were merely luxury.

'Let's try again.'

After thousands of rotations, an image of chaos was faintly drawn.

'The existence of doors means you can return. That's called logic. But multidimensional equations...'

Once you open a door, the door back disappears.

'It's chaos.'

Before he knew it, even Seina had joined the battle, but it wasn't visible to Iruki's eyes.

"Hehehe. Hehehe."

Unaware that blood was streaming from his eyes, nose, and mouth, Iruki burst into laughter.

"This is fun."

Meanwhile, Shirone grew more anxious as time passed.

'This is getting dangerous.'

The number of times he'd avoided attacks through quantum superposition was exceeding 40,000.

'Is Iruki still far off?'

Even without exchanging opinions, the three of them knew what their roles were.

'Breaking the hidden code is impossible.'

But if it was Iruki, he could convert a moment of chaos into the realm of logic.

'Just one moment.'

"Huff!"

Then sacred eyes activated in a holy knight's eyes, and like a contagion, fire lit in everyone's eyes.

"Get out! Get out of me!"

Sloth of 4 o'clock began operating in earnest.

"No! I don't want that! Oh, God. I'm sorry. I..."

Their arms slowly rose, and sharp blades aimed toward their throats.

That's why he stood out.

The holy knight who let his sword hang down while glaring at Iruki with evil eyes.

'He's succumbed to temptation.'

With his sacred eyes extinguished, he bared his fangs, kicked off the ground, and passed by Shirone.

"Iruki!"

"Grrrrrr! Grrrrrr!"

Making boiling sounds, the holy knight heard Sloth of 4 o'clock's hallucination in his ear.

No one can harm you. Help me. Then I'll make Seina choose you.

How could a holy knight not know love?

"Se-Seina."

But demons dig into humans' small wishes and amplify them into enormous desires.

The holy knight raised his sword toward Iruki.

"I am the strongest!"

Shirone cast Miracle Stream, but it was blocked by the hidden code and deflected.

"Iruki! It's dangerous!"

Iruki, who jerked his head up, revealed blood-soaked eyes as he stood.

'Got it.'

There are no logical patterns in chaos.

But if you freeze a specific moment like taking a photograph, that form is definitely mathematical.

'One-time password.'

And if it's mathematical, Iruki could say this:

"Cancellation."

All information reversed, and the hidden code possessed by Sloth of 4 o'clock was destroyed.

"Uaaaah!"

The off-guard Prejudice of 5 o'clock—or rather, Rabika's left arm—was severed by Seina's sword.

'What! Why was it cut!'

Sloth of 4 o'clock's hallucination was heard.

The hidden code was hacked. It's temporary, but there's a hacker with superhuman abilities.

'What nonsense...'

He could see Nade's Thunder God Transcendence surging forward.

"Damn it!"

As Rabika's facial bones twisted again, Shirone cast Stop with the feeling of catching a big fish.

The time of law disappeared, and within 0.666 seconds, two Sheol beings revealed themselves.

The moment their faces came into view.

"Those bastards..."

Shirone, Iruki, and Nade, furious to the tips of their hair, flew in simultaneously.

"Diiiiie!"

Thunder God Transcendence transformed into lightning and surged forward, while an explosion created by the strongest detonation equation occurred.

KWAAAAANG!

As Seina and the holy knights regained their senses from the earth-shaking roar, they looked up at the sky.

"Damn! We missed them!"

Prejudice of 5 o'clock was flying far away with Sloth of 4 o'clock wrapped around her waist.

Nade said.

"No, there's still one shot left."

The holy knights simultaneously turned their heads at the sound of air rupturing from behind.

A giant fist of light was coming over the horizon.

"Hyaaah!"

As Shirone bent his upper body and swung his arm, Hand of God rushed forward at the speed of light.

At that moment, Prejudice of 5 o'clock threw Sloth of 4 o'clock into the flash and dodged.

"You..."

The old man's face turned red.

"Yoooou! How dare you do this to me... Gack!"

Struck hard by Hand of God, the old man's eyes popped out of his face before exploding like fireworks.

"Hmph, if you're useless, you should die."

Mocking Sloth of 4 o'clock falling like scraps of paper, Prejudice of 5 o'clock dissolved into the air.

"Hah, hah."

Shirone, who had watched the scene clearly, stamped his feet as if his anger wasn't fully satisfied.

"We let one escape."

Iruki approached.

"It can't be helped. But we got a taste of them. We're lucky it ended at this level."

Seeing the blood-stained face, Shirone pulled himself together.

"Sorry. I knew it was dangerous, but in that situation, there was no choice."

"What are you talking about?"

Iruki smiled while wiping away blood.

"I finally feel alive for the first time. I really did well to follow you."

Then commotion arose from the holy knights' side.

"Let go! I'm going to die! Let go of this!"

The man who had tried to attack Iruki, who had succumbed to evil, was being held by his comrades.

"Calm down! Anyone could have done the same!"

"No! I... I... Uaaaah!"

Shirone's group watched in silence as the speechless man burst into tears.

"He was really strong. He probably trained his whole life."

"But his heart couldn't match that, it seems. Though it's not something we can blame him for."

How many humans in the world have no gap for even minor desires or evil to enter?

'If there were any, they'd be supremely good.'

Shirone thought he understood why Miro emphasized not physical strength, but depth of spirit.
