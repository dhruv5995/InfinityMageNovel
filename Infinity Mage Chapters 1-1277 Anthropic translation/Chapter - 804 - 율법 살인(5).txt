Lawful Murder (5)

"Where?"

As the steel wire caught on the skeleton's finger swayed, Natasha's speed increased even more.

"There, the right corridor."

Smodo, tucked under Natasha's arm, read Crouch's movements through his clairvoyance.

"He's gone quite far. What's over there?"

"Nothing. He's trying to get as far away as possible. This might actually be dangerous."

Given that they were moving away from Habitz's apartment, it was clear there was some specific intent they didn't know about.

"Turn left here."

Natasha pivoted at a right angle and ran down the long corridor.

"It's a trap."

"Probably. But it's not a trap for us. We have no choice but to check it out."

The place they arrived at was the underground dungeon of the Imperial Palace Marsac, specifically a dead end on the lowest level.

"You came."

Crouch greeted them, holding his severed head in one hand.

"How are you alive with your head cut off?"

Natasha spoke as if amazed, but Smodo realized the gravity of the situation.

"What are you plotting?"

The severed head's eyes snapped open.

"Nothing. I'm just looking for a place to die."

"Is that so?"

Smodo said.

"Capture him. Don't kill him under any circumstances."

Natasha's body vanished like vapor and reappeared, having snatched Crouch's face.

Whoooooosh!

That alone brought a fierce wind through the underground dungeon.

'There's no chance in a head-on confrontation.'

Already knowing Natasha's abilities, Crouch willingly gave up his face.

"How interesting. But how do you kill something like this?"

The moment Natasha lifted the face to eye level, Crouch's lips curved upward.

"Come to think of it, I didn't mention this."

Simultaneously, the headless body rushed forward in one step and stabbed a dagger into Natasha's abdomen.

"I needed a companion for the journey to the afterlife."

The unique aura of the dagger Crouch held strongly pressed against Smodo's clairvoyance.

'That's an Object?' He realized instantly.

"Damn! It's <Lawful Murder>!"

In a room filled with perverted tools, the rough breathing of a man and woman heated the air.

Even while sharing passionate kisses, Alphafisch, Abella, couldn't bring herself to hate Habitz.

'This won't work. At this rate, the mission...'

For her, assassinating Habitz wasn't something driven by desire but rather like homework.

It was her will to return what she had received, since an innocent person had died in her place.

"Uncle, let's begin now."

When she pushed against Habitz's chest, he flopped down on the blood-red bed.

Crawling up Habitz's body, Abella pulled down the chain handcuffs hanging from the barred headboard and fastened them to Habitz's left hand.

Habitz chuckled with amusement, and Abella gently kissed him, setting his heart aflame.

'Now the right hand.'

The iron chains made a scraping sound.

"Krrgh!"

Crouch shuddered at the solid sensation felt through <Lawful Murder>'s handle.

'It's like stabbing rock.'

Though he had clearly aimed for the heart, her muscles gripped the blade as hard as stone.

"You don't die because you're a doll?"

Natasha pulled Crouch's face even closer, as if the blade in her abdomen was of no concern.

"No, if that were all, I could just smash the doll to pieces. You have multiple lives, don't you?"

Though Crouch was stabbing with all his might, the dagger was still pushed out more than halfway.

"You're weak in the end. If you were strong, you would have used the same method as me."

Natasha was also a doll, but she was confident she wouldn't be destroyed.

"How many? It can't be infinite. Will you come back to life even if you die this time? Shall we experiment?"

While asking questions and observing Crouch's eyes, Natasha smiled as if she had realized something.

"This is the last one, isn't it?"

Smodo said.

"Natasha, don't act rashly."

<Lawful Murder>, evaluated as humanity's worst weapon.

'Lawful murder. This isn't a problem to solve here.'

Though this was his first time seeing it with his eyes, considering the terrible history contained in the dagger, he needed to approach it carefully.

"Answer honestly. What are you plotting? What's the intent behind <Lawful Murder>?"

When Crouch remained silent, Natasha's arms expanded.

"Krrrrgh!"

Crouch's head, caught between her hands, made a crushing sound as it crumpled like a balloon.

'The facial bones are steel, but what monstrous strength.'

For Natasha, who was under the domination of an incarnation, physical limitations meant nothing.

"Smodo, what should we do? He doesn't seem to feel pain. Then we can't even torture him."

"No. This is enough."

Smodo made his decision.

"Just stay like this. <Lawful Murder> changes the law. As long as it's embedded in your chest, nothing will happen."

"Ah, is that so?"

Despair filled Crouch's eyes.

"Stay here and hold on. I'll go tell Balkan. If Abella is..."

Dong. Dong. Dong.

The moment Smodo turned around, the sound of bells announcing midnight came from beyond the wall.

"Kehehehe."

Crouch's lips tore in a grotesque grin.

"I won."

Smodo shouted.

"Natasha! Kill him!"

The moment the words fell, all of Natasha's fingers stood up, and Crouch's head shattered as if she were squeezing juice from it.

'Good muscles.'

At the end of his life, Crouch used all his strength to roughly twist the dagger's handle.

'Exceptionally good muscles.'

Because the muscles were hard enough to deflect arrows, the dagger broke with a sharp sound.

'It's not a person who kills.'

Everything went according to Crouch's script.

'It's the situation that kills.'

Crouch's body collapsed with a thud, and only then did Natasha examine her heart area.

"Smodo, the dagger..."

The embedded blade faded like a mirage and dissolved into the air.

"What? What law is this!"

<Lawful Murder>'s effects were well known, but only Minerva knew its detailed functions.

Since shouting at someone already dead wouldn't change anything, Smodo turned and left the underground dungeon.

"I have to tell Balkan!"

Natasha scooped him up like a swallow and sprinted.

"Are the preparations finished?"

Abella's heart ached at Habitz's voice, excited like a mischievous child.

Dong. Dong. Dong.

Then the bell announcing midnight rang.

'It begins.'

As if she had been under a weak hypnosis, the moment she heard the bell, murderous intent boiled up.

"Yes. All preparations are complete."

Having restrained Habitz's limbs, Abella sat up while keeping his waist between her legs.

"Hehe, a woman mounting the emperor. So... what will you do now?"

"You'll know if you wait."

Though Abella's voice was cold, Habitz thought even that was amusing and nodded.

'The bell ringing means...'

Crouch had disappeared somehow.

'<Lawful Murder> is...'

By stabbing Natasha, the target would have changed and the user's murderous intent would have been reset.

'It must be broken.'

The <Lawful Murder> that Crouch had risked his life to destroy would seek the nearest user who hated the target...

"Uncle."

And come into Abella's hands.

"I'm sorry."

Holding <Lawful Murder> in a reverse grip, Abella looked down at Habitz with cold eyes.

Looking up at the dagger held vertically as if it would stab him at any moment, Habitz blinked.

"This isn't the game I had in mind."

Clear murderous intent was planted in Abella's eyes.

"I know you've done many things for me, Uncle. You freed me from the witch's fate, let me open a pretty shop..."

The tip of the dagger trembled.

"But you've killed too many people so far. And in the future too..."

"Shh."

When Abella's shoulders flinched and she looked down, Habitz slowly nodded and said.

"If that's what you think, then that's what you should do."

Abella felt tremendous fear.

'What am I doing right now?'

If being an adult meant walking a tightrope, this felt like that rope had snapped and she was falling toward infinite freedom.

"I'm going to kill you!"

"I know. That's what you want to do."

No.

'It's not what I want to do! Uncle is a bad person, so he has to die...'

What she really wanted to do was...

'I don't know. I don't know what I should do!'

Who was this human called Habitz, and did someone like her really have the right to kill this person...

'Who gives that right!'

If she killed Habitz, what would happen to the world?

'I don't know anything!'

Perfect chaos.

Having deviated from the law for the first time in her life, Abella shuddered at the vast freedom.

"Your Majesty!"

The door burst open with a bang as all four members of Gustav rushed into the room.

Though they had imagined it, everyone was stunned by the sight they couldn't believe even with their own eyes.

"Balkan."

Habitz turned his head.

"Didn't I tell you not to let anyone in? Today is my day with Abella."

"What are you saying? You look like you're about to die."

"Get out."

Habitz looked up at the dagger again.

"If I die, Abella becomes the emperor. Let her do as she wishes. It would be nice if she turned the whole world into a flower garden."

Zetaro's shoulders shook.

"Puhihit! That's hilarious! A flower garden."

Balkan also had no reason to stop his closest friend from wanting to spend his wedding night alone with his wife.

"Understood."

Leaving behind a disappointingly short answer, he turned around and the other three followed.

The door closed.

'What? They actually left? Really?'

"Abella."

Startled, Abella turned her gaze.

"If there's something you want to do, do it comfortably. It's something I've wanted to do for you for a long time."

"Sob..."

Abella's eyes grew hot.

"Why, why are you so good to me? You've killed so many people! So why do you only act like this toward me!"

"Because you're my friend."

The reason was simple.

"Sometimes when you're having too much fun playing with friends, you end up killing and dying."

Something that had been forming Abella until now snapped in her head.

"Sob! Sob!"

Without holding back her falling tears, she arched her back like a bow and raised the dagger.

"Aaaaah!"

With a heart-rending scream, she curled up with all her strength and the lawful murder blade plunged in with a thud.

Habitz didn't even blink.

The dagger that had grazed his ear and embedded in the bed suddenly began to vibrate violently.

"Krgh!"

The moment Abella let go, <Lawful Murder> was destroyed.

'Wh-why?'

Khashan, Aganos.

"Uorin."

When Minerva roughly opened the door with Gando in tow, they saw Uorin holding fragments of a porcelain doll.

"...He couldn't return."

Even Gando didn't clean up for her this time.

"I was thinking of retiring him when only one remained."

"For him, retirement would have been death. Let's think of it as the most splendid retirement ceremony."

Uorin carefully gathered the fragments.

"How are things on the Marsac side?"

Minerva gave a thumbs up.

"We succeeded in target deprivation. It seems Alphafisch properly completed her mission."

"...I see."

Rising from her seat, Uorin's face now held a sense of determination.

"Gando, assemble the <Lawful Murder> team and the Ex Machina team. The real match starts now."

"Understood."

It was the beginning of the Habitz assassination plan.
