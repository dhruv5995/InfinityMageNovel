[652] The Air of Life (1)

"H-how...!"

Austin was a veteran.

Having completed countless requests over thirty years and still being active in the field was proof of that.

Though he hadn't embarked on any particularly grand adventures, the ugly and disgusting aspects of life often hide behind the veil of ordinary existence.

If his life were compiled into a book, ordinary people would dismiss it as either a madman's diary or a pornographic novel, but the events he experienced were undeniably real, and his heart barely reacted to most situations anymore.

For instance, even if a friend of ten years stabbed him with a knife for no reason, he wouldn't hesitate to slit their throat with the dagger hidden in his sleeve.

'Is it a monster?'

When Austin saw hundreds of eyeballs protruding from Shirone's robe, he felt his heart racing for the first time in ages.

His ribs ached, and unfamiliar neural activity scrambled his brain, causing enough dizziness to make him stagger.

"Graaah! What... is this...!"

When the Spear and Death bandits who had been writhing on the ground trembled as they rose to their feet, Shirone realized their abilities were far from ordinary.

'They're moving under Antithesis?'

Though he had divided the power into hundreds of parts before radiating it, any ordinary bandit group should have been unable to move even a finger.

"There! Kill that bastard!"

More spearmen came leaping down from the hillside across the way.

Just from the height of their jumps, it was clear they were Schema masters.

Austin ignited flames in his hands and shouted.

"Be careful! It's the Spear and Death bandit group!"

Composed entirely of spearmen, they were anti-Kazura infiltration spies secretly trained by the Tormia National Intelligence Service, but had become combat elites who transformed into bandits after being abandoned as a ghost unit due to diplomatic issues.

"Block those eyes!"

True to their results-oriented military mindset, they found a solution and desperately overcame the Antithesis to form a human wall.

When the follow-up forces twisted their spears and thrust them through gaps between their comrades, twenty spears crossed like the ribs of a carriage roof and pierced through Shirone.

'Damn, it's over.'

Just as Austin, who had already moved away, thought this, an incredibly fast curtain of light exploded where the spearmen were gathered.

"Aaaahhh!"

The bodies of the spearmen caught in the multiple light explosions twisted uncontrollably, and as Shirone, still pinned in place, lowered his center of gravity, massive wings of light flapped from both shoulders.

"Fire! Pour everything into him!"

Shirone's gaze targeted the Subterranean Ear bandit group floating in the sky.

Equipped with various combat methods utilizing the terrain and features of the Jigger Mountains, the magic bullets they fired from the sky were certainly threatening.

The mountain path was destroyed by the rain of magic bullets, and just as explosions finally covered the entire landscape, Shirone flapped his light wings and soared into the air.

"Fire! Fire! Fire!"

As the leader of Subterranean Ear fired continuously at the approaching Shirone, dozens of magic bullets followed in rapid succession.

When Shirone flapped his light wings forward and stopped, the magic bullets exploded mid-air against the wind pressure that had become as solid as concrete.

"My god...!"

The wind's aftermath shook even the hang gliders unstably, and then dozens of photon cannons shot out like lightning.

Boom! Boom-boom-boom!

With power like iron balls being driven in, the bandits died before even hitting the ground, and it took less than a minute for the sixty-strong force to be completely annihilated.

"What kind of magic is that?"

Austin, who had been staring blankly at the aerial battle raining with flashes, suddenly felt his feet leave the ground.

Then the claws of the Beast Wildcat bandit group, leaping around like animals, flashed before his eyes.

Looking back, he realized Lian was running while holding onto his waist and flailed about.

"Put me down! I need to fight too..."

"Stay still. This isn't at that level."

The movements of the Beast Wildcats, who had made their nest in the treacherous terrain of the Jigger Mountains, were truly animalistic and lethal to mages.

Lian swung his great sword with one hand, and every time the air split with a whoosh, the sound of flesh and bone being severed followed.

"Kill him! Don't let him escape!"

Though the Beast Wildcats leaped in arcs like cats, Lian retreated with movements that defied inertia, taking down the enemies before him one by one.

After retreating a hundred meters, the scene revealed the corpses of the Beast Wildcat bandit group lined up in a row.

The overwhelming difference in ability made all the battles look easy, and Austin was chilled by results that ignored the science of numbers.

'This is just a massacre.'

"Roaaaaar!"

At the deafening battle cry, Austin jerked his head up to see Alpasa, the vice-leader of the Red Blade bandit group, charging while swinging a massive axe.

'This one is different.'

A orthodox style that relied purely on Schema abilities without depending on miscellaneous techniques.

When Lian raised his great sword to block the strike, Alpasa roared again and charged forward like a rhinoceros.

"Everyone, stick close!"

Then ten members pressed against Alpasa's back and pushed forward, causing Lian's arms holding the great sword to bend as his feet dragged across the ground.

"Hrraaaah!"

By the time the charge ended, he had been pushed back a full twenty meters.

'What kind of bastard is this?'

Alpasa looked with wonder at Lian, who was supporting the weight of eleven men without even leaning on any support.

'That's not human strength.'

Though Alpasa had never been outdone in terms of strength, he felt no resistance in acknowledging the difference.

When Austin showed signs of casting magic, Alpasa's gaze targeted him.

"Urgh!"

The eye technique: Pressing.

It was certainly powerful enough for the vice-leader of one of the kingdom's three great bandit groups, and a tense standoff of strength ensued.

"Push! Keep pushing!"

When someone shouted, the members activated the Schema technique of Folding.

By folding their base Schema in half, their muscle strength doubled, and tremendous force came rushing in.

"Graaaah!"

The one in pain was Lian, but the one who was afraid was Austin.

'Damn! How is he holding out?'

What he finally realized was that it might not be about muscle strength.

'Push back.'

As the will of Divine Transcendence dominated Lian's body, his arms began to slowly straighten.

At the sight of Lian pushing back the bodies of eleven men who had activated Folding with just one arm, chills ran down their spines.

'Cut!'

There was a snap as the teeth of the massive axe broke.

And finally, Lian's sword began to slowly descend, splitting the axe blade.

Alpasa screamed in his head.

'This is impossible!'

How could cutting through a blade while weapons were locked together be physically possible?

'No, why is only my axe being cut?'

With equal force, Lian's sword should also be chipped.

As the great sword cut through the axe like slowly slicing paper, Alpasa's mind became hazy.

Facing death, all his senses opened and visions that could never be seen with eyes began to reconstruct through his sixth sense.

'He's not splitting the axe.'

Lian's figure disappeared and an endlessly spread world appeared.

That world was splitting left and right, rushing toward him at tremendous speed.

'The world is being split.'

Divine Transcendence

Absolute Severance.

"...Ma."

By the time the great sword had cut more than halfway through, the world's division reached right before his eyes, and Alpasa shouted in a hoarse voice.

"Don't push, you idiots!"

Mach.

When he saw the giant will split the world in two, Alpasa's body had already been cleaved in half.

With a thud, as the great sword fell to the ground, two more members were additionally split.

Lian, who had dropped Austin, gripped the great sword with both hands and swept diagonally, turning the remaining eight into pieces simultaneously.

"Hoooo."

At the sight of Lian catching his breath, Austin's face went pale.

"W-who exactly are you?"

Even if he had answered "a ghost," Austin would have nodded, but Lian simply slung his great sword over his shoulder and watched as the battle between Shirone and the Red Blade bandit group was drawing to a close.

'It's over.'

The mage Banker lay sprawled faceless, and only the leader Coldpark was still fighting, swinging his sword.

"What kind of mage...!"

How could he dodge Schema sword strikes so fluidly?

With his nervous system enhanced by Armand and Kuzen's metabolic activation added, Coldpark's sword couldn't even graze Shirone's collar.

Though stragglers rushed in to surround him, Shirone had already left his position.

As Shirone spun and retreated, a photon cannon compressed through mana amplification formed in his right hand, creating a sphere of light as large as a human torso.

When he swung his arm toward the bloodless bandit group, a thick flash flew in a curve and crashed into the ground.

BOOOOOOM!

Vibrations traveled through the earth, and where the debris had scattered, no one remained standing.

"Now! Attack!"

The Blood Lord bandit group, who had been watching the battle from the cliff, aimed at Shirone with their seven mages and forty-eight archers.

Arrows twice as heavy as average struck the ground first, and the mages extended their hands toward Shirone flying into the sky.

"W-what is that?"

The magic burning with fire and ice grew weak before even reaching the massive angel of light rising from Shirone's body.

Avatar Technique

Angel's Punishment.

"Fire! Shoot, you idiots!"

Though the Blood Lord leader gave orders, the angel's arm holding a giant spear swung faster.

"Ah..."

Austin saw it clearly.

A single flash that was most vivid before scattering like dust.

BOOOOOOM!

The roar knocked him senseless, and for a while, no thoughts entered his mind.

And when he regained consciousness, he realized that an entire cliff that had been standing before him just moments ago had completely disappeared.

Though some may have escaped, nine out of ten of the over three hundred bandits had become corpses remaining here.

'Am I dreaming?'

Thirty years of experience living purely for survival actually prevented him from accepting this moment as reality.

The Red Blade bandit group was one of the kingdom's three great bandit groups, and the Subterranean Ear, Beast Wildcat, Spear and Death, and Blood Lord bandit groups were all A-class criminal organizations in the capital.

Was it even remotely possible for just two people to annihilate five massive bandit groups?

*Mr. Austin. Have you ever seen an Archmage?*

Estera's voice suddenly came to mind, and it wasn't by chance.

'No, you were wrong.'

The Archmage he had actually confirmed exceeded even her imagination.

'Estera, we made a mistake. There's no way to capture that boy.'

Not unless they offered up their entire guild.

While Austin was having such thoughts, Lian approached Shirone and placed a hand on his shoulder.

"Shirone, are you okay?"

"Yeah. I'm fine."

Shirone looked around at the corpses scattered everywhere.

Though he should be getting used to it by now, the question "Why?" never ceased after each battle.

"Tremendous destructive power. It's different from two thousand times."

Shirone checked where the Angel's Punishment had struck.

Summoning an avatar and throwing a spear of light was far too easy for him.

"They clearly targeted me specifically."

The spearmen had mentioned six billion gold.

"Information about Armand must have spread. If I had known earlier, I could have avoided the battle."

He didn't think about the people they had harmed so far or would harm in the future.

As always, Shirone believed humans had no right to judge other humans.

Having the right and acting out of necessity were completely different concepts.

"I have something to discuss."

As Shirone and Lian turned around, Austin pulled out a slip of paper from his chest and spoke.

"My mission seems to end here."
